1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,213
- Sydney!
- Nadia!

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,513
Come here, come here!

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,540
No!

4
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:09,264
It's Nadia. She's infected.

5
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,287
My daughter's being kept in a coma.

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,662
She's suffering from a condition
that no one understands.

7
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:16,831
It is a condition
that I am responsible for

8
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:18,063
with no hope for a cure.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,850
I've hurt the most precious thing
in my life.

10
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:24,365
Gordon Dean,
Office of Special Investigations.

11
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:28,402
Dean wasn't special investigations.
He went off the grid two years ago.

12
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:30,812
These people killed my fiancé.

13
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:39,576
We lost our only lead on Gordon Dean.

14
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,629
We'll get another lead.

15
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,228
Yeah.

16
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,342
I'm patched in. Go for the hack.

17
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:32,638
Thank you for calling.

18
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:35,200
For the purposes of training,
this call may be monitored.

19
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,175
My name is Roger. How may I help you?

20
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:38,679
Hi, Roger.

21
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,238
I'd like to cancel a subscription,
please.

22
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,175
Certainly. Can I have the name
on the account?

23
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,127
Michael Vaughn.

24
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,437
V-A-U-G-H-N.

25
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,139
Got it.

26
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,701
I see it right here.

27
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,215
May I ask why you're canceling
the subscription?

28
00:03:58,377 --> 00:03:59,377
Mr. Vaughn died.

29
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,977
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of it right away.

30
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:05,876
Yeah.

31
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,001
Okay...

32
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:48,127
When your wife tells you
it's a waste of time to have a pen pal,

33
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:49,128
she's wrong,

34
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:52,246
'cause two days ago, there was a theft
in an R&D facility in Istanbul.

35
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,126
The Turks have done a pretty good job
of keeping it under wraps.

36
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,154
But my friend Ali

37
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,827
forwarded me this.

38
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:01,696
Now take a look right there.
You see that, those vials?

39
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,747
Right there, that's a nerve agent
called Substance 33.

40
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,179
It was developed by the Russians
during the Cold War.

41
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,992
Remarkable stuff, you know, in an

42
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,180
"end-of-civilization"

43
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,471
sort of way.

44
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,508
What makes you think
they worked with Dean?

45
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,071
Well, they don't. As far as we can tell,
they're independent.

46
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,072
- Gordon Dean, he's a...
- Former C.I.A.

47
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,998
Disappeared two years ago.
Infiltrated this office.

48
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,660
Compromised one of your men.

49
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:26,965
I'm up to speed, thanks.

50
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,688
Sorry...

51
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,112
new guy.

52
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,480
I just assumed that maybe...

53
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
Anyway...

54
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:39,981
this woman right here,
that's who I think works for Dean.

55
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,619
"You think"? Based on what?
Your pen pal?

56
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,921
Who, Ali? No. See,

57
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,843
this woman had help...

58
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:48,632
a hacker who remotely accessed

59
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,731
the security system
using the same computer

60
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:52,604
as a hack on the N.S.A.
a few months back,

61
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,305
which we know was ordered by Dean.

62
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,876
So 2 hours ago I traced

63
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:57,707
this computer

64
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,506
to Prague within these 5 square miles.

65
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,504
But, you see, if I can go to Prague,

66
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:04,729
I can narrow it down to, like,
2 feet, and then we can

67
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,808
grab this hacker and get him
to tell us where the Substance 33 is.

68
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,343
But if we do that, we lose Dean.

69
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:13,057
Once he realizes his hacker is missing,
he'll disappear as well.

70
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:14,231
Right.

71
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,243
Okay. I want you both
to accompany Marshall to Prague.

72
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,732
Follow the signal.
Locate Dean's operation there.

73
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,721
But don't do anything to reveal yourself
or to engage his men.

74
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:25,222
Once you've done that,
we'll reassess our options.

75
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:26,998
Shouldn't Dixon be going with me?

76
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,721
I've tasked Dixon to another assignment.

77
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,347
Marshall will brief you on your op tech.

78
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,298
Let me know when you're ready to leave.

79
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,211
Dad,

80
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,832
you're making a mistake.

81
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,917
Sydney, I understand you'd be
more comfortable taking Dixon with you,

82
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,157
but that was inappropriate.

83
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,053
This is not the time
to break in a new agent.

84
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:51,847
Agent Grace has extensive
field experience.

85
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,470
And I have a history with Dixon.

86
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,930
What is so important, dad, that he can't
come with me on this mission?

87
00:06:58,681 --> 00:06:59,681
Your sister.

88
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,232
What about my sister?

89
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,856
You know that Sloane
has been searching for a cure for Nadia.

90
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:11,844
He may have found one.

91
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:17,644
"Conditional release of Arvin Sloane"?

92
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:19,906
Sloane cultivated a lead

93
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,388
who will only meet with him
face-to-face in Russia.

94
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:24,562
I was able to convince
the Attorney General

95
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,489
to let him out of prison for 72 hours.

96
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,713
I'm sending Dixon as a security detail.

97
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,014
When was I going to find out about this?

98
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,589
I didn't want to raise your hopes
until we knew what Sloane had.

99
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,449
Well, in that case, I'd prefer to go
with Marshall by myself.

100
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,693
- Sydney...
- It's not that complicated a mission.

101
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,627
In fact, it's very complicated...

102
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,889
recovering the nerve agent
without tipping Dean...

103
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:54,803
What aren't you telling me?

104
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:57,516
I read his file.

105
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:01,139
Agent Grace's?

106
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,204
You had no authority to do that.

107
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:04,375
In the last 3 years,

108
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:07,018
he has turned downhalf
a dozen team assignments,

109
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,444
instead taking long-cover operations
by himself.

110
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,757
He's a loner.

111
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:16,508
He's a superior agent,
and he's agreed to be on this team,

112
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:19,281
which is good enough for me.

113
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:22,943
Sorry.

114
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:26,194
Didn't mean to... it's just
that you said to let you know when...

115
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,751
- We're ready to go.
- Yeah.

119
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:02,887
Tell me about your contact
Alexander Dolzhenko.

120
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:06,048
Dolzhenko was an undersecretary
in the Politburo.

121
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:09,501
I had been working with him
for the past decade.

122
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,538
Trustworthy?

123
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:12,598
Reliable.

124
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
Why is he insisting on meeting with you
in person?

125
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:18,476
For his protection.

126
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,684
After the Sovogda incident,

127
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,400
we believe that the Russians
killed all the infected.

128
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:26,287
But according to Dolzhenko,

129
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:29,488
they've kept some of them alive,
and they're pursuing treatment.

130
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,190
Of course, the Russians deny
that Sovogda ever occurred.

131
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,040
So by passing the cure to me,

132
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,214
Dolzhenko is risking his life.

133
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,515
Suppose Dolzhenko
has been found out by the authorities.

134
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,155
This could be his way of cutting a deal.

135
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:48,715
And you're suggesting
that I might be walking into a trap?

136
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,416
No.

137
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,841
No. About the Sovogda incident,
the Russians

138
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,091
have no idea that I'm responsible.

139
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,878
Then why has he agreed
to meet with you at all?

140
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:02,092
$300,000.

141
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:07,183
My job is to make sure,
in three days' time,

142
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:09,015
you return to this cell.

143
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,053
I intend to do exactly that.

144
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,540
When we're in the field,

145
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:19,116
you'll follow my instructions
explicitly, no questions.

146
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:21,717
It's my show.

147
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,342
Great.

148
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,840
Sure you're reading that right?

149
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:49,341
Yeah, seems like an unlikely place
to hide an operation.

150
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,423
It's definitely him.

151
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,530
I mean, the signal I'm getting
is weak but clean.

152
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,716
And the hacker's
right inside that building.

153
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:55,967
- Wi-Fi hot spot?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,904
Must be using a laptop off-site.

155
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:02,716
Know what? That's okay. I got an idea.

156
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:07,654
Okay.

157
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,032
Okay.

158
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,454
Got it. Here's what we do.

159
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,204
Pack of mints, right?

160
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,028
Microprocessor
on the bottom of the case. It's a relay.

161
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,217
Get it within 5 feet
of the hacker's computer.

162
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:23,027
It should allow me
to clone the hard drive,

163
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,841
might even tell us
where the nerve agent is.

164
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:25,900
Even better...

165
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:28,592
offer him a mint.

166
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,650
Inside each one is a tracking device.

167
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,751
Don't worry. He won't die
or anything if he swallows it.

168
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,025
Just get a little sick, a little nausea.

169
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,876
If Gordon Dean has an operation here,

170
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:41,462
chances are the hacker
will lead us right to it.

171
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:42,463
Got it.

172
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,197
What's that?

173
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:52,884
That was Czech.

174
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,910
I'll fake it.
It's all sort of Germanish, right?

175
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,262
Go for it.

176
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:21,535
- Okay, who am I looking for?
- A far window, back to the wall.

177
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,713
- Baseball cap on backwards.
- Got it.

178
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,337
You are American?

179
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,713
Great, Syd, that's perfect.
I'm starting the clone now.

180
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,321
Nice.

181
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,756
Hold on a second. Wait a minute.

182
00:12:57,784 --> 00:12:58,807
What is it?

183
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:01,286
Well, I'm not the only one
accessing this computer. Syd...

184
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,741
Does your guy
have two laptops networked together?

185
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,168
- No.
- No?

186
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,203
Syd, listen, we have a problem.

187
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,475
Someone beside me
is piggybacking off this computer.

188
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,285
They're trying to steal the bandwidth,

189
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:19,763
which means
the hacker doesn't have a laptop at all

190
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,349
maybe a PDA or a cell phone.

191
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:24,287
Great, the signal just went dead.

192
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:27,888
I got her. Blond hair, brown jacket.
She just left. She's coming your way.

193
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,037
There she is.

194
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,189
You're going to want a seat belt.

195
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,001
- What are you doing?
- Following her.

196
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Watch out!

197
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:55,413
Sorry!

198
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:04,836
She made us. Hold on.

199
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,914
Hi there.

200
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:05,602
Hey, did you get anything
from her cell phone?

201
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,703
No. The simm card
is completely shattered.

202
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,901
She says the phone broke
when you hit her car.

203
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,913
Well, more likely
it was a countermeasure.

204
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:15,601
She smashed it when she realized
you were chasing her.

205
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,476
And if her people realize she's gone,

206
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,898
if there's some protocol
to check in that she misses,

207
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:21,902
they'll disappear as well.

208
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,653
Maybe under the circumstance,
you'd have done something different.

209
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:32,353
Okay.

210
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:35,913
You talked to your father, right, Syd?

211
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,264
I mean, what's he want us to do?

212
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,042
I'm going to talk to her again,

213
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:43,543
see if I can get her to give up
Substance 33 while there's still time.

214
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,155
Can you rig a voice stress analyzer?

215
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:49,614
Yeah, sure. Just give me ten minutes.

216
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:07,978
Dolzhenko is typically
a few minutes late.

217
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,292
Half an hour is more than a few minutes.

218
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,254
- Here we go.
- Alexander.

219
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:17,403
You deviated from my instructions.
I told you to come alone.

220
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:20,018
He's backup.
He's only here for my safety.

221
00:16:20,543 --> 00:16:21,593
Do we have the money?

222
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,350
It's all here, Alexander. $300,000.

223
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,800
Our last job, where we parted company...

224
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:37,360
be there by 8, alone this time.

225
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:39,829
I can't do that, Alexander.

226
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,892
Then our deal's off,
and you lose your daughter's cure.

227
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,667
Marcus...

228
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,291
No.

229
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:52,133
If you're concerned
that this is a trick,

230
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:54,500
an escape... You have my daughter.

231
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,066
She's all the insurance you need.

232
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,353
Could be a trap.
Russian police could be waiting for you.

233
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,554
It doesn't matter to me.
I have to see this through.

234
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,880
What if it were your daughter, Marcus?

235
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,330
Call me when you're ready
to be picked up.

236
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:34,556
Three days ago,
you hacked into a security system

237
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,892
and facilitated the theft
of a chemical weapon, Substance 33.

238
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,620
I want to contact the American embassy.

239
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,541
I'm a U.S. Citizen. I have rights.

240
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,592
You committed an act of terrorism.
You forfeited your rights.

241
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,905
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

242
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,100
Hey. Rachel Gibson,

243
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,192
traveling on a student visa
issued two weeks ago.

244
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,545
So what are you studying?

245
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,900
Architecture. The gothic influence.

246
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,632
- Well, that's fascinating.
- It is.

247
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:15,355
What are you do... get off!
Let go of me now! Don't... let go!

248
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,463
What is this?

249
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:18,595
Whoever you people are,
you're making a big mistake.

250
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:19,599
Can I see that?

251
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,542
Pretty soon, there will be
a ton of U.S. agents

252
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,999
swarming this place looking for me.

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,240
- U.S. agents?
- That's right.

254
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,354
It's an E.L.T., Emergency Location Transmitter.

255
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,041
She was trying to send
a distress signal.

256
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,200
Do we need to worry?

257
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:32,407
Well, looks like it's still intact.
The signal didn't go out.

258
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:35,918
You're scared?

259
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,918
You should be.
No one's coming to rescue you.

260
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,192
I'm an operative
for the U.S. Government.

261
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,150
So unless you want to start a war
with the C.I.A., I would suggest...

262
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,500
Here's your next problem, Rachel.
We're C.I.A.

263
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, then this must be
some big misunderstanding.

264
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,344
If you're C.I.A.,
we're on the same side.

265
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:05,532
Call Langley. Verify her story.

266
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,232
- All right.
- You can't.

267
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:12,000
We're off-book. Black ops.
Langley won't verify us.

268
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,906
- That's convenient.
- Well, that's the truth.

269
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,944
- I've had enough.
- Syd?

270
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,245
The stress analysis indicates
she's telling the truth.

271
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,232
That may be,
but the more likely scenario

272
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,633
is that she's practicing a form of
self-hypnosis

273
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,533
to convince herself
that what she's saying is true.

274
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,743
I triple-checked my readings

275
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:38,559
and filtered them against
every known method of duping.

276
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,595
She believes what she's saying.

277
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:46,609
What?

278
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,571
Marshall, you and my father
said the same thing,

279
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,193
that Rachel believes what she's saying.

280
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,044
She believes she works for the C.I.A.

281
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:55,807
Yeah. I think so. That's right.

282
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,172
I need to talk to her.

283
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:07,196
I want to tell you a story.
Just stop me if I get something wrong.

284
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:10,768
You were approached in college,
someplace public,

285
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,421
in the quad or walking to class.

286
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,546
A man asked you
if you wanted to serve your country.

287
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,320
When he told you it was for the C.I.A.,
you just... you couldn't believe it.

288
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:22,772
But you took the tests,
and they were easy for you.

289
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,733
It made you feel good about yourself.

290
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,300
You probably started work
at a false front,

291
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:32,372
some phantom company
that had you doing entry-level analysis.

292
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:39,272
Maybe you wondered why
you were never sent to Langley.

293
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,406
Maybe you wondered why

294
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,772
you weren't being trained
with other recruits.

295
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:45,607
Then you got promoted.

296
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,882
You met the director of your division,
Gordon Dean.

297
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:51,483
He offered you a position on his team.

298
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:55,747
Dean took you under his wing.
He convinced you that

299
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:59,345
you were so important,
you just had to be out there

300
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,007
helping him save the world.

301
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:03,948
How am I doing?

302
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:09,061
- You read my file.
- No, I didn't.

303
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,254
13 years ago,
the same thing happened to me,

304
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,186
only I had been lied to.

305
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:19,861
What I was told was the C.I.A. was,
in reality, a criminal organization.

306
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,972
I think you've been told the same lie.

307
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,883
I know you don't believe me, Rachel.

308
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,734
You think this is another
interrogation tactic. It's not.

309
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:31,535
I think I can prove it.

310
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:36,587
You can prove it,
that I work for a criminal organization?

311
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,396
Your transmitter,
where does the signal get received?

312
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,711
C.I.A. headquarters. Langley.

313
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
You're sure of that?

314
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:47,684
I designed it myself.

315
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,321
I'd like you to build a trace program,

316
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:53,172
one that piggybacks onto the signal
your watch sends out.

317
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,209
If I'm right, it won't go to Langley.

318
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:10,887
Okay. It's ready.

319
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:12,762
Let's do it.

320
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,386
Okay.
I'm going to send out a test signal.

321
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:19,886
Whoever receives this will just assume
you're checking the system, okay?

322
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:21,019
Here we go.

323
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,337
And... testing...

324
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:35,289
Yep.

325
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,648
Went to Langley.

326
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,662
Wait a minute. No, it isn't.

327
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:49,385
That ping was just a ghost signal.
It was meant to throw us off.

328
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,036
It's not going to Langley at all.

329
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:53,986
- Where'd it go?
- Prague, Vlasska street.

330
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,760
What's on Vlasska street?

331
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,387
Our office.

332
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:09,275
It's temporary so that Dean can oversee
the transfer of Substance 33.

333
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,251
Wait. Gordon Dean is in Prague?

334
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:14,761
Yeah.

335
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:18,776
He's right around the corner.

336
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:41,588
- How's she doing?
- About how you'd expect.

337
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:46,086
She was told Substance 33
was developed by a terrorist cell

338
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:49,364
and was being transferred
to U.N. weapons inspectors.

339
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:51,750
Most likely,
it's being sold to the highest bidder.

340
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:53,699
Does she know when
the exchange is to be made?

341
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,575
Tonight, but she doesn't know where.
She said it's all classified,

342
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:59,825
and all classified intel is stored
on Dean's own dedicated server.

343
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:02,264
What else? How much does she know
about his operation?

344
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,515
Dean calls it "The Shed."

345
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,538
She was recruited two years ago,
computer specialist.

346
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,613
She's willing to give us everything,

347
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,900
mission history, suppliers,
contacts, the works.

348
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,637
Without more background,
it's too risky to move on Dean.

349
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,200
He could destroy his data
before we have time to secure it.

350
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,001
Marshall, can we access that server?

351
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,263
Well, according to Rachel,

352
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:23,614
Dean uses an encryption key
that changes daily.

353
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,261
But if I could get inside,
I could crack the key,

354
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,112
maybe download the entire hard drive.

355
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,802
Obviously, that's too dangerous.

356
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:32,952
What about the girl?

357
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,338
She's not a field agent.

358
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,500
And her whole world
is coming apart right now.

359
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:41,239
I don't see another option.

360
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:44,637
We have to recover Substance 33
before it trades hands.

361
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,077
What is it?

362
00:24:58,202 --> 00:24:59,202
We need some help.

363
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,616
All you have to do

364
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:05,249
is copy the encryption key and then
bring it back to me, okay?

365
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:08,179
Shouldn't take me more
than a couple minutes to crack the code.

366
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,606
Then go back inside, all right?

367
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,990
You think maybe you can open
a remote access port to Dean's server?

368
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:14,567
Yeah, from my workstation.

369
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:17,013
Dean's server has about
a terabyte of data.

370
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:19,743
That's going to take you, what,
an hour at 20 gigs a minute?

371
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,702
Don't worry. I can hop R.A.M.
while the data's being transferred.

372
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,388
Unless they know where to look,
it can't be detected.

373
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,015
The encryption key is pretty massive.

374
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:29,515
I don't think I have
anything big enough to copy it to.

375
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:31,616
That's okay.
Got a little present for you.

376
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,014
Okay?
Just a little something I picked up.

377
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:35,965
Looks like a normal credit card, right?

378
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:41,563
But you look closely,
actually holds 240 gigs of memory.

379
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,489
It's a working credit card.

380
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,879
Just don't go shopping with it,
because it's already at its limit.

381
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:50,479
My wife...
crazy with the clothes, Mitchell.

382
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:51,929
- It's clever.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,253
I wanna tell you
that I've been admiring you, too.

384
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,000
Not, you know, anything kind of creepy,
weird. Just totally professionally.

385
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:06,439
I mean, your hack on the N.S.A., genius.

386
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:09,878
Too bad it was being used for evil,
though been there myself.

387
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:13,767
Thanks.

388
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:16,538
Hey, listen,

389
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,355
you're gonna be okay.

390
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,654
All right? I have been through stuff
way scarier.

391
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,327
I'm still here.

392
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,840
- Alexander.
- Old friend.

393
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:58,000
So I did as you asked.
It's just you and me.

394
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,966
I'm sorry for my precautions.

395
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:02,781
- I'm sure you understand.
- Of course.

396
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,831
I'm eager to get this over with as well.

397
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,607
- You can count it.
- No, please.

398
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:11,493
We're friends. I trust you.

399
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:19,756
So you have the cure.

400
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,800
As I told you, it's still experimental,
but, uh, yes.

401
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,944
So far,
the patients have made a full recovery.

402
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,017
Good.

403
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,741
Come. It's right here.

404
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:57,957
Alexander, please.

405
00:27:58,457 --> 00:27:59,957
Oh, begging will not help you.

406
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,282
Whoever wants me dead...

407
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,095
let me reason with them. I'll pay them.

408
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:12,331
"Whoever".

409
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:17,407
But, Arvin, it's me who wants you dead.

410
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,580
Sasha, why are you doing this?

411
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:26,744
I've never done anything to you.

412
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, yes. Yes, you have.

413
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:35,205
I had a daughter in Sovogda myself.

414
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:39,069
Because what you released,

415
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,844
I didn't even have a chance
to bury my own child.

416
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,146
I lied to you.

417
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,743
Besides your daughter,
there are no other survivors.

418
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,200
No experiments, no cure.

419
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:55,769
Yeah!

420
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,869
It's worse than dying, isn't it?

421
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:03,795
Knowing there's nothing you can do
to save your own child.

422
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:06,832
Turn around.

423
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,557
No.

424
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:09,558
- Turn around!
- No.

425
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:14,785
If you're going to shoot me,
I'm not going to make it easy for you.

426
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:17,823
I know your pain, Sasha.

427
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:21,061
Killing me won't heal it.

428
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:23,622
You're not a killer.

429
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:27,736
Don't become one now.
Don't make this your daughter's legacy.

430
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,874
I'll be able to hear anything you say,
even if it's barely a whisper.

431
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,944
If anything goes wrong,
if you even sense

432
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:04,225
that you are in jeopardy,

433
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:07,348
we'll pull you out.
We'll call off the mission.

434
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,371
- Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:12,222
That's the easy part. The hard part:

436
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,636
you have to walk back into that office
and look everyone in the eye,

437
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:19,900
your co-workers, Gordon Dean.

438
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,599
You can't let them see
that you know the truth.

439
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,871
When you've copied the encryption key,
let me know.

440
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,022
We'll brush pass in the lobby
like we said.

441
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,416
Okay.

442
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,006
How many of them know?

443
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,853
How many of them are in on it?

444
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:42,504
It's impossible to say.

445
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,552
In my case, it was half a dozen
out of 50 agents.

446
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,755
You ever seen this man?

447
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:05,150
Yeah, Dean said
he was a C.I.A. agent who turned,

448
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:08,300
that he's in custody outside Los Alamos.

449
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,916
That was a lie, too.

450
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:21,454
His name is Michael Vaughn.

451
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,200
He was a U.S. agent.

452
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,203
But he was a good man.

453
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:37,660
Rachel, look at me.
The reason I'm telling you this

454
00:31:37,668 --> 00:31:39,853
is because right now,
you are our best chance

455
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,104
at seeing Gordon Dean
pay for what he's done.

456
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:44,700
He used you, Rachel.

457
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,367
He used you to murder U.S. agents.

458
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:55,981
I believe in you.

459
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,000
- Hey.
- Peyton, hey.

460
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,582
I thought you weren't due in
till tonight.

461
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,100
Yeah, I have some reports to clean up.

462
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,500
- You okay?
- Rough weekend.

463
00:32:57,918 --> 00:33:00,868
Well, if you wanna take a nap
on the couch, I can hide you.

464
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,445
Thanks. I'm good, though.
I'm gonna get to work.

465
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:04,917
Okay.

466
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,749
Oh, don't let Dean see you,

467
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,266
or he'll make you translate
surveillance footage.

468
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,292
Yeah, you're right.

469
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:27,418
Rachel.

470
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,531
How long has it been?

471
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,769
Since the last time you asked,
30 seconds.

472
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:01,818
Look, she's been in there ten minutes.

473
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,793
I'm sure she's fine.

474
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:11,668
Rachel.

475
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:13,357
Hey.

476
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,970
Don't know whether
I should thank you or curse you.

477
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,471
The book you recommended

478
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,668
"Devil In The White City." I'm addicted.

479
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,244
Truly. I was up all night reading.

480
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,270
I never would have thought I'd be so,
uh, fascinated by a serial killer.

481
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,000
Somehow I find myself even sympathetic.

482
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,169
Yeah, I guess.

483
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
So listen,

484
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:39,640
intel suggests that Iran

485
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:41,950
is trying to buy
nuclear core from the French.

486
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:43,584
But we'll be in Paris next week.

487
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,756
I need a prep report
by the end of the day.

488
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,768
Okay. I'll get right on it.

489
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:50,483
Thank you.

490
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:04,793
I've got it. I'm on my way down.

491
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,106
Great. I'm coming to meet you.

492
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,857
We'll brush pass just outside the door
to the building.

493
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:12,100
Hey, hold the elevator.
You going for coffee?

494
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:16,018
Yeah. Last time I'm going to see the sun
for a few hours.

495
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,033
Perfect. I'm dying for a smoke.

496
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:21,732
Rachel, listen to me.
We can still do this.

497
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,683
We'll do the pass right under her nose.

498
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:26,557
Just follow my instructions.
I'll talk you through it.

499
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:32,982
- What are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

500
00:35:32,983 --> 00:35:34,483
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

501
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:38,196
If Gordon Dean can recognize you
on sight, so can any of his agents.

502
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,659
How do you say
"you're welcome" in Czech?

503
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:45,146
- I thought you quit.
- I did...

504
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:47,419
in the U.S.

505
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:50,083
But here, everybody smokes.
It's a social necessity.

506
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,698
Rachel, have the credit card ready
in your left hand.

507
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:02,472
I'm ten seconds away.

508
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,270
Palm the credit card down
by your side. Don't look at me.

509
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,650
See? Social necessity.

510
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,340
If I didn't smoke,
that never would have happened.

511
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:31,400
But I suppose
he's not your type anyway, is he?

512
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:33,736
No.

513
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,186
Remind me to ask her
what that means, "not her type".

514
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:48,483
- How's it going?
- Um, good.

515
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:50,955
What kind of idiots
don't double-encrypt their firewalls?

516
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:53,574
I could do this stuff in my sleep. Okay.

517
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,411
We're in. Let Rachel know.

518
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,048
Rachel, Marshall's decoded the key.

519
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:01,311
You can open the access ports now.

520
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,398
That's what I love about our friendship,
no competition.

521
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:07,237
Yeah.

522
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:10,849
You sure you're okay?

523
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:15,200
Of course.
It's nothin a little caffeine won't fix.

524
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:19,174
Okay.

525
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,049
Got it. She's in.

526
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:36,962
Rachel. Good job. We're in.
This shouldn't take too long.

527
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:50,798
Peyton.

528
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:52,549
What is it?

529
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:55,735
I think we may have a problem.

530
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:02,000
- What kind of problem?
- Rachel Gibson.

531
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,550
I don't know.

532
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:20,663
She hasn't done anything unusual
from her terminal.

533
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:33,799
She's brilliant.

534
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:36,363
What?

535
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
She's hopping R.A.M.

536
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:40,962
She's trying to stay undetected.

537
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,078
She's copying everything on my server.

538
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,081
One sec here.

539
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:53,269
Substance 33.

540
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:58,104
Shipping tonight, Budapest.
Shipping container 1147.

541
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:00,294
Great. I'll let Mr. Bristow know.

542
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,644
She's compromised everything.

543
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:05,206
I can eliminate her. She trusts me.

544
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,457
No, it's too late for that.
Execute plan "B."

545
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:10,330
Are you sure that's necessary?

546
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,131
Just do it quickly.
I'll meet you in the parking garage.

547
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,200
Okay, I spoke to director Bristow.

548
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:38,268
He contacted the Hungarian authorities.

549
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:41,469
Once again, these bad guys
picked the wrong people to mess with.

550
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:44,955
Huh, what's that?

551
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,142
What?

552
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:47,528
There's some RF interference.

553
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:49,106
I should be able to compensate for it.

554
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:58,881
Contact rachel. See how she's doing.

555
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,531
Rachel, it's me. Do you copy?

556
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:03,705
Rachel?

557
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:06,234
Rachel, if you can't talk, cough.

558
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:07,466
Oh, hell, the server's down.

559
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,143
- Rachel, listen to me...
- It's no use.

560
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,644
They set off an E.M.P.
They fried the electronics.

561
00:40:35,877 --> 00:40:36,877
Are you there?

562
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,749
Can anybody hear me?

563
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:17,438
Syd, Syd, no.

564
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:01,501
She's okay.

565
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:04,127
She's gonna be okay.

566
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,328
