1
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,885
DSR team is supposed to be here. Contact A.P.O.

2
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,476
We've got Mr. Bristow on sat-comm.

3
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,770
Jack, what's your situation?

4
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,106
We're at the rendezvous point. Still waiting on the DSR team.

5
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,066
We'll give them five more minutes, then move on.

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,776
Have we made any progress with the russians?

7
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
No, director Chase is in Washington.

8
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,238
They've organized a coalition to pressure the russians

9
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,073
to call off the air strike, but so far, no luck.

10
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,410
They do understand that destroying the device with conventional explosives

11
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,990
will cause enough toxic fallout to make Chernobyl look like a kitchen fire?

12
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,910
Yeah, their official position is they're not buying it,

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,710
which gives you about two hours to deactivate the device.

14
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,506
Dad, we got a signal from the DSR team's transponder.

15
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,882
They're a block and a half away.

16
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,050
We'll be in touch.

17
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,262
The russians rely on the Milsat satellite network to vector the bombs, right?

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,181
If I can hack into it, I can shut it down.

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,266
And violate several thousand international laws?

20
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,644
We're talking about the end of the world. I'm not worried about a tribunal.

21
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,813
That's a good point. Go, go, go, go.

22
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,199
- It's operational.
- Have you notified our cells?

23
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,284
- We're on schedule.
- Good.

24
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,417
It won't be long before you see her again.

25
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,464
I know Nadia. She's gonna make us proud.

26
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,274
The signal's coming from right here.

27
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203
We should keep moving.

28
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,668
Show yourself!

29
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,313
Brodien.

30
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,398
Bristow?

31
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,942
Oh, for god's sakes.

32
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,028
What are you --

33
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,655
I thought you were relieved of duty.

34
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,782
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

35
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,992
What happened here?

36
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,037
Uh, let's just say those tranqs --

37
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,997
they're not gonna do you any good.

38
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,916
Not on the infected.

39
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,587
They're like rabid dogs.

40
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,130
They travel in packs.

41
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,508
It only took one night to wipe out my entire team.

42
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,176
You're the last one alive?

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,677
Yeah. That's right.

44
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,432
I don't know how many are out there -- hundreds could be thousands.

45
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,725
What about the rest? Where are they?

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,352
Dead, if we're lucky.

47
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,523
When there's no one left to kill, they turn on each other.

48
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,233
The municipal water supply was tainted.

49
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,278
And the device is broadcasting a subaudible frequency off any spectrum.

50
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,030
Anyone within the radius of the signal

51
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,824
who drank the water has been physiologically altered.

52
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,451
Are we gonna just shoot them?

53
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,285
Yes.

54
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,079
I mean, it's either them or us.

55
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,499
They're already gone anyway. We're putting them out of their misery.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:51,959
There is no cure.

57
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,337
Once you're infected, there's no reversing the symptoms.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,839
What have you learned about the device?

59
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,631
Uh...

60
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,718
best we can tell,

61
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,013
the epicenter is, uh,

62
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,183
4 miles northwest over the Oransky building -- right here.

63
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,020
In that case, the control center for the device should be located on the rooftop.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,107
I've taken out the city's power grid. The device keeps running.

65
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,567
Irina knows how to bring it down safely.

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,862
Irina?

67
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,739
Irina Derevko?

68
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,910
The device has been modified to run off an internal energy source.

69
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,663
We need to get to the roof of that building.

70
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,876
Okay, uh, right, but we can't drive.

71
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,711
All the roads are closed off with gridlock.

72
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,296
We can get through town through the subway tunnels.

73
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,965
It's a straight shot to the Oransky building.

74
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,468
There should be an emergency battery system to power up the cars.

75
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,345
Those tunnels are pitch black.

76
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,930
There's only one way in or out.

77
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,975
I'm not saying I'm looking forward to it.

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,437
All right. Let's go.

79
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,485
They're here.

80
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,491
Less than two hours before the russians launch their strike.

81
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,118
Nothing can stop us.

82
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,288
Regardless, we should eliminate all possibility.

83
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,124
I'll lead the assault team.

84
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,877
Nadia.

85
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,463
What about Nadia?

86
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,923
Bring her back.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,884
Give her the option to join us.

88
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,969
I was going to.

89
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,264
Let's go.

90
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:35,729
Damn it.

91
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,857
It's too secure. I can't get in from the outside.

92
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,943
Unless we have a valid access code, this isn't gonna work.

93
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,027
So get an access code.

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,697
Only russian military officials have access codes to those. Hence the word access.

95
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,242
We've managed harder. Come on. There's got to be a way.

96
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,619
What would Jack do in this situation?

97
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,538
Jack is the king of this sort of thing.

98
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,373
Well, first he'd probably glower a bit, right?

99
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,919
And then he'd probably blackmail or torture somebody. Right?

100
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,089
You're  a genius.

101
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,633
You, Eric Weiss, are a genius.

102
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,264
I thought Sloane turned the Blackwell Index over to Langley.

103
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,723
He didn't. It's complicated.

104
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,100
Not really. Sloane's evil --

105
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,811
why wouldn't he hold on to blackmail material on world leaders?

106
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,022
Okay, here it is. Russian deputy defense minister Karkov.

107
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,526
We find the right dirt, he'll be begging to give us the code.

108
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,069
I think we found your passion.

109
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,321
- What's this guy into?
- Let's take a look.

110
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,034
-  Ooh. Is that A...
- Whoa, hello.

111
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:33,286
- I hope not.
- Wow.

112
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,957
Jack, we found a russian minister off the Blackwell Index

113
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,960
who can get us access to the Milsat. We'll ke you posted.

114
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,088
Copy that. Marshall and Weiss are working on the russians.

115
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,882
Stubborn bunch, your countrymen.

116
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,466
We like to control our own fate.

117
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,595
You never put much faith in that, did you? Fate. Destiny.

118
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,974
About as much faith as I put in horoscopes, fortune cookies.

119
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,060
Look.

120
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,648
Rambaldi wrote,

121
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,986
"when bloodred horses run to the streets and angels from the sky,

122
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,281
the chosen one and the passenger will clash."

123
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,702
"And only one of them will survive."

124
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,874
You really are through the looking glass, aren't you?

125
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,671
When I see angels fall from the sky, I'll start to worry.

126
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,052
I just can't shake the feeling that tonight, one of my daughters will perish.

127
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:35,933
This is it.

128
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,024
Hey, Brodien, it looks like that ear healed up pretty nicely.

129
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,192
Yeah.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,403
And if you plan on putting any more holes in me,

131
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,989
just go ahead and tell me now. All right?

132
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,011
Brodien?

133
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,514
Hang in there.

134
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,520
Go.

135
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,689
End this.

136
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,827
We should move.

137
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:39,830
Now!

138
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,757
We found the switching room.

139
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,675
We'll set green lights all the way down the line.

140
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,472
It should only take me a few minutes to redirect the power to the drive wheels.

141
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,807
How are we on the brakes?

142
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,058
The calipers have seized.

143
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,018
Must have happened when the power shut down.

144
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,390
But if we cut the hydraulic lines and bleed the fluid,

145
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,680
they should disengage, but we'll have no manual stopping power.

146
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,060
We can set the track switch at the Oransky station to trigger an emergency stop.

147
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,487
Right. Be careful out there.

148
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,536
You shouldn't wait.

149
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,454
For what?

150
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,039
I saw the ring.

151
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,544
Yeah, you know what? You killed my father.

152
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,046
The way I see it, I don't have to ask for your blessings.

153
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,465
Despite that, you may have them.

154
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,717
Along with some advice.

155
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,470
Marital advice from you. Wonderful.

156
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,556
Like what, don't betray your spouse?

157
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,516
Yeah, that'd be one of them.

158
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,354
But even between a husband and a wife, some secrets are acceptable.

159
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,525
However, your activities are not.

160
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,320
What are you talking about?

161
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,031
You're not as covert as you'd like to think.

162
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,326
Consider my life an object lesson.

163
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:46,540
If you don't want tond up like Jack and me, tell Sydney the truth.

164
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,557
It's not catching.

165
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,058
They're at either end of the platform.

166
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,145
Maybe when the train's at the station, they have to be set manually --

167
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,438
we can do it ourselves.

168
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,105
Okay.

169
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,528
You still feeling it, too?

170
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,531
Like something awful's gonna happen.

171
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,199
I know.

172
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,370
Vaughn asked me to marry him.

173
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,914
Sydney...

174
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,042
that's amazing.

175
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,170
I'm sure there are plenty of brides who want to kill their maid of honor.

176
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm not one of them.

177
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,466
Okay.

178
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,927
I'll take the switch in front.

179
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,601
  

180
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:48,977
  

181
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,566
  

182
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,448
  

183
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,826
  

184
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,061
  

185
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:07,246
  

186
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,456
  

187
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,084
Whatever! I wrote this program in five minutes, you perv!

188
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,669
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.

189
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,672
We need your Milsat access codes. You either give it to us now,

190
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,342
or every major news organization will get the tuva photos by morning.

191
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,970
"A," I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,305
"B," I'm running a trace on this call.

193
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,849
Great. I look forward to meeting you.

194
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,767
While I've got you on the line, let me ask you --

195
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,395
what's the significance of the green balloons?

196
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,529
Alpha-5-7-2-8-1-1-black.

197
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,032
Now, let me be clear. If those photos ever --

198
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:48,078
Oh, sure thing, minister. Or should I call you "cowboy"?

199
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,289
Got it!

200
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,143
D a.

201
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,019
  

202
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,440
  

203
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,026
  

204
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,077
- Okay, code's good. We're in.
- Good.

205
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,746
Okay.

206
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,043
- Wait a second. This is odd.
- What? What's odd?

207
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,086
Well, there's a signal coming out of Sovogda.

208
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,840
Someone's trying to uplink an encrypted broadcast connect to the russians' network.

209
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,343
It could be Elena, but why would she broadcast over a closed network?

210
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,594
- I don't know.
- Can you find out?

211
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,553
Let me see.

212
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,474
Jack, we cut the brake lines.

213
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,559
As soon as you restore power, we'll be good to roll.

214
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,686
I'm almost done here. Give me a sec.

215
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:17,918
Need any help?

216
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,503
No, just another minute.

217
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,136
Where's Nadia?

218
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,138
- She isn't back yet?
- No.

219
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,810
Guys, they're coming!

220
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,938
- Nadia, get out of there!
- Got it!

221
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,109
Nadia! Vaughn!

222
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,575
Nadia! Nadia!

223
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,375
Dad, stop the train!

224
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,835
Sydney, we can't!

225
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,086
Stop the damn train!

226
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,463
Nadia!

227
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,341
Sydney!

228
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,926
Come here, come here!

229
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,354
No!

230
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,525
Syd...

231
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,796
Your sister's alive.

232
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,270
Hold on! We're coming into the station!

233
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,219
These are Elena's men, sent here to kill you.

234
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,680
I suppose you're expecting a thank-you.

235
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,431
There's no time for sarcasm, Jack.

236
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,643
Elena's men have already primed the world's drinking water.

237
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,729
No one else can stop her if we don't get to her within the next few hours.

238
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:47,359
Wait a minute. You expect us  believe that you came here to help us? Please!

239
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,653
I have never been disingenuous with you on this, Sydney.

240
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,113
I allied myself to Elena

241
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,866
in order to put an end to her plan, to shoulder the risk myself.

242
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,327
But she's built in security devices, and I haven't had enough time.

243
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,079
I've heard quite enough, Arvin.

244
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,706
Jack, I've been inside the operation.

245
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,958
If you want to stop Elena, this is how we're gonna do it.

246
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,171
She's secured herself inside an antiquated C.O.G. facility below the Oransky building.

247
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,965
Sydney, Vaughn, open a line to A.P.O. We're gonna need Marshall.

248
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,135
Jack, you take point. Irina, forgive me, but there's no time for pleasantries.

249
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,182
You're no longer in charge of this team.

250
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,685
Jack, we might have made a breakthrough.

251
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,478
Marshall detected a signal coming out of the city.

252
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:27,065
We believe Elena is trying to uplink to the Milsat network.

253
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,609
Do we know why?

254
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,904
I decoded the signal -- it's a subaudible frequency below the range of human hearing,

255
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,156
the same frequency being used by the Mueller device.

256
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,326
She's using the russian satellite network to distribute that frequency worldwide.

257
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,329
If she succeeds, the effects we're seeing will occur globally,

258
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,623
everywhere the water's been primed. That's her endgame.

259
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,626
I know we told you there were two hours before the air strike,

260
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,003
but the instant the russians scramble those bombers,

261
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,130
the satellite network, it's going to go online.

262
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,050
The minute that happens, that signal -- it's going to be broadcast.

263
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:57,095
She is super-tricky -- counting on the russian air strike all along. It's what she wants.

264
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,347
How much time do we have?

265
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,556
40 minutes, give or take.

266
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,476
We need to get to the roof of that building and shut down the device.

267
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,646
Can you send us intel on the facility -- thermal scans?

268
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,941
Okay, just give me a sec.

269
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,237
No good. The Mueller device is causing too much interference.

270
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,822
The best I can do is building blueprints. Uploading now.

271
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,619
Got it.

272
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,539
Put in a call to Chase --  Washington should be kept up to speed

273
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,291
so they can order foreign leadership to begin preparations.

274
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,210
- Good luck.
- Yeah, likewise.

275
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,504
Our best bet is the northwest entrance.

276
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,422
We can approach it through the alley without being seen.

277
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,467
If she anticipated that, all her defenses would be there.

278
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,679
You're going to help us get inside that building and up to the roof.

279
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,265
- We have 40 minutes.
- Of course.

280
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,268
If we fail, I will personally put a bullet through your skull.

281
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,436
You won't have to.

282
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,690
I can take you up to the roof. It's not a problem --

283
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,525
Elena left it unguarded.

284
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,612
Once you disable the device, the toxins that are inside will

285
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,865
dissipate into the atmosphere.

286
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,826
What you're talking about is a suicide mission.

287
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,536
Just get me to the roof.

288
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,998
I can cut the wire to the relay -- reverse the ionization.

289
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,709
Aside from the impact, the water will be harmless.

290
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:14,047
I'll take you, but your sister changed the wiring scheme. It's one of her fail-safes.

291
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,382
In that case...

292
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,010
take me to my sister.

293
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,428
I will.

294
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,014
Where's Nadia?

295
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,353
Phoenix, Raaptor, do you copy?

296
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,647
Can anybody hear me?

297
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,274
Sydney!

298
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,637
Hello?

299
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,597
Is someone there?

300
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,807
Help  me!

301
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,727
Please.

302
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,027
Don't hurt me!

303
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,447
What happened to you?

304
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,116
My leg -- I think it's broken.

305
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,994
Thank god. I've been here for hours.

306
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,374
It was risky going out like you did.

307
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,210
How did you know I wasn't one of them?

308
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,670
Because...

309
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,714
...I know who you are.

310
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,313
Sweetheart.

311
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,191
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.

312
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,070
I hope you understand. I never wanted to hurt you.

313
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,408
I never wanted children of my own, Nadia.

314
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,410
Then you came along.

315
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,083
And ever since then, no matter how far I was from you,

316
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,629
I always thought of you as my daughter.

317
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,506
Don't touch me.

318
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,177
You have a choice.

319
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,890
You can embrace your anger and hate me...

320
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,477
...or you can join me.

321
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,063
The flood has begun.

322
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,900
Only precious few will survive.

323
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,113
There she is.

324
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,200
I see her now --

325
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,577
your mother.

326
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,917
She used to look at me with those eyes.

327
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:01,173
It's time that you accept the life you have ahead of you.

328
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:09,014
I know it's not easy. Greatness never is.

329
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,566
You're right.

330
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,488
I see my future.

331
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,661
Two minutes from now, I see myself killing you.

332
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,294
The only reason you want me to be on your side

333
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,216
is because you believe I'm the one to stop Sydney Bristow.

334
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,760
But she's my sister.

335
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,017
You're nothing to me.

336
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,605
I am sorry you feel that way.

337
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,876
What's that?

338
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,629
Don't worry, darling.

339
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,257
It's only tap water.

340
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,136
I will never betray my sister.

341
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,389
We'll see.

342
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,029
Syd.

343
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:48,947
Did I forget something?

344
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,950
Yeah -- me. I'm coming with you.

345
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,911
Did my dad change the plans?

346
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,871
No, I did. I'm joining you on the roof.

347
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,499
It's a one-person job. My mom will relay up the wiring instructions.

348
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,126
- I can disarm the device myself.
- I know you can.

349
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:04,630
But you can't outrun the wall of water that thing's gonna turn into.

350
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,839
How are you gonna help me?

351
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,174
We'll figure something out.

352
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,635
You'll run faster if I'm chasing you.

353
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,512
I'll be fine.

354
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,305
And they need you in the bunker.

355
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,641
- Syd...
- If we don't get Elena...

356
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:17,726
Don't say it.

357
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,066
I'll see you in a few minutes.

358
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:26,485
Okay.

359
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,367
Just in case, yes.

360
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,953
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I want to marry you.

361
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,593
It's perfect.

362
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,429
So are you.

363
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,024
Go.

364
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,944
- I'll see you.
- I know.

365
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:36,471
That's right, a polymorphic computer virus capable of infecting military-grade encryption.

366
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,516
You think you can handle that? Not 10 minutes -- I need it now!

367
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,643
Just get it done, okay? Thank you.

368
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,312
Are we close?

369
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:46,023
That's not really a helpful question right now, okay?

370
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:47,733
Don't blame yourself.

371
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,277
This satellite network was designed to withstand World War III.

372
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,533
I just got off the phone with my buddy at the secret service.

373
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,952
They've initiated the "continuity of government" protocol.

374
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,913
The president, his cabinet, their family members --

375
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,873
all being evacuated to underground command centers.

376
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,144
Somewhere in the back of my mind I've kidded myself,

377
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,129
but I thought maybe I'd be on the list.

378
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:10,339
Yeah.

379
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:12,799
It's kind of like high school all over again.

380
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,344
The cool kids are having a party, and I'm not invited.

381
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,015
All right, there's still time left.

382
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,600
Let's not give up on them yet.

383
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,691
Hey, honey. Hi. Uh... no, I don't have a lot of time. I just --

384
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,653
I just wanted to tell you I love you.

385
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,613
I don't get to tell you that often enough.

386
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,159
No, I haven't been drinking. I'm just --

387
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,620
I'm just gonna be home early tonight, okay?

388
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:43,789
Bye.

389
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,795
Russian bombers are taxiing to the runway.

390
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,296
Have you uploaded the signal?

391
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,133
Once Milsat in on line, the signal will be broadcast worldwide.

392
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,178
Sloane's back.

393
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,944
Hello, sis.

394
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,492
Ever since you were 11, there's something I wanted to do.

395
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:20,993
You --

396
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:23,287
Now.

397
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,760
Can't retract the signal from this terminal.

398
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,512
Find the relay room and destroy it.

399
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,010
Nadia!

400
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,222
Nadia, it's me.

401
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:24,932
It's Sydney.

402
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:27,935
I don't want to hurt you.

403
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,689
Sydney, what's happening?

404
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,317
It's Nadia -- she's guarding the device. She's infected.

405
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,528
This is all your doing.

406
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,112
You have to take her out.

407
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,572
No, dad.

408
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,616
She's my sister.

409
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,867
Listen to me.

410
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,827
She's not your sister anymore.

411
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,162
But mom...

412
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:50,916
I know.

413
00:29:57,544 --> 00:30:01,193
Please, Nadia. Please let me help you.

414
00:30:07,797 --> 00:30:09,852
- Sydney?
- Sydney, what's happening?

415
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,063
Nadia, stop.

416
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,469
The relay's blown. Check the signal strength.

417
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,139
No good, Vaughn. The signal's still broadcasting.

418
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,932
I've planned this for five years.

419
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,686
Don't you think I've accounted for every possibility?

420
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,232
- Vaughn? Is Sloane with you?
- No. He's not with you?

421
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,484
- Get to the roof right now.
- On my way.

422
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,940
Okay, mom, I've removed the panel.

423
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:39,942
Do you see the master circuit board?

424
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,027
I see a lot of circuit boards.

425
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,862
It's the one closest to the power supply.

426
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,865
Trace the ground wire. It should lead you to the coil.

427
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:47,824
Got it.

428
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:54,206
Okay, I'm there.

429
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:58,085
There should be two wires -- one black, one yellow.

430
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,919
No.

431
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,505
She's changed them out. One wire's blue. The other's white.

432
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:02,881
Hold on, Sydney.

433
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,971
I'll give you one chance to do the right thing.

434
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,307
Not that you were ever any good at that.

435
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,268
Which wire?

436
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:15,894
It's useless.

437
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,563
In a few minutes,

438
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,066
when the signal broadcasts, the whole world will be different.

439
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,528
However you plan on torturing me,

440
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,906
I'll hold out at least for that long.

441
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,075
I'm not gonna torture you.

442
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,870
I'm gonna let him do it.

443
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,455
And he really doesn't care for you,

444
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,875
especially after you tricked him into killing me.

445
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,919
One thing you should know about Jack --

446
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,463
he hates being anybody's puppet.

447
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:46,925
I'm actually hoping you don't tell us what we need to know.

448
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,849
There's a 50/50 chance Sydney cuts the right wire.

449
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,562
I'm willing to take those odds...

450
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,650
if it means I can stand here and watch you turn into an animal.

451
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,029
You're not a gambling man, Jack.

452
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:10,240
I didn't used to be, but it's been a rather interesting year for me.

453
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:14,036
It's made me re-evaluate certain parts of my life.

454
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:18,916
I'm trying to have more fun these days.

455
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:22,628
Wait.

456
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,174
How do I know you won't inject me anyway?

457
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:28,967
You don't.

458
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,683
White. Tell her to cut the white wire.

459
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,814
Sydney, cut the blue wire. And then run like hell.

460
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,608
You have 15 seconds before the ball bursts.

461
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,485
Copy that. Cutting the blue wire.

462
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:55,702
Nadi-- Nadia.

463
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,439
I had no choice.

464
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,115
Sydney, we got to go.

465
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:36,827
Get her into the elevator.

466
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:42,833
She's still breathing.

467
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,130
Sydney, let's go.

468
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,440
She's bleeding out.

469
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:08,817
Put some pressure on it.

470
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,327
The device is coming apart.

471
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,877
Raptor, do you copy? Come on. Phoenix.

472
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:13,173
Raptor, Phoenix, do you copy? Come on. Anyone?

473
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,800
Hold on. I'll try an alternate signal.

474
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:17,469
- Anything?
- Nothing.

475
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,972
All right, what's the status of the building?

476
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,726
It's not there anymore.

477
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:33,277
3-9-alpha-2-4. We've transitioned out of the bunker on the street.

478
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,071
Requesting immediate evac. Med-support needed. Popping smoke now.

479
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,870
The chopper should be here any minute.

480
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,332
We both know how this is supposed to play out.

481
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,170
You bring me back to the states, turn me over to your superiors.

482
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,383
On foot, you could reach the border by daybreak.

483
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,678
What about the agency? What would you tell them?

484
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:01,388
Oh, I think they know --

485
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,851
no one can hold on to Irina Derevko for too long.

486
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,121
Take care of your sister.

487
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:27,664
I will.

488
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,504
Three years ago, when I told you you were the chosen one,

489
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:36,131
that only you could take down the greatest evil,

490
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,344
I know your mind must have been overwhelmed with confusion.

491
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:47,518
But tonight you should recognize that you've done just that.

492
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:52,773
I'm so proud of you.

493
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:00,864
Thank you.

494
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:05,994
Sydney?

495
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,958
You may not see me on your wedding day...

496
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,462
but I'll see you.

497
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,261
- Nadia. Is she --
- Her vitals are stable.

498
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,681
They're keeping her under sedation until we find an antidote for her condition.

499
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,269
What about the survivors? Russians must be running tests --

500
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,062
There aren't any survivors.

501
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,567
The russian military executed all remaining civilians inside Sovogda.

502
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:19,985
Of course.

503
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,406
Otherwise it would belie their claim of a chemical explosion.

504
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,369
It's because of me...

505
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,039
because of my choices.

506
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,045
I've hurt the most precious thing in my life.

507
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,714
We'll get her back.

508
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,884
Whatever it takes, we'll find a cure.

509
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,223
Thank you.

510
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,725
I've arranged for you to see Nadia.

511
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,394
Sydney.

512
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,232
I didn't think I would ever say this,

513
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,736
but I believe you were trying to do the right thing.

514
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,572
Thank you.

515
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,689
- I had a thought.
- Yeah?

516
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,360
What if we just blow off the big-wedding thing?

517
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,196
What if we just do it on the beach?

518
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,657
- The beach?
- What do you think?

519
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,785
I like it. Barefoot on the beach, you'd look sexy as hell.

520
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,453
Oh, but wait. What about your dad?

521
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,914
He doesn't look like the kind who likes sand between his toes.

522
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:56,582
That's true.

523
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,835
So...we won't invite him.

524
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,004
Your father?

525
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,506
What if we don't invite anyone? We just elope?

526
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:06,425
Are you serious?

527
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,302
I would love it.

528
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,722
All right. Then we'll elope.

529
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,022
Have I told you that I love you?

530
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,067
Yeah. Go ahead, tell me again.

531
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,194
I love you.

532
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,988
I love you, too.

533
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,449
I know. Say it again.

534
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,745
I love you, Syd.

535
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,330
That's why I need to tell you something.

536
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,666
Just so there's no secrets between us.

537
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,459
Okay.

538
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,588
Whatever it is, I can handle it. Just don't tell me you're a bad guy.

539
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:49,343
You're not a bad guy, are you?

540
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,886
I guess that depends who you ask.

541
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:51,762
Vaughn...

542
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,722
It's from a long time ago.

543
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,098
It's before we met.

544
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,934
Actually, it's the reason we met.

545
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,896
It's no accident that I was the one you came to

546
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,232
when you walked in the CIA with your story about SD-6.

547
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,525
Wait. I don't understand.

548
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,486
Vaughn, what are you telling me?

549
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,656
Well, for starters, my name isn't Michael Vaughn.
