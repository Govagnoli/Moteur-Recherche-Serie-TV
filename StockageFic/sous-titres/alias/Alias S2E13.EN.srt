1
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,581
What was wrong with the black one?

2
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,752
Do you think it's comfortable
wearing clothes like this?

3
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,170
This isn't my first day on the job.
I disconnected your call button.

4
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,047
I know who you are.
I know what this plane is.

5
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,379
I don't know what you're talking about.

6
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,558
Tell me how to access Server 47.

7
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,848
Over there.
Behind the frame there's a terminal.

8
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,700
We're transmitting.

9
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,379
Mountaineer requests covert entry.

10
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,590
Roger that.
Mountaineer's cleared for entry.

11
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:49,515
OK, so what's new in town?

12
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,685
Kendall wouldn't say.
He wants to wait for the meeting.

13
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:53,937
So, I just ran by the park,
and there were, like, millions of people

14
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,106
just playing Frisbee, having picnics.

15
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,362
I know. What are people doing
in the middle of a workday?

16
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,277
Right, just in the middle of the day,
hanging out.

17
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,240
Let's move.
Did you tell her about the transfers?

18
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,201
Some recruits from Langley
are gonna be observing.

19
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,783
Wait. Before the meeting...

20
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:22,722
I'm gonna say something, and it'll either
be obvious to you, or seem presumptuous.

21
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:27,518
Either way, I've gotta say it.
This isn't working.

22
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:32,268
I've been thinking about this for a while.
I don't know what the hell to do.

23
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,397
- What?
- I think you know what.

24
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,451
- I need you to tell me.
- You need me to tell you what?

25
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:44,407
That when you're on operations,
I can't sleep at night?

26
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:46,490
That when we're in debrief,
I have to force myself

27
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,825
to remember what the hell
we're supposed to be reviewing,

28
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,207
when all I want to do is kiss you?

29
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,886
Sometimes it is hard to remember
what we're supposed to be talking about.

30
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:07,973
That's what I'm talking about. And the thing
that makes me crazy every day is,

31
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:12,143
people that would kill us if we were seen
together - the Alliance, SD-6, Sloane -

32
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:15,519
are the very forces that brought you
into my life to begin with.

33
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:17,735
What kind of a sick joke is that?

34
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:19,981
So what are you thinking? That maybe
we shouldn't be working together?

35
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,862
That's what I was thinking. But then
I thought "We are great together."

36
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:24,530
- I know.
- And the more we work together,

37
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,622
the sooner the Alliance gets destroyed.

38
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,163
So what are you suggesting?

39
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:33,122
- What is this, the flirting corner?
- We're talking.

40
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:36,878
Yeah, I figured that out.
There's a meeting. National security?

41
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,339
Remember that? It's important.
For the people?

42
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,918
We'll be right there.

43
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:03,152
Arvin Sloane: as most of you know,
Sloane is the acting director of SD-6.

44
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:08,913
For those of you new to the fun and games,
SD-6 is an arm of the Alliance,

45
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:11,454
a worldwide organised crime syndicate

46
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:14,248
responsible for weapons trade,
drug traffic and murder.

47
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:20,423
The Alliance keeps a dozen offices,
or cells, SD-1 through SD-12.

48
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,971
We've identified the location of seven
of these cells. The rest is speculation.

49
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:29,517
The Agents Bristow, Jack and Sydney,
have been working undercover at SD-6,

50
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:35,024
tracking their objectives, operations,
contacts, working under Arvin Sloane.

51
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:38,892
Until now. We've intercepted
communications which reveal

52
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:43,151
that the Alliance has picked someone
to be Sloane's replacement:

53
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,654
Anthony Geiger, which is about
as much as I can tell you about him.

54
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,581
Geiger has no file at CIA, FBI,
no police records,

55
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:53,452
no overdue video rentals, nothing.

56
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:56,877
Excuse me. Sloane's being replaced?

57
00:08:56,963 --> 00:09:00,712
He's been MIA for five days.
With Sloane gone and Geiger coming in,

58
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,923
we no longer have access
to their inner circle,

59
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:09,132
so, Sydney and Jack, your assignment is
to get close to Geiger, earn his trust.

60
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:12,641
Get back inside that inner circle.
That's it.

61
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:19,350
Dad, the one person in the world I want
brought to justice, he's disappeared.

62
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:25,981
I've been doing this a long time, Sydney.
There's rarely an end to the story.

63
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,102
I don't like it, whatever's happening here.

64
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:05,446
- Excuse me. Mr Geiger.
- Yes.

65
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:08,865
- Sydney Bristow.
- Come in. Sit down.

66
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,205
Let's see...

67
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,293
I just wanted
to introduce myself, say hello.

68
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:21,581
What can you tell me about Danny?

69
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:28,967
- What would you like to know?
- You were engaged?

70
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,047
- Yes.
- Well, tell me something more.

71
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:36,476
I assume you mean how Danny died.

72
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:39,848
I told him the truth.

73
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:43,144
That I worked for SD-6.

74
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:47,779
Security section discovered this,
they told Sloane.

75
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:53,322
- Sloane had him killed.
- What kind of doctor was he gonna be?

76
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:57,327
- A paediatric cardiologist.
- Really?

77
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,825
Well, that's unusual.

78
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,204
Did he like kids?

79
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:09,799
Danny had a younger brother who was
born with a condition, a heart condition,

80
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:14,050
and they were told there was no treatment.

81
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:27,861
If the people I work for
would assassinate my wife,

82
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:31,780
I would not show up at the office
the next day.

83
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,240
So why come back?

84
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:37,200
What for?

85
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,825
The precepts of SD-6 were made clear
to me when I was recruited.

86
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,540
What happened was my fault.

87
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:48,712
And I am a faithful officer
of this agency.

88
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,922
Thanks for coming in.

89
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,802
The new boss has a dreadful personality,
don't you think?

90
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:57,968
I've seen worse.

91
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:01,849
- Am I supposed to take that personally?
- Sark, what do you want?

92
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,641
When I met with Geiger this morning, I left
his office feeling as unstrung as you look.

93
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:08,440
Just so you know, I'm fully strung.

94
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:12,736
We all have secrets, Sydney.

95
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:18,615
And from what I've heard about Geiger,
he'll discover them.

96
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:22,455
- What have you heard about Geiger?
- Former German intelligence.

97
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:26,589
Has more enemies than various
other Germans we're familiar with.

98
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:28,749
He seems to think Sloane is a traitor.

99
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:31,712
He's already unlocked
Sloane's secret files on Server 47.

100
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,674
There are only 46 servers.

101
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:39,473
Really? Well, he announced it to me
as if it were a victory.

102
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:44,472
"I've already hacked Sloane's files
on Server 47."

103
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:49,477
There's only one reason Sloane would
keep secret the existence of a computer.

104
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,821
Because this computer, Server 47,
is a vulnerability.

105
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:55,114
Until you tell me what you're suggesting,
I have nothing to respond to.

106
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:58,571
I think there's a central Alliance computer.
I think that's what Server 47 is,

107
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:02,708
a network that links all the SD cells.
It makes sense, doesn't it?

108
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,666
I'm trying to find a flaw
in this line of thought.

109
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:08,418
I wanna find this computer.
If I'm right, it could tell us everything -

110
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,461
names of the Alliance partners,
locations of their offices...

111
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,679
- Sydney...
- Dad, this could be the silver bullet.

112
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:18,175
I'll get CIA to sanction it.

113
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,093
We tracked down Server 47.

114
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:23,388
The reason you couldn't get a 20 on it
is because it doesn't exist on this planet.

115
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,312
It's in the sky. It's a 747
purchased by the Alliance in 1998.

116
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,651
They retrofitted the interior to contain
a secure server and a satellite uplink.

117
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:34,272
- They keep the computer airborne?
- It only lands for refuelling.

118
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:37,367
The Alliance has this man
overseeing the operation: Gils Macor.

119
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,694
He's an accomplished
computer-security expert.

120
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:42,457
He and his bodyguards
travel with the server at all times.

121
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,245
This guy spends his life
on a plane with a computer?

122
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:46,663
It's a really nice plane.

123
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:49,789
How did they convince an upper-level
asset to do that job, right?

124
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,957
- They provide him with women.
- You're kidding me.

125
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,719
No. Twice a week, alternate airports
in England and Spain,

126
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:58,717
a high-end escort agency
provides a new "friend".

127
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:02,507
- I have to be his friend?
- No, you just have to get him alone.

128
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,013
The computer's in the belly of the plane,

129
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,310
but apparently there are terminal access
in the main cabin.

130
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,556
We're all going to Barcelona.
We have a team set up there already.

131
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,808
They'll ambush
the drop-off of his latest date.

132
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:13,939
But they'll deliver you in her place.
Just get onto the plane,

133
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,067
get Macor alone, access the server,
and transmit its contents to us.

134
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:18,653
We'll be in a cargo jet flying at altitude.

135
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:21,495
We have to stay within 5,000 feet
of you to receive your signal.

136
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,868
Here's your transmitter.
The earrings'll give us audio and video,

137
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:26,993
and Op Tech has the rest of your gear.

138
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:29,956
Guys, we should get to the plane.

139
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,756
Security scan.

140
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:41,546
- OK, whenever you wanna have that talk.
- What talk?

141
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,848
About the cologne,
or whatever the hell you're wearing.

142
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:45,975
- I'm not wearing any cologne.
- Something's going on.

143
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:49,313
No man naturally smells
as good as you do right now.

144
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,439
OK. Her camera's on.
Here we go. Here we go.

145
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:11,920
- That son of a bitch.
- Easy. Come on.

146
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,007
I swear I'm gonna kill this guy.

147
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:27,804
There's no way
that guy smells as good as you.

148
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:32,309
- It's aftershave. I got a new aftershave.
- Yeah, well, I'd lighten up on it.

149
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,816
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. To the point of nonuse.

150
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:41,484
Tell me how to access Server 47.

151
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:44,328
Behind the frame there's a terminal.

152
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,041
All right. Keep going.

153
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,247
- We're transmitting.
- Got it.

154
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,628
- We should be at Heathrow in an hour.
- Team's already in place.

155
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,421
I'm going to take out the guard.

156
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,809
Throw the gun. Make him reach for it.

157
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:46,971
You think you can steal from us,
you little bitch?

158
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,846
No. No, no, no, no.

159
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,421
Oh, my God.

160
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:20,312
She's all yours.

161
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:31,116
Hey, guess what.
Sydney's gonna be late again.

162
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:36,199
I know. She's missing all the dirty work.
Look at these guys.

163
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:38,784
I hate this part.

164
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:46,969
OK, the suspense is killing me.
What's the occasion?

165
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:51,265
- The restaurant is actually making a profit.
- After only six months?

166
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:55,050
- Is that even possible?
- Yes. Hence the lobster dinner.

167
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,980
Seriously, if anyone told me last year
that I would be making this work,

168
00:18:58,064 --> 00:19:03,770
you know, my own restaurant...
It's just... it's just unbelievable.

169
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,405
I guess this is a really bad time
to tell you I have to quit, right?

170
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:12,110
I got a job working for a travel magazine.

171
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:15,738
I mean, it's not <i>The New York Times,</i>
but I am writing for a living.

172
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:19,497
Will, that is genius. I love that
you're writing again. It's fantastic.

173
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,164
- You're OK with it?
- Yeah.

174
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,796
Like I can't find another waiter
in Los Angeles?

175
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,170
- Oh, Francie, you're the best.
- Congratulations.

176
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,167
You too.

177
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:47,694
Analysis got done with the hard drive.

178
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:56,993
Sir, this is our chance
to destroy the Alliance now.

179
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:59,917
Miss Bristow, thank you.
I understand what the papers suggest,

180
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,793
but you don't rush an operation like this.

181
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:04,286
Sir, as soon as the Alliance realises
there's a breach in their server,

182
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:07,999
- this information won't be valid.
- Do you recall the 150lb of C-4 explosives

183
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:11,676
buried in the subbasement at SD-6
and probably every other SD cell?

184
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:13,341
If this intel is wrong and we move on it,

185
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:15,424
we're talking about
the deaths of hundreds of civilians.

186
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:18,601
The answer is in the document.
According to the information you retrieved,

187
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:23,099
each SD cell uses a code, which changes
weekly, to operate their security systems.

188
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,065
The current code is listed right here.

189
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:28,271
So you're saying we need to get into SD-6
and find out what the code is right now?

190
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:30,521
If it matches the one in the document,
the rest of the intel is real.

191
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:33,735
In which case I could go to Langley
about raiding Alliance facilities.

192
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:36,614
- Do we have the current SD-6 code?
- No.

193
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,662
But I can get it.

194
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,048
- Yesterday I thought I was...
- Really?

195
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:53,259
- Yeah, it was... Yeah.
- It was great.

196
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:57,261
- Thank you. Thank you for noticing.
- It was really good.

197
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,766
- Do you know that guy at table 45?
- No, I don't know him.

198
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:03,012
- He was totally looking at you.
- He was not looking at me.

199
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:06,024
- He was so.
- What's going on?

200
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,268
- What?
- What do you mean?

201
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:10,852
You guys are both acting
like you're on drugs.

202
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:13,023
Well...

203
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,485
- We sort of made out.
- Oh, my God.

204
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,615
All right, this is too weird.

205
00:21:22,918 --> 00:21:27,165
- You called for me.
- I've been reviewing Mr Sloane's work.

206
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:31,834
I found an email. It struck me as curious.

207
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:36,838
Is SD-6 running a program
recording key strokes at each desktop?

208
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:41,759
- Yes, sir. Of course.
- Well, then... Why don't you sit down?

209
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:47,227
I'd like you to play back
what Arvin Sloane was typing.

210
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:53,149
- Literally every detail. Now.
- I don't know. We were in the kitchen,

211
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,443
- and all of a sudden we were...
- I can't believe this. I'm in shock.

212
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:58,159
- Good shock?
- No, great shock.

213
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,652
- Is this a onetime thing, or a thing thing?
- I don't know. I don't know.

214
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:06,038
You know the weird part?
The really weird part? It wasn't weird.

215
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,874
- I'm gonna have so much fun with this.
- Oh, Jesus.

216
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:15,421
Here we go. This is a playback of Arvin
Sloane as he wrote the email in question.

217
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:16,674
OK.

218
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:22,467
Wait. He wrote something
and then erased it. Play it back slow.

219
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:23,592
Certainly.

220
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,464
Jack Bristow?

221
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:03,014
- Anthony Geiger.
- I've been looking forward to this.

222
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,177
Me as well.

223
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,980
- Yeah?
- Sydney, it's me.

224
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:18,737
I'm talking to Mr Geiger.
He'd like you to come in right away.

225
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:21,363
Oh, and take surface streets.

226
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:24,454
They're doing some work on the freeway.

227
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,543
OK, I will.

228
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,706
See you soon.

229
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,600
Did he get the code?

230
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:44,846
Syd?

231
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,684
- He's compromised.
- What?

232
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,774
He just said "Take the surface streets,
they're doing work on the freeway."

233
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,896
- I don't understand.
- It's a phrase we came up with last year,

234
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:59,985
a code to let one of us know
if the other was ever discovered.

235
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:03,241
To warn them to stay away.

236
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,778
He's with Geiger now.

237
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:57,378
Jack, I know you are disloyal.

238
00:24:57,465 --> 00:25:01,214
I know your daughter is too.
Both your files.

239
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:06,178
There were so many red flags,
I thought I was in a Russian airport.

240
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:11,426
What I don't know
is where your loyalties lie.

241
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:17,603
Where are your loyalties, Jack?

242
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:23,438
So who are you working for?

243
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:31,994
We've met before, you and I.

244
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:40,089
I'm surprised you don't recall,
a man with such attention to detail.

245
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,960
I can't quite place it.

246
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,759
Neither could I.

247
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:49,470
But then I remembered.

248
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,635
Kanagawa, '87.

249
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:57,731
- Were you with Nagayo?
- We had dinner.

250
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:03,190
Oh, yes. I remember.
What a night that was.

251
00:26:03,281 --> 00:26:08,358
- The woman with the club foot.
- That's... that's right.

252
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:21,295
Come on, Jack. Just tell me who you're
working for, and this will all go away.

253
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:34,309
One last chance.

254
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,913
- I don't understand. Go where?
- Anywhere. Get Francie and leave town.

255
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:04,540
- Go to Vegas. Drive to San Francisco.
- Wait. What kind of trouble are you in?

256
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:07,172
Someone might be looking for me.
I just want you safe.

257
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:10,179
Just promise me you and Francie will
stay away. That's all I need you to do.

258
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:12,838
I promise.
Syd, are you gonna be OK?

259
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,141
Yeah. I have to go.

260
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,557
- Kendall's on his way back.
- He's not gonna do a thing.

261
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,475
- You don't know that.
- My dad was right.

262
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:21,978
Kendall's not gonna
make a move on the Alliance

263
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:24,939
until he knows
that information is valid.

264
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,110
- We have to get that code from SD-6.
- You cannot go back there.

265
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,191
I know.

266
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:43,710
Sydney. I got your message.

267
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:54,683
There isn't time
for me to explain everything.

268
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:59,346
For me to apologise
the way I need to.

269
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:05,602
SD-6 has nothing to do with the CIA.

270
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:12,190
Dixon, you've been lied to.
We've all been lied to.

271
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:15,951
What are you...? That's...

272
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,830
- Dixon, you've had suspicions about me.
- No, Sydney.

273
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,410
- You had suspicions about me.
- Sydney...

274
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:24,412
You were right. I know this is insane,
but you have to trust me now.

275
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:28,206
I'd take you to CIA headquarters,
I'd show you the files, the proof.

276
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:30,590
SD-6 is part of the Alliance.

277
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:35,546
You have been working for the enemy
you thought you were fighting.

278
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:40,849
This will take time to understand,
time we don't have.

279
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,472
I need you to listen to me.

280
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,897
They have my dad.

281
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:57,287
Geiger at SD-6,
and I'm afraid he's gonna kill him.

282
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:04,705
The CIA, the real CIA...

283
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,588
No, no, no. This is crazy.

284
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:10,338
- Sydney, do you hear yourself?
- .. has intel that can change all of this.

285
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:13,511
- No, wait, Dixon, you have to listen to me.
- This does not make any sense.

286
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:17,844
You have to listen to me. I can't
go back there, or they will kill me too.

287
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,635
We need you to go into SD-6.
We need you to hack into the system

288
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,312
and make visible a hidden file, one you
would never see, never know was there.

289
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,318
It's a code, a number that we need.

290
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:32,021
If it's a match to one we already have,
it will confirm data,

291
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:37,192
and the CIA will raid SD-6
and every Alliance office.

292
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:40,822
If you follow these instructions
to get the code,

293
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:46,123
you will be
in the core of SD-6 computer network.

294
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:50,833
You'll see...

295
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,169
it's not CIA.

296
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:56,551
It's Alliance.

297
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:08,817
I'll wait for your email.
But you need to hurry.

298
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:57,967
- Hello?
- Hi, baby.

299
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,970
- Where are you?
- I'm at work.

300
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:04,138
What's up?

301
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:08,645
I was just calling... you

302
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,221
to tell you I love you.

303
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:16,986
- How much I love you.
- Oh, thanks, sweetie. I love you too.

304
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:19,563
When will you be home?

305
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,861
I'm not sure.

306
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:25,412
OK.

307
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:27,573
Well, be safe.

308
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,122
You too.

309
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:08,783
The codes match.
It's a match.

310
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:14,042
As many of you may be aware,
the CIA recently received intelligence

311
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:17,712
which provides us with vital,
previously unavailable details

312
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,717
on the inner workings of the Alliance.

313
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:24,301
Thanks to some exceptional work,
we've confirmed the validity of this intel.

314
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:26,714
Therefore, tonight at 2200 hours,

315
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:32,099
the CIA in conjunction with the FSB,
the BAP, Ml5 and the Shin Bet,

316
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:36,138
will conduct simultaneous raids
on all Alliance facilities.

317
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:41,739
And tomorrow morning, God willing,
the Alliance will no longer exist.

318
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,411
Our tactical team will surround
the Credit Dauphine building

319
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,707
which houses the target SD-6 office.

320
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:58,839
Team will get as close to the perimeter as
possible and disable the security systems.

321
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:02,708
On operation leader's call,
teams around the globe, including yours,

322
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:07,464
will raid all SD offices, Alliance
headquarters, and partners' residences.

323
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:10,926
Now, most SD-6 agents are desk-trained
and won't fight back,

324
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,886
but their security team members
will respond with lethal force.

325
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:18,765
And they're the ones
you're gonna want to take down.

326
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,736
People, it's a hazardous job.
Do it well, and come home.

327
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:53,010
Jack, you know how this goes.

328
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:59,519
Your heart can only take one more shock,
perhaps two.

329
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:03,984
I've never seen anyone go beyond three.

330
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:06,823
Have you?

331
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:22,582
Base station to Congo team leader.
Security disarmed at SD-3.

332
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:24,714
Alarms disabled at SD-10.

333
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:28,929
Base station to Panda team leader.
Security alarms disarmed at SD-4.

334
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:40,938
I have given you
enough time to reconsider.

335
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,780
- You OK?
- Yeah.

336
00:35:54,873 --> 00:35:57,743
- SD-5 team, stand by.
- SD-4 team, stand by.

337
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,163
SD-3 team, stand by.

338
00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:06,879
Sir, all teams in position.

339
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:10,961
Let's move in.

340
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:13,432
Go, go, go.

341
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:24,938
Hey, do you want some pigs in a blanket?

342
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,570
- No, thanks.
- What?

343
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:33,535
Hey, nobody can resist little pigs in a
blanket. They're hot, fresh out of the oven.

344
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,992
Everything all right?

345
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:38,157
Yeah.

346
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:02,186
Marshall, get down.

347
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:39,427
Your daughter is so beautiful.

348
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:43,933
Imagine what I could do to her.

349
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,590
This is your last chance, Jack.

350
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:14,420
To save yourself.

351
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,428
To save Sydney.

352
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:22,811
Who are you working for?

353
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:55,843
- Oh, my God. Dad.
- I'm OK, sweetheart. I'm OK.

354
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:02,268
Seems we have two men down at SD-4.

355
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:04,641
Three agents killed at SD-8.

356
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:07,683
- Three agents down at SD-2.
- SD-9 has four down.

357
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,977
Excuse me.

358
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,233
Give me your hand.

359
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,988
Get up.

360
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:28,661
Dixon...

361
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:53,433
Look, this'll be over soon, I promise.

362
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,938
Thank you.

363
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:00,820
Don't talk to me.

364
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,738
Details of casualties are still sketchy, sir,

365
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:07,741
but we've gotten reports
from all team leaders.

366
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:12,496
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

367
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:10,225
Hey, guys. I just talked to base.
We did it. We kicked their asses.

368
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:12,685
Hey.

369
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:16,143
Guys. Did you hear what I said?
Asses.

370
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:19,688
Kicked.

371
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,745
It's remarkable, really.

372
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,743
Sydney leaked the intel to the CIA,

373
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:36,335
and the rest played out
exactly as you predicted it would.

374
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:40,919
So, congratulations, sir.
The Alliance is gone.

375
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:48,259
We shouldn't celebrate yet. As you know,
there's much more work to be done.

376
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:51,601
I just wanted to let you know
that Phase One is complete.

377
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:54,606
Good. Move on to Phase Two.

378
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:58,892
- And Sark?
- Yes, Mr Sloane?

379
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:02,437
Check in on the new asset.

380
00:42:03,491 --> 00:42:05,983
Make sure we're on schedule.

381
00:42:28,141 --> 00:42:29,422
Yes?

382
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:34,310
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

383
00:42:34,397 --> 00:42:37,315
Yes. Everything's in place.
