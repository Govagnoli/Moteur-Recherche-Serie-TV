1
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,167
  

2
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:28,679
  

3
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,235
  

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,164
  

5
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,103
What's taking so long?

6
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:53,300
You're an impatient bastard, aren't you?

7
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,432
Time is money.

8
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:56,420
The hydrosect will be here soon,

9
00:00:57,523 --> 00:01:00,093
at which point we'll move on to the next stage.

10
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,082
Which is?

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,070
Dispersal.

12
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,410
For now we relax and enjoy ourselves.

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,420
Cheers.

14
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:13,332
Outrigger's armed.

15
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:15,782
He's in V.I.P. with Kradic and two others.

16
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,277
Expect delivery of hydrosect any minute.

17
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,410
Good work, Phoenix.

18
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,064
Once delivery is confirmed,

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,205
we need to take every precaution to ensure the hydrosect remains stable.

20
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:26,004
Have we confirmed the method of transport?

21
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:27,807
It was Jack's responsibility.

22
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,012
He hasn't checked in yet this morning, has he?

23
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:31,528
No.

24
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,529
Now, it'll most likely arrive in a large metal biometric case --

25
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:39,192
you know, the kind that are usually named after large multinational corporations.

26
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,038
Shotgun, what's your status?

27
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,598
No sign of Kradic's men yet.

28
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:01,260
Yeah?

29
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:05,320
Good.

30
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,713
The hydrosect's here?

31
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,125
- Out front.
- About time.

32
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,631
Got a visual on the hydrosect.

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,028
Vaughn, take cover!

34
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,740
Phoenix, what's happening?

35
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,430
Drop the gun or lose your arm.

36
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,117
Don't move!

37
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:28,994
I'm on him!

38
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,933
Phoenix, what's going on?

39
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,686
Third party tried to intercept the hydrosect.

40
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:46,676
I'm in pursuit.

41
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,316
Put the guns down!

42
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,958
Or this goes into the drinking water!

43
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,082
I said put them down!

44
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,794
Send in the biohazard team. We need to contain the hydrosect.

45
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:33,831
On their way.

46
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,742
So the CIA has the hydrosect?

47
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,358
They got lucky. If I can find out where they took it, I can get it back.

48
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:45,636
Leave that to me. Come to Los Angeles.

49
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,058
Contact me when you get here.

50
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:53,910
Everything all right?

51
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,463
Oh, yes.

52
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:57,742
Just making a hotel reservation.

53
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,392
Sophia, you just got here.

54
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:03,054
  

55
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,809
  

56
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,945
  

57
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,894
  

58
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,219
  

59
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,121
Didn't I used to say that to you?

60
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:20,162
Stay. I insist. We want you to be here.

61
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:21,616
Please.

62
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:22,881
All right.

63
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:27,097
But you must tell me the minute I become a burden.

64
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:28,317
I promise.

65
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,718
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:42,183
Have you seen my father?

67
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,782
Nothing yet, huh?

68
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:47,475
I'm worried. I left him like a dozen messages.

69
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,847
He was supposed to report in two days ago.

70
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,494
So what do you want to do about it?

71
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:02,817
So this is where your dad lives, huh?

72
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,092
Yeah, what did you expect?

73
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,604
I don't know, a bunker or something.

74
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:08,418
So you've really never been here?

75
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,683
- No.
- That's very strange.

76
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,956
As opposed to everything else about my relationship with my father.

77
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,124
301. Here it is.

78
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:29,789
Dad?

79
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,469
- Not much for clutter,is he?
- No.

80
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,338
Sydney, come here. Look at this.

81
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,788
Body temperature, blood pressure, blood cell counts.

82
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,350
He's monitoring his vitals.

83
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,148
Marshall.

84
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,378
Oh, hey, did you hear the news?

85
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,091
I get to run an initial analysis on hydrosect this afternoon.

86
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,078
I love level 4 biohazard toxins.

87
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,929
My father asked me to give you

88
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:54,524
this artist's sketch based on descriptions from Sydney and Vaughn.

89
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:56,755
- He wants to know if you can --
- Run a biometric match.

90
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,462
Yeah, but off a sketch it's a bit tricky.

91
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,024
Can you do it?

92
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:02,016
Flinkman doesn't know the meaning of failure.

93
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:05,145
One ugly puss, huh? Muy feo.

94
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:08,184
Now they have a picture of you.

95
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,082
They have a cartoon drawing.

96
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,434
They'll never get a positive I.D. off of that.

97
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:15,568
You underestimated them in Vienna,

98
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,696
and we lost the hydrosect.

99
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:18,923
Lucky break.

100
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,205
Nadia  has a laptop with A.P.O. access.

101
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,054
She brings it home every night.

102
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:27,670
We may be able to use it to find the hydrosect.

103
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,569
How long would it take you to hack into it?

104
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,334
I'm afraid our options are limited, Jack.

105
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:41,037
The white blood cells anomalies are not what we'd hoped for.

106
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,835
Limited, not exhausted.

107
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,626
Science is full of happy accidents.

108
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:49,490
Alexander Fleming spent years trying to figure out

109
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,475
how to treat bacterial infection.

110
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,848
He  needed a vacation so bad,

111
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,844
he forgot to wash his petri dishes before leaving the lab.

112
00:08:56,263 --> 00:09:00,933
So he comes back a week later, well rested, tanned, and what's he faced with?

113
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,592
A stack of moldy dishes.

114
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:05,441
But he looks a little closer, and son of a gun.

115
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,631
Not an iota of bacteria growing anywhere near the mold.

116
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:09,857
Penicillin.

117
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,368
Just a happy accident.

118
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:12,892
Fascinating anecdote,

119
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,826
although its relevance to my condition isn't exactly --

120
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,014
I have spent most of my career researching genetic mutations.

121
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,287
Mostly in rats.

122
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:20,561
I like rats.

123
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,053
Much smarter than they're given credit for.

124
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:27,040
These little buggers were exposed to the mother lode of radiation.

125
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:31,057
I was distracted one day -- problems with the wife --

126
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,524
and I accidentally gave them a lethal dose of an alkylating agent.

127
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:38,220
But lo and behold, a few of my rats survived.

128
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,922
Milo lived to the ripe old age of 4.

129
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:41,751
That's something.

130
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:45,606
Yes, but 84% of my rats were dead within a week.

131
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,930
And given what they went through, death was a blessing.

132
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,154
We both know the prognosis for my condition.

133
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,714
I don't see that I have a choice.

134
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:55,991
This alkylating agent was discontinued decades ago.

135
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,079
It was considered too lethal, even in controlled environments.

136
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:02,553
I have contacts. I'm sure I can procure the necessary chemicals.

137
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:08,878
Here's what we need.

138
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:16,080
Jack, as one friend to another, these drugs are nasty.

139
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,260
If they don't cure you --

140
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:19,066
I'll turn out like one of your rats.

141
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:22,903
I'll be in touch.

142
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:33,721
Come up with anything on that assailant?

143
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:34,425
Not yet.

144
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,990
But I am writing an algorithm into the program to speed things up, so...

145
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,410
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

146
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,670
Hello?

147
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:44,481
I hate to bother you at work, but I was hoping that

148
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:48,862
I could make dinner for you and Sydney and your boyfriends tomorrow night.

149
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,520
Sophia, you don't have to.

150
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:53,852
It would mean so much to me after all you've done.

151
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,594
Are we free for dinner tomorrow?

152
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:58,450
Dinner? Food? Are you kidding me? Yes.

153
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,891
It's fine with us, but I have to check with Sydney and Vaughn.

154
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:01,737
Great.

155
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:10,717
Jack.

156
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,868
Were you able to get what I requested?

157
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:14,955
Yeah, sure.

158
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,241
Cute.

159
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,894
Listen, I need you to promise me

160
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,420
there's no way this is gonna get traced back to me.

161
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:26,167
I'm familiar with your concerns.

162
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,092
Look, Jack...

163
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,960
I don't mean to be presumptuous, tell you how to handle your business,

164
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:40,619
but the human body is not designed to handle this stuff.

165
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,880
Whoever this poor guy is you're gonna be torturing --

166
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:46,878
Curious morality coming from a guy who kills monkeys for a living.

167
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:49,205
What I'm saying -- be conservative.

168
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:53,147
A few ccs at a time, or you're gonna be out of fun before it begins.

169
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,138
Thanks for the advice.

170
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:59,222
So, this -- this pays off my debt to you, right?

171
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,583
Be seeing you, Anthony.

172
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:17,162
I need a favor.

173
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,151
Sure. What can I do for you?

174
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,953
Pull up everything you've got an alkylating agents

175
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:22,137
and cross-reference it with radiation sickness.

176
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:26,053
Okay. Kind of an odd combination. What exactly are you looking for?

177
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,529
Something's going on with my dad. I have to get to the bottom of it.

178
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,731
Coming right up. Just, uh...

179
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,165
Marshall, what's wrong with my father?

180
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,187
Hmm?

181
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:43,412
You know, don't you?

182
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:48,909
It was after your mission to Yakutsk.

183
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:49,901
Yeah?

184
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,782
God, he pulled the fuel right out of the core reactor.

185
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,108
He told me not to tell you.

186
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,149
He actually made me swear on Mitchell's life,

187
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,095
but seeing that you came in here to me,

188
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:06,330
I guess I didn't really violate --

189
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,421
I thought you shut down the reactor from here.

190
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,903
So did I, at first.

191
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,039
But then you got trapped in the experimental chamber,

192
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:14,432
and he thought it would be best if he went inside, and --

193
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,218
Marshall, whatever information you have on his treatment, I need it now.

194
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:17,924
Syd...

195
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:20,256
there is no treatment.

196
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,857
I mean, I have been all over the medical journals,

197
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,356
harassing researchers that I know -- some that I don't know.

198
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,633
If there was a treatment,

199
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,573
I would have found it by now.

200
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,044
Sydney,  what is it?

201
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,739
We have to find my father.

202
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,628
Jack Bristow is in need of immediate medical attention.

203
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,284
Currently he's off the grid.

204
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:19,431
We've tried all usual avenues of communication.

205
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:23,132
We have contacted every hospital and private practice in Los Angeles county.

206
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,822
No one has record of treating him.

207
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:27,624
Maybe he checked in using an alias.

208
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:28,833
Well, we considered that,

209
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,331
but the genetic mutation he experienced

210
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:32,910
would require any doctor to make special note,

211
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:35,987
and nothing matching your father's criteria has been reported.

212
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,308
The truth is, whatever my father has,

213
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,243
it isn't treatable.

214
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,203
If he's as sick as we think he is,

215
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:45,911
it's likely that his mental faculties are impaired.

216
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:48,019
Which means someone might be preying on Jack

217
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,228
using the false promise of a cure.

218
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,319
We must act quickly. If someone is actively trying to harm Jack,

219
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,117
he may be in no position to defend himself.

220
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,419
How did it go?

221
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,779
All right. I'll prepare this, and we'll be ready to go.

222
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,816
Connie will take care of your personal belongings.

223
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,552
How are you feeling today, Mr. Bristow?

224
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,963
Hopeful.

225
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:27,529
We got a hit. Jack just used a drive-thru ATM on 9th

226
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,288
about 20 minutes ago down near Staples center.

227
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,065
Great. I'll log onto the traffic surveillance network,

228
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,107
see if I can spot his car leaving the bank.

229
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:33,856
Fantastic.

230
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,128
Come on, dad, pick up your phone.

231
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:39,641
Please leave your name and number with a brief message --

232
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:40,694
- Damn it.
- Syd, we'll find him.

233
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:42,254
Okay, I got it!

234
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,016
- Yeah, Marshall?
- We found his car.

235
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:52,200
It's parked outside a building on Pierpont.

236
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,431
- Do you know where Pierpont is?
- Yeah, five minutes out.

237
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,709
Oh, thank you, Marshall. Remind me to kiss you.

238
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:57,700
Okay.

239
00:15:58,877 --> 00:15:59,692
What? What'd she say?

240
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:00,612
Uh, nothing.

241
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:03,110
Everything's set.

242
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,516
The whole procedure should take about four hours.

243
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,928
What are these restraints for?

244
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,304
Uh, some patients go into convulsions when they're unconscious.

245
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,284
I didn't want you to hurt yourself.

246
00:16:12,994 --> 00:16:14,741
Jack, have you thought about talking to Sydney?

247
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,436
I do keep too many secrets.

248
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,407
When this is behind me, that's gonna change.

249
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,204
Sydney deserves more.

250
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,565
She deserves to know that she's the most important thing in my life.

251
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,522
She and Laura, of course.

252
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:33,817
I'm proud of you, Jack.

253
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,278
We found his car.

254
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,042
What would my father be doing here?

255
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,172
I don't know.

256
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,348
That's my father's jacket.

257
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:27,711
Where is the man you took these from?

258
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,447
Hey! Where is he?

259
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,336
Come on.

260
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:44,997
If for some reason this doesn't work,

261
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,013
tell my girls I love them --

262
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,911
Sydney and Laura.

263
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,743
You're gonna pull through this, Jack.

264
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:55,955
I'll see you on the other side.

265
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:02,290
I'd like you to count backwards from 10.

266
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,517
10...

267
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:06,174
9...

268
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,609
8...

269
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:11,434
7...

270
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:16,330
Dad.

271
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,424
It's okay. Everything's...

272
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:19,787
Oh, my god, dad.

273
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,116
Marshall, we need medical attention now.

274
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,850
Sydney's with Jack. They've taken him to the infirmary.

275
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:40,896
So he injected himself with poison?

276
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,049
Well, apparently he thought it was a cure.

277
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,807
Now they got it out of his system, but this illness --

278
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:47,234
they say within 72 hours,

279
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:49,601
his condition will advance to the point where it's irreversible.

280
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,302
Did he wake up in the ambulance?

281
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,110
Briefly. He kept wanting to see his doctor -- Dr. Liddell.

282
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,614
Apparently he's been suffering from hallucinations for weeks.

283
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:00,197
- Dr. Liddell?
- Yeah.

284
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,762
Dr. Atticus Liddell.

285
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,126
He exists?

286
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:06,734
He did.

287
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:11,568
25 years ago, Atticus Liddell developed a radical thesis

288
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,096
regarding the treatment of genetic mutations.

289
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,907
In 1981, he left the U.S. to pursue his theories.

290
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,581
He was working with patients devastated

291
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:22,673
by an undisclosed nuclear accident in the soviet union.

292
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,269
Unfortunately, it was the cold war.

293
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:28,138
Shortly after he arrived,

294
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:32,161
the soviets became convinced that in addition to being a physician,

295
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,059
Liddell was also a spy.

296
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,754
Which he was.

297
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,042
- Did they kill him?
- No.

298
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,746
One of Jack's handlers informed us of the russians' suspicions,

299
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,256
and Jack was able to extract him before they could act.

300
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,831
He  changed his name, gave him a new identity.

301
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,389
Then there must be a record of where Liddell was relocated.

302
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,577
No. In those times, Jack and his handler had a strict policy --

303
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,763
anything that sensitive, they kept no documentation.

304
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,768
So we have to contact my dad's handler.

305
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,005
Jack's handler is dead.

306
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,436
He died eight years ago.

307
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,130
But supposing Jack knows where Liddell is,

308
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:08,371
why didn't he make contact when he first developed symptoms?

309
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,609
He thought he did.

310
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:14,530
Wow. Mr. Bristow hallucinated the one man who can actually save his life.

311
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,235
Even his delusions are lucid.

312
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:18,485
A man like Liddell can't just disappear.

313
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,743
Yes, he could,

314
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,208
if he was hidden by my father.

315
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:31,238
Hey.

316
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,527
Is there anything I can do?

317
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,473
We're doing everything to find a doctor who might be able to help.

318
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:44,257
- I'm so sorry, Syd.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,256
I'm gonna sit with him for a while.

320
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,669
You want company? I'll cancel dinner with Sophia.

321
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,604
You should keep it. There's nothing you can do here anyway.

322
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:57,223
Okay. But if you need anything...

323
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:08,337
- Hi.
- Hi.

324
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,431
Mmm. Something smells good.

325
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:13,509
- You must be Eric.
- Yes.

326
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,362
- I'm Sophia.
- Oh, hi. Eric Weiss. Oh, wow.

327
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,307
How are you? I love her already.

328
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,809
I'm so sorry Sydney couldn't make it. How sick is her father?

329
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:25,042
It's hard to say. They're running some tests now.

330
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,796
- Yeah.
- That's awful.

331
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:31,029
It's very hard. When it's a parent, it's always so difficult.

332
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,765
Give me those. I want you two to relax. You had a rough day.

333
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,638
I'll take care of everything.

334
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:39,143
- Uh, Eric?
- Yeah?

335
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,283
You have no ideahow excited I am to meet you.

336
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:45,753
Nadia says the most beautiful things about you.

337
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:49,031
Really?

338
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:52,171
She asked me if you were tall, dark, and handsome.

339
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,019
I told her you were tall.

340
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,055
Dad?

341
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:41,873
Dad, can you hear me?

342
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:43,091
Oh...

343
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:45,016
Oh...

344
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:46,892
Hello.

345
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:48,064
Hi.

346
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,788
What are you doing -- why am --

347
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,792
I need to ask you something, dad.

348
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:55,960
Oh, no.

349
00:22:56,101 --> 00:23:02,013
It was my turn to pick up Sydney after dance class. I'm sorry.

350
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,587
Can -- can you take care of that?

351
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,327
I'll cover next time, Laura, I promise.

352
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,564
Laura?

353
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,451
I don't -- I don't know why I'm so tired, sweetheart.

354
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,754
I'm so tired.

355
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:36,081
What are these, the emperanas? These are inc-- they're so good.

356
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,595
Empanadas.

357
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,942
Whatever. They're delicious.

358
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:42,368
I taught Nadia how to make them when she was very little.

359
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:44,072
Well, I've been seriously deprived.

360
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:45,554
Please.

361
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,033
Have you ever made these for me?

362
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:51,157
Excuse me.

363
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,367
Can't you let it go?

364
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:54,356
I really have to get this. I'm sorry.

365
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:57,228
Nadia.

366
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:59,876
Do you want some more wine?

367
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,320
- Sure.
- Red? White?
- Red.

368
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,380
I know there's -- you know, there's seafood in here, but what --

369
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,667
what is this? Is this artichoke hearts?

370
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:17,990
- What is this?
- Many things.

371
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:21,922
And the rice. What is the spice in the rice? I can't -- is it, um...

372
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:24,642
- Saffron.
- Ah. Saffron.

373
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:28,481
I was going for cumin. Saffron -- your secret ingredient. Of course.

374
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,426
- It was Vaughn.
- How's Jack?

375
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,440
He's too far gone, Sydney.

376
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,315
In his present mental state, he will never tells where he hid Liddell.

377
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:48,956
Not to mention that it's possible your father doesn't even remember.

378
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,557
My father doesn't forget things.

379
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:51,978
We can hypnotize him.

380
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,741
Yeah, I considered that myself, but given his situation,

381
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,018
his condition, these hallucinations...

382
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:04,102
He called me Laura. He thought I was my mother.

383
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:08,248
He called you Laura? Not Irina? You said he called you Laura.

384
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:14,381
Suppose we convince your father that he's still living in 1981,

385
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,421
specifically the day that he extracted Liddell out of Russia.

386
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,407
My dad's hallucinating.

387
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,535
That's distinctly different from what you're suggesting.

388
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:27,901
No, no, I'm not sure it is. Calling you Laura, imagining Dr. Liddell.

389
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:33,738
What if we could recreate his surroundings?

390
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,666
Perhaps we could guide his delusions, get him to reveal

391
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,204
exactly where he relocated Liddell.

392
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,485
You want me to be my mother?

393
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:46,160
That's right.

394
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:58,540
Found a girl.

395
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:01,836
Six years old. She's got your eyes.

396
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:05,540
Her mom wants to know if she can use this for her acting reel.

397
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:08,161
You okay?

398
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,717
I get it. Not okay.

399
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,248
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

400
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:20,514
Well, you know, it's not too late.

401
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,077
We can always have Weiss dress up as Irina.

402
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,737
I'm sure he'd make a great housewife.

403
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,623
I don't remember my parents back when they were together.

404
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,052
Well, you were a little girl.

405
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,903
I remember the time. I don't remember them.

406
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,507
My dad... was my dad.

407
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,955
He was never around when I was a kid. He was always away on business.

408
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,929
My mom...

409
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,694
I don't know what my dad was like around my mother,

410
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:53,311
or what she was like around him. I don't know how to do this.

411
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:54,660
Syd, it's just a job.

412
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,999
It's another alias like all of the others.

413
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,895
Just trust your training. Follow your dad's cues.

414
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,315
Follow his lead.

415
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:05,295
Besides, I've got snipers everywhere if he starts to get inappropriate.

416
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,362
They're ready.

417
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:16,916
Hey, listen to me.

418
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:20,248
You can do this.

419
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,935
Oh, my god.

420
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,446
It's unsettling, isn't it?

421
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:49,113
This is my old house.

422
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:54,754
It should be sufficient as long as Jack doesn't examine the details too closely, hmm?

423
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,689
That bowl is in the wrong place.

424
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,433
Hmm. It's murano glass.

425
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:06,156
Emily and I gave this to your parents --

426
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:09,002
or at least the original version --

427
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,111
as a housewarming gift.

428
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,444
It belongs on the coffee table.

429
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:14,807
That's right.

430
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:20,330
We'll give you a few minutes after Jack wakes up to sell the illusion.

431
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,085
When the phone rings, give him his privacy.

432
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:28,049
Medical will move in as soon as we get Liddell's location.

433
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:31,136
We'll get this --

434
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,467
we'll get this over with as quickly as possible, Sydney.

435
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,262
You ready?

436
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,949
Your mother used to call your father "sweetheart."

437
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:52,220
It was a pet name for him.

438
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,045
Good luck.

439
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,234
He should be conscious in 30 seconds.

440
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:33,932
Turn on the television.

441
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,654
Okay. TV... on.

442
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,505
Sydney, go ahead.

443
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:24,894
Jack?

444
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,024
Oh, good. You're home.

445
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,810
Sydney?

446
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,062
She's upstairs, isn't she?

447
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,076
Would you give me a hand with these?

448
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:05,758
Sweetheart, is something wrong?

449
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,544
- It's not working.
- Just give her a moment, please.

450
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:16,216
Arvin called. He and Emily want to have dinner next Saturday.

451
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,399
I told him we'd love to.

452
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:26,474
You could have just said we're busy.

453
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,155
I know you put up with Arvin for my sake.

454
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:35,056
Sweetheart, he's your best friend. I'm your wife. I can tolerate him.

455
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:41,978
How can you do that?

456
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:44,004
Do what?

457
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,755
How can you be so perfect?

458
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:47,964
Loving mother...

459
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:51,366
beautiful wife, just --

460
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:54,085
just by standing there.

461
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:00,880
Vaughn.

462
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:05,600
Would you get that?

463
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:16,146
Hello.

464
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:18,790
Control number 80709. Is this line secure?

465
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:20,114
Yes, it is.

466
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,599
I'm calling from agent Grady's office.

467
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:23,924
We've moved up the timetable to get Liddell out of Minsk.

468
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:25,210
We have to get him out of there now.

469
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:26,629
Yes, I understand.

470
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:28,211
I can expedite your movements from here.

471
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,800
What travel arrangements do you need set up?

472
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:35,979
Jack, where do you want Liddell moved?

473
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,528
His mind's rejecting this,

474
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,326
possibly because Vaughn's voice doesn't sound like his handler's.

475
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,251
We should send in the girl.

476
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:52,950
Do it, Marshall.

477
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,285
Sending in...the girl.

478
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,489
Hi, dad.

479
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:04,537
Is it okay if I practice the piano?

480
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,317
Of course.

481
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,919
- Are you still there?
- Yes, of course.

482
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:16,664
- I have company.
- I understand.

483
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,293
About the doctor, I've been feeling a bit under the weather,

484
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:20,917
but I'm much better now.

485
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,043
It's code. Do you recognize it?

486
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,481
No, must be something Jack had with his handler.

487
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:27,676
Go ahead.

488
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:30,217
Despite that, I think I'd be wise to have a checkup.

489
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,218
It's been a year since my last stress test.

490
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,294
Can you schedule that for me?

491
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,647
You got it.

492
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:36,980
Thank you.

493
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,128
Sydney, Marshall should be able to decode the message.

494
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,140
Keep trying to get Liddell's location.

495
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:55,564
Sorry, honey.I have bad news.

496
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:56,339
Oh?

497
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,704
That was Grady. Who else would it be this early on a Sunday?

498
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,559
He has a mission for me. I'm afraid I have to leave town.

499
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:04,921
He told her. She knew he was a spy.

500
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:06,462
It would seem so.

501
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:08,685
What's the mission?

502
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,364
There's a doctor whose research has put his life in danger.

503
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,215
I need to make him disappear.

504
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:18,507
New name, new identity, new life.

505
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,451
Low risk. I promise.

506
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:24,775
- Where will you take him?
- Finland.

507
00:34:25,117 --> 00:34:27,778
Marshall, run a biometric of Dr. Liddell

508
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:31,311
against the databases of finnish passport offices and medical licensing board.

509
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,373
Already on it.

510
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:33,877
Sydney, we got it. Good work.

511
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,109
What concerns me -- I won't be back until next week.

512
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,496
I'll miss Sydney's birthday again.

513
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,799
That's okay.

514
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:47,231
You'll explain it to her. She'll understand.

515
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:50,295
She's a child. She shouldn't need to understand her father

516
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,884
isn't home to celebrate her birthday.

517
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:58,639
Laura, the only memories I have of my father are of him leaving.

518
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,322
I don't want it to be that way for her.

519
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:11,724
She deserves better.

520
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,509
The work you do is important.

521
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:26,652
Not as important as her.

522
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,365
Or you.

523
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:41,301
When I get back from Europe, I'm going to talk to my supervisors.

524
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:44,093
What about?

525
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,061
I'm giving notice.

526
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:49,983
Sorry.

527
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:53,747
I should have discussed this with you before I made any decisions.

528
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,526
No.

529
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:00,620
That means more to me than you'll ever know.

530
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:18,027
We'll send in the med techs to sedate your father.

531
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,054
That's good. Can I join you?

532
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,047
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

533
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:01,470
Laur-- ahh!

534
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:27,485
Dr. Liddell.

535
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:33,490
Jack Bristow needs your help.

536
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:45,180
Guys! Weiss, Nadia, hold on.

537
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:48,857
I was about to run some more carbide tests on the hydrosect --

538
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:51,608
case carbide tests, and I went to get it out of cold storage,

539
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:53,463
and it wasn't there, but of course you knew that.

540
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:54,356
How would we know that?

541
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:55,933
Well, it was moved at your request

542
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,665
by your unit to a low-security facility off-site.

543
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:01,998
I'm just wondering why, 'cause that's some dangerous stuff.

544
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:12,081
Excuse me, sir.

545
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:13,473
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm lost.

546
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:17,323
Could you please tell me where Division street is, please?

547
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,639
Sure. Actually Division street is the one-way street heading north.

548
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:21,908
What's going on?

549
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:24,376
Just some lady asking directions.

550
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,683
No one in our unit authorized anything.

551
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,443
Well, the request was authenticated. It came over our secure network.

552
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:38,972
The security system's offline. I'm calling it in.

553
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:42,561
You're saying that way is a one-way street, goes --

554
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:43,742
Right -- aah!

555
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,355
Hey, hey, hey, how did you get in --

556
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,522
Nothing. I'm getting nothing. No answer.

557
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:02,996
Let's go.

558
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:20,094
It's double-folded titanium.

559
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:23,216
Take a look at this.

560
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,513
You can cut through that.

561
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:44,632
Done.

562
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:24,912
The hydrosect's gone.

563
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:27,176
Oh, god.

564
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:30,544
It's the guy from Vienna.

565
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:32,721
The one Sydney and Vaughn --

566
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,283
What the hell happened here?

567
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:52,512
Atticus. So good of you to come.

568
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:54,416
After what Jack did for me...

569
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,686
Sydney will show you the infirmary. If there's anything you need --

570
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,541
- I'd like to see my patient.
- Right this way.

571
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:14,326
Dad?

572
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,596
Dad?

573
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,010
A friend is here to see you.

574
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,561
Hello, Jack.

575
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:31,479
Am I cured?

576
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:34,073
Not yet.

577
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,467
But I'm going to make you better.

578
