1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,157
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,870
Neil Caplan. He's a mathematician,
working out of Caltech.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,040
The Bureau just confirmed that
he and his family were kidnapped

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,125
from the Long Beach aquarium yesterday.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,964
You want me to help you,
you let my family go!

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,844
All I need to know right now is
whether you want to come with me.

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,102
Yes.

8
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,204
I didn't have a clean shot,
and I took it anyway.

9
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:37,511
I'm putting in for reassignment
to the Directorate of Intelligence.

10
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,468
If I had the shot, I might've taken it.

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,595
I know what Emily meant to you.

12
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,730
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,941
Arvin?

14
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,738
Arvin?

15
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,076
This plan might not hold up.
The CIA knows too much.

16
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,334
They could guess why
we were after the genetic database.

17
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,924
I'm not interested in the database.

18
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,009
I want satellite footage of Tuscany.

19
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,388
I wanna know who murdered my wife.

20
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,515
We both had to make sacrifices, Arvin.

21
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,815
You won't forgive yourself if you stop now.

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:37,481
We're so close to knowing
what Rambaldi knew.

23
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,325
I wish I'd never heard that man's name.

24
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,540
Good news, relatively speaking.

25
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,165
Using the administrative codes
we acquired at Bruckner,

26
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,212
I was able to log into their system
and download a copy of the database.

27
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,972
- But it's still encrypted?
- Yes.

28
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,888
Although Neil Caplan's still analysing
the remainder of the Rambaldi text,

29
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,007
his background in mathematics

30
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,676
should allow him to crack
the encryption algorithms.

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,108
I don't understand how we don't have
a single lead on Sloane or Mom.

32
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,645
There's a difference between
intelligence and actionable intelligence.

33
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,693
- What about the earrings Mom left me?
- Analysis couldn't trace the signal source.

34
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,072
Marshall's still trying to figure out
how they receive anything.

35
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,118
Dad, we have to get ahead of them.

36
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,948
We know they're acquiring
Rambaldi artefacts,

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,116
we know they tried
to access a DNA database,

38
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,619
so there must be some way
to predict what they're gonna do.

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,922
Sydney, I understand your frustration,
particularly in light of Emily's death.

40
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,924
But sometimes there isn't
a clear move to make.

41
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,918
Look at this.

42
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,131
Elsa Caplan's debrief transcript.
It's barely ten pages long.

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,639
Sloane kidnapped her husband two
months ago. All we have are ten pages?

44
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:52,266
Sydney, if you feel Elsa Caplan was
improperly debriefed, do it again yourself.

45
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,517
- How's your son?
- He's keeping me sane.

46
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,147
Even with the security detail,
it's hard to feel safe.

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,906
I don't wanna make this
more difficult for you,

48
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,114
but I need a little more of your help.

49
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,911
I'd like to bring you in
for a regression therapy session.

50
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:16,955
It's like hypnosis.
It's completely safe. I've done it myself.

51
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,588
No offence, but I don't feel comfortable with
the government poking around in my head.

52
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,755
I'll be honest with you.

53
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,176
- We're out of leads.
- What are you saying?

54
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,512
That if something happens to him,
it's my fault?

55
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,772
- No, of course not.
- These people threatened to kill my son.

56
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,567
- He's still having nightmares about it.
- Elsa, wait.

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,941
You come here and you tell me
that I'm not doing enough?

58
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,987
- That's not what I meant.
- Aaron, sweetie.

59
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,647
Sweetie, come on, it's time to go.

60
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,031
How dare you?

61
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,247
Sweetie, honey, it's time to go.

62
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,588
We still need your help.

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,185
I've just downloaded this. It's a catalogue
of over ten million people's DNA.

64
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,887
We're looking for someone specific, a man.

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,564
But it's encrypted.
We need you to break it.

66
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,027
For the past two months,
I haven't heard a word about my family,

67
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,908
or been given any indication
whether they're dead or alive, so...

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,617
you can just kill me.

69
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:36,202
Just kill me, cos there's no way in hell
I'm gonna help you people any more.

70
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:42,048
What if I told you that your family's
not only alive, but we let them go?

71
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,257
Call your house.

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,806
Call.

73
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,983
- Hello?
- Elsa, it's me!

74
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,654
- Hello?
- Elsa! Elsa, I'm alive!

75
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,442
She can't hear you.
I've modified the cellphone.

76
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,407
- Hello?
- They're home. They're safe.

77
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,412
Now you have something
to live for, Mr Caplan.

78
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,373
Elsa Caplan was living under
protective custody for the last two months.

79
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,002
I was so convinced that
we were overlooking something

80
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,844
that I went over there and implied that she
wasn't doing enough to save her husband.

81
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,724
How stupid!

82
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,811
Look, no one's harder
on themselves than you are.

83
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,510
Vaughn, OK, the backpack
is getting a little ridiculous.

84
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,677
What do you mean?

85
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,345
The middle drawer, it's yours.

86
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,447
- Yeah?
- It's just a drawer.

87
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,448
- I'm just saying, it's a great idea.
- Are you sure?

88
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,533
Uh-huh.

89
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,188
I love my drawer.

90
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,491
If we're gonna keep working,
I need to go and make a sandwich.

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,655
OK.

92
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,924
Vaughn?

93
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,599
There were three calls
made from the same number

94
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,557
to Caplan's house over the last year.

95
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,023
They came exactly four months apart.

96
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,987
They were all made on a Monday night
at the same time.

97
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,574
- And they all lasted one minute.
- Where did the calls come from?

98
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,366
- I need to talk to you.
- Is it Neil?

99
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,914
Before Neil's abduction,

100
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,332
three calls were made to your house
over the last year at odd hours.

101
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,962
We traced the number to a reporter
named Grigory Ivanov.

102
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,292
- Does that name mean anything to you?
- No.

103
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,797
We ran a background check.

104
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,924
He was a journalist working
out of Los Angeles for Itar-Tass,

105
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:23,176
a news service known for giving cover
to Russian intelligence agents.

106
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,438
This man, Ivanov...
we think he's one of them.

107
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,522
We put Ivanov under
electronic surveillance.

108
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,362
An hour ago, he received a fax
from an unknown source.

109
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,775
I don't understand.

110
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,815
Your husband may have been
working for the Russian SVR.

111
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,362
It's their equivalent to the CIA.

112
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,289
What did the fax say?

113
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,206
A single Russian word: <i>rahzviazka. </i>

114
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,713
It means "endgame".

115
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,808
- Neil's gonna die.
- Elsa, we don't know that.

116
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,146
No. I do.

117
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,235
Not you?

118
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,500
I didn't want to be hypnotised
because I was afraid you'd find out.

119
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,910
Ivanov was my handler.

120
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,170
Seven years ago,
I was ordered to seduce and marry Neil.

121
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,673
My objective was to keep tabs on his work.

122
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,343
I was given a tracking device
to implant in his arm,

123
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,838
but it has a secondary purpose.

124
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:47,556
It was designed to release 15mg
of cyanide into his bloodstream.

125
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,269
It's a suicide pill.

126
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,398
That's what the fax was about.

127
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,854
It means it's been activated.

128
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,866
And you're not authorised
to be telling me this?

129
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,444
I've just committed treason
against my government

130
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,540
because I want to get him back.

131
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,002
I'm telling you because I love him.

132
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,703
I have a lead on Sloane and Irina,
but we have to move immediately.

133
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,824
Yes, Vaughn briefed me.

134
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,252
Elsa Caplan shouldn't be processed
as a walk-in. She's an SVR agent.

135
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,746
Which means technically
we can classify her as a defector.

136
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,593
Or we can arrest her
and try her for espionage.

137
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,504
Until we make that determination,
I'm holding her here.

138
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,676
She wants to help. She implanted
a tracking chip in her husband.

139
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,934
The chip's activated by a code.
If we can get a locating device,

140
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,594
we can enter the code,
find him and remove the device

141
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,970
before it releases the cyanide.

142
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,399
I've already asked Marshall to look into the
possibility of reverse-engineering a locator.

143
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,653
I talked to Marshall. It'll take him
three days. Caplan will be dead by then.

144
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,073
The chip's set to release cyanide
into his bloodstream in 42 hours.

145
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,409
There's a black-market contact who deals
in SVR contraband. I'm going to meet him.

146
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,907
I'm not willing to risk your life

147
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,915
based on speculative intel
you acquired from a Russian spy.

148
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,123
- Why would she lie?
- That's precisely the question.

149
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,331
- She turned herself in.
- She's not the first.

150
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,750
Dad, I realise we're talking about a
Russian agent who betrayed her husband.

151
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,678
But Elsa Caplan and my mother
are not the same person.

152
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,475
Elsa's first instinct, her first thought,
was for her husband's life.

153
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,564
That's your assessment.

154
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,232
If we find Neil Caplan, we find Sloane
and Derevko. Isn't that worth the risk?

155
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,771
We'll move on Elsa's statement if
and only if we can corroborate it.

156
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,988
When did you start playing it safe?

157
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,025
You let Derevko walk out of here because
you thought she could lead us to Sloane.

158
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,786
A mistake I'm not anxious to repeat.

159
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,208
- And if Neil Caplan dies?
- Then he dies.

160
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,057
Who has my son?

161
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,099
- Aaron's fine. He's being taken care of.
- I thought you believed me.

162
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,313
- I do believe you.
- Then why am I in this cell?

163
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,268
I've admitted everything, committed
treason against my own government...

164
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,936
It's not that simple.
There are protocols...

165
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,780
This is Director Bristow. I want solitary
confinement imposed on Elsa Caplan.

166
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,862
No unapproved visitors, understood?

167
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,947
We still have 42 hours.

168
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,700
I want you to know
we're doing everything we can.

169
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,830
Elsa, don't react.
You're listening to a recorded message

170
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,876
being transmitted to you
through a directional sound projector.

171
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,255
You're the only one who can hear this.

172
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,428
The CIA won't sanction
an extraction team to get the locator.

173
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,174
I'm going in myself.

174
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,884
I know none of this is much of
a consolation to you right now...

175
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,804
I need you to give me the locator codes.

176
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:19,807
Cross your arms and tap them out
in Morse code with your index finger.

177
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,776
- Back away from the glass, please.
- I have authorisation.

178
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,947
Back up now.

179
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,701
Thank you.

180
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,377
It's been 24 hours.

181
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:54,426
This database is encoded with an 81 -92 bit
military-grade polymorphic encryption.

182
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,813
Unless you wanna kidnap a smarter
genius than me, it's gonna be a little while.

183
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,730
Tell me what you need to speed this up.

184
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,066
I need access to a Cray supercomputer.

185
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,158
I hope you're not stalling, Mr Caplan.

186
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,659
Because your safe return to your family

187
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,698
is no guarantee.

188
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,287
Understand?

189
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,925
- A few days ago...
- My leg!

190
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,926
I would have done anything
to keep you alive.

191
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,344
- My leg!
- And now...

192
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,897
I don't care.

193
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,353
Arvin! Arvin.

194
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,773
Arvin, don't.

195
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,938
We still need him.

196
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,657
My leg!

197
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,079
Where would you be transferred to?

198
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,670
I'll be reassigned within the Agency.

199
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,794
Maybe to Texas or DC.

200
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,424
I'd be an analyst.

201
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:21,767
- I'd be safe.
- You'd be happy not being in the field?

202
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,648
I'd be happy.

203
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,355
As long as you and the kids are with me.

204
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:32,981
Sloane's the man who ran SD-6,
the one who lied to you for years.

205
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,192
Marcus...

206
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,287
You are not responsible
for what happened to his wife.

207
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,914
He put her in harm's way.

208
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:50,509
That's not the only reason
I'm putting in for the transfer.

209
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,429
I'm doing it for us.

210
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,515
When you first told me the truth,

211
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,392
I said I didn't know who you were.

212
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,682
I was wrong.

213
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,268
I just didn't know what you did.

214
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,064
I have always known who you are.

215
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:18,488
You are the most decent man I know.

216
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,416
Whatever you decide, I'll be with you.

217
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,255
- Hello?
- It's me.

218
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,926
- Is your source still in place?
- Yes.

219
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,714
Good. I need something from him.

220
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,447
Base Ops, this is Trailer.
We have a 20 on the target.

221
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,529
Copy. Stay with her.

222
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,945
We're about to head over
to the Pi Delt exchange.

223
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,951
I think Tom's gonna be there.

224
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,077
- She gave you a drawer, huh?
- It was a gesture of convenience.

225
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,505
- And what'd you put in it?
- Why do you care?

226
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,545
What do you mean, why do I care?
Do you know how spoiled you are?

227
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,883
You got a drawer. I wish I had a girlfriend
to say "You want a drawer?"

228
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,425
- I'll give you a drawer at my place.
- I don't want a drawer in your place.

229
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,642
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

230
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,224
You OK?

231
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,354
Marshall told me your father
shut you down this morning.

232
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,811
Yeah, I just needed to get out, cool down.

233
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,687
Dad was right, like that's news.
I just wish there was more I could do.

234
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,656
Well, we're working on
corroborating Elsa's intel.

235
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,403
- Where are you?
- At the drugstore.

236
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,985
Just picking up some pictures
I had developed.

237
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,702
I think there's this great one of us.

238
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,329
You could hang it in your hallway,
by the coat rack.

239
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,119
What?

240
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,584
Although the developer said
some of the pictures might not come out

241
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,504
because I used the wrong film speed
or something.

242
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:42,049
Next time, he said, to keep in mind
I should use a slower roll.

243
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,599
Pen.

244
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,471
I'll probably be another 20 minutes.
I'll come over when I'm done?

245
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,563
- Yeah, OK. Bye.
- OK, bye.

246
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,356
What?

247
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,528
She said she wanted to
hang a picture next to the coat rack.

248
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,230
So?

249
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,237
Well, she's never been to my place.
I don't have a coat rack.

250
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,782
OK, well, maybe it's some kind of
message. What did she say, exactly?

251
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,362
She said "Keep in mind,
I should use a slower roll."

252
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,501
And this bag, please.

253
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,706
Where's your bathroom?

254
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,706
I like this product and
I've used this one before.

255
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,203
- You have?
- Yeah.

256
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,164
Sorry, I tried that once
and totally broke out.

257
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,129
Really?

258
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
OK, thanks.

259
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,674
Oh, my... Are you Sigma Gammas?

260
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,470
Yeah!

261
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,347
I was president of my chapter
in West Virginia.

262
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,184
- Get away!
- I swear to God!

263
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,842
- President.
- Yeah!

264
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,349
- Wow.
- It's Tuesday.

265
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,064
You still have the lunch exchange
with the Pi Delts?

266
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,273
- Yes, we do.
- You wanna come?

267
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,153
- Can I?
- Absolutely.

268
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,810
Oh, my God! I have been
so homesick since I graduated.

269
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,065
Thank you for invitin' me!

270
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,213
No, wait. I got it. She's using
skip-sequence cipher text.

271
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,968
Take the first letter from every word
and rearrange them.

272
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,437
She's going to Russia.

273
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,190
You wanted to see me?

274
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:11,028
Sydney clearly knew I was
listening to your phone conversation.

275
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,871
She also knew that by the time I decoded
her anagram, she'd be halfway to Russia.

276
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,166
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt and assume

277
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,376
you had every intention
of reporting that fact to me.

278
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,504
I'm giving you this consideration because

279
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,714
when Sydney makes
contact with you again,

280
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,471
you're going to tell me exactly where she is.

281
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,927
If I'd known what she was doing,
I would have tried to stop her.

282
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,886
Now that she's gone, there's nothing
we can do to change her mind.

283
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,595
She's got 40 hours to find Caplan.
Why not support her, give her backup?

284
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:41,691
If it's not obvious to you by now, everything
I do is in the service of protecting Sydney.

285
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,771
For all we know,
Elsa Caplan's working with Sloane.

286
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,983
For all we know, she was
a conspirator in her husband's abduction,

287
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,364
which means Sydney
could be walking into a trap.

288
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,157
Or she isn't, and she's about
to save Neil Caplan's life.

289
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,535
This is not a debate.

290
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,870
And just because you've gotten
comfortable with my daughter,

291
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,369
it doesn't mean you should be
comfortable with me.

292
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:05,213
If you don't report your next contact
with Sydney immediately,

293
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,717
I will take action that you will regret.

294
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:31,744
OK, partners! Let's get ready to ride!

295
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,446
Hold on there! Here you go!

296
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,666
Get up! Get up!
You're no cowboy!

297
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,603
This is cowboy bar. Speak English.

298
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,012
I said we have a mutual friend.

299
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,475
I don't care.
This is "Eight Seconds" table.

300
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,401
Everyone here has ridden bull
for eight seconds. Goodbye.

301
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,914
Oh, God.

302
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,439
- Something like that?
- Something like that.

303
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:11,047
Now, champion,
who is our mutual friend?

304
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,212
Elsa Caplan.

305
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,638
- When exactly did you talk to Elsa?
- Yesterday.

306
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,394
We are old friends.

307
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:23,060
Elsa's parents were in Golokov's class
at the Red Banner with my parents.

308
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:26,398
- What do you need?
- I need a tracking device.

309
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:30,316
- Latest SVR issue.
- 50,000 cash.

310
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,821
- US bucks only.
- Deal.

311
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,907
Open the door.

312
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,587
I want to see my son.

313
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,610
Look, my family is all I care about.

314
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,991
Your family?

315
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:25,453
The one you manufactured
in order to steal classified information?

316
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:30,205
- You don't know anything about me.
- You couldn't be more wrong.

317
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,006
You're Sydney's father.
Irina Derevko was your wife.

318
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:41,046
Which makes me an expert
on someone like you.

319
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,769
It started as a job, a duty to your country,

320
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,430
but it required you to prostitute yourself.

321
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:53,060
It was a small price to pay
for serving the motherland.

322
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:57,484
At first, everything went as planned, then...

323
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,529
surely an accident, you got pregnant.

324
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,615
You considered terminating the pregnancy,
but selfishly you didn't.

325
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,282
You hoped somehow that
becoming a mother would redeem you,

326
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,833
- would absolve your guilt.
- You're wrong!

327
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:15,880
But you continued to lie and
deceive both your husband and son.

328
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,926
I am not Irina Derevko!

329
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:20,420
I probably care more
about your son than you do.

330
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,931
- That is not true!
- If I have my way,

331
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,679
you're never going to see your son again.

332
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,522
Don't you dare take my son away from me!

333
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:31,311
Don't you take my son away!

334
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,660
- Weiss.
- Weiss, it's me.

335
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,621
Sorry to call you, but Vaughn's phone
is probably tapped. Is he there?

336
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,250
Yeah. Guess who.

337
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,082
- Syd.
- Listen to me. I've got the tracker.

338
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,714
I input the codes Elsa gave us.
I found Caplan

339
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:02,801
in a building in Soria, Spain. It used to be
a software company. I'm on my way now.

340
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,346
Your father knows what you're doing and
thinks you could be walking into a trap.

341
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,843
Syd, I'm not sure he's wrong. I'm
supposed to convince you to come home.

342
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,977
I will when I have Caplan.

343
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,480
My father can't see straight when he
looks at Elsa. He only sees my mother.

344
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,186
If this ends up being a stupid mistake,
so be it. I believe her.

345
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,736
- Then I'm coming with you.
- I can't ask you to do that.

346
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:25,744
You don't have to. There's an alley in Soria
behind the Gandera Hotel. Meet me there.

347
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,034
- Jack is gonna shoot you in the face.
- Just give me a half-hour head start.

348
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,833
Tell him that she called on your phone
and you gave it to me.

349
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,995
We only have ten hours to find Caplan.

350
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:38,509
If we end up sharing a cell in federal
prison, I'm not giving you a drawer.

351
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,058
- OK, I gotta go.
- No, no.

352
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,641
You work for a travel magazine.
Just tell 'em you're travelling.

353
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,812
I wish I could.

354
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,061
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,477
- It's Will, right?
- Yeah.

356
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,568
Hey, I've seen you in the briefing rooms.
I'm kinda new around here myself too.

357
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,485
- Marshall Flinkman.
- Nice to meet you.

358
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,328
Let me ask you. They have you
parking down in the federal annexe?

359
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,200
Cos I have to walk, like, half a mile
to get here in the morning.

360
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,616
I'm exhausted by the time I get into my...

361
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,328
I shouldn't really complain.
It's the only exercise I really get.

362
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,165
Although I did see a gym...

363
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:00,538
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

364
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,086
- I gotta...
- That's all right.

365
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,097
Let's get some lunch or something.
At the CIA lunchroom.

366
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,389
- Hello.
- Hey, honey, you got a sec?

367
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up?

368
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:16,600
Are you near a computer? I've just brought
up a recipe on my laptop and it crashed.

369
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:19,361
What, do you want me to pull up a recipe?

370
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,730
- Would you mind?
- Sure. What's the website?

371
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,942
www. bouillabaissecentral. com.

372
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,322
OK, what do you need?

373
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,201
Will you tell me what kind of fish they list?

374
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:40,123
OK, hold on. Let me find it.

375
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:15,455
- Thank you for coming.
- How much time do we have?

376
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:20,583
- 12 minutes. Did you bring gear?
- Did I bring gear?!

377
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:24,207
I spoke to Weiss after we landed. Satellite's
picked up five figures inside the building.

378
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,381
- Basement level, north wing.
- Sloane could be a block from here.

379
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,345
With my mother.

380
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:33,801
- If they are, they won't surrender to us.
- I know.

381
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,021
- What about the perimeter?
- No activity.

382
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,897
Roof access will be our best bet.

383
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,474
Not that I'm a huge fan of you
disobeying the CIA, but...

384
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,772
that was pretty good,
the way you got away.

385
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,896
Thank you.

386
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,451
Yeah, it's me.

387
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,287
I need you to do something else for me.

388
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,011
Who are you, anyway?

389
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,892
And what are you, 22, 23?

390
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:10,066
What are you doing
working for a guy like Sloane?

391
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,740
What do you expect to get out of all of this?

392
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:24,210
I was sent to school in England
at a very young age.

393
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,581
Out of necessity,
one becomes self-reliant.

394
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,924
Then, perhaps, prematurely ambitious.

395
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,715
I'm like anyone, Mr Caplan.

396
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,925
What I want is that which I never had.

397
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,228
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

398
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:51,105
You wouldn't share any of that stuff with me
if you expected me to live.

399
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,817
I suggest you keep working.

400
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,733
- I'll go around.
- Syd!

401
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,921
Is Arvin Sloane in this building,
or Irina Derevko?

402
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,046
No, no, no, no,
but a blond guy just took off.

403
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,762
- Sark?
- That's him, yeah.

404
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,924
I'll go after him.

405
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,973
- What the hell's that for?
- Mr Caplan,

406
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,101
you have to listen to what I'm gonna say.

407
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:51,566
You won't want to believe me, but you have
to, or you will die in less than 60 seconds.

408
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,766
What?

409
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,274
Freeze!

410
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:09,034
Your wife, Elsa,
she works for Russian intelligence.

411
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,089
I know.

412
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,048
Six years ago the NSA recruited me.

413
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:21,180
They told me I was a target. They had
intel that I was gonna be approached.

414
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,185
- You're NSA?
- They recruited me out of Caltech.

415
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:34,643
Even though, if you ask them,
they'll deny any affiliation with me.

416
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,488
- I knew Elsa was a spy the day we met.
- OK, look.

417
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:40,656
Your wife injected you with a cyanide
caplet. We have to remove it right now.

418
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:41,572
- What?
- Listen to me.

419
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,533
- She wouldn't do that.
- I came this far because of it.

420
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,325
- She wouldn't try and kill me.
- She didn't. Her handlers did.

421
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:09,012
When the hell did she
implant me with this thing?

422
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:12,473
Right after you met. Mr Caplan, you have
less than 30 seconds before you die.

423
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,891
We have to remove this right now.

424
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,107
Give me your left wrist.

425
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,860
OK, look away.

426
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:22,024
I'm OK.

427
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,947
God!

428
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:30,241
- Oh, God! Come on.
- Hang on.

429
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,542
God!

430
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,508
Thanks.

431
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,279
No matter what you may think of me,

432
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,206
I would have done anything
to bring you home.

433
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,169
I know.

434
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:22,044
We both have a lot to figure out.

435
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:26,631
I don't think either one of us are
in a position to pass any judgments.

436
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,184
I love you.

437
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:42,354
I love you too.

438
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:55,827
I know I'm not in a position
to ask you for any favours.

439
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:01,128
But whatever you plan on doing to me,
please leave Vaughn out of it.

440
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:04,336
Vaughn will be escorting the Caplans
to Bainbridge Island.

441
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:09,635
I've granted Elsa defector status.
She is not Irina Derevko.

442
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,013
We downloaded the DNA database

443
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:18,564
Caplan decrypted from
the computer he was working on.

444
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,651
We finally have a lead
on Sloane and Derevko.

445
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:23,563
Good.

446
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,024
Sydney, if you go around me again,
I'll have you transferred.

447
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:31,364
And finding them will no longer
be part of your job description.

448
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:43,247
- I owe you an apology.
- Diane, you don't have to explain anything.

449
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,417
No, let me say this.

450
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:50,597
When Marcus first told me about SD-6,
I felt so betrayed.

451
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,849
And, in part, I blamed you for that.

452
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:00,350
Your world has these rules
that force good people to lie,

453
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,811
even to those they are closest to.

454
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:10,282
Before I could accept that,
I had to understand it.

455
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,370
I rescinded the transfer order.

456
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:18,329
Diane rescinded the order.

457
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,380
Mr Bristow! Mr Bristow!

458
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,174
- Yes, Marshall?
- Hi. Listen.

459
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,675
I was doing some spelunking on the CIA
network - mapping it, really - just for kicks,

460
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:34,259
and you can relax because "the Death Star
plans are not in the main computer".

461
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,268
Anyway, I did find
a bandwidth discrepancy.

462
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,975
At first I thought it was a Trojan virus
someone implanted on the system,

463
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,603
but unless it was locked into
a perpetually renaming RAM cache...

464
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:45,812
Marshall! Please, English.

465
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,731
I found a massive
information haemorrhage.

466
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,397
Someone without authorisation
accessed the system

467
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:54,447
and downloaded 10Gb worth of
satellite footage from Tuscany.

468
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,700
- Tuscany?
- Yeah.

469
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,247
We're on a secure system.
How did they hack in?

470
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:01,032
Well, they didn't.
It came from this office.

471
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:05,457
No, there's no way the Agency
has season tickets for the Lakers.

472
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,633
I'm telling you, four seats, 12 rows back.

473
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:12,716
You know, by this point,
I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am.

474
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,798
I'll see you at home after I get the kids.

475
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:18,640
- Good night.
- Good night, Diane.

476
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,060
It feels good.

477
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,307
Having it out in the open.

478
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,185
See you tomorrow.

479
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:35,909
By the way...

480
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:47,125
Diane! Oh, God!
