1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,252
OK, I'm in.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,215
Agent Bristow works undercover with her
father, Jack Bristow, also a double agent.

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,382
Get down.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,878
I guess we'll just have to
learn to trust each other.

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,262
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,224
My guardian angel.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,019
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,440
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,603
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,697
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,864
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,582
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

13
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,539
Bristow's mother:
formerly Russian intelligence,

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,417
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

15
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,132
Mom?

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,508
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

17
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,426
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's mother
remains unknown.

18
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,678
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

19
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,645
I want to make something
very clear to you.

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:11,153
If Sydney in any way becomes victim
to your endgame...

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,313
I will kill you.

22
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:23,910
You haven't told her what you did to her
after I disappeared, have you?

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,913
Mom says there are no explosives
or anti-intrusion devices.

24
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,207
- She says the building is clean.
- We obviously can't trust this information.

25
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,208
Unless she wants to prove herself.

26
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,341
That kind of hopeful thinking
will get you killed.

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,966
We're sending you to Madagascar
to retrieve the Bible.

28
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,095
You too.
Prepare to leave tonight.

29
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,259
Let's move it.

30
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,975
Jack, I owe you.
But why 30 pounds of Semtex?

31
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:53,309
I need you to make sure that if anyone
enters that building no one will survive.

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,398
Sydney, hold your entry.

33
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,953
That building is wired to explode.

34
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,699
I need you to take a look under the house.
Is there a crawlspace?

35
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,162
She lied to me.

36
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,078
Another child is born

37
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,287
Another race is won

38
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,585
Another dream is shattered

39
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,854
Another day's begun

40
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,015
Five weeks ago, Irina Derevko
surrendered herself to the CIA.

41
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,233
She claimed that
she wanted to cooperate,

42
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,864
to seek restitution for the crimes
she committed against the United States.

43
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,445
During the next several weeks,

44
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,319
Irina Derevko provided meaningful
intelligence to the CIA.

45
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,115
- On several occasions...
- Pardon the interruption, Agent Bristow.

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,338
Let's talk about last week,
the incident in Madagascar.

47
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,289
Before Derevko turned
herself in to the CIA,

48
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,928
as leverage, she concealed
her organisation's operations manual.

49
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,217
Last week, the CIA
discovered where it was hidden.

50
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,223
When I told Derevko that I was going in
to retrieve the manual,

51
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,350
she informed us that
the building was safe to enter.

52
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:58,399
In truth, it was a trap.
Derevko had rigged it with explosives.

53
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,646
Just as we were about
to enter the building,

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,314
an agent spotted something
on the satellite imagery.

55
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,695
- That agent was your father.
- Yes.

56
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,704
He saved my life.

57
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,607
I wanted to stand in this cell.
Just once.

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,858
You tried to warn me about her
so many times.

59
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,949
I'm so sorry that
I didn't listen to you.

60
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,083
Some things you need
to experience for yourself.

61
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:02,295
I imagine every parent tries
to protect their children from that truth.

62
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,718
I never said thank you
for saving my life.

63
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,895
We're due for a briefing at SD-6.
We should go.

64
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:41,850
Niels Haider, the so-called "Austrian
Connection", was murdered yesterday.

65
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,312
The bold nature of the hit, the complete
disregard for civilian collateral damage

66
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,444
indicates the work of the Triad.

67
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,533
Haider was Triad.
They killed one of their own?

68
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,113
Yes. We believe so.

69
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,662
The Triad?
You never mentioned them.

70
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,870
It's a loose coalition
of organised-crime entities.

71
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,875
They deal mainly in drugs and prostitution,
but over the last couple of years

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,000
they've made a significant foray
into weapons.

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,376
OK. So why did they kill Haider?

74
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,134
Because he was selling Intel to SD-6.

75
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,590
In his last communication
to our sources in Vienna,

76
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,845
Haider informed us
that the Triad was engaged in a plot

77
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,767
to deploy and develop
16 next-generation weapons.

78
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,307
Any idea what
"next-generation" refers to?

79
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,480
No, which is
a major source of concern.

80
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,563
According to the communiqué, testing
of the weapons was ahead of schedule,

81
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,322
which means they may soon
be put into the field.

82
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,564
Do we know
where these weapons are now?

83
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,073
Budapest. During the Cold War,
the Russians built a massive bomb shelter

84
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,319
underneath the magistrate's bureau.

85
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:40,574
The Triad has been using that shelter
to serve as a testing facility.

86
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,131
Your mission is to gain access to that
facility, identify the nature of the weapons,

87
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,635
retrieve the specs and test data
off the central server,

88
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,723
then proceed to the R & D lab
and photograph the weapons.

89
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,478
So that SD-6 can engineer the weapons
for themselves.

90
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,099
- Which we won't let happen.
- OK.

91
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,762
I'll confer with your father
about your countermission.

92
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,816
My father?

93
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,943
He didn't tell you?

94
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,032
Based on your father's instincts
in the Madagascar incident,

95
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,237
Devlin gave him operational approval.

96
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,671
When you and I were
approaching that building

97
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,340
Ops was monitoring our progress
via sat radar scan.

98
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,547
Now, at the last moment,
your father switched to infrared,

99
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,715
which is how he saw the explosives.

100
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,844
We don't have routine satellite coverage
over Madagascar.

101
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,148
One had to be retasked. Now,
the closest one was over the Indian Ocean.

102
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,775
Yet your father specifically requested
the one over the South Atlantic,

103
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,112
which of the two is the only one
that has infrared capability.

104
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,650
He wanted to account
for every possibility.

105
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,617
Probably.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,284
Or it's possible that he already knew
there would be explosives at that entrance.

107
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,786
I don't see how.

108
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,131
He never trusted
my mother's motives, but he...

109
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,967
You think my father
wired that entrance?

110
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,306
To set up my mother?

111
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,483
We were nearly killed.

112
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,561
- I know.
- If there'd been comms interference...

113
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,227
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Meaning what?

114
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,437
- Russek.
- Russek?

115
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,908
- Your father set him up.
- I was a prisoner.

116
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,693
- Sloane was about to have me executed.
- I don't know why you deny this possibility.

117
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,991
I understand that your authority
has been superseded by my father

118
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,834
and that maybe you feel irrelevant.

119
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,751
But he saved our lives.
Remember that.

120
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,589
I will wait to hear from you.

121
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,165
- Hey.
- Hey.

122
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,671
- Hi, you look fabulous.
- So do you.

123
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,047
- I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.

124
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,045
- Where did you find all these people?
- Can you believe it?

125
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,304
- I invite a hundred, thinking 70 will show.
- You said you were worried.

126
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,633
- He tells his entire NA meeting.
- They're good people.

127
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,309
I'm sure they're fantastic. But we make
90 per cent of our profits from the bar.

128
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,306
They don't drink.

129
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,775
Baby girl, where you at?

130
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,352
Got no strings,
got men attached

131
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,279
Can't stop that feelin' for long, no

132
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,741
You makin' dogs wanna beg

133
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,117
Breaking them off your fancy legs

134
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:09,282
But they make you feel
right at home now

135
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,873
See, all these illusions
just take us too long

136
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,049
And I want it bad

137
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,551
Because you walk pretty, because
you talk pretty, cos you make me sick

138
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:25,099
And I'm not leavin' till you're leavin'

139
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,348
Oh I swear there's something
when she's pumpin', asking for a raise

140
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,182
Does she want me to carry her home...

141
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,328
Your plane leaves for Budapest in an hour.
You'll meet Dixon at the airport.

142
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,540
When you get into the Triad's testing
facility, you'll log onto their computer.

143
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,416
Sloane expects you
to disable the firewall

144
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,128
so SD-6 can hack in and directly download
the specs for the next-gen weapons.

145
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,793
Once you've accessed the computer, you'll
contact the CIA and give us the IP address.

146
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,128
We'll download the specs.

147
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,547
Here. Memorise this number.

148
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,764
This is the IP address
you'll give Dixon.

149
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,719
He'll think he's accessing the Triad's
computer, but he'll be on a CIA server.

150
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,853
We've set up some dummy files
for him to download.

151
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,396
Anything else?

152
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:22,736
Sydney, Washington has made a decision
regarding your mother.

153
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:26,195
What she did to you invalidated
her agreement with the CIA.

154
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,288
The government is pressing charges.

155
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,209
They're going to seek
the death penalty.

156
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:48,299
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, Craig. What're you doing in LA?

157
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,556
Madagascar customs picked up
a US national transporting explosives.

158
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,103
They brought him to LA
and I'm baby-sitting him to New York.

159
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,477
Listen, I heard about Weiss.
How's he doing?

160
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,609
It was rough,
but they say he's gonna be OK,

161
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,689
which is more than I can say
about the nursing staff.

162
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,154
Wait till he gets home.
He's gonna be insufferable.

163
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,070
- Listen, I have to...
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go.

164
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,653
I'll be back next month.
I wanna play some ball.

165
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:15,086
- Why? You think you're ready for this?
- That's cute, that's cute.

166
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,795
Craig. The guy with the explosives,
was it Semtex?

167
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,299
- Yeah.
- Vintage Russian stuff?

168
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,631
- Yeah, that's right. How'd you know that?
- And he's here in LA?

169
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,133
- For the next two hours.
- I have to talk to him.

170
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,221
He's with me.

171
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,368
Manolo Desouza.
I'm Agent Vaughn.

172
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,783
Has anyone offered you a drink?

173
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,878
I'm sure I could find you a soda.

174
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,795
This is not a good time
to be a terrorist, Manolo.

175
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,376
Now, a couple of years ago and you
would have had some civil rights.

176
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,050
Now we just throw you in a cell.
No attorney. No due process.

177
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,894
So who were you working for?

178
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,356
OK.

179
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,941
In that case we'll just let
the pictures tell the story.

180
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,646
The satellite photos from four days ago
showing you rigging a plantation building

181
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,825
in the jungle near Sambava.

182
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,777
Those photos are all we need
to put you away for the rest of your life.

183
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,328
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

184
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,990
Do you want that soda?

185
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,004
I was working for you,
you son of a bitch.

186
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,220
CIA.

187
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,767
- Through what office?
- My contact was Jack Bristow.

188
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:10,443
You tell that bastard
I'm not taking the fall on this.

189
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,578
- Test. One, two, three.
- Good.

190
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,674
Once you disable the network firewall
I'll download the database

191
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,879
while you access the viewing room
and take photos of the weapons.

192
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:35,760
The guards change shift at noon.
That gives you ten minutes to get in place.

193
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,806
- How do I look?
- Lip gloss.

194
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,352
What I have here is
a ordinary tube of lip gloss.

195
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,276
Let's say that you're at the beach
and your lips are feeling a little...

196
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,730
"My lips are chafed." Or you're possibly
on a date, it's the end of the night,

197
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:52,235
you're doing some smooching,
you want your lips to be supple and you...

198
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,114
Pistachio.
Now, that's my favourite flavour.

199
00:15:55,205 --> 00:16:01,741
But you flip it over, and it's a miniature
camera with compressed-air injector.

200
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:06,083
Take a look. Go ahead and smile
cos you're on TV. And...

201
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,841
Anyway, this... I...
There's three cameras inside the tube.

202
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,264
I wanted to make four, but then there
wouldn't be room for the actual lip gloss.

203
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,432
You know,
I'll make you a fresh one.

204
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,453
- So, you're making a family tree?
- It's a present for my grandparents.

205
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,113
They're both from Budapest,
but they lost everything in the war.

206
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,495
Well, I'm certain you will find
the documentation of their marriage.

207
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,336
And you should be able to find
their registration of birth.

208
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,045
Our records are very complete
dating back to 1895.

209
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,348
Older than that,
unfortunately, not so thorough.

210
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,760
Good work, Syd.

211
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:10,104
Birth records are here. Over there,
documentation of marriage and death.

212
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,696
The correlation is unintended.
Please.

213
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,116
Eight. Two. Four.

214
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,371
One problem.
All documents are in Hungarian.

215
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,129
How do you expect
to know what they're saying?

216
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,585
- That's good.
- My grandparents taught me.

217
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,388
All right, Syd, you're clear.

218
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:53,192
The combination is eight, two,
four, zero, two.

219
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,137
- Stand by, Dixon, I'm going radio silent.
- OK, Syd. Standing by.

220
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,178
Mountaineer in position.
Come in, Boot Camp.

221
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,301
Copy that, Mountaineer.

222
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,568
Stand by for IP address,
Boot Camp.

223
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,574
Boot Camp.

224
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:47,369
IP address is 199.181.134.104.

225
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,497
I've opened port 47.

226
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:54,717
Good work, Mountaineer. Go ahead
and give the dummy IP to Dixon.

227
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,718
- See you at home.
- Copy that.

228
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:07,559
Dixon, I've disabled the firewall.
The IP address is 259.10.3.179.

229
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,809
Good work, Syd.

230
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,936
Now go get some pictures
of the weapons and we're outta here.

231
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,313
The viewing room is around
the corner to your left.

232
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,027
Door marked <i>"kutatoterem".</i>

233
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,026
Copy that.

234
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,619
Clear to exit.

235
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,425
OK. Go.

236
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,766
Sydney, you've got company.
Two guards coming on your left.

237
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,390
16 next-generation weapons.

238
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,257
We had no idea that the 16
next-generation weapons

239
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,138
would turn out to be children.

240
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,931
They're training as sleeper agents?

241
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,884
That appears to be the case.
See, the best spies have certain traits.

242
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,018
Proficiency with numbers,
three-dimensional thinking,

243
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,648
creative problem-solving.

244
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,647
These abilities are all in evidence
as early as five years old.

245
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:23,731
This is footage that we downloaded
from the Triad computer.

246
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,535
Every first-grader in the European Union
takes a standardised test.

247
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,372
A few years ago the Triad acquired
the company doing the testing

248
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:34,075
and added a series of questions designed
to locate children with these traits.

249
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,039
This year, 28 children were indicated.
Their parents were sent letters

250
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,665
inviting them to participate
in a month-long achievement programme.

251
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,134
16 accepted.

252
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,792
Six-year-olds acquire knowledge
at an incredible rate.

253
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:50,130
So the basic skills of marksmanship,
linguistics, visual-verbal cue recognition,

254
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,062
it can all be taught
in a matter of weeks.

255
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,266
- Who is he?
- We're still working on that.

256
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,813
So what happens to these kids
at the end of the month?

257
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,856
Triad sends them home
with the intent that, when they're grown,

258
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,520
they will contact these kids
and send them out in the field.

259
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,700
There was a rumour that the KGB
began developing a similar programme

260
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:11,653
back in the '80s,
but we never confirmed it.

261
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,120
Before these kids are sent home,
their memories are reset?

262
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:19,998
Yeah. That's right. They remember nothing
except that it was extremely satisfying.

263
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,778
Someone forged my wife's name in the
registry at her favourite bed and breakfast.

264
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,938
Weeks after her death.

265
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,993
My concern is that
it's intended to be a message.

266
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,451
You have enemies, Arvin.

267
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,541
Clearly one of them is trying
to leverage your grief.

268
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,005
It's not my grief.

269
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,007
It's my guilt.

270
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,971
Cancer didn't kill Emily, Jack.

271
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,839
Emily's doctor told us
that her cancer was in remission.

272
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:21,233
That very day, the Alliance told me
that I was being considered for partner,

273
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,725
but that there was a problem.

274
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,821
Somehow Emily had learned that...

275
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,902
Well, she learned about
my association with SD-6.

276
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,236
She didn't know the truth.

277
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:38,537
In fact, she assumed the lie
that we're a branch of the CIA.

278
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:48,123
Despite that, the Alliance decided to make
my promotion contingent on Emily's death.

279
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,553
My choice was an easy one.

280
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:56,978
I wasn't about to kill my wife.
Emily was not a bargaining chip.

281
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,605
Then I talked to her doctor,

282
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:11,445
and I was persuaded that...
despite this temporary remission,

283
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,950
that Emily's lymphoma would return

284
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,083
and that it would slowly
and painfully kill her.

285
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,954
She had already
suffered so much, Jack.

286
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:28,713
The thought of her succumbing
to this merciless illness

287
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,135
or being killed by the Alliance...

288
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:43,306
So I dissolved sodium morphate
in a glass of red wine.

289
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,602
The wine put her to sleep.

290
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,444
The sodium morphate
then caused a heart attack.

291
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,193
She didn't suffer.

292
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,788
I will find out who's doing this.

293
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,376
Jack.

294
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,217
See who else was being
considered for partnership.

295
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,598
I was given a seat at the table.

296
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:24,980
That means someone else was not.

297
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:29,267
Well, I have this new friend
on my work detail - Tommy Marijuana.

298
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:33,312
We call him that because there's Tommy
Marijuana and Tommy Crystal Meth.

299
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:37,619
Tommy Marijuana thinks that we're always
the person that we were in sixth grade.

300
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,743
Sixth grade was
an awkward phase for me.

301
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,998
- Oh, come on. You, awkward?
- Yeah. I had big teeth and little eyes

302
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,619
and I was always a foot taller than
everyone else, so I sort of hunched over.

303
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,871
I wish I could have seen that.

304
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,539
I don't know, when I was in sixth grade,
I was just sort of anonymous.

305
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,885
You know, you had the smart kid
and the funny kid and the good athlete.

306
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,296
And I was just Will.

307
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,818
They're putting my mom on trial.

308
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,989
They're gonna ask
for the death penalty.

309
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,198
The only way I'm able to deal with it

310
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:21,199
is to tell myself
that woman was never really my mother.

311
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,292
The irony is, since she's been back,

312
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:31,621
my father and I are closer
than we've ever been.

313
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:42,431
It's Vaughn. I have to go.

314
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,600
Hey, Vaughn.
That guy with the Semtex, Desouza.

315
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,602
- Are we supposed to be looking into that?
- Excuse me?

316
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,316
I'm just wondering, is that our case,
or were you pursuing it independently?

317
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,529
I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:26:56,616 --> 00:27:00,281
Daily situation report says the guy was
here yesterday on a transfer order.

319
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,695
You're listed as visiting him.

320
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,874
Vaughn?

321
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,626
No, it's not our case.

322
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,761
- Hello, Sydney.
- Dad. Hi.

323
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,468
- Agent Vaughn contacted you?
- Yeah.

324
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,646
Have we identified the man
from Budapest with the children?

325
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,356
Yes. Valery Kholokov.

326
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,268
- It's Kholokov?
- You've heard of him?

327
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,112
Yeah. He used to run
KGB's psych ops division.

328
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:38,067
Mind-control experiments, psychoactive
drugs. I thought he was dead.

329
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:42,155
Well, so did we. But apparently after the
KGB dissolved he went over to the Triad.

330
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:45,614
A facial-recognition scanner at the airport
in Buenos Aires identified him yesterday.

331
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,245
- What's he doing in Buenos Aires?
- He has a house there.

332
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,078
The project in Budapest is completed.

333
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,582
- A team is raiding that facility as we speak.
- The children have all returned home.

334
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,797
We have surveillance teams
monitoring each of them.

335
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,292
If the Triad ever makes contact,
we'll intercede.

336
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,585
We need to grab Kholokov.

337
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,634
See how many other kids he's
done this to - who they are, where they are.

338
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,133
- There's a team prepping now.
- Good. I wanna go with them.

339
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:09,643
No. Sending you to Buenos Aires
would be an unnecessary risk.

340
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,147
Kholokov has a private security detail.
External and internal alarm systems...

341
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:17,481
Dad, when I signed up with SD-6,
I wanted to join.

342
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:22,281
When I found out the truth...
I mean, these kids...

343
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:29,416
I know what it's like to be used.
I'm going to Buenos Aires.

344
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,831
The team leaves in 12 hours.

345
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,792
OK. Anything else?

346
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,250
That's all.

347
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,836
I'm going to pack.

348
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,435
I saw Desouza.

349
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:56,308
He told me that you hired him
to rig those explosives.

350
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:01,656
Irina Derevko would eagerly destroy
all of our lives.

351
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:06,652
I'm not a big fan either.
It still doesn't justify what you did.

352
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,828
You do good work,
Agent Vaughn.

353
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,166
But your consistent shortcoming,
and you should know this,

354
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,503
is your naive sense of morality.

355
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,749
Evil must be eliminated
by whatever means necessary.

356
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,298
- I don't think Sydney would agree.
- Sydney...

357
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,343
will never know about what I've done.

358
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,806
You betrayed her trust.

359
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,848
I won't.
Now, she should hear it from you.

360
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:37,316
But if you don't tell her,
I promise you, I will.

361
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,941
- Yes, sir?
- Why is my security system disabled?

362
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,616
It was disengaged on site, sir,
ten minutes ago.

363
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,408
I'll put the system back on line, sir.

364
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,323
Sir, is everything OK?

365
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,972
I'm going in.

366
00:30:55,063 --> 00:31:00,306
- The guard's been sedated.
- Copy that, Mountaineer.

367
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:17,433
I make four guards in the courtyard.
Kholokov just went inside.

368
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,936
Get into position.
I'm heading to the junction box.

369
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,491
You take the guards.
I got Kholokov.

370
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,368
On my signal.

371
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,915
And that's in three.

372
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,201
Two. One.

373
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,167
Go.

374
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:52,195
- You good?
- Yeah. It's him. It's Kholokov.

375
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,693
Good work. Nice job.

376
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,657
- You want me to hypnotise you?
- I want you to take me back

377
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,243
to whenever it was I first saw that puzzle.

378
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:50,461
But you say you don't remember
seeing that puzzle before.

379
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:55,376
- I must have.
- Agent Bristow, I've seen your profile.

380
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,799
Your spatial intelligence is stellar. It's no
surprise that you could solve the puzzle.

381
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:03,971
But I wasn't solving it. When I was
standing there, staring at that puzzle,

382
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,767
it was like I remembered
where every piece belonged.

383
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,060
There wasn't any thought involved.

384
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,485
You said the KGB developed
a similar project.

385
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:18,235
It's possible that my mother knew
the techniques and maybe she...

386
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,402
Agent Bristow.

387
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:25,454
If you are looking to uncover a trauma,
then I need to warn you.

388
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:30,702
Hypnotic regression can trigger severe
nightmares, flashbacks, acute depression.

389
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,917
Understand that to do what I do -
maintain my cover at SD-6 -

390
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,419
I compartmentalise a lot.

391
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,211
But the idea that I might have been
programmed to be a spy -

392
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,678
I can't tuck that away.

393
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,888
I need to know what happened to me.

394
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:57,648
Excuse me, sir. I analysed the wine.
Is this a good time?

395
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:07,619
There's no fingerprints on the glass.
The wine is a '99 Hadley Cabernet Franc.

396
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,035
An unremarkable vintage.

397
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:15,209
What is remarkable is what I extracted
from inside the wine.

398
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,672
I was so surprised I redid the test.

399
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,177
But I'm certain it's VTX.

400
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:26,133
A calcium-based antidote -
extremely scarce.

401
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,307
Antidote to what?

402
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,851
Mainly heart-attack-inducing toxins.

403
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,143
Kurtotic acid, sodium morphate.

404
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:38,112
VTX simulates death.
It slows the lungs, nearly stops the heart,

405
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:42,610
which is how it prevents the poisons
from causing cardiac arrest.

406
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:47,945
And then when the VTX is metabolised,
the body returns to normal.

407
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:55,046
So if someone who was poisoned
by sodium morphate were given VTX,

408
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,085
they would appear to die.

409
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:02,221
Yes, sir. Well, assuming
they had no other heart conditions,

410
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:06,089
in eight to twelve hours,
they would be just fine.

411
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:11,725
I'm going to count back from three.

412
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,978
When I get to one, I want you
to tell me where you are.

413
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,230
Three.

414
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,691
Two.

415
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,444
One.

416
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,042
Where are you, Sydney?

417
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,880
It's me.

418
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,099
In my room,

419
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:54,519
when I was little.

420
00:37:56,151 --> 00:38:01,774
Tell me if you see anything that resembles
the puzzles we're looking for.

421
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,651
I'm taking...
I'm taking care of her...

422
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:10,114
I'm taking care of her for Christmas.
That'll be soon.

423
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:14,074
Christmas... Christmas...
Christmas is all set.

424
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,128
Yes, I see it.

425
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:32,216
Nothing can happen to you now, Sydney.
You're safe.

426
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,269
Sydney, I want you to listen to me.

427
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,566
Just breathe.

428
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:43,524
Breathe. Focus on the puzzle.

429
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,483
Focus on the puzzle.

430
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,653
Good, Sydney.

431
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,825
Very good.

432
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:12,883
Look around you.

433
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,978
Tell me who else is in the room.

434
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,820
Good work, Sydney.

435
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,747
Sydney, get in.

436
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,676
What is it?

437
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:58,846
I have this memory
from when I was six years old.

438
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,060
My mother had just died
in a car accident.

439
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:10,281
I felt so scared. You were never home,
so who was gonna take care of me?

440
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:15,326
Then I overheard you talking.
You were in your study, on the phone.

441
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,708
You were talking
about Christmas, about me.

442
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,957
You were taking care
of my Christmas presents.

443
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:29,628
Suddenly, I felt so safe.

444
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,587
You were taking care of me.

445
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:36,807
That memory is a lie.

446
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,468
- You weren't talking about that at all.
- Sydney...

447
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:43,562
I've seen the footage,
mom's briefings with her KGB handler.

448
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,522
She was sent here
for one specific purpose.

449
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:50,776
To steal information from you about
a project you were developing for the CIA.

450
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:57,616
An operation to train children
to be American spies.

451
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,420
Project Christmas.

452
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:08,542
Ever since Mom came back, you were
afraid she'd figure out what you did to me.

453
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:14,424
You weren't trying to protect me from her.
You were trying to protect your secret.

454
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:19,473
So the first opportunity you had,
you set her up.

455
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,970
- In Madagascar.
- Sydney.

456
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:26,727
- Understand something...
- No, Dad, you understand something.

457
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,737
You took away my choices in life.

458
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,778
You programmed me to be a spy.

459
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:39,115
I will never forgive you for this.

460
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:49,923
I would teach my feet to fly

461
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,888
Oh, I wish I had a river

462
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,895
I could skate away on

463
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:11,275
I made my baby say goodbye

464
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,246
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees

465
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:31,249
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace

466
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,964
I wish I had a river

467
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:42,179
I could skate away on
