1
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:20,692
Do you have a problem with all holidays?

2
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:21,162
No.

3
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,153
So you're fine with, let's say, Arbor Day?

4
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,809
I'm not that into celebrating, that's all.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,704
- That's all? It's --
- What's going on?

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,125
Your sister doesn't want to celebrate her own birthday.

7
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:29,972
When?

8
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,629
In two days -- you don't know about this either?

9
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:32,502
Get out!

10
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,303
I don't even know if it is my birthday.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,140
In the orphanage, they just felt bad

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,520
because I was the only kid who didn't know when I was born.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,980
So the sisters just picked a date.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,881
Yeah, day after tomorrow.

15
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,157
We could go bowling and rent some lanes.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,288
We've been through bowling.

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,803
Go-carts, though, could be really good.

18
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:46,792
Bar hopping.

19
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:48,638
Bar hopping, or a ragin' house party.

20
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:49,830
Whoo! What's up?

21
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:52,298
Thank you, but I don't want to do anything.

22
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,573
- Come on.
- Hey, guys.

23
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,131
Are you guys planning a party?

24
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,071
There's no party.

25
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:59,112
'Cause I'm a really good DJ, if you need, uh...

26
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:00,758
Anyway, speaking of parties,

27
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:03,319
Sloane's having one in the briefing room now.

28
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:08,028
As most of you know, when the Alliance was dismantled four years ago,

29
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:10,954
the CIA came into possession of a multitude of artifacts,

30
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,420
files, and intels.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,055
Among the items retrieved was the Blackwell index.

32
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,569
Blackwell? What is this, a worst-dressed list?

33
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,801
Damien Blackwell, head of the Gouse Crime Syndicate.

34
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:23,458
He's believed to have compiled incriminating information

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,209
on corporate heads, government officials,

36
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,439
common criminals -- essentially a master blackmail list

37
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:30,477
encoded into a mobile terminal.

38
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,333
The Alliance was never able to read the index

39
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,132
during the six months it was in their possession.

40
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:39,267
It was inciphered using 4,096-bit encryption.

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,193
Wow. I mean, even with current technology,

42
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,278
that would take like 20 years to decipher,

43
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,224
and that's with a supercomputer working on it 24/7.

44
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,219
Needless to say, the CIA was unsuccessful in its decryption efforts.

45
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,588
Why is this an issue now?

46
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:56,088
Last night the index was stolen from the CIA research station in Sarajevo.

47
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,260
Left three of our analysts dead.

48
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,614
No leads on who stole it?

49
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:08,415
No, it was a clean job. In and out within two minutes.

50
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,817
Why steal something you can't read?

51
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,617
The decoder disk has been located.

52
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:16,226
Two weeks ago, Damien Blackwell's concealed base of operation

53
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:18,885
was identified and raided by french authorities.

54
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:21,684
They seized most of his possessions as evidence,

55
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,483
including a mini disk.

56
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,989
We believe this to be the decoder.

57
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:28,551
Our only logical recourse is to go after the decoder.

58
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:30,302
Without it, the index is useless.

59
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,434
Do the french know what they have?

60
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,188
No. Of course we would rather obtain it through legal channels.

61
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,512
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be an option right now.

62
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:40,028
Wait a minute. You want us to steal the decoder from french police?

63
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,351
Right now it's being housed in the Paris prefecture.

64
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,864
Sydney, figure out a way to get yourself arrested.

65
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,046
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,800
We got out of the briefing early. Did Sloane approve your trip?

67
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:26,361
Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:27,637
Any word on your uncle?

69
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,366
Yeah, I spoke to my mom this morning.

70
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,117
Apparently this last stroke hit him pretty hard.

71
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,631
He hasn't regained consciousness.

72
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,329
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,523
Are you gonna be okay?

74
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:39,420
Yeah. I'm fine.

75
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,283
It's just that, you know, when my dad died,

76
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,226
my uncle made all these promises about

77
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,695
being there for me and my mother, and he wasn't -- ever.

78
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:52,607
I'm not sure how I feel about seeing him again, you know.

79
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,721
I wish I could go with you.

80
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,839
I know.

81
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,645
I'll call you when I land.

82
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:19,400
Sydney.

84
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,634
We need to talk.

85
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,246
Okay, it's safe to talk here.

86
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,507
Okay.

87
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,588
I've been cross-checking Sloane's facts,

88
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,150
vetting the intel he's given us.

89
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,592
Director chase encouraged us to watch Sloane.

90
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:41,962
That's what I've been doing.

91
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,896
I'm not going to make the same mistake I did at SD-6,

92
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,172
blindly following that man's orders.

93
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,726
What has he done now?

94
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,037
Sloane just said he had no leads

95
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,601
on who stole the index out of that research station in Sarajevo.

96
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:57,256
Yeah?

97
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:00,497
Look familiar?

98
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,911
Miles Devereaux, former Alliance member. Head of operations, SD-3.

99
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:10,048
Sloane contacted him. 40 minutes after the Blackwell index was stolen.

100
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,943
Before  Langley had even discovered the theft.

101
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:12,838
How do you know?

102
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:16,488
I've got a tap on Sloane's home line.

103
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,049
Dixon --

104
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:21,187
The call was encrypted, but I traced it to a hotel in Sarajevo.

105
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,272
I hacked into the hotel's CCTV feed.

106
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,976
That's where I found this.

107
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:29,209
You think Sloane is working with Devereaux?

108
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,612
I think Sloane tasked us to steal the decoder for one reason --

109
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,078
so he and Devereaux could crack the index

110
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,496
and  retrieve the blackmail files for themselves.

111
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,868
That's why he lied about having no leads.

112
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,316
He's using us...

113
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:44,822
again.

114
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:51,017
And that's not something I'm gonna let him do.

115
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,005
So what you're telling me

116
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,190
is that you've been illegally tapping your superior's phone.

117
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,990
Keeping an eye on Sloane was a mandate,

118
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,694
one that you specifically charged me with.

119
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,053
I didn't condone breaking federal laws to do it.

120
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:42,695
Since SD-6, Sloane has wanted he Blackwell index.

121
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,155
And now he's coincidentally made contact

122
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,482
with Devereaux in Sarajevo minutes after the theft?

123
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,806
Perhaps he's pursuing information on who stole it.

124
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,559
By contacting a former Alliance member?

125
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:54,785
Sloane is free to contact old associates.

126
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:57,778
It's one of the reasons why he was appointed head of the task force.

127
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,291
He lied to us about having no leads.

128
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:02,757
Perhaps none of the leads proved useful.

129
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,988
Irrational explanations.

130
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,777
He tasked us to steal the decoder from police custody.

131
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,431
Does this add up for you? Are you listening to me?

132
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,418
I'm aware of the mission to retrieve the decoder, mr. Dixon.

133
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:18,220
I authorized it myself.

134
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,210
Now I appreciate your concern,

135
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,087
but these accusations are based on circumstantial evidence,

136
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:25,299
so unless you have something else to give me,

137
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:28,911
I would suggest you pull that phone tap.

138
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,585
I know you want him to be guilty. I've been there.

139
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,571
This is not about what he did to Diane.

140
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,941
Of course it is.

141
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:38,923
It is for me.

142
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:42,550
But you're the one who reminded me why we're here --

143
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,344
to do the right thing.

144
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,880
Maybe this time director Chase is right.

145
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,040
Maybe we should just let it go.

146
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,460
Chase refuses to see the truth.

147
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,595
Sydney, you know I never do this. I'm asking you for me.

148
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:02,862
Please, I need your help.

149
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,586
You don't have to stand in the dark, you know.

150
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,240
Oh, uh, I didn't want to, uh...

151
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,706
The light won't bother David.

152
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,821
You must be Bill.

153
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:33,868
Why would you say that?

154
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,526
Your uncle said you were coming to see him.

155
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,356
He used to talk about you a lot before he had the stroke.

156
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:40,822
Bill was my father. He's dead.

157
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,765
Oh. My mistake.

158
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:46,496
Older people get confused sometimes, you know,

159
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,297
and they get the past and the present mixed up.

160
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:54,131
- Was it recent?
- No, he died in 1979.

161
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:58,586
- I'm Michael.
- I'm Rosemary.

162
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,855
Nice to meet you.

163
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:02,418
I do the 3:00 and the 10:00 rounds in this wing.

164
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,360
Did you come a long way?

165
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:06,637
Los Angeles. I would have come to visit sooner, but...

166
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,041
Well, you're here now.

167
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:13,104
That's what's important.

168
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,602
I reviewed your recon analysis report.

169
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,639
Your extraction plan needs some work.

170
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,097
Really? I thought --

171
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,945
You're assuming that everything is going right.

172
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,412
No, I allowed for contingencies.

173
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,355
Exiting the building, if anything happens,

174
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,725
it's the perimeter that poses the greatest problem.

175
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,142
Okay, I'll work up a new scenario.

176
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:35,848
Good. You have all our resources at your disposal, Weiss.

177
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,027
Why don't you use them?

178
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:39,876
The last thing we need is an international incident.

179
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:40,627
Yes, sir.

180
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,140
Rest of the specs look great.

181
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:42,985
Well, thank you.

182
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,500
I take it you'll have no problem bringing Nadia up to speed.

183
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,537
Yeah. I already did last night.

184
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,608
Excuse me?

185
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:54,250
Uh, we were working. We work late. We actually like it.

186
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,859
There were other peop-- Jack was here.

187
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,039
Are you finished?

188
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,027
Have the report on my desk in an hour.

189
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,624
Impress me.

190
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,018
Jack, I didn't realize you were waiting.

191
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,098
I heard the forensic reports from Sarajevo were in.

192
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,754
I'm curious -- was Langley able to generate any new leads?

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,697
No.

194
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,588
They have nothing as far as the theft is concerned.

195
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,998
Then I'm assuming our agenda remains the same.

196
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,132
Oh, yes. We obtain the decoder.

197
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,835
I'll coordinate transport now.

198
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,678
Jack, one more thing.

199
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:32,146
Sydney was supposed to hand me her ops report 15 minutes ago.

200
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,750
Any  idea where she might be?

201
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:38,880
No. I imagine she's somewhere working out the details.

202
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:43,065
I used to meet Vaughn like this

203
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:45,435
when he was my handler at SD-6.

204
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,603
Must have been romantic.

205
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,640
Micro CD burner.

206
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,720
Where'd you get it?

207
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,805
I borrowed it from Marshall's office.

208
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,984
With a few adjustments,

209
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,308
it'll make a corrupted copy of the decoder disk.

210
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,919
That'll be what we give to Sloane. Keep the real one safe.

211
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,718
So if Sloane follows protocol and hands it over to the CIA...

212
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:06,833
No harm done. But if he tries using it, he'll be sorely disappointed.

213
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,059
We'll have to watch and see.

214
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:14,622
What?

215
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:19,555
I'm just now realizing how complicated your life was at SD-6.

216
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,230
I appreciate you doing this.

217
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:25,782
I know you have your reservations.

218
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:31,497
It's just that things are a little different now since Nadia.

219
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:33,127
He's her father.

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,832
I know this may seem weird,

221
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,314
but I hope for her sake that we're wrong.

222
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:41,931
You're under arrest.

223
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,996
It's about time.

224
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,697
Amanda Peterson, right?

225
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,480
My name is Richard Zachary, your legal counsel

226
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,706
appointed by the american embassy.

227
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,486
Great.

228
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,564
I see you've been enjoying your stay in Paris.

229
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,884
It's been swell.

230
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,096
Okay, got it.

231
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,848
Outrigger, looping the feed on your call.

232
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:29,225
Vandalism, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer.

233
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:30,970
These are serious charges.

234
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:31,626
So?

235
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:34,808
So let's see about getting you out of here.

236
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,113
- The CD burner.
- Thanks, Dixon.

237
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:43,865
Good luck.

238
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,833
Phoenix signing in.

239
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:53,159
Copy. We have you. It's the third door on the left.

240
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:03,369
Make it quick. You're about to have company.

241
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:11,873
I'm in.

242
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:14,007
Okay, plot number 430.

243
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,205
Phoenix, report. Did you get the decoder?

244
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:49,296
Negative. Moving to check the rest of the inventory.

245
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,332
Phoenix, we lost visual.

246
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:00,856
Still searching for the decoder.

247
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,299
Phoenix, you've got incoming.

248
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:05,241
Get out of there now.

249
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,094
Okay. I just found the disk.

250
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,348
Outrigger, abort. Go to plan "B."

251
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:21,789
Copy that.

252
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,635
Phoenix, we're moving to alternate extraction.

253
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:25,721
Get to the roof immediately.

254
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,960
Base, plan "b" better be in effect!

255
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:14,256
I checked with Marshall.

256
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,865
The decoder's still in analysis.

257
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,235
Sloane's following protocol.

258
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,512
No. Since we got back from Paris,

259
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,217
he's made more than a dozen calls from a secure line in his home.

260
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:23,541
Were you able to trace the calls?

261
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,054
They were routed through relay stations,

262
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,473
but I narrowed them down to a number in Brussels.

263
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,398
Syd, we need to get into Sloane's house.

264
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,329
If we could copy the encryption key from his secure phone,

265
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:36,179
we could crack the calls to gain access to his conversations.

266
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,265
Yeah, but how?

267
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:40,886
Sydney, a word.

268
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,606
My office.

269
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:50,515
I'm sure I don't have to inform you of the consequences

270
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,029
had either of you been apprehended by the french police.

271
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,430
With all due respect, we weren't.

272
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:58,469
Sydney, you took a long time in the evidence room.

273
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,075
I assume you read my debrief.

274
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,924
The decoder disk was misfiled. I had to search the rest of the inventory.

275
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:06,135
During which time, Nadia and Weiss lost visual contact with you.

276
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,075
Was that my fault?

277
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,734
Once you were out of view of the security camera,

278
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,630
you just happened to be able to locate the decoder disk?

279
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:13,809
That's correct.

280
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:23,584
Perhaps I shouldn't,

281
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,182
but I expect better from you.

282
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,629
This might not be the best time, but I thought you should know.

283
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:48,938
Today's Nadia's birthday.

284
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,154
She says she doesn't want to celebrate,

285
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,574
but maybe she'd change her mind if the invitation came from you.

286
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,131
Actually, I didn't know when --

287
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,820
Well, what do you think she might like?

288
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:05,518
Something simple.

289
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,955
Family dinner, maybe.

290
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,517
At your house.

291
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,505
That's a good idea.

292
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:15,913
Thank you.

293
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,158
Think your uncle wants to listen to the game?

294
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:39,671
I don't know, I'm not sure he was much of a basketball fan.

295
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,638
Do you think he can hear it?

296
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,960
Well, you never know.

297
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,377
I've known people to come out of comas,

298
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,034
and when you ask them what did it,

299
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:50,638
lots of times they say that it was the sound of a loved one's voice

300
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,532
that  guided them back.

301
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:56,906
Patients' hands get so dry.

302
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,294
Were you and your uncle close?

303
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,132
No, not really.

304
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,740
Didn't see him much at all after my father died.

305
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,825
He must have been a good man, your father.

306
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:08,503
Sometimes he's all David would talk about.

307
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,298
Oh. You know what?

308
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,947
David was keeping something for him.

309
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,900
For who, my father?

310
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,890
I think so. Maybe he wasn't clear,

311
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,215
but he said it was for Bill when he came back.

312
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,667
I suppose you should have it.

313
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,071
What do you think?

314
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:01,822
It's pretty. It's perfect, actually.

315
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,763
Thanks.

316
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,612
Sure. You can borrow that necklace anytime.

317
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:07,009
I don't mean that. Well, that too.

318
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:10,315
I mean tonight, the party.

319
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:12,752
Really?

320
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,975
Because you seemed a little annoyed when I told your dad about your birthday.

321
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:21,300
I was, but the idea of being with family --

322
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,286
it feels better than I thought.

323
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:26,716
I'm so glad you didn't listen.

324
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,082
I usually don't.

325
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:32,713
You know, the fact that you're even willing to have dinner with my father --

326
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,560
it means so much.

327
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,520
I'm glad.

328
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,385
I'll get my coat.

329
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:52,520
I'm telling you, she was crazy in Paris.

330
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,123
I'm not kidding. I'm thinking about making my next car a hybrid.

331
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,162
You should. I have one.

332
00:20:58,281 --> 00:20:59,797
What do you think, Arvin?

333
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,577
Uh, Mr. Sloane. Ahem.

334
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:10,984
Well, considering the rapidly growing demand for fuel

335
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,784
in nations like China and India,

336
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:16,396
not to mention the world's oil production is expected to peak

337
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:19,292
in the next five years and then sharply plummet,

338
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,378
I think it's pretty clear we're looking at an exponential rise

339
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:24,504
in global conflict,

340
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:29,354
along with an energy crisis of unfathomable proportions.

341
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,261
So, yes, I'd say a hybrid is an excellent idea.

342
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:43,740
That's what I thought.

343
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,587
How about a toast?

344
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:49,383
The chinese have a saying --

345
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,792
"one joy scatters a thousand griefs."

346
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,805
So it is in that spirit that I wish you, Nadia,

347
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,746
the same joy that you bring to me every day.

348
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:03,440
I never dreamed that something so precious would come into my life.

349
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:06,649
Because of you, I am a changed man.

350
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:15,426
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

351
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:18,940
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

352
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,055
Hello?

353
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:30,236
- It's me.
- It's Vaughn.

354
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:33,847
No, I have a minute. Are you okay? How's your uncle?

355
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,885
Sloane's secure phone should be in his desk.

356
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,585
Okay, Dixon, stand by.

357
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:30,073
No, no, no, no. Unh-unh. Sit down.

358
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:30,729
Why?

359
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,527
Because you're not gonna lift a finger on your birthday.

360
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,135
Come on.

361
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,889
Well, I have something for you, so I'm going to get it.

362
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,236
Okay, I'm transmitting now.

363
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,181
Copy. I'm receiving the phone's encryption key.

364
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:53,571
Transmission good.

365
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:13,945
Nadia.

366
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:25,520
Birthday cake's ready.

367
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:29,245
Okay.

368
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,811
Nadia.

369
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,027
Thank you.

370
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:53,953
There she is.

371
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:56,082
- How's Vaughn?
- He's okay.

372
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,621
I think it's hard for him.

373
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:00,846
It must be.

374
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,222
All right, don't worry.

375
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:06,975
I made them promise they would not sing to you.

376
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:08,908
This is a little something I whipped up.

377
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:13,471
Uh, chocolate icing, chocolate cake, chocolate mousse --

378
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:15,653
just for you. Happy birthday.

379
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,467
Come on, Nadia, make a wish.

380
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:30,665
Speech.

381
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:40,245
I had no idea what to expect from tonight.

382
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,353
I've never celebrated anything with family before.

383
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:49,556
And, um, I wasn't even sure I wanted to, but...

384
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,575
Sydney insisted.

385
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:06,193
Now I see what I've been missing all these years.

386
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:14,539
The chance to know my family for the kind of people they really are.

387
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:19,499
Hear, hear.

388
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:22,264
Happy birthday.

389
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:36,189
You used me!

390
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:39,087
You wanted to break into my father's office, and you used me to do it!

391
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:40,505
- Nadia, listen to me --
- No!

392
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,257
Tonight was nothing but a ploy.

393
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,198
That's not true.

394
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,189
You just said you suspected my father.

395
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:47,894
I do, but for the first time in my life,

396
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,928
I don't want him to be guilty.

397
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,104
Nadia, I was trying to prove that he's innocent.

398
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,166
Hi. Is Sydney home?

399
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,536
Whatever you found out about my father,

400
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,430
I have a right to know.

401
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,146
Quite a coup,

402
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,705
stealing the decoder from police custody.

403
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,743
No less difficult that obtaining the index from the CIA.

404
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:42,637
It seems we're both blessed with unique talents.

405
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,430
The others have agreed.

406
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:46,512
They're leaving for Brussels in the morning.

407
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:50,405
It will be nice to have you back at the table, Arvin.

408
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,613
Sloane is reconstructing the Alliance.

409
00:28:54,126 --> 00:28:55,833
Unless you require more evidence.

410
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,933
You've proved your point.

411
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,160
Do we have any idea where the meeting's taking place?

412
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:04,515
All we know is what you heard -- Brussels.

413
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:07,324
All right then.

414
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,857
We'll set up a mobile surveillance, track Sloane to the meeting.

415
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:13,751
Once he's led us there, we'll move in.

416
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,355
Who else knows about this?

417
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,584
Agents Sydney Bristow and Nadia Santos.

418
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:20,797
You've involved agent Santos in this matter?

419
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,025
It became necessary to do so,

420
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,861
but she's prepared to accept the truth about her father.

421
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:31,609
All right then. Let's do it.

422
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:47,072
I need the report.

423
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:47,915
Yeah.

424
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:52,033
I told you, I need the report on my desk by tomorrow.

425
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,737
That's it.

426
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,434
- You wanted to see me?
- Your scarf.

427
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,644
You left this last night.

428
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:58,816
Thanks.

429
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:01,121
You seemed like you were in a hurry.

430
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:03,372
Is everything all right?

431
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,116
Um, yeah. Why?

432
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:09,331
Last night, I thought I detected some tension between you and your sister.

433
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:11,227
No, nothing like that.

434
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:13,160
I was just overwhelmed.

435
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,220
I still have to get used to being around family.

436
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,529
Oh, I see. Okay.

437
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:22,748
Well, if you ever need to talk,

438
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,974
just know that my door is always open.

439
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:25,770
Thank you.

440
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:30,032
Are you going somewhere?

441
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,782
Yeah. Just an overnight.

442
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,615
- Where to?
- Brussels.

443
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:40,666
- Have a safe trip.
- Thanks.

444
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,243
I should have told you sooner.

445
00:31:03,335 --> 00:31:04,566
You don't need to protect me.

446
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,095
I know that.

447
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:12,329
It's just it's always been black and white where your father's concerned.

448
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:13,842
I'm not used to seeing the gray.

449
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,450
What if it was your father?

450
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:17,678
He's done his share of compromising things.

451
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:19,742
Would you work this hard to punish him?

452
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:35,660
Target's on the move.

453
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:36,698
Is the tracker hot?

454
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:39,688
He just got onto rue Voltaire, heading due north.

455
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,169
He's turning towards the river.

456
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:50,792
The dockyards.

457
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,604
Do you have a visual?

458
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:12,781
Sloane's approaching the building on foot.

459
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,712
Gentlemen, as promised...

460
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,078
the Blackwell index.

461
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,410
He went into the building.

462
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,617
All right, we need to move.

463
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,224
You'll monitor the perimeter.

464
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:04,133
You're late.

465
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:18,812
Evergreen, report.

466
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:20,397
All clear. You have go.

467
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,370
Where's Devereaux? Where is he?

468
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,501
You have no idea what you're doing.

469
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,587
Where's the Alliance meeting?

470
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,462
It's not here. It's in another building.

471
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:52,289
I am only surveilling.

472
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,348
So, we've heard rumors you've turned CIA.

473
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,385
Rumors were wrong.

474
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:06,751
Oh, my god.

475
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,228
It's good to be back.

476
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,078
Thank you.

477
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:29,114
If you knew the Alliance was regrouping,

478
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,580
why not alert the CIA?

479
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:31,755
You and I both know

480
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:34,746
that the CIA would never have allowed me to convene the Alliance leadership.

481
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,070
You're damn right.

482
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:40,443
I had to bait them into the open to I.D. the players, the infrastructure.

483
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,765
You should have come to me.

484
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:43,765
I went to Jack.

485
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,515
You sent my father to do your dirty work.

486
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:47,886
Your father demanded to go, Sydney.

487
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:48,777
He's lying.

488
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:50,004
No, Marcus, I'm not lying.

489
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:52,899
Like you, Jack would never trust me around the Blackwell index.

490
00:34:52,992 --> 00:34:56,845
But he knew they would recognize him as my chief of operations at SD-6.

491
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:00,593
He insisted on delivering the decoder himself.

492
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:06,215
He doesn't have the real decoder.

493
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:08,014
Oh, no, you didn't.

494
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:28,536
What's going on, Jack?

495
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:36,723
I think the rumors are true.

496
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:38,898
I think this is a setup.

497
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:42,189
- Where is he?
- Building 37.

498
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,620
Nadia, get to building 37!

499
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:05,246
Where's Sloane?

500
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,872
My guess?

501
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:09,778
Miles from here.

502
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:12,551
He knew the decoder was a fake.

503
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,777
He sold me out.

504
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:19,475
And when I find him, I'm going to kill the bastard --

505
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:24,230
just as soon as I'm done with you.

506
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,035
Where's Sloane?

507
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,614
Where is he?

508
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:04,015
Jack?

509
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:31,950
Dad.

510
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:36,254
I'm okay.

511
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:38,670
Really.

512
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:43,912
I'll wait in the car.

513
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:00,451
Thank you.

514
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:06,294
I'd like to think in the future you'll do the same for me.

515
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,216
David, it's Michael.

516
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,852
I found it -- dad's diary.

517
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:37,553
I don't understand. There are entries in here until 1982.

518
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:40,783
My father died in 1979.

519
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,677
Please, if you can hear me, I need you to wake up.

520
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,952
I need to know.

521
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,989
Have you seen him? Has he been here?

522
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,619
Is he alive?

523
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:58,629
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize he had a visitor.

524
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,712
Everything okay?

525
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,320
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

526
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,613
Oh, uh, wait. I need to talk to Rosemary.

527
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,928
I'm sorry. Who?

528
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:10,300
Uh, Rosemary. The nurse. She's been taking care of my uncle.

529
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:13,032
I don't recognize the name.

530
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:17,121
What? That's impossible. She covers the 3:00 and 10:00 rounds.

531
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:21,246
Sir, there are no 3:00 and 10:00 rounds.

532
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,219
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,830
I trust that you'll remove the tap on Sloane's phone.

534
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,200
Already done.

535
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,240
And the decoder disk. The real one.

536
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:45,515
It's been turned over.

537
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,171
Good. There's a lot of outside pressure on this task force.

538
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,826
I don't want it compromised from within.

539
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:51,768
I understand.

540
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:53,559
You know, Marcus,

541
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:57,198
when I asked you to keep an eye on Sloane, I meant it.

542
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,045
But there are limits.

543
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,162
That being said, neither Sloane nor I

544
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:04,915
are pursuing disciplinary actions at this time.

545
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:07,834
You're an asset to this team.

546
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:12,281
So if anything else comes up, be sure to call me.

547
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,459
- Anything?
- Within reason.

548
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,132
That looks like it went well.

549
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:24,589
Yeah.

550
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,088
I'm glad it's over.

551
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:31,623
Is it?

552
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:35,510
We'll see.

553
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:11,783
Yes?

554
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:13,516
It's working.

555
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:15,952
Does it have what we need?

556
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:18,533
Oh, yes.

557
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,582
And more.

00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,782
