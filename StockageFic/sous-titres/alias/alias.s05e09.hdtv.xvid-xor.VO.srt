1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:01,213
Previously on Alias...

2
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:04,211
Marshall counted 12 sources
that make up Prophet Five.

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,086
It's like the Alliance all over again.

4
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,585
How are you feeling, Dr. Desantis?

5
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,773
Girl's alive. She calls herself
Renée Rienne. Works with the C.I.A.

6
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,776
Then keeping an eye on her
won't be a problem.

7
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:17,649
A job well done, Mr. Sloane.
I'm so glad you took our offer.

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,338
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?

9
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:20,839
There's always a choice.

10
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:22,587
We got Dean.

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,832
They insisted to kill Michael Vaughn.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,833
They have plans for you.

13
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:31,277
What plans?

14
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:36,675
Translation : Anyone Sixe Guilamu

15
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,088
I'm back.

16
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:04,777
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,211
What took you so long?

18
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,962
Traffic light out on Venice.

19
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,932
- Want to look at something for me?
- Sure.

20
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:18,776
You see an eyelash?
Something itches like hell.

21
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:19,895
- No.
- You sure?

22
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,207
Yeah. Maybe it's those contacts

23
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,402
you wore on the Ireland mission
irritated your eye.

24
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:24,403
Yeah.

25
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,279
What's this?

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,024
What do you think about orecchiette?

27
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,275
I don't think I've ever heard of it.

28
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,901
Wait a minute. Don't tell me you cook?

29
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:34,714
There is a lot of things about me
you don't know.

30
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:35,715
You clean, too?

31
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:37,961
I've been known to.
Why, you thinking about hiring me?

32
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,774
Why would I hire you
when I get you for free?

33
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,341
You taking a bath?

34
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:45,838
Maybe. Maybe we're gonna take a bath.

35
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:46,903
Damn it.

36
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:49,588
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,590
Let me see.

38
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,841
- It's nothing.
- Not nothing.

39
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,713
There you go. All better.

40
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,212
You're gonna make a great mom.

41
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,213
Yeah, maybe.

42
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,189
It's just my mom wasn't exactly
the best role model, you know.

43
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,963
Yeah, well, the good news is that
you're nothing like your mother.

44
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,776
You're not there yet, Sydney.

45
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,341
Did you hear that?

46
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:35,827
- What?
- Radio.

47
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:37,715
You need to go further back.

48
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,339
Follow Vaughn.

49
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,714
It's just the radio, Syd.

50
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,903
If you don't like it,
we can turn it off.

51
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,279
That's right.

52
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:53,278
How about a nice bottle of wine
with this bath?

53
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:55,339
That'd be great.

54
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,028
Who are you?

55
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,267
Sit still.

56
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,403
We're almost there, Sydney.

57
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,277
We almost have what we need.

58
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,679
We just need to go a little further.

59
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,715
What are you doing to me?

60
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,529
Nothing for you to worry about.

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,905
I'm just trying to help you relax.

62
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,614
Why? What do you want?

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,627
I just need to find a vein...

64
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:52,892
Stop. Are you certain
this won't harm the baby?

65
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:55,153
Quite certain.

66
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,627
Wait. The baby? Don't...

67
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:02,528
But if you want your answer,
you're gonna need to let me do my job.

68
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:05,029
Who is that behind there?
Who's behind there?

69
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,805
Okay. You may proceed.

70
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,464
If you hurt my baby,

71
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,090
I swear to you

72
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,715
I will kill you.

73
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,036
- You like?
- Yes. I like very much.

74
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,597
It's nice to see a girl like you
eating noodle.

75
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:45,798
My granddaughter...
she tell me "too many carbs".

76
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,247
Thank you. I'm late for a date.

77
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:54,724
Okay.

78
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,160
Excuse me! Mister!

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,910
- Yeah?
- Thank God.

80
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,411
I'm supposed to meet some friends
in the Mission District.

81
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:18,324
But my cab driver from Oakland
just drove me off here and zoomed off.

82
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,925
I've been trying to find a cab,
but no one here speaks English.

83
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,850
There's a stand
two blocks over to the right.

84
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:23,851
Thank you.

85
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,974
Oh, do you know what time it is?

86
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,037
Yeah, it's a quarter to...

87
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,036
Nice watch.

88
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:28,724
Again, Turner?

89
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,099
You're gonna miss your plane.

90
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,725
If you miss that pickup in Cartagena,

91
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,788
I'm gonna hear from the Director.

92
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,601
What'd you forget this time?

93
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,827
Mister, you okay?

94
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,352
This is agent 4962 Bravo
requesting the technician.

95
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,540
This is he.

96
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,728
Dr. Desantis, this is Kelly Peyton.

97
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:57,789
Were you able to retrieve
agent Vaughn's files?

98
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,040
Yes. I'm exiting Cha-kow street now.

99
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,103
I'll run the analysis and be in touch.

100
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,666
Excellent.
I'll let our benefactors know.

101
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,673
What's all that noise?

102
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:12,036
You know how it is...
rough neighborhood.

103
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,050
After your initial triage and check-in,

104
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,489
we'll bring you up here
to the labor and delivery rooms.

105
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,450
So this is where
I'll be getting my epidural?

106
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,590
Yes, it is, if you want one.

107
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,613
I do. I'm not a big fan of pain.

108
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:55,644
Are there any adjustments

109
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,415
Sydney should be making
to her lifestyle?

110
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,804
I'm sure her boss at the bank
would be happy to lighten her workload.

111
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:01,805
No, she's fine.

112
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,864
I tell mothers staying active
for as long as they can is a good thing.

113
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:09,033
You must be excited.
Won't be much longer now.

114
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,985
Oh, no, the due date's
still 3 weeks away.

115
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,804
Sure it is, but you never know.
Your baby may be in a hurry.

116
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,240
And you're far enough along,
if your water broke today,

117
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,428
we could expect a healthy delivery.

118
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:20,306
I didn't know that.

119
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,426
My service. I need to run.
I'll see you next week for your checkup.

120
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,427
Okay.

121
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,404
So... any day.

122
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,992
Well, she said it could be any day.

123
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,492
I have something for you.

124
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,493
What?

125
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:45,929
A gift?

126
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:50,054
Technically, no. It's already yours.
I'm just returning it.

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,053
Your mother and I bought it
when you were born.

128
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:03,866
You wouldn't let it out of your sight
till you were almost 3.

129
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:09,992
Reminds me of a time
when I could keep you safe.

130
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,114
It's beautiful, dad. Thank you.

131
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,555
You wanted to see me?

132
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,243
Oh, yeah. Hey. Agent Grace.

133
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:28,180
Listen, I was doing some housekeeping...
logging aliases,

134
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,927
safe house authorizations,
family contacts... you know,

135
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,366
the sucky part of my job.

136
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:36,709
And I came across a mistake
in your file, so I contacted Langley.

137
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,123
Turns out I don't have proper clearance
to do my own job.

138
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,180
What did you find?

139
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,241
Marriage certificate
from seven years ago.

140
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,556
Listen, if it's to support
an outdated alias,

141
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,929
I'd probably have it rescinded
sooner than later.

142
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,805
- You know, tax issues...
- It's not a mistake. I was married.

143
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,867
Really?

144
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm sorry.
I never heard you mention that.

145
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,713
For 3 years. Didn't work out.

146
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:00,743
Totally understand.
I mean, it's a... it's a struggle.

147
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,928
Hey, do me a favor.

148
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,366
Next time you have a question
about my personal life,

149
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,303
why don't you call me before Langley?

150
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:09,316
Absolutely. I'm... really sorry.

151
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,243
I'll get Jack.

152
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,303
4 hours ago, an agency facility
storing closed matters was breached.

153
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,765
Security cameras
identified the perpetrator

154
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,443
as an operative of Prophet 5.

155
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,274
- Kelly Peyton.
- Do we know what she took?

156
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:27,464
Among the archives were files

157
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,474
of all our agents killed
in the line of duty...

158
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,382
their contact protocols,
audio field journals,

159
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,274
biometric readouts...

160
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,366
They were Vaughn's files, weren't they?

161
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,245
You were going to have to say it
eventually.

162
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,371
Yes, that's right.

163
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,931
Why would they want Vaughn's files?

164
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,137
It's unclear at the moment,

165
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,055
which leaves us
in a vulnerable position.

166
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:46,554
Vaughn's investigation of Prophet 5
was off the books.

167
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:49,245
It's unlikely he kept those records
in a C.I.A. file.

168
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,384
I've tasked Tom and Marshall

169
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,496
with disabling all of
Vaughn's official protocols.

170
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:55,620
I'd like you to locate any
of his old contacts and issue a warning.

171
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:59,055
Sloane will oversee Rachel
in analyzing the remainder of the intel.

172
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,056
Me?

173
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:03,116
Though I would prefer
to keep you close by,

174
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,867
I know that's not an option.

175
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,367
Given her intimate knowledge
of Prophet 5

176
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,993
and her association with Vaughn,

177
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,431
you should meet with Renée Rienne,

178
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:12,556
see if she has any idea
what they may be looking for.

179
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:13,557
Yeah, okay.

180
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,058
Sydney?

181
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,181
You should know,
when it comes to Vaughn,

182
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,246
I take it quite personally.

183
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:28,744
I know, dad.

184
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,556
We're going to fix this.

185
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:47,872
Anything?

186
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,121
- Listen to this.
- The location?

187
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:55,494
Not quite, but I think Vaughn shared it
with Sydney Bristow.

188
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:57,568
...and I met this afternoon to discuss

189
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,680
the protocol for her
SD-6 countermissions.

190
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,493
I briefed agent Bristow
on the full scope of their operation,

191
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:03,681
how far it reaches.

192
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,121
Go back.

193
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,305
I briefed agent Bristow
on the full scope of their operation,

194
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,493
how far it reaches.

195
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:17,869
She knows where it is.

196
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:23,494
And you're certain agent Vaughn
communicated this intelligence to her?

197
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:27,218
Yes, according to his own
C.I.A. reports.

198
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,535
But it was several years ago.

199
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,495
There's no guarantee
Sydney will remember.

200
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:32,808
That's of no concern.

201
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:36,433
An associate of mine
will be able to refresh her memory.

202
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:40,308
I'll forward you the contact protocol
for Dr. Gonzalo Burris.

203
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:44,288
He's going to ask for a lot of money.
Tell him you'll pay half.

204
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:47,041
Have him waiting for me
at the Athena facility.

205
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,914
Then you're suggesting
that we abduct Sydney Bristow,

206
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,542
which, you realize,
may compromise our larger agenda?

207
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:55,293
We've been searching
for more than 30 years,

208
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,543
and this is the closest we've come

209
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,727
to retrieving the Horizon.

210
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,356
If Sydney bristow
can tell us where it is,

211
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,665
we must act immediately.

212
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,978
It's a chance we have to take.

213
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:32,915
Hello, Renée.

214
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,166
You look beautiful.

215
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:38,666
Doctor said it's my last week to fly.

216
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,103
Which means this is a special visit.

217
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,918
Prophet Five is targeting
some of Vaughn's C.I.A. files.

218
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,289
I need to know... did he make a record
of your investigation?

219
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,040
No. It was all in our heads.

220
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,917
Well, then was there anything
that Vaughn was working on

221
00:14:56,918 --> 00:15:00,729
or any leads or contacts that might be
of value to Prophet Five now?

222
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,915
What's in the files?

223
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,543
Presumably, everything he worked on...
SD-6, the Covenant, the Alliance...

224
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,106
Then no. It's impossible.

225
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:11,479
All the way back to SD-6,
he was only investigating...

226
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,667
Where did you park?

227
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,105
- I walked. Why?
- Let's move.

228
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,449
There's a police center on the corner.
You'll be safe.

229
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,826
Just take it easy. It might be nothing.

230
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:21,827
Go!

231
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:34,762
Sydney!

232
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:08,387
You.

233
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,952
Where are they taking her?

234
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,764
Where are they taking her?!

235
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,952
I've just sedated her
with a propofol cocktail

236
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:23,765
which should take full effect
within minutes.

237
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:27,199
It's a chemical process
of forced hypnosis which will

238
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:32,387
effectively numb the body
but leave the mind partially lucid,

239
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:37,555
allowing me to access
any part of her memory you'd like.

240
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,917
Which means

241
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,729
it's now time that you tell me
what it is you're looking for.

242
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,541
First, I'd like some proof
that this technique will work.

243
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:48,642
Of course.

244
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,207
Tell me your name.

245
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:18,521
Tell me your name.

246
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,957
Sydney Bristow.

247
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,241
That's a girl. Sydney, I want you
to remember Michael Vaughn.

248
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,267
Find him. Find him and remember a time
when you were both happy,

249
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:44,830
a time that was meaningful.

250
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:54,007
Go back, Sydney. Find him.

251
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:57,793
Vaughn...

252
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,917
I had it all planned out.

253
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,170
Vaughn?

254
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:23,418
No, just please let me do this.

255
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:25,342
Do what?

256
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,482
I was going to take you to the beach,
Santa Barbara.

257
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,480
We'd go for a walk,
maybe during a sunset.

258
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,606
But now we're here,

259
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:33,480
and I have no idea
what we're about to jump into,

260
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:36,917
and I don't know if I'll ever get
another chance to do this.

261
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,980
But, Vaughn, we already did this.

262
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:42,731
I don't understand.

263
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,545
I think I do.

264
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,854
The people you were looking for,

265
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:50,917
the people behind Prophet Five...

266
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,041
I think they're holding me.

267
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,487
How do you know about Prophet Five?

268
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:55,970
You told me, and then they shot you.

269
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,855
What? They shot me? No, I'm here.

270
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,607
I know.

271
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,979
They injected me with something.
They hypnotized me.

272
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,981
They're trying to get something
out of my head.

273
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,919
- What?
- I don't know.

274
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:13,292
But I think they're trying
to use you against me.

275
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,155
Stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

276
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,981
Remember the love you feel for him.

277
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,792
- I should go.
- No.

278
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,106
I don't want to be without you.

279
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,994
I know. I miss you.

280
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:42,545
Look.

281
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,359
Sydney Bristow, will you marry me?

282
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,417
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

283
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,105
You're supposed to say yes.

284
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:58,668
Yes.

285
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,483
I want to marry you.

286
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,446
Okay, we've got it.

287
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,234
Now perhaps you should tell me
what we're looking for.

288
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,699
There's a call for you
on the overseas line.

289
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,110
They're following our contact protocol,
but I don't recognize the voice.

290
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:20,607
This is the Director.

291
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,608
Is this Sydney Bristow's father?

292
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,231
Prophet Five has Sydney.

293
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,307
She was last seen in a black van
heading west

294
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:28,796
away from the Salamanca quarter.

295
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:31,646
Rachel, access Madrid's
surveillance infrastructure.

296
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:34,456
Marshall, monitor all movement
through local ports and airspace.

297
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,304
- What's the timeline?
- She was abducted 40 minutes ago.

298
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,484
Well, they could've had her
to the city limits in 20.

299
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:39,795
- Then move!
- Right.

300
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:41,946
We're assuming Sydney's capture
is connected to something

301
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,486
Prophet Five found in Vaughn's files.

302
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,017
I'll reassess them with that in mind.

303
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:46,818
Dr. Aldo Desantis was present
at the ambush,

304
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,671
which implies they may intend
to use Sydney for a medical procedure.

305
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:50,799
My God. The baby.

306
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,331
Renée Rienne has Desantis in custody.

307
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,556
I'm gonna join her and assist
with the interrogation.

308
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,931
Do you want me to come with you?

309
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,921
No. I need you to run operations
until I return.

310
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,489
I'll secure a flight to Spain for you.

311
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,594
Where do you need me?

312
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,544
You're sure you have no means left
by which to contact Prophet Five?

313
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,896
Jack, I told you that Gordon Dean
was my only resource.

314
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,610
With him dead, I have nothing.

315
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:12,232
Okay. Then use your underworld contacts.

316
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,045
The news of a federal agent in captivity
may have made the rounds.

317
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,671
See if they know anything.

318
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,423
I'll get right on it.

319
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,296
This is Arvin Sloane.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ehrmann.

320
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,106
Mr. Ehrmann is not available.

321
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:31,169
This is an urgent matter.
I need to speak to him.

322
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:35,360
You're not playing by the rules,
Mr. Sloane. Remember, we contact you.

323
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:40,298
A pregnant woman's life is at stake...
someone very dear to me.

324
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,800
The only woman you can save
is lying in a hospital bed.

325
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:46,363
May I suggest
you pick your battles, sir?

326
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,610
- Please.
- Good-bye, Mr. Sloane.

327
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:07,737
Jack?

328
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:11,048
Do you have anything?

329
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,175
Satellites lost her at the city limits.

330
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,925
If we don't get him to a hospital,
he's gonna die.

331
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,113
Has he given us anything?

332
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:23,176
He won't talk,
but I pulled this from his jacket.

333
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,361
It's got dates, addresses.

334
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,052
So this is how you do it...

335
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:42,286
bring in a man in a suit...
to scare me into talking?

336
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,362
You're right.

337
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,426
The suit shouldn't scare you.

338
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:52,014
What should scare you is that
I'm a very concerned father.

339
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:05,714
No!

340
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:14,964
I'm going to continue
the regressive process...

341
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,967
attaching her to a memory of Vaughn

342
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:22,151
and then taking her back through time
until we get your answer.

343
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:36,816
Now, Sydney, I want you to remember
the last time you were with Vaughn.

344
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:42,652
Think of the comfort you feel
when you're with him.

345
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:44,904
Live there...

346
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,029
in your memories.

347
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:11,465
Vaughn?

348
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:16,904
Vaughn?

349
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,614
Sorry. I guess I drifted off there.

350
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,967
Hey, we should think about
more names for the baby.

351
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,531
There will be plenty of time for that.

352
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:34,654
I know. What do you think about Oscar?

353
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:39,405
- What if we have a girl?
- I meant for a girl.

354
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,583
I wish she were here already.

355
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,417
- I want to meet her.
- You will.

356
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,519
I know.

357
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,086
Are you comfortable?

358
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,583
No.

359
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,708
When he feels ready,
make sure he drinks it slow.

360
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,084
Don't overdo it. Just a sip at a time.

361
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,081
- I'll be back soon.
- Thank you.

362
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:19,150
Can I... I'm thirsty.

363
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,524
I gave you this, and then you crashed.

364
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,250
- Vaughn... I can't.
- Syd...

365
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:40,798
They can hear us. Come closer.

366
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,478
You said it yourself...
they're using me against you.

367
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:51,618
The only way to defeat them...
I need to go away.

368
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:53,788
I don't care.

369
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,790
I don't want
to say good-bye to you again.

370
00:25:56,976 --> 00:26:00,451
I know. I know. It's okay.
I need to go away.

371
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:06,413
We'll find each other.

372
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:08,726
We always find each other.

373
00:26:13,728 --> 00:26:14,728
Syd?

374
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,038
The baby kicked.

375
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,352
Really? What's it feel like?

376
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,789
Here.

377
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,601
- I don't feel anything.
- Wait.

378
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:30,352
There.

379
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:34,300
- No, I... that?
- Yeah.

380
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:40,555
Very good, Sydney.
I want you to stay with Vaughn.

381
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,974
- Don't ever leave me.
- Never.

382
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:51,693
- Where are they taking us?
- Nowhere good.

383
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:05,694
Syd?

384
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:10,322
Vaughn?

385
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:16,264
Don't let him go.
I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

386
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:27,823
Sydney, can you hear me?

387
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:29,758
Vaughn, where are you?

388
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:31,945
I'm losing... go to chann...

389
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:35,564
Vaughn? Vaughn!

390
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,821
Don't let him leave you, Sydney.

391
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,097
Where is Vaughn?

392
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,135
I'm back.

393
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,572
What took you so long?

394
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:06,760
They're back together.

395
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:12,134
Tell me where they have my daughter.

396
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,510
I'll tell you nothing.

397
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,382
You've been shot.
You'll never survive the blood loss.

398
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:20,883
Though I am prepared to draw this out
to the last second,

399
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:23,196
make it as painful as it needs to be,

400
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,894
until you tell me where she is.

401
00:28:27,134 --> 00:28:29,989
Where she is does not matter.

402
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:34,940
Your concern should be
where she is going.

403
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:37,322
Jack?

404
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,570
I found a repeating address
in the calendar.

405
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,946
"Kristina Korut 37/E."

406
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:44,950
That's in Hungary.

407
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:47,758
He had it marked three times
in the last fourth months

408
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,840
and once on this date,
three weeks from now.

409
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,448
Jack, what is it?

410
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:58,011
That's Sydney's due date.

411
00:28:58,323 --> 00:28:59,385
Give me your gun.

412
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,026
What's gonna happen
at Kristina Korut 37/e?

413
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,167
You'll never know.

414
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,793
Is Sydney being held there?

415
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,044
- Of course not.
- You're lying.

416
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,167
Very well. Maybe I am lying.

417
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,713
What's there?

418
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,104
You can't do anything to me now.

419
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,668
I'm quite prepared to die.

420
00:29:33,296 --> 00:29:34,606
See if he means it.

421
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:43,323
Dixon, it's Jack. I need you to prepare
a transport to Hungary.

422
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:52,131
Sydney, think back
to a comforting time...

423
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:56,270
the place you were the first time

424
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:59,233
you realized that Vaughn
really cared for you.

425
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,544
I forget how beautiful it is...
the ocean.

426
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,605
Yeah.

427
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,542
We should have come here more often.

428
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:28,017
Draw me a map... how far it reaches.

429
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:36,543
- They're pushing me closer.
- What do they want?

430
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:39,168
I don't know.

431
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,136
- Something about a map.
- A map?

432
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:52,637
Listen to me. Draw me a map...
how far it reaches.

433
00:30:57,543 --> 00:31:00,793
You just threw your phone
into the pacific... twice.

434
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:04,669
I know.

435
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:17,483
Listen to me.

436
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:21,358
You have got to let me go.

437
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,543
- I can't.
- You have to.

438
00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:27,674
I can't, Vaughn. I can't stand it...

439
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,732
- being here without you.
- Sydney...

440
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,670
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

441
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:34,984
I do.

442
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:38,170
Like I don't know who I am anymore

443
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,796
or what I'm doing or why I'm doing it.

444
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:44,045
Okay, stop. Do you remember
the last time we were here?

445
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:46,006
Your contact had just been killed
in Morocco,

446
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:47,687
and your world
was collapsing around you.

447
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,295
And I told you that even
in the middle of all this darkness,

448
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,671
you could not allow it to swallow you.

449
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:57,421
You gave me strength.

450
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:02,357
Yeah, but the truth is... the truth
has always been you are the one

451
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:05,233
that has kept the darkness
from overtaking me.

452
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:09,732
You can do this. I know you can do this.

453
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:12,358
I've seen you do this
time and time again.

454
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:16,357
I'm gonna go...

455
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:22,848
and you are gonna take these guys down.
Okay?

456
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,172
She's fighting the process.

457
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,860
I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney.

458
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:00,859
If you don't say good-bye to me,
they win.

459
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,048
I can't do it on my own.

460
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:05,797
I'm not here.

461
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,964
This isn't real. None of this is real.

462
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:11,734
It's real to me.
That's all that matters.

463
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,982
Don't say that.
That's what they want you to say.

464
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:16,673
Do you know what I want?

465
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,420
I want the world to forget about us.

466
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:20,782
I'm tired, Vaughn.

467
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,769
I'm tired of having this weight
on my shoulders.

468
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,610
I don't want to be the one
who has to save the world.

469
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:31,001
I want you back.
I want you all to myself.

470
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:37,836
I want to go away,
just you and me and our baby, somewhere

471
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,609
no one can bother us...
a deserted island.

472
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:52,204
I want out. I don't care if they win,
Vaughn. I don't care.

473
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,359
I just want you to stay with me.

474
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:58,487
That's it.

475
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,050
We got her.

476
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,245
Excellent. Now I want the map of SD-6.

477
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,047
I want no more of this spy crap.

478
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,048
I just...

479
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,109
that's why I went to you
in the first place.

480
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,422
So just listen to me,

481
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,173
and I will give you, in record time,

482
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:24,447
the names of people
who will render SD-6 useless.

483
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:25,859
Record time?

484
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:30,329
Two months tops,
and then I'm out. I walk.

485
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,862
Draw me a map of SD-6
and all its allies,

486
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,923
how far you think it reaches.

487
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,094
Draw me an SD-6 family tree
and how deep you think it goes.

488
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:42,736
Just do it.

489
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:16,046
This is what you're in the middle of.

490
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:21,298
This isn't about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

491
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,424
This is about killing the monster.

492
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:28,606
Focus on the map.

493
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,372
The upper right corner...
what do you see?

494
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,445
There's a name. What is it?

495
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,235
Tell me what it is.

496
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:01,008
X-23 Norte.

497
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:03,737
Well done.

498
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:06,926
Well done.

499
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,174
Good...

500
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,612
Thank you, doctor.

501
00:36:23,737 --> 00:36:25,014
I'll let my associates know

502
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,236
we've discovered the location
of the Horizon.

503
00:36:27,237 --> 00:36:28,924
I'll be back in a few days.

504
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,049
Until then, keep her comfortable.

505
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:03,485
Do you hear that?

506
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:06,112
I didn't hear anything.

507
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:09,113
I know.

508
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:11,863
It's great, isn't it?

509
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:23,675
I wish we could stay here like this
forever.

510
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:27,114
There's nothing I want more.

511
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,424
They're gonna figure it out, Syd.

512
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:36,423
Sooner or later, they're gonna know
you gave'em the wrong name.

513
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,299
And when they do, I can't be here.

514
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,425
They'll keep using me against you.

515
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:44,177
They won't stop until they get
what they want. I have to go.

516
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:47,606
I know.

517
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,981
We'll find each other.
We always find each other.

518
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,918
Unit three is on the third floor.

519
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,856
The lease expired 16 years ago.

520
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:38,542
Nevertheless.

521
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Good Lord.
