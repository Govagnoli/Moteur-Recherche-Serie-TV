1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:03,813
Seven years ago,
I was recruited to work for SD-6,

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,649
which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:10,361
I was trained as a spy,
warned not to tell anyone what I did.

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,822
I thought I was working
for the good guys

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:16,408
until I told my fiancé about SD-6,
and they had him killed.

6
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,452
That's when I learned the truth,

7
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,705
that SD-6 is part of the enemy
I thought I was fighting.

8
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,876
Now, I'm a double agent, working
with the real CIA to bring down SD-6.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,881
My only ally is another double agent,
a man I hardly know. My father.

10
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,427
Is the winner of the Edgar Peace
Prize working with Jacqnoud?

11
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,680
Dhiren Patel is India's UN delegate.

12
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:39,849
No way is he working with Jacqnoud.

13
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:42,852
Your objective is
to monitor the meeting, ID the client

14
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,147
and make sure whatever
Jacqnoud is up to doesn't happen.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,025
Patel is our delivery man.
I'll need the piece by tomorrow.

16
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,365
Damn it. That bodyguard,

17
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,536
I know him. Corsica two years ago.
Son of a bitch broke my arm.

18
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,745
You. I know you.

19
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:05,541
The man Jacqnoud
is meeting with is Malik Sawari.

20
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:08,294
He specialises
in industrial demolition.

21
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,713
Jacqnoud will plant
an explosive on Patel?

22
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:11,630
Yes.

23
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:13,591
I want you two to stop it.

24
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:16,385
- 20 on Patel.
- Let's get them out.

25
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,930
Something's wrong. He looks sick.
He just went down.

26
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:23,934
If they're bombing this place,
it'll be the opening ceremonies.

27
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,729
Careful with that. That's TNT.

28
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:28,981
Yes, don't kill us, please.

29
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:40,701
Recognise me now?

30
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,500
Anyone else?

31
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,461
Keep looking.

32
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,698
I never did find out
what you were doing in Corsica.

33
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,743
Are you working for Dimitri?

34
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,751
Tell me now
or you're going in the fire.

35
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,340
Who sent you here?

36
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,135
Are you here alone?

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,098
Who sent you here?
Answer me. Bitch.

38
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:03,909
Get to level C now. She got away.

39
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,108
Oh, my God. What time is it?

40
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,995
- Dixon, it's me.
- Where've you been? I didn't sleep.

41
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,540
It doesn't matter.
Have you spotted Patel?

42
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,543
He just showed up.

43
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:38,462
News agencies report
he had an arrhythmia.

44
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,423
What I'm about to say,
just believe me.

45
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:42,633
Of course.

46
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,761
The bomb we're looking for,
it's inside of him.

47
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,389
- What?
- Inside Patel.

48
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,600
They implanted the bomb
into his chest, like a pacemaker.

49
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:53,561
A simple outpatient procedure.

50
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:56,355
Jacqnoud turned a Peace Prize winner
into a human bomb

51
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,982
which is not good.

52
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,151
- Did you see the device?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,820
It's small.
It's probably on a wireless remote.

54
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,781
Get Patel and I'll meet you
behind the auditorium.

55
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:08,075
I'll get there as soon as I can.

56
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:08,177
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honour

57
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,182
to officially open
the 2001 ministerial conference

58
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:15,726
of the United Commerce
Organisation.

59
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,706
Please welcome
our keynote speaker.

60
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,792
Ladies and gentlemen, Dhiren Patel.

61
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,966
I just punched Dhiren Patel.

62
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,385
- Any luck?
- I worship this man.

63
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,096
In the building,
did you ID the trigger?

64
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,307
No. I didn't see anyone.

65
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,562
Oh, God.

66
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:49,695
Please wait one moment.
I will be right back.

67
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,089
I know you've been field-trained,
but can you do this?

68
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:12,176
- Pull a bomb out of a man's chest?
- Yeah.

69
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,351
It's Jacqnoud.

70
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,450
Don't forget.
This thing's on a remote.

71
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:39,662
You can't let them get within range.

72
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,715
Get me closer.

73
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,594
Get me closer.

74
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,066
- I can feel it.
- Oh, God.

75
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,451
- Police roadblock.
- Get around it.

76
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,202
Oh, God.

77
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,305
Get me closer!

78
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,182
You've got to hurry.

79
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,476
They put an adhesive on the incision.

80
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,728
It must have bled through.
It's stuck.

81
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,112
Closer.

82
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,660
Oh, God!

83
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,706
What's that?

84
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,626
It's on a delay. Just keep driving.

85
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:10,878
Now.

86
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,475
Nicely done.

87
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,229
Patel sahib.

88
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,940
You're going to be OK.

89
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:37,113
- That's insane.
- No kidding.

90
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,198
Dixon just pulled it out of him?

91
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,409
- Pulled a bomb out of Patel?
- The very one.

92
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:45,538
- Any luck with the alliance member?
- The what?

93
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:47,957
You were supposed to ID
the minister.

94
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,792
Thanks, I remember. No.

95
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,169
- Sydney, to take down SD-6...
- Stop.

96
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,504
I'm just saying...

97
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:57,550
I was trying to keep an important
humanitarian from blowing up.

98
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,843
Fine.

99
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,724
Anyway, I have a paper to finish.

100
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,359
I have something for you.

101
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:21,991
I know you have a lot of questions
about your father.

102
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:26,454
I don't know if you want this,
but I copied his file.

103
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,506
Thank you.

104
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:48,911
Sorry I'm late.

105
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,997
- It's after 1:00?
- It's 1:30.

106
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,541
You got to be kidding?

107
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:56,252
OK, I'm in my
Technology Management class.

108
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,753
I realise two things.

109
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,381
- One, I prepared the wrong chapter.
- No.

110
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,049
I don't wanna talk about it.

111
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,844
Two, you and I are gonna have
a Hallowe'en party.

112
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,470
Guest list.

113
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,226
- What, is it too big?
- You put down everyone we've met.

114
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,771
- You invited Kenny.
- So? He's a kid. It's Hallowe'en.

115
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,731
If you wanna see Charlie again,

116
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:20,818
don't throw a Hallowe'en party
and invite his nephew.

117
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,195
- I love Kenny.
- I know you do.

118
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,282
Just admit you're hoping,
just a little,

119
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,117
that Charlie will bring him.

120
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,621
- What?
- Is that Will?

121
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:35,791
Maybe it's about
the humiliating kiss.

122
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,210
- Stop calling it that.
- That's what it was.

123
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,672
You know, I gotta call you back.

124
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,341
I got to go. I'll call you back. Bye.

125
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:47,470
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I got this...

126
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:51,932
I'm writing a story on SATs,
about how the university is...

127
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,976
- What are you guys doing?
- Lunch.

128
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,438
- We're having a Hallowe'en party.
- Do I have to wear a costume?

129
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,315
- No.
- Yeah.

130
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,859
Really? That's... confusing.

131
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,366
- Let me guess. The bank.
- A meeting with the higher-ups.

132
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,911
- Seriously, your job?
- It's a problem?

133
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,371
- I should go.
- We know.

134
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:17,708
- I'll call you guys later, OK?
- See you.

135
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,794
This is Hensel Corporation.

136
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:22,171
A Germany-based
chemical conglomerate.

137
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,965
They make ibuprofen,
hand lotion, toothpaste.

138
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:28,010
They also have
a multi-million-dollar research fund

139
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:31,263
with ties going back to World War II
and the Third Reich.

140
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,893
They don't list the last part
in their annual stock report.

141
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:40,106
This is Jeroen Schiller, one of
Hensel's leading biotech engineers.

142
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,732
He lives in Berlin.

143
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:44,193
We've been in communication
with him.

144
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:48,823
The news is that Hensel has perfected
a vaccine against biological weapons.

145
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,909
Schiller has that information.
He wants to make a trade.

146
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,786
What does he want in exchange?

147
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,663
Safe passage to the US.

148
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,415
He lives in Berlin.
He can take a cab to the airport.

149
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,459
Germany's not the problem. Hensel is.

150
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:03,921
Anyone who has top-level clearance
is closely surveilled.

151
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,756
Your job is to ID Schiller,

152
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,175
get him away from Hensel
and into the US.

153
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,761
- What kind of extraction?
- Shipment.

154
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:14,223
Hensel is upgrading their intranet
with fibre optics.

155
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,184
You go in
as a Rhine-Kom network supervisor.

156
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:21,063
Unfortunately, this is the last
documented photo of Schiller.

157
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:23,858
University of Hamburg, 1975.

158
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:25,901
We had Tech do an age processing

159
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:28,237
to show
what he might look like today.

160
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,030
You'll find it in there.

161
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:33,492
Marshall, go.

162
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,119
Right. Thank you.

163
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:36,871
How is everyone? Hello.

164
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:40,124
Hope everyone's planning
an enjoyable All Hallow's Eve.

165
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,085
- Marshall?
- Sorry.

166
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,796
This is pretty incredible.

167
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,799
Business card.
Something you might hand out.

168
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:51,802
Like, "Hello,
I'm a Rhine-Kom net supervisor."

169
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:54,805
In German, of course.
English would give you away.

170
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,184
But the genius,
the achievement, is this.

171
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:03,230
Even Sony would be like, "Well,
Marshall, this is pretty cool."

172
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,024
What does it do?

173
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:08,068
You place the card
on top of his monitor.

174
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:11,447
A tiny transmitter inside
will override the CPU

175
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,326
and make the network think that
you are the system administrator.

176
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,871
You'll manually override the firewall

177
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:22,875
and Schiller will transfer
the formula to a Canadian website.

178
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,544
We'll get the password
once Schiller's here.

179
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:29,131
- So I got your voice mail.
- Don't feel obligated.

180
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:32,551
No. I asked Diane.
We're coming. All of us.

181
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:36,263
- You don't have to wear a costume.
- You didn't need to say that.

182
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,681
Sydney.

183
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:43,479
- Could I have a minute?
- Of course. See you at Op Tech.

184
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,233
I...

185
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:50,945
We were closing a deal last Thursday.
I couldn't get away.

186
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:53,489
You said that when you called.
It's fine.

187
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:57,618
This is an especially busy time
for me.

188
00:16:57,701 --> 00:17:02,206
There are six cases I'm overseeing.
So, until things slow down,

189
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,084
we probably shouldn't
make any plans.

190
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,086
I wasn't going to pursue it.

191
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:12,550
- I just wanted it clarified.
- Good.

192
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,786
This is Paul Kelvin. Sydney Bristow.

193
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,581
- I know your father.
- Really? I hear that a lot.

194
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:47,126
We gotta move fast. The CIA's
watched Hensel Corp for years.

195
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,961
They're not creating a vaccine?

196
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,714
They are, but the US Army
has been doing research

197
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,592
that we thought was years
ahead of the Germans.

198
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,968
What are we afraid of?

199
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:59,388
Schiller has developed
micro-encapsulated cytokines.

200
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:03,100
They activate your immune cells.
Know anything about this?

201
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:05,728
- A little. You?
- A little.

202
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:08,606
Enough to know
that SD-6 could sell this vaccine

203
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,859
to a radical leader
who wants to protect his own people

204
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,111
and start an all-out biological war.

205
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,364
What am I supposed to do in Berlin?

206
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:20,826
Instead of shipping Schiller,
we'll ship Kelvin.

207
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,204
He's prepped to impersonate Schiller.

208
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,290
Based on available photographs,
he's a good match.

209
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,126
You'll make the switch
in the building's garage.

210
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,630
- You're up for this?
- I'm not looking forward to it.

211
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:35,758
What about when Sloane
wants the vaccine?

212
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,010
He'll give them false information.

213
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,221
Kelvin's got a plane waiting.

214
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,932
- See you in Berlin.
- OK.

215
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:59,073
- I've got to tell Dixon.
- Absolutely not.

216
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:02,451
How do I make a switch invisible
to my partner? He'll be there.

217
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:06,247
- You cannot tell him the truth.
- You don't know him.

218
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,041
- That's my point.
- But I do.

219
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:15,089
You might be right about Dixon,
but you can't volunteer a man

220
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,008
for double-agent duty
if he hasn't asked for it.

221
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,677
His whole life, his family.

222
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,722
You'd be putting all of that at risk.
You.

223
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:27,017
Is that a decision
that you want to make for him?

224
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,285
I'm in.

225
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:31,290
Copy that. All's quiet out front.

226
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,304
Herr Schiller?

227
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,687
You are the agent?

228
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:10,538
Dixon, someone might be following me.
Meet me at Eisenzahn at 7:00.

229
00:21:10,621 --> 00:21:14,041
Copy that. I'm starting the gas now.

230
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,711
You'll have two minutes
until people regain consciousness.

231
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:20,399
- Dixon, I'm on Königstrasse
- I'm on my way.

232
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:45,049
When you asked me to help you,
you didn't say all day.

233
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:46,717
We're almost done.

234
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:49,386
What's left
that we haven't covered with corn?

235
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,847
I work
with a professional party planner.

236
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:55,684
What's going on with work?
You haven't mentioned it today.

237
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:01,232
You want the truth?

238
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:06,821
I wasn't working on a SAT story
when I bumped into you guys.

239
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:08,489
There is no SAT story.

240
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:10,991
I was trying to track down
a Kate Jones.

241
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:14,161
Supposed to be seated next
to Danny on a flight to Hong Kong.

242
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,371
You can't do this.

243
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:18,541
What was Danny doing
on a flight to Hong Kong?

244
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:22,586
Kate Jones and Danny were the
only two people to miss that flight.

245
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,383
I was at the medical school. I
thought they'd have her name on file.

246
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:29,927
Too many things
don't make any sense.

247
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,971
One of them is this woman.

248
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:36,100
I looked up every Kate, Kathy,
Katherine, Kathleen Jones in LA,

249
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,519
plus I have a contact
at the airport...

250
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,020
You can't do this.

251
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:42,273
Nothing is going to bring Danny back.

252
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:44,650
When Sydney finds out
what you've done,

253
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:49,989
which you know she will...
Just think about that.

254
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:56,829
I want to see Mr Sloane.

255
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,874
Mr Schiller, I've explained this.
Sloane is not here.

256
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:01,750
Tell us the password...

257
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,003
I only talk to Sloane.

258
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:05,671
That was the agreement.

259
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:09,049
If you were who you say you are,
you would know that.

260
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,719
Mr Schiller, I swear to you.
Sloane is a liar.

261
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,888
He has nothing to do with the CIA.

262
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,143
So you say Sloane is a fraud?

263
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,937
How do I know it's not you
who is the fraud?

264
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,443
You don't.

265
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,656
But you will.

266
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,120
- How fast can we get to Langley?
- Why?

267
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:42,458
He wants proof we're CIA. He won't
believe us unless we take him there.

268
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,585
Vaughn, we're in.

269
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,879
What's this?

270
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:49,840
This is the main reason
we made the switch in Berlin.

271
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,635
We had Kelvin give Sloane
access to a bogus website

272
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:56,430
with enough real information
to keep them occupied for months.

273
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:59,350
- Is that worth risking a man's life?
- There's more.

274
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,018
Once SD-6 runs the program,

275
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:03,354
we'll have a back door
into their systems.

276
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:07,108
In other words, we have access
to their entire network.

277
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,610
Files, contacts, accounts?

278
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:12,404
This is a huge step
in shutting down SD-6.

279
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:15,699
- Nice.
- It was Agent Vaughn's idea.

280
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:18,953
- You look so surprised.
- No.

281
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,955
Yes, it was my idea.

282
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,415
- Amazing idea.
- Thank you. I know.

283
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:44,478
- This is very exciting.
- Go tell Analysis.

284
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,319
It's good to finally meet you.

285
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:55,698
The travel was not so easy,
so forgive me for being so...

286
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:57,825
No, not at all.

287
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,411
We have $200,000
in cash waiting for you.

288
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:03,497
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. It's yours,

289
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:06,959
when you tell us, and we confirm,
the location of the plant.

290
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:10,129
Plant? Which plant?

291
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:12,506
Where the prototype's being made.

292
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,425
The vaccine inhaler.

293
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:19,555
You do know
the location of the plant?

294
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:27,521
You see, I did not get information
about any prototype.

295
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:30,816
I was never privileged
to such information.

296
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,444
I have reason to believe you were.

297
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:35,362
Why don't you think about it?

298
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:38,115
Why don't you think
about everything?

299
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:54,590
How's Schiller?

300
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:57,885
- I want to talk about your report.
- Is something wrong?

301
00:26:57,968 --> 00:27:01,472
You wrote that Sydney changed
the pickup to the rear exit.

302
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,973
On Königstrasse.

303
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:05,142
Was this decided
before the extraction?

304
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,936
- During.
- Why?

305
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,147
- Someone was following her.
- Did you see someone?

306
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:13,692
No, but I was outside the whole time.

307
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:16,529
I see.

308
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,117
If Sydney said there was someone
following her,

309
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,285
there was someone following her.

310
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,882
Kenny.

311
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,682
Trick or treat.

312
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:47,560
There's more candy in there.
Come on in.

313
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:49,186
Good to see you.

314
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,730
Sydney, can I talk to you
for a second?

315
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,490
What's up?

316
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:07,496
Syd, we've been working together
a lot of years. I trust you.

317
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,375
- I trust you and I love you.
- I know.

318
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,544
If something's up, you'd tell me?

319
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:16,756
- What are you saying?
- Sloane is asking about Berlin.

320
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,884
He thinks someone got to Schiller,
that he's a plant.

321
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,845
He wanted to know why you had me
change the pickup.

322
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,389
I told you
I thought I was being followed.

323
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:30,144
Syd, is there something
I should know?

324
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:35,357
No.

325
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,407
Sloane says there's a prototype.
An inhaler for the vaccine.

326
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:46,368
He wants us to get it
but Schiller won't give the location

327
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,204
which makes no sense.

328
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,164
That man should know where it is

329
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:53,000
and has everything to lose
by not telling us.

330
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:57,213
- What's going to happen to him?
- I think Schiller is in trouble.

331
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,881
But, Syd...

332
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,717
...I think you are, too.

333
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,566
Here's my question.

334
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,402
Who eats this crap?
It's like marzipan, but worse.

335
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:23,405
If it was this or dirt,
I would be all over the dirt.

336
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,825
Would you shut up
about the candy corn?

337
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:29,078
OK. You're bummed that
the kid came and Charlie didn't.

338
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,871
What?

339
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,957
You gave me advice. I took it.

340
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,626
- Now it's my turn.
- What advice did I give you?

341
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,212
The Kate Jones thing.
I'm giving it up.

342
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:40,297
It can only end badly.

343
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:43,509
So, it's my turn to give you some.
You love Charlie.

344
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:46,804
You don't want to lose him,
so don't be an idiot.

345
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:49,181
You gotta talk to him.
Don't deny it.

346
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,891
Don't piss me off.

347
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:53,853
That's exactly what I did
when I first met Sydney.

348
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:57,773
OK? So use me as a cautionary tale
and call Charlie.

349
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,868
Yeah, Will Tippin.

350
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:11,704
Hi, this is Kate Jones.
You called me?

351
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:17,001
Yeah. Did you know a guy
named Daniel Hecht?

352
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:21,213
Yes, I did. Very well.

353
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:24,925
- Don't go to Langley.
- We go in an hour.

354
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:29,680
Kelvin could be dead by then.
Sloane wants more than the password.

355
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:34,018
Information Schiller would have.
This could be it.

356
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:36,854
If this goes badly,
they'll know I'm a double.

357
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:40,316
- What the hell do we do?
- That's why I came here.

358
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,611
I need to talk to Schiller right now.

359
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,001
I wouldn't have called
unless I had no choice.

360
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,795
It's alright. What is it?

361
00:31:00,878 --> 00:31:02,797
There's a CIA officer, Paul Kelvin.

362
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,382
Yes, I know about Berlin.
Paul's a friend.

363
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,927
Then you should know
his life's in danger.

364
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,847
He's in custody. Sloane wants
intel Kelvin doesn't have.

365
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:14,975
I have what Kelvin needs,
but I can't get it to him.

366
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,228
Sloane's already too suspicious
of me.

367
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:21,065
- But since he trusts you...
- Sloane put a call in to me.

368
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:24,318
- That must be why.
- Why would he call you?

369
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:28,114
He finds me useful
in difficult situations.

370
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,618
I'm surprised you're not with Emily.

371
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:36,372
I would be, but we have a problem.

372
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:39,291
Schiller won't talk.

373
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:46,465
I don't trust that man,
so I want proof.

374
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,469
- Proof?
- That he's telling us everything.

375
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,598
That he is who he says he is.

376
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,144
I understand.

377
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:19,832
Arvin Sloane is not affiliated
with the United States government.

378
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,959
He's just a man...

379
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:27,465
...who used me,
the same as he was going to use you.

380
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,490
He made me think I was giving myself
to God and country.

381
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:55,201
But it was all a lie.

382
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:59,747
A lie that cost my fiancé his life.

383
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:08,422
If I go back to SD-6 without
the location of that plant...

384
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,885
...they will take the life
of another innocent man.

385
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:18,182
I need to prove
you're Schiller and I'm SD-6.

386
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:20,142
I have to hurt you.

387
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:23,104
There's only one person
who can stop that.

388
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,398
And I'm talking to him right now.

389
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,068
Mr Schiller.

390
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:35,199
Please.

391
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:45,793
It's Badenweiler.

392
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,878
The plant is in Badenweiler.

393
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:51,966
The plant is located in Badenweiler,
near the Black Forest.

394
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:56,929
Badenweiler. It's in Badenweiler.

395
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,235
Sloane called us in this morning.

396
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,821
Our mission
is to go to Badenweiler tonight,

397
00:34:13,904 --> 00:34:17,074
steal the vaccine inhalers
and blow up the plant.

398
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,535
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

399
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:22,037
Sit in these meetings with Sloane,

400
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:24,290
look at him
as if I don't despise him,

401
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,459
don't want to leap across the table

402
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:30,463
and use the skills
I've learned at SD-6 against him.

403
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,882
So what the hell do I do next?

404
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:34,842
What's my countermission?

405
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:51,317
- He practically apologised.
- Sloane did?

406
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,737
For thinking I'd mailed him
the wrong guy. Imagine that.

407
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,865
Your reward is destroying
the Badenweiler plant?

408
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:01,744
Sloane says Hensel's producing
supplies for neo-Nazi terrorists.

409
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,205
Such a load.
Sloane wants the vaccine tech.

410
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:07,041
Why? He thinks he has the formula.

411
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:10,086
It took Hensel five years
to go to prototype.

412
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,046
Sloane wants to skip that step.

413
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:16,967
- How's Kelvin?
- Home with his family.

414
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:20,346
Arm in a cast. He'll be fine.

415
00:35:20,429 --> 00:35:23,182
- What about Schiller?
- On his way to the Mid West

416
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,392
with 200,000 grand
of Sloane's money.

417
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:28,187
- Of all of us, he's the luckiest.
- That's for sure.

418
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:30,815
What's my counter?

419
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:34,235
Break into the building.
Dixon sets the explosives.

420
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:37,530
You retrieve the inhaler
and rendezvous with the CIA team

421
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:41,158
which will be inside the building.
They will switch the inhaler.

422
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,953
By then, Dixon should have
exited the building.

423
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,621
You disable the explosive.

424
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:48,791
The CIA team searches
the main computer system.

425
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,709
You'll just steal their files?

426
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:52,920
This isn't sanctioned research.

427
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:55,506
Langley wants to know
what Hensel is up to.

428
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,884
I get out with the inhalers,
Dixon tries to blow the charge.

429
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:01,554
- Nothing happens.
- Security's on their way.

430
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:04,265
- We can't get back in.
- That's the plan.

431
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,271
You alright?

432
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,775
What do you know about case 332L?

433
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:25,411
There's some missing pages
in my father's personnel file,

434
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:28,831
and references to case 332L.

435
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:30,749
And Agent Calder.

436
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,586
- You read that, too?
- Yeah.

437
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:37,673
It sparked my curiosity. I went
to Records to retrieve the file.

438
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:40,426
It was missing.
No record of it anywhere.

439
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,138
There's one more thing.

440
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,433
Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI.

441
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:52,188
Why would the FBI
be working with my father?

442
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,649
They wouldn't.

443
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:02,323
Unless they suspected him
of selling secrets.

444
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:15,336
Yeah. To Hancock Park
Homeowners' Association meeting.

445
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:17,546
No, after county records.

446
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,507
You know what? I'm on my cell.

447
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,927
You're breaking up. Can't hear.

448
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:29,642
Yeah, Will Tippin.
Escorza, what's up, man?

449
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,395
No, I didn't get a fax.

450
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:39,235
Are you sure it was Kate Jones?
Where was she headed?

451
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:40,986
Sao Paulo?

452
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:44,782
Her social security number?
Give me her number.

453
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,036
What?

454
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,848
Let's go.

455
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,662
- I'm going for the inhaler.
- I'll see you outside in ten.

456
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,639
- Mr Tippin?
- Yes.

457
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:34,391
I'm Kate Jones.

458
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,996
Forgive me
if I ask you anything too intrusive.

459
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,790
- It's sort of my job.
- It's OK.

460
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:44,128
Can you tell me what your
relationship was with Daniel Hecht?

461
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,674
Miss Jones?

462
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:52,595
Danny and I were having an affair.

463
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,397
- Sorry I'm late.
- Not at all. Let's see what you got.

464
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,526
These are 45s? I need three of 'em.

465
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:10,237
- So you're Bristow?
- Yeah.

466
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:15,075
Vaughn's told me about you.
He likes you. He respects you.

467
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,999
- I've got a bomb to disengage.
- Please.

468
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:25,127
We'd appreciate it.
We'll be about ten more minutes.

469
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:29,799
I twisted my ankle
and went to University Hospital.

470
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:32,676
Danny treated me
and he asked me out.

471
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:36,680
- Danny asked you out?
- Yeah.

472
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,474
I knew he was seeing someone,

473
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:41,352
but I wasn't really thinking
so much about her.

474
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:55,616
Syd, come on.

475
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:13,426
We talked about going
to Hong Kong together.

476
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:15,469
At the last minute, he broke it off.

477
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:21,100
That's all it was, really.

478
00:42:21,183 --> 00:42:24,687
One of those relationships
that just happen until they don't.

479
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,856
I see.

480
00:42:32,736 --> 00:42:34,989
Anything else that you wanna know?

481
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:37,783
Yeah, actually,
there is one more thing.

482
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:41,745
I have a contact
who tracked your credit card

483
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:44,290
from another one of your flights
out of LAX.

484
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:47,376
From that, they got
your social security number.

485
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,796
I did a trace on it.
Here's what doesn't make any sense.

486
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:57,887
Kate Jones, you died in 1973.

487
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:03,976
I have to go.

488
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:06,187
Who are you?

489
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,938
Who the hell are you?

490
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:12,902
- Got 'em.
- Is everyone out?

491
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,070
We're good.

492
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,126
Come on, we gotta go.

493
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,255
Dixon, we don't have time to go back.
What are you doing?

494
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:36,133
I brought a secondary detonator,

495
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:39,095
in case there was a frequency jam,
like in Peru.

496
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:41,305
Did you get the inhalers?

497
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:44,558
Good to go?

498
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,195
Let's go.

499
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,285
Sydney? We've gotta run.

500
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:08,541
Sydney, we've gotta move. Now.

501
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,876
Sydney.
