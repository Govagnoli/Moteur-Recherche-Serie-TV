1
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:07,174
We were driving on Mulholland -- you know, all the curves,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,883
and we come around this corner, and the sun's right in our eyes.

3
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:11,920
Egg whites?

4
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,577
Sure. Thanks.

5
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:14,978
So the sun's in your face?

6
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,441
Completely blinding me.

7
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:19,481
And the first thing he does without even thinking about it,

8
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,422
- he slaps down the...
- Visor.

9
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:24,081
Yeah, the visor. So the sun's not in my eyes.

10
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,824
And I just thought, that was so sweet.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,430
He really likes you.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,090
He's so funny.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,690
You're not gonna break his heart, though, right?

14
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:35,917
Me?

15
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,665
Eric's a friend. You know what I mean.

16
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,132
No, I like him, too.

17
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,003
- But?
- But nothing.

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,840
- Hello?
- Yeah?

19
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:50,735
Yeah, I'll be there.

20
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,501
We'll eat later.

21
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:54,870
She compared you to ice cream?

22
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,998
Yeah, vanilla swiss almond, which is a really significant flavor.

23
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,327
I'm not saying it's not.

24
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:00,605
And then she said that I'm this big spoonful.

25
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:01,832
Which you took as a compliment?

26
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,187
I take everything she says as a compliment. She's got that great accent.

27
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:07,129
I don't know. I can't even look at this girl, she's so pretty.

28
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:09,216
Nadia's great. I know that, all right?

29
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,874
But you might want to just consider taking it slow.

30
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,151
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's with the warning?

31
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,473
Sally Vincent.

32
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,646
Sally -- that was a completely different story.

33
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,114
How is that different? When it ended, you were all, like, weird.

34
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,055
Weird how?

35
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,849
You were building ships in bottles.

36
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:25,889
You built many, many ships in many bottles over many, many months.

37
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,430
Yeah, that's called a hobby.

38
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:29,421
A hobby? You locked yourself in a closet for a month.

39
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,316
Tell me you don't still think about how I got those ships in the bottles.

40
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:32,450
- Hey.
- Hi.

41
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:33,723
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,948
What's going on?

43
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,462
We got called in, but they've been in there all morning.

44
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,414
That's weird.

45
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:40,212
What do you think it is?

46
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:41,201
We don't know.

47
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,188
Here we go.

48
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,967
As you know, my position here at A.P.O.

49
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:02,675
is contingent upon an agreement I made with director Chase's office last year.

50
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,749
That agreement includes a short list

51
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:09,687
of operatives with whom I am not authorized to engage.

52
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:13,011
So that if a mission arose that involved any of these people,

53
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,478
I am to immediately recuse myself.

54
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,185
I am to step down.

55
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,901
Well, that day has come.

56
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,315
So as of now, I am giving full operational authority

57
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,355
over your next assignment to Jack Bristow.

58
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:34,196
I would ask for your cooperation in not involving me at all.

59
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,307
Good luck.

60
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,079
So, what, he's not coming back?

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,668
When this matter is resolved, yes.

62
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:47,228
If Sloane can't touch this case,

63
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,362
then why did they assign it to his task force?

64
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,667
Because of Sydney.

65
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:54,135
Our target is someone with whom several of you are quite familiar.

66
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,883
- Who is it?
- Anna Espinosa.

67
00:02:58,284 --> 00:02:59,418
I thought--

68
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,470
- She's supposed to be dead.
- So are a lot of people.

69
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,598
Who is she?

70
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:07,113
Former soviet agent raised in Cuba.

71
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,575
Used to be K-Directorate.

72
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,234
Four days ago, our London listening post

73
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:13,655
intercepted chatter about a dead drop from a suspected terrorist group.

74
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:17,312
Satellite surveillance of the specified location revealed this.

75
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:25,537
Marshall.

76
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,192
Thank you.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,792
And congratulations on the, uh...

78
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,758
Uh, now, I pulled the files on miss Espinosa.

79
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,603
She specializes in close-quarter kills,

80
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,880
strangulation, edged weapons, guns,

81
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,250
high-level theft, security breech --

82
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,558
She spent six years on Interpol's most-wanted list.

83
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,356
Six and a half, actually.

84
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,867
Did the --

85
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,811
After she left K-Directorate, she went freelance.

86
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:48,751
Worked for the highest bidder.

87
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,979
You know, give her the dough, she'll give you the show.

88
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:55,593
She's also associated with the followers of Rambaldi.

89
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,770
Intel indicates Anna's making contact with an associate

90
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,715
in Brussels 36 hours from now...

91
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:04,877
Excuse me.

92
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,933
Concerning an assignment --

93
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,044
Sydney?

94
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,118
You want us to surveille the meet.

95
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:16,383
Yes.

96
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:17,798
You, Marshall, and Dixon.

97
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,020
Given your familiarity with Anna's methods,

98
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,182
I want you to track her movements.

99
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,887
Find out what the assignment is.

100
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,066
If  the opportunity presents itself,

101
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,677
you're authorized to bring her in.

102
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:31,243
The category of force you choose to exercise will remain classified.

103
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,204
When do we leave?

104
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,998
We're arranging a jet for this evening.

105
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:39,084
You'll have 20 hours in country to coordinate before the meet.

106
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:40,863
That's all.

107
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,491
- What happened?
- I don't know.

108
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:50,333
Are you okay?

109
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,311
I got lightheaded.

110
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:55,077
We  have a while before we have to leave.

111
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:56,637
Do you want to grab something to eat?

112
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,388
Sure.

113
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:01,130
It was just me and Anna in the middle of the stadium.

114
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,881
I have the key, she has the box.

115
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,906
We needed to work together to get the code.

116
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:08,882
But there she is right next to me.

117
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,734
All I kept thinking was, I could take her out right now.

118
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,482
End it once and for all.

119
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:15,995
That wasn't your assignment.

120
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:20,041
Not that night.

121
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:25,583
But I swore to myself if I ever had the chance again, I would not hesitate.

122
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,421
This can't be easy for you.

123
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,734
I'm not worried about me.

124
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,277
What's going on with you?

125
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:40,975
I know only a few things about Rambaldi.

126
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:43,727
I know he was a prophet, 15th century.

127
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,860
I know my father was --

128
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,803
is -- I don't know, obsessed with him.

129
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:53,313
Last year, when my father connected me to Rambaldi,

130
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,874
I started to hallucinate, and...

131
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,659
I saw something awful.

132
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:02,901
Sounds and fast images --

133
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,988
they went by quickly, but...

134
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:11,224
there was one vision that felt so real.

135
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:12,785
What was it?

136
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:17,412
We were both together,

137
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:20,015
scared and upset,

138
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,944
holding guns

139
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,718
aimed at each other.

140
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,588
And I remember my hands were shaking.

141
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,900
And I pulled the trigger.

142
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:38,034
Blood was pouring down your chest, and...

143
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,390
I wanted to say I was sorry,

144
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,610
but you just looked at me

145
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,270
as if you'd been expecting it.

146
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,380
As if you knew all along...

147
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:54,008
knew I was going to kill you.

148
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,397
I know I must sound insane.

149
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:04,054
Nadia, there's something I should have told you.

150
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,335
Miss Bristow?

151
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,123
There's a call for you.

152
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:17,655
- Hi.
- Here you go.

153
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:19,937
Hello?

154
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,318
Hello, Sydney.

155
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:26,650
Anna.

156
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:28,866
Turn around.

157
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,974
I'd advise against any action.

158
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,631
My associates wouldn't like that.

159
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:55,051
There's something I need you to do for me, Sydney.

160
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:03,373
I must say, I have been looking forward to working with you again.

161
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,427
Anna has Nadia.

162
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,560
She knew she was going to be intercepted in Brussels, so she took her.

163
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,169
If I don't do what she says,

164
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:46,157
dad, she's going to kill my sister.

165
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:04,997
If we don't meet her demands,

166
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,085
Anna Espinosa claims she'll kill Nadia.

167
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,359
We have 18 hours to comply.

168
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,204
What are her demands?

169
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,527
She wants me to take the meet in Brussels posing as her.

170
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,995
I'm to retrieve a package from a man named Milos Sabine.

171
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,128
If I deliver it to her --

172
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,355
a boutique in Beverly Hills -- by a specified time,

173
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,869
she claims she'll let Nadia go.

174
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,862
Sydney, scrap the surveillance op in Brussels.

175
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:22,374
Get with Marshall to coordinate new parameters.

176
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,458
You're going in as Anna Espinosa.

177
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,140
Dig up everything you can about Sabine --

178
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,322
business associates, last-known whereabouts, the works.

179
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,692
Coordinate with Langley.

180
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:31,444
We'll need total satellite coverage of the meeting point.

181
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:34,057
I want sniper teams and full ground support ready to go.

182
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:34,573
On it.

183
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,277
We'll wheels up within the hour.

184
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,114
Approaching the metro station.

185
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:50,346
Do you see anyone?

186
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,235
White male, late 70s.

187
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:53,601
There's no photo in his file,

188
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:56,357
but based on estimated date of birth, this could be our guy.

189
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,494
This time of year does terrible things to my hair.

190
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,780
Miss Espinosa.

191
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,471
How I wish that I were younger.

192
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:17,580
Do you have the package?

193
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:21,283
What your associates have requested of me is...

194
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,076
highly valuable.

195
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:28,061
I would like to make sure that I get my money's worth.

196
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:33,958
Are you prepared to reach your end?

197
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm always prepared once apprised of the specifics.

198
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,373
30 minutes ago a man entered the Hotel Metropol.

199
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,505
He is currently enjoying a 17-year-old Scotch

200
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:48,781
in  the bar located in the west lobby of the hotel.

201
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,916
The man's name is Willem Karg.

202
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,602
This is the man.

203
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,417
The man you are to kill.

204
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:03,396
I will require photographic evidence of his corpse,

205
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,200
plus what I understand is your keepsake --

206
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,669
his right index finger.

207
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:15,787
I will be sitting on this bench for the next 40 minutes.

208
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,473
Return within that time, and you will get your package.

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,038
After that, I will not be sitting on this bench.

210
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,839
Tick-tock, miss Espinosa.

211
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,209
Hotel Metropol -- seven blocks away.

212
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:36,293
We have 32 minutes.

213
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:37,613
Marshall, how are we doing on Karg?

214
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:38,746
Do you have anything on him yet?

215
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:39,641
On its way.

216
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,902
It's a rather large file.

217
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:44,041
We got it.

218
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,581
This guy's wanted in four different countries.

219
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,525
Money laundering, kidnapping, conspiracy.

220
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,514
Affiliations -- russian and chinese organized crime syndicates.

221
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,171
Known associates -- Anton Matteo and Peter Giger.

222
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,258
Solicitation for prostitution, three charges.

223
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,010
This guy's got a real thing for hookers.

224
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:57,479
Wait.

225
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:18,376
There you are, ma'am. Room 1132. Two keys.

226
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,856
Will you be needing any help with any bags?

227
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,350
No, thank you. I'm traveling light.

228
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,554
Willem?

229
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,942
Ja?

230
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:55,448
Do you know how hard it has been to find you?

231
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,557
If I knew you were looking, I would have made it a lot easier.

232
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,980
Matteo said you were not drinking anymore, you bad boy.

233
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,972
I won't tell Matteo.

234
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:10,996
How do you know my business partner?

235
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,984
Who do you think sent me to you?

236
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,126
I am Matteo's early birthday present.

237
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,594
Really?

238
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:26,607
He wouldn't tell me how old you were.

239
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,783
He knows I don't usually...

240
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:33,998
work with older men.

241
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,453
You don't seem so old.

242
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,493
Thank you so much.

243
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,765
We have a room.

244
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,075
Shall we?

245
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:49,441
So it's happy birthday to me, ja?

246
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,417
Great, beautiful arms.

247
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,142
I love... arms.

248
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,804
Hey, what -- what is this?

249
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,028
It's your lucky day.

250
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:02,922
You get to live.

251
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,291
We're gonna need that ring.

252
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,279
And the finger it's on.

253
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,744
What's happening?!

254
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,667
There are people out there who want you dead.

255
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:10,277
Fortunately for you, we're not them.

256
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:13,126
When this is over, you're gonna walk out of this hotel and disappear.

257
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:14,307
You'll thank us for it later.

258
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:16,823
What are you doing? Aah!

259
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,747
You look like her.

260
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:28,956
Your mother.

261
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,895
Don't waste your time trying to scare me.

262
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,467
You are scared.

263
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,814
I would be scared, too,

264
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,230
if I did not understand what this was all about.

265
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:48,473
She told me about you.

266
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,497
Sydney.

267
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,991
I know enough.

268
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:56,783
Your sister -- she's a curse.

269
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,227
You see what happens, don't you?

270
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,589
To everyone she loves.

271
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:06,559
One day you will be asked to pay the price.

272
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:13,314
Today you will feel a little bit of that.

273
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,407
Please! Please!

274
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,969
There must be another way! Please!

275
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,147
We've got nine minutes left.

276
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,708
Keep him quiet.

277
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:37,317
Yeah.

278
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:38,565
Please!

279
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,080
Bite this. Bite this.

280
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,870
- You got him?
- Yeah.

281
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:43,752
Look at me.

282
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,693
Look at me.

283
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:48,062
Look at me. Look at me.

284
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:48,905
Look at me.

285
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,629
What are you people doing?

286
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:07,379
Don't move.

287
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:27,559
Your reputation is well-earned.

288
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,880
I still wish I were younger.

289
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:41,868
You should let your associates know that this

290
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,717
is the last remaining sample.

291
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:48,602
They should treat it as if it were sacred.

292
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,725
Absolutely.

293
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,062
I've got it. I'm on my way.

294
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:01,802
This is a gift from me...

295
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,353
to you...

296
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:07,013
to Sydney.

297
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:10,936
Every time she looks at you,

298
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,011
I want her to think of me.

299
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,666
And one day,

300
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,465
whether  you choose to or not,

301
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,877
you will help me destroy her.

302
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,854
The lab confirmed

303
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,507
it's the Dante compound --

304
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,784
a super-rare phosphorous-based putty.

305
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,104
But not the same kind of putty

306
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:38,335
you'd use on the newspaper to copy "beetle bailey" out of --

307
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:39,799
you ever do that with --

308
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,692
Anyway, it's completely harmless on its own.

309
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,828
But when mixed with certain nerve agents -- VX gas in particular --

310
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,815
boo-yah-ca!

311
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,042
It mutates the neurotoxins,

312
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:51,323
causing them to self-replicate at a rate that would be, like, historic.

313
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:54,592
We'll have to secure all chemical laboratories that manufacture VX.

314
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:57,145
How long would it take you to construct a fake?

315
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:58,891
A fake?

316
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,787
You mean like something that would actually pass as the real thing?

317
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,777
Sydney's meeting with Anna in 30 minutes.

318
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:06,478
Turning this over to her is not the ideal option.

319
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,180
Can you do it?

320
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,573
No. Absolutely not, no.

321
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,209
Okay, probably.

322
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,523
But, listen, one more thing.

323
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,608
I know this isn't, you know, like my province,

324
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:18,553
but I think I have an idea who Anna's working for.

325
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:22,450
There's this fringe terrorist cell called the Cadmus Revolutionary Front.

326
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:23,534
Yeah, they're former Covenant.

327
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:25,429
Right, so I don't need to tell you how -- do you?

328
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,944
Yes, I know who they are.

329
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,692
Well, turns out the CRF --

330
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,921
they've been trying to acquire the Dante compound for over a year.

331
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,719
I think they're trying to build a chemical bomb.

332
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,280
I read the Echelon report on the CRF.

333
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:36,413
We don't know what their agenda is.

334
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,860
Then we increase our knowledge base.

335
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:40,375
Figure a way to penetrate the CRF and determine their motives.

336
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:42,175
Well, we actually have somebody in custody

337
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:43,918
with CRF connections,

338
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:45,576
considering their Covenant ties and all.

339
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:47,032
Oh, god.

340
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:50,721
If we give Anna a fake, she will kill Nadia. You know that.

341
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,691
Turning over the compound would be irresponsible,

342
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:53,967
not to mention unnecessary.

343
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,338
My responsibility is to get Nadia back --

344
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,944
safe, alive.

345
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,458
He's right, Sydney.

346
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:00,967
What are you talking about?

347
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,523
I'm trying to save your daughter.

348
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,847
Giving Anna the compound is an unnecessary risk.

349
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:07,922
Unnecessary?

350
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,529
She won't kill her.

351
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,231
It's not her destiny.

352
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:14,492
Please tell me this is not about what I think it is.

353
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:15,718
If you had faith,

354
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:17,657
you would know what I know.

355
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,551
Faith in a 15th century lunatic?

356
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:23,450
Dad, please tell me Rambaldi is not dictating procedures.

357
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,451
He has no authority here,

358
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,963
and I know Anna better than anyone.

359
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,762
That's why you chose me for this mission.

360
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,992
Dad, please, I need to get my sister back.

361
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:38,621
Thank you.

362
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,142
You shouldn't be here, Arvin.

363
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

364
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:55,777
Where are you going?

365
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,386
I'll tell you later. When's the meet with Anna?

366
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:58,696
Now.

367
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,655
Nadia's gonna be okay.

368
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,465
I just want the ghosts to go away.

369
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,693
Tell me about it.

370
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:37,011
Here.

371
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,362
Nice work.

372
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,985
You aren't even gonna look at it?

373
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:44,448
I trust you.

374
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,480
You wouldn't try to deceive me, would you?

375
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,962
Where's my sister?

376
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,087
Wait five minutes after my exit,

377
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,980
then go to the fourth floor of the parking structure across the street...

378
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:10,433
or my friends will blow a hole in your heart.

379
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,137
Get your hands off me.

380
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,890
It was nice getting to know your sister.

381
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,898
Dispatch, I need backup.

382
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,048
She can have the blouse.

383
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,479
Are you okay?

384
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,293
Open it up.

385
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:10,084
- Procedure dictates --
- We're old friends.

386
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,044
Actually, given our shared intimacies with your late wife,

387
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,889
I may even go so far as to say that we're family.

388
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:34,104
Mr. Vaughn, your timing is impeccable.

389
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,687
The last of my broken bones is finally healed,

390
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,490
and I sit before you a fresh candidate for your aggression.

391
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:44,769
Before we begin whatever inquisition you're here for, there is a

392
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,472
pesky question that's been lingering in my head.

393
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:48,839
Do you mind?

394
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,245
Go ahead.

395
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:54,213
Was it the infidelity or the espionage

396
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,014
that motivated you to kill the woman I loved?

397
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,739
The woman you loved?

398
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:01,343
Yes. Loved.

399
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:06,079
You know, she once actually told me that she longed to love you,

400
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:13,960
but the mundane existence you provided couldn't hold a candle to my passion.

401
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:18,580
That wasn't for sleeping with the woman I was married to.

402
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:20,046
I couldn't care less about her.

403
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:22,349
Then what? The torture?

404
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:23,864
This is how it's gonna be,

405
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,276
and I'm only going to give you one shot at this.

406
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:30,691
The CRF -- they've hired Anna Espinosa. They're building a bomb.

407
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,661
Why have they made repeated attempts to contact you?

408
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:37,214
- So it's begun.
- What has?

409
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,343
Wouldn't you like to know.

410
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:40,378
Well, you're gonna tell me

411
00:24:40,518 --> 00:24:42,368
what they're planning and where they're located.

412
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,597
And if you're fishing for some type of pardon agreement,

413
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:45,869
it's not in the cards.

414
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:48,335
But I am willing to provide you certain amenities

415
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:51,327
that will make your life in confinement a little more comfortable.

416
00:24:51,887 --> 00:24:55,072
I see your bargaining skills have gone the way of your manhood.

417
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,770
Let me rephrase that.

418
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,045
I'd be willing to leave you with what you already have

419
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:01,370
and not make your life more uncomfortable.

420
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,230
I don't see that there's much left to take away.

421
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:06,647
You stonewall me,

422
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:09,246
and I'll have you shipped to Alder penitentiary,

423
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:13,333
and I'll have you secured in darkened solitary till the end of days.

424
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:16,798
24/7 in a pitch black cell with zero human contact

425
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,360
is a slow way to die,

426
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:21,850
especially with all the demons you've got in your closet.

427
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,266
And believe me,

428
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,260
they will come knocking.

429
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,987
I regret to inform you, mr. Vaughn...

430
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,555
I'm not afraid of the dark.

431
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,374
You should be.

432
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm having you transferred to Alder tonight.

433
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,322
How did he respond?

434
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:10,644
As expected.

435
00:26:11,157 --> 00:26:13,054
We'll send in the surgical team this evening.

436
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:29,507
What did she do to you?

437
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:30,588
I'll be okay.

438
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:32,288
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:33,788
I should go.

440
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:47,004
Hey.

441
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,784
I'm so glad you're all right.

442
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:53,253
Thank you, Sydney.

443
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,510
The doctor's waiting.

444
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,569
The tissue in the scorched region's completely macerated,

445
00:26:59,662 --> 00:27:01,177
so we'll have to graft new skin.

446
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,098
But we can fix this.

447
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:04,269
Thank you.

448
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,351
I'll be back in a minute and dress it for you.

449
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,079
We're gonna find Anna.

450
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,969
We know who she's working for now. We're tracking her down.

451
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:15,246
She said things about us.

452
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:17,558
That we'll be torn apart.

453
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:19,702
What does that mean?

454
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,871
When mom died,

455
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,717
I requested clearance to her files.

456
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,893
I got it.

457
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,729
There was an audio tape --

458
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:32,481
surveillance from a hotel room in Hamburg.

459
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:34,543
She was talking to a man.

460
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,390
His voice was never identified.

461
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,228
She was describing the symbology of this --

462
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:43,038
the mark of Rambaldi.

463
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:46,123
She said the outer markings represented her two daughters.

464
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:52,446
The center is the object over which they will do great battle...

465
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:56,073
with each other.

466
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:58,150
Those were her words.

467
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,784
And then mom went quiet.

468
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:07,348
It was almost like the next part was too painful.

469
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,192
Tell me.

470
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:09,563
Nadia, it's insane.

471
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,359
What?

472
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:14,836
According to Rambaldi, only one of the daughters will survive.

473
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,709
I am not going to lie to you.

474
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:21,595
Some of the predictions Rambaldi made have come true.

475
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,579
So if -- if you want to go back...

476
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,215
To Argentina?

477
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:34,322
Do you believe in all this? Rambaldi?

478
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:36,423
No.

479
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:41,503
But the people who do are dangerous.

480
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,823
They're zealots

481
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,527
who will stop at nothing to make their visions into reality.

482
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:46,994
Are you kidding me?

483
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:52,453
Change my life because some freakshow made a prediction 400 years ago?

484
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,558
Anna contrived to tear us apart

485
00:28:57,212 --> 00:29:00,444
to make some ridiculous prophecy come true.

486
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,842
But we're together now.

487
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:56,225
Sark's being transported to Alder tonight.

488
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Good, because his tracking device is in.

489
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,954
That anaesthetic gas --

490
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:02,039
totally knocked Sark out. Didn't know what hit him.

491
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,171
How many hours until the delayed activator goes hot?

492
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:04,970
24.

493
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:08,182
Oh, and if the CRF tries to run a countersurveillance sweep on Sark,

494
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,689
no detecto.

495
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,581
That's not the only modification that mr. Bristow authorized.

496
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,071
The tracker is packed with a high-density explosive.

497
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:20,812
Just enough to blow off his melon in case he tries to go off-book.

498
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:23,913
You mess with a friend of Flinkman,

499
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,235
you're messing with Flinkman.

500
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:26,652
Good job, Marshall.

501
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,624
This is transport team Alpha.

502
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,851
We have secured the prisoner, and we are en route.

503
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,553
E.T.A., 0600.

504
00:30:58,393 --> 00:30:59,337
Copy that!

505
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:18,571
Put your head down! Shoot!

506
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,188
Come with me!

507
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:37,837
Come on!

508
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,704
Quickly! Go!

509
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:47,438
Get in back!

510
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,703
There is change of clothes!

511
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,557
Alpha, do you copy?

512
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:07,864
You got a minute?

513
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,755
We picked up chatter on a meet scheduled between the CRF

514
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,937
and an administrator at the Shilanost chemical labs in Estonia --

515
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:14,687
Jan Vorich.

516
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,248
Shilanost was a soviet-run facility. Marginal security at best.

517
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:21,376
Theft of a level-4 toxin could go unnoticed there for years.

518
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:23,557
It's probably just a meet, but

519
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:25,623
if Anna's there,

520
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:28,937
this would be our best shot at getting her back in our sights.

521
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:40,152
Take Nadia with you. Observation only.

522
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:42,709
If Vorich has a sample of VX,

523
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,078
I want you to find out where it is.

524
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,829
This is a surveillance,

525
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,173
not a boxing match.

526
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:52,109
Can I trust you to maintain your professionalism?

527
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,559
She brings out the worst in me, dad, but,

528
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,494
yes, of course.

529
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:01,284
What is it?

530
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,355
Anna never checked the sample.

531
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,745
Marshall said he couldn't have made a good fake anyway.

532
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,115
You were right, dad.

533
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,819
I was stubborn. I'm sorry.

534
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:16,622
You trusted your instincts to ensure the safe return of a fellow agent,

535
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,701
a member of your family,

536
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,447
and you succeeded.

537
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:35,366
Take the motorcycle. Get yourself to CRF headquarters.

538
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,732
What about you?

539
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:40,345
Follow protocol! Go!

540
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:55,316
Tango is in motion.

541
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:56,876
Copy that. Good work.

542
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:58,052
In the next 24 hours,

543
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:01,036
Sark should lead us to CRF headquarters.

544
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,450
We'll put a tactical team on standby.

545
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,766
For now, we wait.

546
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:10,225
Who wants to order chinese?

547
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,589
I'm starving.

548
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:13,369
Thai?

549
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,397
Indian?

550
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:18,559
Sydney?

551
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:19,779
You and your sister --

552
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:21,794
are you going after Anna?

553
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:23,786
This is highly inappropriate. Excuse me.

554
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:26,014
Come on, Sydney, you know of Anna's beliefs.

555
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,972
You know the lengths she'll go to see them realized.

556
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,816
You want to talk about beliefs?

557
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,757
This is something you want to discuss?

558
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,906
From where I'm standing,

559
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:40,133
it was your madman obsession with Rambaldi

560
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:43,602
that dragged me and Nadia into this endless pit of confusion.

561
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:45,640
So given that, let me ask you --

562
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,000
what is it you believe?

563
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:51,989
I believe that if the two of you go out on this mission,

564
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:55,679
and Anna Espinosa has her way,

565
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:01,929
that only one of you will return home alive.

566
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:16,073
It's been 24 hours. Sark's tracker is still dark.

567
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,589
I know. I'm checking the satellite, making sure it's not offline.

568
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,008
You're sure you did the insertion properly?

569
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:20,739
Come on. It's me.

570
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:23,589
I can't stress enough how critical it is that we locate CRF headquarters.

571
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,865
I know. All right? Why's everybody picking on me?

572
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:28,563
Seriously. It's hard work.

573
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,136
Okay, I got it. It's hot.

574
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:36,656
They are in South Africa. Johannesburg.

575
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,550
658 Kroner street, to be exact.

576
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:39,776
Let's move, people.

577
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:51,501
Sydney and Nadia are in Estonia pursuing Anna.

578
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:55,303
Dixon is leading a team to Johannesburg to raid CRF headquarters.

579
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:58,230
This should all be over soon.

580
00:35:58,508 --> 00:35:59,643
Thank you.

581
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,191
Maintain your perimeter cover points.

582
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,224
We need to lock this building down tight.

583
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:21,928
No one slips out.

584
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,251
We'd rather take home data on CRF, not prisoners.

585
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:25,812
Let's go. Go, go, go.

586
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:43,852
I got something.

587
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,301
Gentlemen.

588
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:10,834
Were you expecting a bigger party?

589
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:13,896
This isn't CRF headquarters.

590
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,102
You're a genius.

591
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:17,791
Where are we?

592
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:22,622
Nowhere in particular. And that's the truth.

593
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,801
Just a nice place for a chat.

594
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:30,977
Really, Michael, don't look so shocked.

595
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:33,721
You couldn't have had such low expectations of me.

596
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:38,467
Now, with regards to your previous request,

597
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:42,333
I will help you locate CRF leadership.

598
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:46,088
But as always, you must do something for me in return.

599
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,454
Why the charade?

600
00:37:47,547 --> 00:37:49,444
If you were going to cooperate, why run at all?

601
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,423
For the bubbly, of course.

602
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:14,568
We're early.

603
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,928
Who says girls can't make it anywhere on time?

604
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,461
Get comfortable.

605
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,634
Vorich.

606
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,661
All right, one down, one to go.

607
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,967
Where are you, Anna? Come on.

608
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:55,151
Let's take her.

609
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:56,045
Bad idea.

610
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,952
I was hoping we could spend a little more time --

611
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,856
Vorich had the VX gas with him.

612
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:06,511
Go!

613
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:04,436
Why is the CRF assembling this bomb? What do they have planned?

614
00:40:04,715 --> 00:40:06,088
It's no use.

615
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:08,867
You're too late.

616
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,590
Tell me!

617
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:03,081
- Oh, my god, I thought you were...
- Anna.

618
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,084
Nadia.

619
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:22,719
Oh, god. Oh, god. Don't be scared.

620
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,562
I'm right -- I'm right here.

621
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,357
It's okay. Stay with me.

622
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:29,821
Just breathe. Just stay with me.

623
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,963
Just keep breathing.

624
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,323
Nadia? Nadia?

625
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:37,598
Look at me. Look at me. Look me in the eye.

626
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,540
Don't.

627
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:39,997
Don't.

628
00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:41,823
I'm right here. Don't.

629
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:46,823
