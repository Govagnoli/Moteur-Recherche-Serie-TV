1
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:05,706
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:10,878
Seven years ago, I was recruited by a
secret branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:14,590
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:18,093
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,182
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:26,477
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,730
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:35,069
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,697
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:41,534
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,078
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,830
My father.

13
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:50,376
There's an FBI tribunal flying in.

14
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:54,421
They'll question Sydney about the
prophecy and decide the next move.

15
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:57,800
- It was just a question.
- No, it was an accusation.

16
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,511
You are questioning
my honour, my loyalty,

17
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:04,932
based on a prophecy in a book you
wouldn't have if it weren't for me.

18
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,727
Look at this. There.
"This woman will have had her effect,

19
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,105
never having seen Mount Subasio."

20
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:13,315
According to Rambaldi, the woman,

21
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,111
the subject of this prophecy,
will have never seen Mount Subasio.

22
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,530
If Sydney were to go there
and see it...

23
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:23,492
- She couldn't possibly be the woman.
- That makes sense, doesn't it?

24
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:25,661
We'll have to extract her.

25
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:34,879
The plane is ready
to take you to Italy.

26
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,172
Dad, I just drove a car
into the ocean.

27
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:40,009
I knew the police
were waiting for me.

28
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:45,014
I used the air from the tyres.
I was underwater for ten minutes.

29
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:48,017
And as that car
started to fill with water,

30
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,980
I knew what my mother
had done in the same situation.

31
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,566
- Sydney...
- Mom's alive.

32
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,153
I know it.

33
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,561
- Agent King.
- Agent Otley, please.

34
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:59,398
Tell him it's about a fugitive
the FBI has been looking for.

35
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,237
The fugitive is me.

36
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,429
I don't know
how to thank you for helping me.

37
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:35,351
Don't thank me. Devlin said the FBI
is focusing their investigation

38
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:37,561
where it should have been all along.

39
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:41,732
Instead of persecuting you, they
should have searched for your mother.

40
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:46,278
But they were convinced
she was dead.

41
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:51,367
No. While you were in Italy I did
something I've never done before.

42
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,786
I violated the CIA's trust.

43
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:56,622
I broke into Langley's
classified archives.

44
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,417
I pulled the operational file
on your mother,

45
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:05,798
to see if I could find anything that
might prove your intuition correct.

46
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:12,346
Apparently, after her accident,
an internal commission was formed

47
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:15,683
to assess the damage
she'd done to US intelligence.

48
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:22,731
The commission was comprised of
people I'd worked with at the agency,

49
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,901
but one name
stood out in particular.

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,445
20 years ago, back at the CIA,

51
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,408
you were on a commission
that investigated Laura's death.

52
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,454
When I heard that, I couldn't imagine
why you never told me.

53
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,249
Unless the commission
discovered something

54
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,418
it didn't want me to know about.

55
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,133
Laura didn't die in the accident,
did she?

56
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,642
Given my state at the time, they
thought it best that I wasn't told.

57
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,771
They don't know what happened
to her, where she went.

58
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:07,276
She could still be in this country
for all they know.

59
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,946
Dad...

60
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:15,326
I'm gonna find her. I have to.

61
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,662
Searching for that woman
will accomplish nothing.

62
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,832
- I need to know where she is.
- We're not sure she's alive.

63
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,793
- And it doesn't change what she did.
- Dad, I know.

64
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:27,922
- You expect her to say sorry?
- I don't know what to expect!

65
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:31,759
You'd better know
exactly what to expect!

66
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:36,931
What could she ever say
that would satisfy you?

67
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,611
I have this memory of my father.

68
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:55,658
I was maybe five years old.

69
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:58,118
We were camping with my mother.

70
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,247
I broke my leg.

71
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:07,503
And he picked me up
and carried me miles back to the car.

72
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,048
I remember looking up at him

73
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:15,010
and thinking he was
the strongest man in the world.

74
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:21,475
Seeing him there in the car,
looking so damaged.

75
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,269
I'd never seen him like that.

76
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:28,357
The idea that I wanna find my mother,
it scares him.

77
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:36,740
Well, I don't have a neutral point of
view, but your father's got a point.

78
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:41,287
I know, and maybe I'm being
reckless or selfish or masochistic.

79
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,374
But if my mother is alive,
then I just have to know that.

80
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,047
Can you help me get
everything the CIA has got on her?

81
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:58,053
I can't. All information on her has
been classified Omega 17 by the FBI,

82
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,598
including her connection
to the prophecy.

83
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,350
Dozens of agents
must be looking for her.

84
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,853
They won't let me be part of that.

85
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:10,316
I know you need help, but this time
I just don't have it to give.

86
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,944
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,866
Apologise to Emily for me
if I woke her.

88
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,163
Emily is used to the phone ringing
in the middle of the night.

89
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:28,125
You've been avoiding me.

90
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:33,214
When I found out that
my mother might still be alive,

91
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,092
I just needed some time
to sort it out.

92
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:39,094
I understand.

93
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,143
And now you want to know how I
could have hidden the truth from you.

94
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:49,813
No. I don't want an explanation.

95
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:54,151
I came here because
I need you to help me find her.

96
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,115
Sydney...

97
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,203
...how much do you remember
of the year

98
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:07,081
after you were told
that your mother died?

99
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:13,003
I remember just feeling
disconnected from everything.

100
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,423
My father was away on business.

101
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,134
No.

102
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:24,431
Your father spent six months
in solitary in a federal prison.

103
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:28,185
He was suspected
of being in collusion with Laura.

104
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,729
The FBI almost tried him for treason.

105
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:34,358
And even though
he was eventually vindicated,

106
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:39,113
the damage was done,
and he began to unravel.

107
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,492
- Unravel?
- He drank.

108
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,495
He started taking unnecessary risks.

109
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,500
Come on, Sydney. You know the
father he was to you all those years.

110
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,924
He took a long time to fully recover.

111
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,177
I was under direct orders
from the DCI

112
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:06,307
not to let him know that
Laura had survived the accident.

113
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,185
Unfortunately,
that also required lying to you.

114
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:17,568
Now that I know the truth,
I am removing myself from active duty

115
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,945
until I find out
what happened to her.

116
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,865
And I am in no position to allow you

117
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:26,577
to go off on what appears to be
a rogue operation

118
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,663
that would compromise the agency.

119
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:33,959
Every day you send me on operations
that could compromise this agency,

120
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:37,171
but as long as it's for SD-6,
the risk is acceptable.

121
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:40,966
It is time that SD-6
took a risk for me.

122
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:56,982
A daughter has a right
to know her mother.

123
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,487
I'll help you find her.

124
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:13,290
OK, we do not put
chocolate chips in the pancakes.

125
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,167
I got news for you. Yes, we do.

126
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,005
- Hey, guys.
- You still live here?

127
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,300
- I know.
- That finance seminar took a week?

128
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:27,304
Any questions about
offshore tax shelters, I'm your girl.

129
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:28,847
What are you doing today?

130
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:34,645
Francie's gonna take me to look for
a new tuxedo. For the awards thing.

131
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,273
- Can we come?
- Not a chance in hell.

132
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:40,359
- He's too embarrassed.
- We're definitely coming.

133
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,028
My God!
What happened to your arm?

134
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,573
On the flight back from Seattle,

135
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:49,702
this guy hit me with his carry-on,
pulling it from the overhead.

136
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:53,163
- Are these chocolate chips?
- Thank you very much!

137
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,502
We've identified Alexander Khasinau
as the person referred to

138
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,714
in underground
intelligence circles as The Man.

139
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:04,633
He controls more assets
than the Russian Mafia

140
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,761
and, thanks to
his old Cold War connections,

141
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,723
he has the legitimacy
of a fledgling government.

142
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:14,810
Sorry I'm late.
And sorry that I have hives.

143
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:20,399
I'm developing
a dermal pigmentation capsule and...

144
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:22,401
Not quite right... react...

145
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,989
Never mind. Should be gone
in a couple of hours.

146
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,407
Excuse me.

147
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:35,247
For five years
we've had two deep-cover agents

148
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,416
in the Russian embassy in Vienna.

149
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:40,002
One of them is this man, Kyle Wexler.

150
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,088
We recently received
a communiqué from Wexler,

151
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:45,758
indicating that Khasinau
has just converted

152
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,761
250 million dollars' worth
of assets into cash.

153
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,555
We need to know
what he's spending that money on.

154
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,684
He's acquired evidence
of Khasinau's transactions

155
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,479
which he's encoded onto a microchip.

156
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:01,065
He's scheduled a brush pass
at the embassy.

157
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,485
They're holding their annual
Maslyanitsa celebration.

158
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,780
We've arranged for you to attend.

159
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,699
I told you, I can't focus on...

160
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,912
Khasinau has become this agency's
top priority. It will become yours.

161
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,748
- What I have to do can't wait.
- I understand.

162
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,334
What does Khasinau
have to do with my mother?

163
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,128
He has everything
to do with your mother.

164
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:26,465
He was her superior.

165
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:30,302
When you identified him as The Man

166
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:34,098
I recalled his name
from your mother's investigation.

167
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,559
I thought,
"This has to be coincidence."

168
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,477
I did some checking.

169
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:42,982
He was her superior
back in his days at the KGB.

170
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:46,151
This is the only clue
I have to offer you.

171
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,446
Get the microchip.

172
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,994
The more we find out about Khasinau,
the closer you get to your mother.

173
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,374
Sydney!

174
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,836
- I saw you with Sloane.
- I was gonna tell you.

175
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,547
You asked Sloane
to help you find your mother?

176
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,464
Yes.

177
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:10,134
I thought you'd know
not to ask him for a favour.

178
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,304
You'll spend more time
than you care to paying it back.

179
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:17,141
- What choice do I have?
- You can choose not to go.

180
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:21,103
Dad, Khasinau was Mom's superior.

181
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:06,482
- May I have this dance?
- With pleasure.

182
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,703
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Il y a un problème.

183
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,455
Of course. What's on your mind?

184
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:23,874
Interesting development
about Khasinau.

185
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,378
I see. So you spoke to Sydney.
You have every right to be angry,

186
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,757
but... I was under orders to keep the
commission's findings confidential.

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,052
That I understand.
I don't understand why you agreed

188
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,389
to help Sydney find her mother
without consulting me.

189
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:41,809
She was gonna pursue this
with or without our blessing.

190
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,186
She'll only find disappointment.

191
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,314
That depends on
what she's expecting.

192
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:50,317
You are different people, Jack.

193
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,114
Is this affecting you
more than you admit?

194
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:58,117
I assure you,
my concern is only for Sydney.

195
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,537
Your assurances notwithstanding,

196
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,498
it would be best
if you took a break from active duty.

197
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:08,586
Just, what, a few days.
Clear your head.

198
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:13,632
I wouldn't feel comfortable
leaving Sydney alone right now.

199
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:17,887
If she were your daughter,
I'm sure you'd understand.

200
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:24,727
You should know by now that
my interest is in protecting Sydney.

201
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,231
It's always been my pleasure to fill
in for you when you were indisposed.

202
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,244
- You ready?
- Ready.

203
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,830
These earrings'll
make you look radiant.

204
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:50,085
And I mean that literally,
because once you activate them,

205
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:53,380
they emit an infrared pulse
invisible to the naked eye.

206
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:56,842
But thanks to our SOP
for high-visibility brush passes,

207
00:16:56,926 --> 00:17:00,721
the agent you're meeting will know
to wear IR-capable contacts.

208
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:03,474
That's how he'll ID you.

209
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:23,536
- Excuse me. May I cut in?
- Of course.

210
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,996
But I should warn you,
she likes to lead.

211
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,625
That's good.
Maybe I'll learn something new.

212
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:38,676
Listen to me carefully.
Wexler's dead.

213
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,804
It's only a matter of time
before my cover's blown, too.

214
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,640
- Who are you?
- Wexler's partner.

215
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:49,436
That's my ring you feel on your neck.
It's a jet-injector for a neurotoxin.

216
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,315
- I gave you the oral bona fides.
- How do I know this isn't a setup?

217
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,402
Credit Dauphine
is SD-6's front company.

218
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:58,612
Marshall runs the op-tech division.

219
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:02,867
And Sloane
is a humourless son of a bitch.

220
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:10,332
Dixon, Wexler's dead. He may have
talked. I'm going for the microchip.

221
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll have the car
brought around front.

222
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:16,297
- Is the ring one of Marshall's toys?
- I was bluffing.

223
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,675
- Were you recruited out of college?
- Yes, Berkeley.

224
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,392
- My God.
- My God.

225
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,860
This is a restricted area.

226
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,248
How you been?

227
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:02,384
- I can't believe it's you.
- Yeah.

228
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:03,928
What are we doing here?

229
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,972
Wexler was undercover
as executive secretary.

230
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,516
The ambassador
is on Khasinau's payroll.

231
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,477
- What are we looking for?
- This.

232
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,107
Khasinau ships everything through
the embassy to avoid inspections.

233
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:24,698
It's Wexler!

234
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:28,244
The ambassador did not know he had
the chip. I guess he stashed it.

235
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,704
Or he swallowed it.

236
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,844
OK, what...?

237
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:03,070
Sydney, abort. They knew we were
coming. I'll meet you out front.

238
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:07,408
We need another minute.
We almost have the microchip.

239
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:18,335
- Dammit. His stomach's empty.
- It could be in his oesophagus.

240
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,216
You wanna give me a hand here?
You spread.

241
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
A little bit wider.

242
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:30,931
- So, you've been good, generally?
- You know, work.

243
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,643
- There it is. See it?
- Got it.

244
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:03,839
- Get in.
- I'm not gonna ask.

245
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,467
- Dixon?
- Noah?

246
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,719
Let's go.

247
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,064
I'm not real anxious
to see Sloane's face

248
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:23,150
when he hears
we had to pull Noah out.

249
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,571
What choice did we have?

250
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:33,619
Do me a favour. Until he goes through
debriefing, don't get too friendly.

251
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:36,747
That's ancient history.
It was five years ago.

252
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,916
Does anybody have change?

253
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,044
There's a lady back in coach
who's about to kill me.

254
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:46,298
- I was gonna stretch my legs anyway.
- Really? Thanks.

255
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,152
I should get some sleep.

256
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,449
Syd, if you're mad, that's fine.
I understand.

257
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,328
You don't wanna talk, it's OK.
You don't have to be polite.

258
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:20,749
But I'm not mad any more and
I don't think you should be either.

259
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,253
You're not mad? What did
you ever have to be mad about?

260
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:28,841
It must have been hard when I left,
but you didn't even put up a fight.

261
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,343
What kind of fight
was I supposed to put up?

262
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:35,639
I waited for six hours. You didn't
show up. You didn't even call.

263
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:38,183
Sloane told me
you were transferred abroad.

264
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,895
- I wrote you. I wrote.
- What?

265
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:44,023
I told you to meet me in San Pedro.

266
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:46,942
- I never got a letter.
- I didn't send a letter.

267
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:50,946
I couldn't discuss my reassignment.
I encoded a message in a junk email.

268
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,491
You should have picked it up
from the subject line.

269
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,207
I always set my computer
to filter out junk email.

270
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:19,058
This constitutes a major setback.

271
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:22,478
Extracting Agent Hicks
has squandered five years' work.

272
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,564
- We didn't have a choice.
- It's not her fault.

273
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:27,775
Your investment was burned.

274
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:31,278
The same thing that happened to
Wexler would have happened to me.

275
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:34,823
The fact that we got the microchip
means he didn't die in vain.

276
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:40,037
I'll hear your report after you've
been evaluated by security section.

277
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,999
Dixon, would you escort Agent Hicks
to McCullough, please?

278
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,632
Now, I have done you
a favour, Sydney.

279
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:54,969
So should the need ever arise...

280
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:00,891
...l'm sure that
I can count on you to return it.

281
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,562
In '97 I was admitted
as a graduate student

282
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:07,439
to the Moscow Institute
for International Relations.

283
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:10,693
Worked as a courier
for the Russian embassy in Baghdad.

284
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:13,404
On the visa desk
at the consulate in Cape Town.

285
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:17,533
In November of 2001 I was put on as
an attaché at the Viennese embassy

286
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:19,702
and given a low-level clearance.

287
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:24,039
While under alias as a member
of the Russian diplomatic corps,

288
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:27,710
were you approached
by any other agency for recruitment?

289
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:30,004
- Yes.
- Which agency?

290
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:33,090
- K-Directorate.
- Did you accept their offer?

291
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:37,553
Yes, I did. They're listening
to this conversation right now.

292
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:43,183
Please answer
the question truthfully.

293
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:44,727
Of course not.

294
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:50,316
Why did you volunteer for prolonged
undercover assignment to begin with?

295
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:53,736
I fail to see how my motives
are relevant. My reasons are my own.

296
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,531
Unfortunately,
Agent Hicks, they are not.

297
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:06,415
OK.

298
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:11,253
Because I was in love, and I was
afraid to admit that to myself.

299
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:16,342
I saw that as being a sign
of weakness in this work, so I left.

300
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,890
The only reason I can speak
with any perspective about that now

301
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:25,643
is that I've had five years
to regret my mistake.

302
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:30,022
May I have the name of the person
to whom you are referring?

303
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,650
Absolutely not.

304
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:37,446
You are aware that I have
the authority to take steps

305
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,491
that will compel you to answer?

306
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:46,497
Yes, but the only other deep-cover
agent near Khasinau is dead,

307
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,083
which makes me a valued commodity.

308
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:54,838
So I suggest we limit the questions
to subjects SD-6 needs to know about.

309
00:25:56,215 --> 00:26:00,511
Besides, where I come from,
a gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.

310
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,312
Our station chief got your dead drop.

311
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:13,482
I read your debrief.
Sorry you had a rough time.

312
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:17,903
Thanks. If anything turns up
on the microchip, I'll let you know.

313
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,781
The agent you extracted, Noah Hicks.

314
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:25,578
You mentioned him in your report
when you made contact with the CIA.

315
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:28,581
We met when I was a trainee.

316
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,669
We actually dated for a while.

317
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:36,338
- Really?
- We kept it under the radar.

318
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:41,135
SD-6 discourages
fraternisation among agents.

319
00:26:41,218 --> 00:26:43,721
So does the CIA.

320
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:49,727
One more thing. Do you know
where your father's been lately?

321
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,896
I talked to him an hour ago. Why?

322
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:55,900
Kretchmer's left two call signals
for a meet. Is he OK?

323
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:10,289
Club soda, please.

324
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,380
- How'd you find me?
- Your car was still in your garage.

325
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:22,051
I thought you might have
walked somewhere close.

326
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:25,930
It's the fifth place I looked.

327
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,890
Mike, can I get the check?

328
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:40,277
Dad, it's two o'clock in the
afternoon. What are you doing here?

329
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:47,535
I think you might
wanna talk to someone.

330
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,703
Noted.

331
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:54,833
Six months ago I wasn't...

332
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,711
I didn't even know
how to talk to you.

333
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:02,591
But now at least I feel like
I can come to you and say...

334
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:08,514
What's happening between us,
Sydney, is temporary.

335
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:13,477
I'm not suggesting the person you
talk to should be me. It shouldn't.

336
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:16,146
But the CIA has counsellors.

337
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:22,361
- I think you should see one of them.
- You are not responsible for me.

338
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:25,865
It's not irrational for me
to be worried about you.

339
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,868
Keep your voice down.

340
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:43,132
I didn't think
you'd listen to my advice,

341
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:48,929
so I made it official.

342
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:55,352
I came here to pass along
an order from Devlin.

343
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,232
You're going to see a counsellor
for trauma evaluation.

344
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm sorry you had to come down.
It's my fault really.

345
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,049
We're uploading the microchip.

346
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:28,510
There's 10,000 files,
14 different languages.

347
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:31,472
Linguistics needs
all the help they can get.

348
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:35,059
- So you're cleared?
- Yeah.

349
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:37,561
You survived the debriefing.

350
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:42,441
Yes, I did. And I forgot
how much I missed McCullough.

351
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,613
Let's get started.

352
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:26,360
- So how long are you staying?
- I'm not exactly sure.

353
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:29,363
It's somewhat complicated.

354
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:32,408
- Why?
- Long story.

355
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:41,750
Remember when you had just
got back from endurance training,

356
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:44,336
before you were sent out
as a field op,

357
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,715
and you came back
and you had this incredible glow?

358
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:54,346
I remember thinking, "Man, this girl
is really having fun."

359
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:58,601
I remember being worried about that

360
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:03,439
because I knew inevitably one day
you would not feel that way.

361
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,027
You were not aware of
what you were getting yourself into.

362
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,779
You thought I'd get myself killed?

363
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:13,032
Maybe.

364
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:16,035
Is that why you left?

365
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,578
No.

366
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:24,168
You were right about one thing.

367
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:28,214
I'm not having fun any more.

368
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,638
- We're gonna be late.
- I can't find my jacket.

369
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:40,184
- I don't wanna miss the previews.
- I'm just gonna borrow one of Syd's.

370
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:44,104
- You think I bought the right tux?
- For the amount of money you spent.

371
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:47,733
What's that supposed to mean?
What?

372
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:51,195
- Didn't Syd say she went to Seattle?
- Yeah. So?

373
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:55,157
There's a return ticket
from Italy in her pocket.

374
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:58,911
- Probably from another trip.
- It's dated last week.

375
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:04,291
Why wouldn't she tell us
about a trip to Italy?

376
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:17,680
You are looking at a schematic
of a Westbury 23 supercomputer.

377
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:21,225
It's capable of making 500 trillion
calculations per second.

378
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:25,020
- Khasinau bought two of them.
- What for?

379
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:29,024
They are ideal for simulating
theoretical engineering design.

380
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:34,071
So, for example, if Khasinau has
acquired enough Rambaldi artefacts,

381
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:37,241
he may be able to assemble
these artefacts correctly

382
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:41,829
and extrapolate what missing pieces
remain from the overall design.

383
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:45,916
And that's why you need to steal
the data core. How are you?

384
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,752
May I? Thank you.

385
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:52,339
Thanks to the microchip,
we have an image of the data core,

386
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:55,342
and trust me, this core, hardcore!

387
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:58,971
It's a photo-refractive crystal cube.
It acts like a sponge.

388
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:03,350
It has enough capacity to serve as
a backup archive for both computers.

389
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:08,314
But it's gotta be kept in a cryogenic
chamber halfway to absolute zero.

390
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:12,067
It is cold enough to freeze your skin
to stone in under a minute,

391
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:14,445
even if a millimetre of it
is exposed.

392
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:19,909
Khasinau's computer complex in
Arkhangelsk is a mile underground.

393
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:23,454
The surrounding forests
are patrolled by private security.

394
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:28,042
Given this high level of security
surrounding this computer network,

395
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:32,087
it is likely that Khasinau
is using it as his primary archive.

396
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:35,299
Account numbers, old contacts,

397
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:38,344
every agent
who's ever worked for him.

398
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,638
This is a two-person operation.

399
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:43,849
You've been on assignment
a long time. I'll go.

400
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:48,521
I know the area pretty well. I did
a lot of recon there as a courier.

401
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:52,483
Noah's right.
We need every advantage on this one.

402
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:55,444
You leave in an hour.

403
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:07,540
My feet hurt.

404
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:10,084
Can we stop?
I gotta take my boots off.

405
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:13,003
Leave them on,
or your foot will swell up.

406
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:17,550
We're Americans!

407
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:27,726
You were speculating that perhaps
Sydney's desire to find her mother

408
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,272
could be interpreted
as criticism of you as a father.

409
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,732
I suppose it's understandable.

410
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:37,403
Much like a normal family
after a divorce,

411
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:40,823
when parental jealousy
is stirred over a child's affection.

412
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:45,202
And how would you define
a normal family?

413
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:48,956
I suppose it's one
in which the family members

414
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,084
aren't under orders
to lie to each other.

415
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,503
I see what you're getting at.

416
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:58,340
Maybe there's no such thing
as a normal family.

417
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,389
Well, OK, Mr Bristow.
I guess we can call it a day.

418
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,558
I prefer Jack.

419
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,897
One more thing, Jack.

420
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,194
I don't believe a single word you've
said to me over this past hour.

421
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:21,989
Don't get me wrong.
I think you're a master.

422
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:26,160
You have all your subconscious
tells under control.

423
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:29,163
You're smart enough
to struggle with words.

424
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:34,501
But I think you told me what I wanted
to hear so you could get out of here.

425
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:40,341
I also think that someone
so skilled at deception

426
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:43,260
is in danger of deceiving himself.

427
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,225
I am going to recommend
that you see me once a week.

428
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:51,644
You haven't got a clue...

429
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:55,773
what's required to lead
the kind of life I lead,

430
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:58,817
to maintain a balance
between two lives

431
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,237
and protect my daughter
in the process.

432
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,826
The kind of person who does that,
the kind of person I have to be,

433
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,581
is not the kind of person who would
come in here and talk to you.

434
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:15,834
Then I guess
we're making some progress.

435
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,714
See you next week.

436
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:39,108
Is there any chance we can contact
the American embassy?

437
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,283
- What were you taking pictures of?
- Just the scenery, I swear it.

438
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:50,828
Why don't you just take the film
and give her back the camera?

439
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,621
Just the scenery.

440
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:03,048
Keys. Take 'em.

441
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,678
Let's go.

442
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,818
Move!

443
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:39,501
- Let's go, Syd.
- I'm disengaging the core.

444
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,700
I'm in.

445
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:20,209
Don't forget to keep
that core temperature constant.

446
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,378
Got it.

447
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,760
- How are we doing?
- Almost there.

448
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,433
Got it.

449
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:07,965
- Noah, I'm freezing.
- Hang on. The system is in lockdown.

450
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,672
Wake up.

451
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:51,383
Come on.

452
00:39:57,973 --> 00:40:01,060
Good girl. Come on. Up!

453
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:16,575
Syd, come on, baby. Move.

454
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:25,292
It's weird, I don't know. Italy.

455
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,795
What if she met somebody
on a business trip?

456
00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:32,925
- Why would she keep that a secret?
- Maybe she's embarrassed by it.

457
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:35,344
Why?

458
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,304
What?

459
00:40:37,388 --> 00:40:39,807
The bruise. What if he's beating her?

460
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,978
Are you kidding me?
Sydney would never put up with that.

461
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:48,357
Maybe she's sleeping with her boss.

462
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,359
Sloane? No.

463
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:53,863
Should we just forget
that we even found the ticket?

464
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:57,408
- You think she's in trouble?
- When she gets back from...

465
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:00,119
- Where did she say she went?
- San Francisco.

466
00:41:00,202 --> 00:41:03,539
Which I'm sure she did.
We're blowing this out of proportion.

467
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:05,457
There's an explanation.

468
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:10,754
We'll ask her when
she gets back from... San Francisco.

469
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:19,305
- Did you get through?
- Yeah.

470
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:24,685
It was hard to get a signal, but
we've got an extraction set at 0800.

471
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:28,355
- That's what, six hours?
- Yeah.

472
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:34,486
We should prepare
in case Khasinau's men show up.

473
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,658
The floorboards over there lift up.
This safehouse has saved me before.

474
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:47,499
You know what would be great
right now? A fire in that fireplace.

475
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:58,302
I heard a chopper.
If it's thermal-equipped,

476
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:01,096
it'll pick up the heat signature.

477
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:09,188
What were you looking for
in that database anyway?

478
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:11,941
It's a long story.

479
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:15,361
We've got six hours, so that's good.

480
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:21,075
I was looking for information
about my mother.

481
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:24,828
- Your mother?
- A lot's happened since you left.

482
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:33,671
I wanna fill you in, but I don't know
if I feel comfortable doing that yet.

483
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:35,548
Fine.

484
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:38,050
You're still mad.

485
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,761
No.

486
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:57,778
When you left,
and you just disappeared,

487
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,158
it was a kick in the stomach,

488
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:08,414
and I carried that around
for a long time.

489
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:19,049
You were the last person that
I ever wanted to see again. Ever.

490
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:23,220
And you were the only person
that I ever wanted to see again.

491
00:43:47,286 --> 00:43:49,371
Wait.
