1
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,464
On behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency,

2
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,214
a grateful nation thanks you for your father's sacrifice.

3
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,856
This star on the wall is in some ways

4
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,563
too small a gesture.

5
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:42,113
Bill Vaughn dedicated his life in service

6
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,434
and commitment for his country.

7
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:49,181
His death in the line of duty is a tragedy for his loving wife

8
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:50,650
and his young son.

9
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,298
  

10
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:19,842
  

11
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,190
  

12
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,150
  

13
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,110
  

14
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:10,713
  

15
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:16,416
  

16
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,282
  

17
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:27,315
  

18
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,009
  

19
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,506
  

20
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,012
  

21
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:33,791
  

22
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:41,687
  

23
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,325
  

24
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:14,413
  

25
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,023
  

26
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,739
Did you see the front page?

27
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:35,981
Yeah.

28
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,008
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,401
So Laughton called me back from CIA archives.

30
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,566
- About Nightingale?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,033
- When?
- Yesterday morning.

32
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,213
Why didn't you tell me?

33
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:55,095
I was going to. He didn't find anything.

34
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:57,814
We'll keep looking.

35
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,198
I should get dressed.

36
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,186
There could be a hundred reasons

37
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:11,701
your father didn't register Nightingale with the CIA.

38
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:12,691
Yeah, I know.

39
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,349
Listen, have you seen my jacket anywhere?

40
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,004
It's a setback, but

41
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,849
there are people we can talk to.

42
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,364
No, no, there aren't.

43
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,436
Keys. Where the hell are my keys?

44
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,142
We could bring it to A.P.O. They might be able to help us track --

45
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,132
We're not bringing this to A.P.O.

46
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,744
The last thing I want is Sloane knowing I was investigating my father's death

47
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,097
and him using that against me.

48
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,609
We don't know your father's dead.

49
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,355
Yeah. At this point, I do.

50
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,061
After all the progress you've made, how can you just --

51
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:38,623
How can I just what? What have I got?

52
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:41,044
Some journals in his handwriting that shouldn't even exist?

53
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,798
And a word. One word. Nightingale.

54
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,740
What the hell does that even mean?

55
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,347
Some random woman mentioned it to me.

56
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:50,198
I would have been better off asking for the goose that lays golden eggs.

57
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:53,430
It wasn't some random woman. She was the woman who raised Nadia.

58
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,692
I want to get to the bottom of this as badly as you do.

59
00:05:56,784 --> 00:06:00,829
We always thought my mother killed your father, but what if we were wrong?

60
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,582
What if there was some other plan?

61
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:10,509
- Do you have a minute?
- Certainly.

62
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,020
I need to ask you a favor.

63
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:16,319
I was wondering if I could use your level six clearance

64
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:17,876
to look at some files.

65
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:21,001
In reference to what?

66
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,938
They're not for me. They're --

67
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,352
It's for Vaughn, actually.

68
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:27,485
I see.

69
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:34,441
A month ago, Vaughn found a journal that belonged to his father.

70
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:37,853
The entries ended in 1982.

71
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:40,844
Mom killed bill Vaughn in '79,

72
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,550
but we authenticated the handwriting.

73
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,157
That proves nothing.

74
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,528
Counterfeit artists are experts at graphoanalysis.

75
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,188
I know, but it doesn't explain Nightingale.

76
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,839
- What's Nightingale?
- We don't know.

77
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,071
Vaughn followed a lead in the journal that took him to a woman in Lisbon

78
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,631
who knew all about Vaughn's dad --

79
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,051
that he rescued Nadia when she was a baby.

80
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,659
She said that shortly after that

81
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,547
he left looking for Nightingale.

82
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,110
It could be a code name, it could be an operation.

83
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:10,282
I know I'm asking for a lot.

84
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,697
But I understand what Vaughn's going through.

85
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,398
You also know how dangerous that search can be.

86
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah, I do.

87
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,246
Thank you.

88
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,556
I appreciate you trusting me with this.

89
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:43,068
It seems like we haven't really talked since --

90
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,009
Mom died.

91
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:49,331
Feel free to come to me anytime.

92
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,534
Looks like you have an audience.

93
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,170
Not bad.

94
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,755
Nightingale is the brainchild of Dr. Josef Vlachko,

95
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,367
russian émigré we recruited into D.A.R.P.A.

96
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,458
He vanished 25 years ago after running tests on human subjects.

97
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:45,256
Nice guy.

98
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,103
When he left,

99
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:48,475
he took all the records of project Nightingale with him.

100
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:50,748
That's  why you couldn't find anything.

101
00:08:50,935 --> 00:08:53,405
D.A.R.P.A. had to cover up the security breach.

102
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,012
So if we find Vlachko,

103
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,188
we might find something on my dad.

104
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,762
Hans Dietrich, german money launderer.

105
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,017
Last year he started branching out into higher-risk investments,

106
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,961
mainly new weapons systems.

107
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,570
He funneled over a million euros

108
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,849
into an encrypted bank account labeled "Nachtigall" --

109
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:13,072
Nightingale.

110
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,268
Dietrich's  office is located in Munich.

111
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,448
He runs a beer hall on the ground floor.

112
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:22,440
If we can get to his records, we might be able to find a lead --

113
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,908
something on Vlachko. Who knows?

114
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,072
Syd, how'd you get all this?

115
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:30,256
- My dad.
- What?

116
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:32,534
- He has clearance --
- Did you tell him everything?

117
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,043
I had to.

118
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,243
How much do they know?

119
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,467
Uncertain.

120
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,921
Apparently there were journals we couldn't account for.

121
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:51,759
Hmm. Well, this should shut them down.

122
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,320
We could turn this to our advantage.

123
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,264
Let sydney and Vaughn obtain intelligence for us.

124
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,451
I see.

125
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,317
And you have no problem with that?

126
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:05,159
Of course I do.

127
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,999
But given our current obstacles,

128
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,802
they might provide a lead we couldn't get on our own.

129
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,660
All right, Jack. Give them a long leash.

130
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,300
But just so we're clear,

131
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,413
we cannot afford to be compromised,

132
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,677
not even by your daughter.

133
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,332
It won't come to that.

134
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:10,328
No, I'm fine, thanks. Don't help.

135
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,840
Ah, boo-hoo.

136
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:14,020
"I'm gonna go up north and drink wine for two days

137
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,868
while my friends stay here and work."

138
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,381
It's called accumulated vacation, man. You use it or lose it.

139
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,753
So you'll water the plants, and you'll send out --

140
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,505
Sydney, go. Have a good time.

141
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,734
You know what? We could actually drive up and meet you guys.

142
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,808
- We're busy.
- Yeah.

143
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,085
You got to eat. One meal.

144
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,880
Yeah, that's what room service is for.

145
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,490
Don't mind him. Have fun.

146
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,820
We're crazy this weekend anyway. We got plans.

147
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,666
You know, we're doing the, um, there's that, uh...

148
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:38,418
Yeah.

149
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,690
That's Dietrich.

150
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,419
He's with his bodyguards.

151
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,785
On the right is Dietrich's second-in-command, Carl Goedde.

152
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,556
This'll be fun.

153
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,196
No toys from Marshall. Cell phones instead of comms.

154
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,903
Yeah. Now all we have to do is get Dietrich alone,

155
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:18,277
convince him to show us his files on Nightingale.

156
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,358
I can get him alone.

157
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:34,886
  

158
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:40,890
  

159
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:43,405
  

160
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:45,631
  

161
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:46,847
Ja.

162
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,232
  

163
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:01,745
Yeah?

164
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,357
They're getting the check. They're almost out the door.

165
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,090
Okay, okay, I'm almost there.

166
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,945
  

167
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,907
  

168
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:29,969
  

169
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,010
  

170
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,732
  

171
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:43,764
Olga.

172
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:46,621
Komm mit mir.

173
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:52,882
Yeah?

174
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:53,899
Hey, man, quick question.

175
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,176
Eric, this is a really bad time.

176
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,689
Where are you? Is that a party?

177
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,964
Look, I'm gonna have to call you back.

178
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,812
Romantic getaway's going that good, huh?

179
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,608
Braids, fishnets. It's pretty spectacular.

180
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,170
Somebody's getting lucky tonight.

181
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:05,626
Bye!

182
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:24,472
  

183
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,056
  

184
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,076
  

185
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,580
  

186
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:39,887
Where do you keep your financial records?

187
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,257
- What?
- Your business files.

188
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:42,103
Where do you keep them?

189
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,571
God! On my computer!

190
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:45,703
Show me, or I'll break your neck.

191
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:46,644
I will.

192
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,932
Please don't hurt me.

193
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,485
The guys down here are getting pretty antsy.

194
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,458
- How you doing?
- Give me 30 seconds.

195
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:17,165
  

196
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:24,712
Uh, Mr. Goedde? Enacio Maldini, Europol liaison, organized crime unit.

197
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,031
We've received complaints --

198
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,640
Don't tell me. Take it up with our lawyers.

199
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,017
We have, and unless you want my entire office down here tomorrow, you'll listen to me.

200
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,865
   

201
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:40,190
  

202
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:41,942
  

203
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:53,855
Low wages, no overtime, rampant sexual harassment.

204
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,607
What? Sexual harassment?

205
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:08,744
Auf wiedersehen.

206
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,670
Okay, try it now.

207
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,048
It's there.

208
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,941
It's encrypted. It's gonna take a while.

209
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,215
Yeah, well, as long as it's in there.

210
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,103
Hello?

211
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,332
- Say it's Weiss.
- What?

212
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:41,279
Tell your girlfriend that it's Weiss if you want to know about your father.

213
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,243
Weiss.

214
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,765
You got lucky in Munich,

215
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,321
but Nightingale won't answer your questions.

216
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:50,406
Only I can.

217
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,529
Sherwood library. UCLA campus. Get there in an hour.

218
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,806
The library will be closed, but the side door will be open.

219
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,837
Yeah, you know what? I'll see if I can.

220
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,780
What I have is for you alone.

221
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,180
If you tell your girlfriend,

222
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,787
she'll be dead by the time you get back.

223
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:11,916
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

224
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,074
What's going on?

225
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,443
Um, nothing. He just wanted to grab a burger.

226
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,431
You should go. I'll work on this.

227
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:21,548
Besides, if Weiss gets suspicious...

228
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah, yeah, okay.

229
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:30,403
You want anything?

230
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:31,917
No, thanks, I'll grab something later.

231
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:32,905
All right. I won't be long.

232
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:35,247
Take your time.

233
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:37,872
Tell Weiss I said hi.

234
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:39,321
I will.

235
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,021
Yeah?

236
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:05,630
"Through the looking glass." The illustrated edition.

237
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,357
You've got to be kidding me.

238
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,348
Listen, if you think I'm gonna inject myself, you're out of your mind.

239
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:53,626
If I wanted you dead, I'd kill you right now.

240
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,324
You want to know about your father?

241
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,745
I give you two minutes to do the right thing.

242
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,254
I traced Sydney and Vaughn's movement. They went to Munich.

243
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,810
What did they find?

244
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,181
Undetermined at this point.

245
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,364
Jack, the plan was to let Sydney and Vaughn open doors

246
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,575
that we couldn't go through and to pull them back if they got too far.

247
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:13,554
I don't see much here in the way of containment.

248
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,830
We have an option.

249
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:17,477
I can go to Sydney, engender her trust,

250
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,611
convince her to bring the case to A.P.O.

251
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,248
Hmm. No, she's too intuitive.

252
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,559
Considering your relationship,

253
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:29,538
she'll see right through you, through us.

254
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:30,386
No, she won't.

255
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,432
I know exactly how to approach her.

256
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:47,777
- Hello?
- It's me.

257
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,470
Dad, hi.

258
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,606
I realize this is short notice, but

259
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:56,165
I was wondering if you'd join me at Miceli's this evening.

260
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:58,694
Um...

261
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,576
Is it bad timing?

262
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:01,518
No. I --

263
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:04,846
Hey, I was just hoping you might be free for dinner.

264
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,134
I'll meet you there in 30 minutes.

265
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:09,641
See you there.

266
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,172
Mr. Vaughn.

267
00:21:58,105 --> 00:21:59,098
Welcome back.

268
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:02,792
Don't worry.

269
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:03,685
It's temporary.

270
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:07,657
The paralysis should wear off in about 4 minutes, 20 seconds.

271
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:10,998
Might sting a little, though. You know, the re-entry.

272
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:13,718
Who are you?

273
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,796
A man that could tell you about your father.

274
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:18,582
But first what I want.

275
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:22,427
That intel you stole from Dietrich will lead you to Nightingale.

276
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:26,272
What I'm interested in is the transforming coil inside Nightingale.

277
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:29,225
Are you out of your mind?

278
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:34,421
I'm not the one who injected myself with an unknown substance.

279
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,532
So now that we've established your desperation,

280
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,696
it's a matter of how far you're willing to go.

281
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,494
Why should I believe anything you say?

282
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:46,906
Phillip Burke.

283
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,933
B-U-R-K-E.

284
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,420
Who's that?

285
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,699
You look him up.

286
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,246
And when you're done, you contact me.

287
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,920
One time only.

288
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:04,687
Make it count.

289
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:33,740
Thanks for coming.

290
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,923
I took the liberty of ordering a bottle of pinot noir.

291
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:39,999
Okay.

292
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:49,484
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

293
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:51,108
So...

294
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,025
Yes.

295
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:54,905
Everything okay?

296
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,339
It's fine.

297
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,061
How's your investigation going? Vaughn's father?

298
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,395
It's complicated, actually.

299
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:05,896
You found something?

300
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,660
The  intel on the hard drive makes it seem like

301
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,128
Nightingale is an active project.

302
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:13,878
Active?

303
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:17,397
Vlachko was running it out of an abandoned nuclear reactor in Siberia.

304
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:20,689
He's jerry-rigged enough nuclear power to drive what he needs.

305
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:21,393
For what purpose?

306
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:24,533
I'm not sure exactly, but the experiments are molecular.

307
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,668
They're altering human DNA.

308
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:31,121
There was a list of over a dozen human test subjects.

309
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:32,491
All of them died.

310
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,150
There's mention of the genetic markers AD9,

311
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,284
but I don't know what it all means.

312
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,478
Sydney, you have to bring this to A.P.O.

313
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:44,564
Not until I talk to Vaughn.

314
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:47,365
Vaughn doesn't know that people may be dying because of it.

315
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,563
I gave you level six clearance because I trusted you.

316
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,364
I'm asking you to trust me now.

317
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,234
Bring this to A.P.O.

318
00:24:56,886 --> 00:25:01,027
If you really want to find answers, use the resources A.P.O. can provide.

319
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:08,237
You have to discuss this with Vaughn first. I respect that.

320
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,320
But the longer you keep this off-book,

321
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,764
the worse this will look for both of you.

322
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:17,046
The only way to proceed is honestly, above board.

323
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,178
Promise me you'll tell Vaughn that.

324
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,438
I promise.

325
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,511
- She told you this?
- Yes.

326
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:31,822
Hmm.

327
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,330
For 20 years, Josef Vlachko has been off the grid.

328
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:38,032
Now we find him through Sydney, of all people.

329
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,762
Well, I have to hand it to you, Jack.

330
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:47,164
I never thought that you would be capable of exploiting your own daughter.

331
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,850
I certainly couldn't do that.

332
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:54,406
I could have a strike team on the ground in Siberia in 72 hours.

333
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,539
That's a foolish course of action.

334
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,268
Vlachko's our strongest lead to Yelena Derevko.

335
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:02,994
With this intel, we need to act quickly.

336
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,272
Sydney cannot know that I've betrayed her confidence.

337
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:07,455
We wait for her to bring this in.

338
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:10,975
And if she doesn't?

339
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,823
She will. I asked her to.

340
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:18,662
When she does, we'll draw up an ops plan requiring me to go along on the mission.

341
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:19,954
Once there,

342
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:23,609
I'll interrogate Vlachko without Sydney or Vaughn knowing.

343
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:27,074
If our assumption is correct, Vlachko is communicating with Yelena.

344
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:31,619
Once you've completed the interrogation, he needs to be eliminated.

345
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,917
That's a little extreme, don't you think?

346
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,672
No, I consider it a necessary precaution.

347
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,319
He could alert Yelena to our agenda,

348
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,488
or even worse,

349
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:44,568
he could talk to Sydney,

350
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,892
which would be a disaster.

351
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:48,686
Unless, of course,

352
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:52,432
you want to destroy everything we've worked for.

353
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:12,796
"Phillip Burke killed in Laos. 10/21/79."

354
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,290
They're identical.

355
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,703
His name's Phillip Burke.

356
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:22,980
CIA black ops agent killed in Laos the exact same date my father was killed.

357
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,871
The autopsy reports show that Burke was shot with a Makarov pistol,

358
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,675
the exact same make and model your mother used to kill my father.

359
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,272
And there's more.

360
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,058
Dental records.

361
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,522
The ones on the left are Burke's, the set on the right are my father's.

362
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:39,917
Oh, my god.

363
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,669
I mean, we've always thought your mother killed my father,

364
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:44,091
but what if she killed Phillip Burke instead?

365
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,885
How would the CIA -- how would anyone --

366
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:51,498
Maybe the CIA didn't know, and someone wanted the world to think Bill Vaughn died

367
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,490
and replaced him with Phillip Burke.

368
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,987
Vaughn, where did you get this information?

369
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:02,968
That phone call from before --

370
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,293
it wasn't Weiss.

371
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:05,904
I went to see a guy named Roberts.

372
00:28:05,995 --> 00:28:08,657
I made a deal with him because he said he had information about my father.

373
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:12,787
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

374
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,777
Syd, he said he'd only talk if I came alone.

375
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:16,274
I don't care. What you did was crazy.

376
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,455
Yeah, and it paid off.

377
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:18,779
This guy knows more, and he'll tell me.

378
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,007
In return for what?

379
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,476
He wants me to give him Nightingale. Some transformer coil.

380
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:25,328
We don't even know what Nightingale is yet, and you want to just hand it over?

381
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,461
We're just gonna shut down the testing.

382
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:27,977
We're not gonna hand over the entire program.

383
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,351
Just a part of it. Syd, we do missions like this all the time.

384
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:32,247
Not on our own. Not rogue.

385
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,918
My father wants us to bring this in to A.P.O.

386
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,741
You talked to him again.

387
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:43,774
Your father and Sloane will never let me keep technology like this for myself.

388
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:45,558
And besides, I don't trust them.

389
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,071
I don't trust anybody --

390
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,204
except you.

391
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:50,186
Then what do you suggest?

392
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:53,212
We come clean with A.P.O. like your father wants,

393
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,963
we drop a mission that'll get us Nightingale,

394
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:57,050
and then we run a countermission.

395
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,323
Like the old days.

396
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,124
Our stated goal is to retrieve the coil.

397
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,734
But instead we keep it for ourselves.

398
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:04,055
The only problem is, there's no way we can make a duplicate.

399
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:05,999
We won't have time to make a fake one.

400
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,276
So we have a plan "B."

401
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:15,072
We need to retrieve the coil and shut down Nightingale.

402
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,779
Assuming you enter the facility undetected, what then?

403
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:19,800
Once inside, Vaughn and I will split up.

404
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,700
I'll recover the coil while Vaughn takes care of security.

405
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,400
Now, each door in the facility is key-code operated,

406
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,820
but Vlachko operates out of the security station here.

407
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:29,143
So I'll subdue him.

408
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,828
I'll override all the locking mechanisms.

409
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,155
That should get Sydney into the control room where the coil's held.

410
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,242
What configuration did you say the reactor was running?

411
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:35,992
RBMK.

412
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:38,271
Then you'll need two people to retrieve the coil --

413
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:41,072
one to ensure the reactor stays in standby mode

414
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,590
while the other enters the test chamber to grab the coil.

415
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,344
Yeah. That's right.

416
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,336
That means you're missing one man to override security.

417
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,707
Then I'll join the team.

418
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,507
As third man,

419
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,405
I'll access the security system while you and Vaughn recover the coil.

420
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:56,961
Once the mission is complete, we can bring Vlachko back for questioning.

421
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,239
If we need a third man, Dixon is more than capable.

422
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:01,804
Actually, Jack's experience will serve you well --

423
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:05,450
unless there's something about this mission that you haven't told me.

424
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,290
No, sounds good.

425
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,216
Home plate, we're in.

426
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:34,303
Copy, five by five, Phoenix. Standing by.

427
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,047
I'm going to the security room.

428
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,370
We'll meet you back here with the coil.

429
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,046
  

430
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,597
The more you cooperate, the less pain you'll endure.

431
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,032
Sit down.

432
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:38,377
Sit down!

433
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:43,291
Shutting down security.

434
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:45,507
Jack, are you with Dr. Vlachko?

435
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:46,874
Yes, he's been subdued.

436
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:52,265
Shotgun, Phoenix, unlocking the door to the control room now.

437
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:53,446
Copy. Almost there.

438
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:02,934
Okay, Marshall, we're at the control panels.

439
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:04,258
Is the reactor online?

440
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,487
Negative. We can see the transformer inside now.

441
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,381
All right, open up the containment shield.

442
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:09,655
That's where the coil is.

443
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:10,499
Copy.

444
00:32:21,294 --> 00:32:22,954
Now release the lock to the test chamber.

445
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:32,191
We've got the chamber open. I'm going in.

446
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:39,324
Dismantling the pressure shield now.

447
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:45,045
This will take a couple minutes.

448
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:48,916
I need information, and I need it very quickly.

449
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,526
I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:55,024
I know about Nightingale.

451
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:02,449
If you know about Nightingale, what else can I possibly tell you?

452
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:04,440
The location of Yelena Derevko.

453
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,504
Yelena?

454
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,977
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know.

455
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:16,340
Ready to remove the coil.

456
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:21,816
Where's Yelena?

457
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:23,284
I told you, I don't know.

458
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,132
You worked for her. You've been in contact.

459
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,933
You couldn't have set this up without her help.

460
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:28,483
That was years ago.

461
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,138
I don't have time for this.

462
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,147
  

463
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:55,718
Vaughn.

464
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,509
Syd, the controls are fried.

465
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:58,922
Can you get me out of here?

466
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:01,384
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know!

467
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:04,429
Home base, the reactor's coming online. It's coming online now.

468
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,135
Vaughn, bypass the nuclear fusion switch.

469
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:07,747
It's on the panel under the main controls.

470
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,395
I have to run a bypass.

471
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:15,809
  

472
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:34,980
Okay, is there an ethernet port next to the motherboard?

473
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:36,756
Yeah.

474
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,792
Okay, plug it in there.

475
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:40,956
That should give me access to...

476
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,152
All right, nice. That did it.

477
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:45,543
I'm on their server.

478
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,040
Vaughn, fuse the blue and yellow wire together to open the door.

479
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:52,418
Syd, try the door now.

480
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:54,345
It's still locked.

481
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:56,592
Vaughn!

482
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:58,199
Marshall, I can't bypass the door.

483
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,570
Sydney is in the room with the reactor.

484
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,557
Is there another way to shut down the core?

485
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:03,071
Only if you remove the fuel rods.

486
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:10,012
Marshall, I'm headed toward the core.

487
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,335
No, no, no, do not do that.

488
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,567
Exposure to that amount of radiation could kill you, okay?

489
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:14,604
I can slow down the countdown,

490
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,117
buy enough time to corrupt the reactor mainframe.

491
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:17,107
Just give me some time.

492
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,034
  

493
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:22,618
Take cover.

494
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:40,949
No, Mr. Bristow, I see what you're doing. Don't go in there.

495
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:43,933
I've almost got it. I can keep the reactor from coming online. I can.

496
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:46,301
It's getting a little warm in here.

497
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,005
Hang on, I'm working on it.

498
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,109
  

499
00:35:58,715 --> 00:35:59,612
Marshall, come on.

500
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:02,001
Okay, almost there, almost there, almost there.

501
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,515
Got it. The countdown's slowing down.

502
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:21,298
Work some magic, work some magic, work some magic, work some magic, ...

503
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:25,710
  

504
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,330
  

505
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:40,630
Marshall, what just happened?

506
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,907
Total system shutdown due to core corruption.

507
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:46,508
I did it.

508
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:50,912
We did it. We --

509
00:36:52,266 --> 00:36:54,310
All right, Marshall, Marshall, just free Sydney, would you?

510
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,967
Oh, right, sorry. System's in reset.

511
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,057
That shouldn't be a problem and free at last.

512
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:01,728
Sydney.

513
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:07,746
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

514
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:09,583
"Plan B."

515
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,414
I hate this.

516
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:12,538
Vaughn.

517
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:15,819
Are you sure?

518
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,218
I love you.

519
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:28,106
Yeah? Still?

520
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,158
Remember what you promised?

521
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:44,069
I'll let you know when I get there.

522
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,524
Okay.

523
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,111
Sydney.

524
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:00,126
I couldn't stop him.

525
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,588
It was Vaughn. He took the coil.

526
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,131
I couldn't stop him, dad.

527
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,711
Well, I don't understand this.

528
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,040
Vaughn assaulted Sydney and stole the coil?

529
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:33,121
Yes.

530
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,095
And you believe her?

531
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:39,149
Vaughn wouldn't go against us without a reason.

532
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:43,079
From his father's journals to this rash action,

533
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,117
someone must be feeding him information.

534
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:47,062
A third party we're not aware of.

535
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:50,006
Yeah, well, obviously this complicates our situation.

536
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:53,430
Yes, I imagine this might bequite upsetting for you, Arvin.

537
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,175
My not anticipating Sydney and Vaughn's deceit could be greater than your own.

538
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,616
Have you thought about how we're going to deal with this?

539
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:11,706
Jack?

540
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,158
Hmm?

541
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,711
Are you all right?

542
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:15,930
Fine.

543
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:17,192
Just tired.

544
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:22,388
I'll work up some options retrieving Vaughn and the coil.

545
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:54,828
  

546
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,139
Uh, Mr. Bristow? Mr. Bristow?

547
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:11,611
Hi. Listen, I ran the diagnostics on the core reactor shutdown.

548
00:40:11,657 --> 00:40:14,128
- Remember, Marshall saves the day?
- Marshall, this is not the time.

549
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:15,738
Well, but I re-ran security protocols,

550
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,540
and I checked them and rechecked them twice, believe me,

551
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,152
because I couldn't quite understand --

552
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:19,950
Marshall, what is it?!

553
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,370
I didn't shut down that reactor at all.

554
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:22,742
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

555
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,113
The printouts -- Listen, it is physically impossible for me

556
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,819
to shut down that reactor from a remote location.

557
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,284
I mean, given its particular status,

558
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:29,655
it would have to be shut down manually.

559
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:33,173
But that's impossible, too, because that would mean that someone -- that --

560
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:37,574
I mean, you.

561
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:44,200
The only way it could happen is if you went in the reactor yourself.

562
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:52,370
It was my daughter's life.

563
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:01,209
Between us.

564
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:09,209
