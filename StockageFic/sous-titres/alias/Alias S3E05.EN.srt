1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,083
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:04,003
There.
You see that?

3
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:05,210
No.

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:08,013
What do you mean, no?
Look there.

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,471
He's saying "Jewel" or "Julie."

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,138
Maybe "Julia."

7
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,426
Hello.

8
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,980
Hello.

9
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,479
Good to see you, Julia.

10
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,311
Good to see you, too.

11
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:25,818
We have another problem.

12
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,284
What's that?

13
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:28,911
Julia.

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,489
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

15
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:35,824
Vaughn's missing!

16
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:40,332
This is what I meant.

17
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:42,879
He's got CIA-issue equipment.

18
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,248
Come here.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,924
Wait!

20
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:51,217
I want to do it.

21
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:03,559
You never should have
betrayed me.

22
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,032
This line is secure.

23
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,530
Mountaineer, day code 78765,
requesting patch-through.

24
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:57,454
Connected.

25
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,001
This is the first time
I could call.

26
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,912
Sydney, where are you?

27
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,463
I'm in Spain, Dad.
Listen to me.

28
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:03,792
They have to activate
the transmitter.

29
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:06,455
I put it on Vaughn.
He's on a road outside Ibiza.

30
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,840
We're supposed to be tracking
the biological weapons.

31
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,304
Vaughn is bleeding to death.

32
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:11,799
You have to move.

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,885
Hold on.

34
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:13,756
Flinkman.

35
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,510
Trigger Sydney's
transmitter now.

36
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,475
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:18,890
Send Weiss after the signal.

38
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,605
Okay, I'm on it.

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,065
Marshall's activating it.

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,229
Tell me what happened.

41
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,349
They found Vaughn.

42
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,647
They were gonna put a bullet in
his head, so I offered to do it.

43
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,312
Dad, I stabbed him myself.
I had to.

44
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,816
I didn't have a choice.
They were gonna kill him.

45
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,191
We're tracking the signal.

46
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,078
Tell me what happened
with the package.

47
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,203
The biological weapons
are in Simon's room.

48
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,625
He told me he's going somewhere
with Javier to celebrate.

49
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,914
I'm gonna break into his room
and grab the weapons.

50
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,378
We'll find Vaughn.

51
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,294
Thank you.

52
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:07,474
So, what's the rush?

53
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,065
Timetable's moved up.

54
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,527
That's all you need to know.

55
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,120
Now, look at that.

56
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,543
What's more beautiful than that?

57
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:24,287
Perhaps what it pays for.

58
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,249
Here. Cheers.

59
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,313
Excellent.

60
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,770
Biological weapons, please.

61
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,197
It's rare that you find people
that do their job well.

62
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:01,201
Even a thief can take
pride in his work, Mr. Sark.

63
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,748
Well, here.

64
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,294
Thank you.

65
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,885
You know, this is trespassing.

66
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,105
Surprise.

67
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,851
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

68
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,107
I took a walk.

69
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,271
I needed some air.

70
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,618
It's not every night
I kill someone in the CIA.

71
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:02,694
You know, if he was CIA,

72
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,824
he certainly wasn't doing
his job very well.

73
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,288
We already made the exchange.

74
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:11,916
The Covenant already
picked up the weapons?

75
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,167
Yeah.

76
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,043
And they made payment.

77
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,383
This is horrible.

78
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:22,753
What?

79
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,806
Well, I have a flight
later in the morning.

80
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,352
I never wanted to leave less.

81
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,682
You know that, don't you?

82
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,930
I thought the exchange
was tomorrow.

83
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,933
They moved up their schedule.

84
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,526
When am I gonna see you again?

85
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,444
I have so many questions.

86
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,614
About what?

87
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,158
Everything.

88
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:53,042
Look, we work well together.

89
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,078
I have your numbers.

90
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,330
There's always
another job coming up.

91
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,132
I'll call you.

92
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,760
Okay?

93
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,716
And feel free to use the room.

94
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,011
Thanks.

95
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:20,353
We're on the signal.
We're tracking him now.

96
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,781
Oh, God.
I got him!

97
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,246
I need the medic!

98
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,326
Medic!

99
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,957
Over here, quick!

100
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,322
I need the medic!

101
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,295
We found him.
He's in bad shape.

102
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,668
They're working on him now.

103
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,821
How is he?

104
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,036
I don't know.

105
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,831
No one does.

106
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,001
"Critical but stable"
is the official term.

107
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,958
Is he awake?

108
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:01,625
No.

109
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,252
He was hypoxic.

110
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,213
He lost oxygen when the stab
wound collapsed his lung.

111
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,476
They call it
tension pneumothorax.

112
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:17,263
Which means they don't know
if he suffered brain damage.

113
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:24,688
Lauren, I know that you've
been generally briefed,

114
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,904
but I need to explain
the details myself

115
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:30,158
so that you know
how this happened.

116
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,744
A member of Walker's team
caught Michael.

117
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,909
I still don't know how.

118
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,746
Walker I.D.'d him as CIA.

119
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,380
And stabbed him
and left him for dead.

120
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,495
I already know all this.

121
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,085
It's in the briefing.
Thank you.

122
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,749
Lauren, that's not...

123
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,509
Walker had a gun
to Michael's head.

124
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:54,221
He was about to pull
the trigger.

125
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,469
I took his knife.

126
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:00,892
I stabbed Vaughn myself.

127
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:03,391
You?

128
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,812
Yes.
Walker was gonna murder him.

129
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,985
So you stabbed him?

130
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,315
I had no choice.

131
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,567
It was the only thing I could
do to save Michael's life.

132
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,072
Really?

133
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:18,541
You cannot think that I would
have chosen to hurt him, ever.

134
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:23,039
Michael might never
wake up from this.

135
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,215
At 4.30 GMT,

136
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,347
an imaging satellite picked up
the heat signature

137
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,471
of a small aircraft
flying a tactical profile.

138
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,603
The National Reconnaissance
Office tracked it

139
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,146
to a maximum-security facility
in the Ural Mountains,

140
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:44,978
where it flew multiple passes,

141
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,857
deploying some kind
of a biological weapon.

142
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,774
The weapon Sark picked up
in Spain?

143
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,277
Most likely.

144
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,203
Echelon intercepts between
the responding emergency teams

145
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,493
indicate that the entire
prison population,

146
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:00,910
300 guards, 500 prisoners,
died within minutes.

147
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:02,283
There were no survivors?

148
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,873
No, there was one.

149
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,126
- One?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,963
Kazari Bomani.

151
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:10,297
Right, and as we all know,

152
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,794
Bomani's become the largest
arms dealer in Africa.

153
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,798
When authorities realised
a biological weapon

154
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:15,840
had been deployed,

155
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:19,184
they called in a hazmat team
to secure the facility.

156
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,150
Bomani was being escorted
into a decontamination unit.

157
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:27,069
- That's all we know.
- And how did Bomani survive?

158
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,644
Actually, if I may,
I could shed some light

159
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,574
on the situation, as usual.

160
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:37,327
Basically, Sark was able
to combine an Ebola strain

161
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,490
with the bioweapon
he had stolen from Spain.

162
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:43,082
We believe The Covenant tailored
the bioweapon to kill everybody

163
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,747
except the person
whose genetic profile

164
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,877
was encoded into the virus.

165
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,004
- In this case, Bomani.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,630
I mean, the whole thing's
pretty cool.

167
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:55,760
In a sick, horrible way.

168
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,600
Sloane is attending an MPO
conference in Mexico City.

169
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,974
I have a briefing with him
the day after tomorrow.

170
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,102
I'm still catching up.

171
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,265
What did Sloane
have to do with this?

172
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,980
Sloane gave us the intel
that led to Bomani's arrest.

173
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,477
The subsequent dismantling
of his terror network

174
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:13,241
wasn't one of the reasons
we agreed to pardon Sloane.

175
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,151
It was the predominant reason.

176
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:16,274
He might have a lead.

177
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,860
Sydney, you'll accompany
Lauren to Mexico.

178
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,200
That's it.

179
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,659
She thinks I stabbed Vaughn
by choice.

180
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:26,752
That I could have done something
else, that it was payback.

181
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:30,539
When someone's spouse
is critically hurt or killed,

182
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,587
rational thought takes time.

183
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:34,709
I know.

184
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,713
Tell me about Simon Walker.

185
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,558
He's the only connection we have
to your missing years.

186
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,516
We can't squander
this opportunity.

187
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,346
Did he say anything else
to explain

188
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:45,229
how he knew you as Julia?

189
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:47,806
No, when he caught me,
he gave me the money and left.

190
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,561
He didn't say
where he was going.

191
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,653
Just that he would contact me
when another job came up.

192
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,862
Another job.

193
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,151
I'll contact Walker myself,
posing as a client.

194
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,700
I'll spec out a job,
he'll assemble his team,

195
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,366
and we'll take them
into custody.

196
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:03,406
Once we have them,

197
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,955
you and I will have
a face-to-face with Mr. Walker

198
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:08,796
and find out everything
he knows about Julia.

199
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,338
And, Sydney, about Vaughn.

200
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,377
You know you did
the right thing.

201
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,799
Thanks.

202
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,275
Dixon told me about Michael.

203
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,326
That he's off the ventilator.

204
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,622
That's important.

205
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,580
They're keeping him
in an induced coma

206
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:46,781
for the next 36 hours

207
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,414
to minimise
the chance of brain damage.

208
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:57,002
Look, obviously it was
your intention

209
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,253
to save Michael's life.

210
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,174
I understand that.

211
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,973
But I'm gonna be
honest with you.

212
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:09,228
When I heard you were back,
I felt threatened.

213
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,806
And I hated myself,
because I sympathise with you.

214
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,309
With everything
you've gone through.

215
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:15,898
But working together like this.

216
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,562
The stakes of this job
are just too high.

217
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,109
I can't work to the best of
my ability while I'm wondering

218
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:25,370
whether I'm being polite enough
to my husband's ex-girlfriend.

219
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,200
You don't need to be
polite with me.

220
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,786
We're both past formalities.

221
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:29,707
Well, good.

222
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:32,202
Then I'll be blunt.

223
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,586
I want you to request a transfer
to another field office.

224
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:42,127
Lauren, everyone I know.

225
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,882
All of the people
I have left in my life,

226
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:52,058
my friends, my father,
work at that office.

227
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,692
I thought it would be best
if the request came from you.

228
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:02,026
I know we're being blunt,
but was that a threat?

229
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,034
You don't have the authority
to have me transferred.

230
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,950
The NSC will support me

231
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,034
when they learn
that our working together

232
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,662
is compromising the fight
against The Covenant.

233
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:17,840
If you don't make the call,
I will.

234
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:38,113
Excuse me, mate,
you got the time?

235
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,023
My watch is broken.

236
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:42,487
Never buy American.

237
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:47,448
So tell me, Mr. Warner,
how'd you learn to contact me?

238
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,531
We have a mutual acquaintance.

239
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,700
Julia Thorne.

240
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,121
Really?

241
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,369
Oh, I love her.

242
00:15:55,463 --> 00:15:57,123
Yes.

243
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:59,418
So, what's the gig?

244
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,459
A fuel-cell automobile
has been designed in Japan.

245
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,962
The prototype was placed
on a cargo freighter.

246
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:09,224
It left Niigata this morning
bound for Hong Kong.

247
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,888
I want you to steal it.

248
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,470
Oh, sexy.

249
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:17,148
How long will it take you
to put your team together?

250
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,726
Oh, well, the question is,
can you afford for me

251
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:21,315
to put my team together?

252
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:24,407
Don't concern yourself
with my finances.

253
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:27,695
I wouldn't have come to you
if I couldn't overpay.

254
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,827
Nobody ever overpays with me.

255
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:30,946
Yes.

256
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,077
Julia says you're the best.

257
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:37,414
I'll contact you
regarding the price

258
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,913
and the location
of our next meeting.

259
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,713
You know, with all the specs
regarding the shipment.

260
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,261
Naturally.

261
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:46,838
Cheers.

262
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,805
Good night.

263
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,371
Sign in, please.

264
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,501
We're here to see Arvin Sloane.

265
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,382
Oh, perfect timing.

266
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,254
He's just arriving.

267
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,398
Get in the van!

268
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,433
Get in!

269
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,523
Have you done this before?

270
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,236
I cross-trained at The Farm.

271
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,991
- Are you field-rated?
- No.

272
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:44,503
Kazari, you're thinking
that I'm responsible

273
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,085
for your imprisonment.

274
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,842
Hello?

275
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,812
I've got another job for us.

276
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,437
Really?
That's great.

277
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:04,807
You sound distracted.

278
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,524
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

279
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,446
Look, are you available
for another job?

280
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,320
- For you, I am always available.
- Can't that wait?

281
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:14,787
Simon, can I call you back?

282
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:17,492
Sure, baby.
Okay.

283
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,337
They're gaining on us.

284
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:26,581
Tell the chase car
to take them out.

285
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,760
Don't look in the mirror.

286
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,508
All that matters
is what's in front of us.

287
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,640
I think there's
somebody back there.

288
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,069
- Hit the brakes!
- What?

289
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,371
Hit the brakes
and cut right, now!

290
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,375
Go!
Go, go, go, go!

291
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,054
They're still coming.

292
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:20,970
Through the alley.
Go!

293
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:24,057
- There's no room.
- I can make it.

294
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,524
- Back off.
- No.

295
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,268
Wait, Lauren, go around!

296
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,662
Damn it!

297
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,542
I thought we were partners.

298
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:57,296
I thought we had an association.

299
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,973
I was wrong.

300
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:09,687
One day when I was a boy
in Juah Town, the tanks came.

301
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,398
The soldiers rounded up
and killed all the men.

302
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,447
Raped the women.

303
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:21,657
My mother, Mr. Sloane,
was raped.

304
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,498
And then she was killed
in front of me.

305
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,829
In front of my brothers.

306
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,844
My oldest brother threatened me,
insisted I do nothing.

307
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,761
But he couldn't help himself.

308
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,226
He tried to fight them.

309
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,979
The soldiers cut off his arm.

310
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,637
Imagine it for me.

311
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:52,859
Watching your own mother
get raped.

312
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,188
Watching her cut.

313
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,025
Screaming.

314
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,699
Can you even begin to do that?

315
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:07,246
I swore that I will never
be powerless again.

316
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:13,207
That I would do anything
to protect my family.

317
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:19,680
And that anyone who got
in the way of that

318
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:23,180
would suffer the same fate
as my brother.

319
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:30,438
Yes, I turned you in,
as you would have done me.

320
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,442
Why?

321
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,736
To obtain what you now need.

322
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,365
Legitimacy.

323
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,821
In a nutshell, Mr. Bomani,

324
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:48,203
I could help you become
more powerful than ever.

325
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,844
Sloane was responsible
for Bomani's imprisonment.

326
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,557
Sark breaks Bomani out of gaol.

327
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:06,220
The first thing they do
is get Sloane.

328
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,591
Hopefully,
Bomani's got his revenge,

329
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,178
and Sloane is either
in incredible pain or dead.

330
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:13,476
I want a full options briefing
in my office, one hour.

331
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,397
You start with your contacts
in Washington.

332
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:19,861
I'll check in
with Strategic Services.

333
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:25,571
What I said about requesting
you transferred

334
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:28,534
to another field office
wasn't my place.

335
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,873
And it's hard, but I'd
really like this to work.

336
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:36,424
I appreciate you saying that.

337
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,201
Oh, my God.

338
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:15,539
Where am I?

339
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,673
You're home.

340
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:22,252
You stabbed me.

341
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,219
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,845
I had no choice.
Walker would have killed you.

343
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,926
I know.

344
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,765
You're okay?

345
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,896
I was so afraid I'd lost you.

346
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,698
I'm right here.

347
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:51,531
Leaving you like that,

348
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,582
not knowing if I'd ever
see you again,

349
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,835
made me realise
how much I miss you.

350
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,878
I miss you, too.

351
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:05,636
You do?

352
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:28,659
How could you do this to me?

353
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,540
Hi.

354
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,626
Sweetheart, you're okay.

355
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,545
Do you remember me?

356
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:50,008
Of course.

357
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,973
Thank God.

358
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,080
Hi.

359
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,959
I'm going to the hospital.
Vaughn's awake.

360
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,207
It's the best news ever.

361
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:20,754
I was hoping you could tell him

362
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:23,211
that the topical application
of magnets can influence

363
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,877
the electrochemical processes.

364
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,166
He needs to know this why?

365
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:27,719
Oh, sorry.
Buried the lead.

366
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:28,835
It's for pain relief.

367
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,305
Having a collapsed lung --

368
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,801
Syd, you're not gonna
believe this.

369
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,014
They found Sloane. His plane
just landed in Van Nuys.

370
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:36,807
They've taken him
to our facility in Riverside.

371
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,936
He's asking to speak with you.

372
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:45,316
Oh, listen, let's not tell
Mr. Sloane about the magnets.

373
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,612
What have I missed?

374
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:59,290
I was just thanking Ms. Reed
for the attempted rescue.

375
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:01,619
I appreciate your efforts
a great deal.

376
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:03,705
Did you escape?

377
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:06,716
No, Mr. Bomani let me go.

378
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:08,843
He let you go?

379
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,722
He just let you walk
right out the door?

380
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,266
Yes.

381
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,137
What did you offer him?

382
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,889
Well, I gave him information

383
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,769
that I eventually
was going to share with you.

384
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:31,273
My contacts within
the Japanese mob, the Yakuza,

385
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,068
have developed the first
A.I. computer virus.

386
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:39,074
It probes networks, analyses
systems, and then writes itself.

387
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:42,084
Creates its own subviruses.

388
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,668
In the wrong hands,
it can crash markets,

389
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:48,089
destroy banks,
shut down transportation,

390
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:51,296
bring military installations
to a halt.

391
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,961
You're telling us
you gave this information

392
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,512
to a man who's working
with The Covenant?

393
00:27:56,601 --> 00:28:02,271
Now I'm giving it to you so
that you can disable the virus

394
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:04,433
before The Covenant gets it.

395
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,939
And I mean disable it,
not destroy it.

396
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:12,398
Because if Bomani comes to
the Yakuza facility in Osaka

397
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:14,900
and finds that the virus
has been destroyed,

398
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,446
he will know I tipped you off
and have me killed.

399
00:28:22,293 --> 00:28:24,619
My life is in your hands.

400
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,793
You've told Bomani
you'd work for The Covenant?

401
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,259
Yes.

402
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:34,127
Now I'm telling you that I'm in
a position to be a double agent.

403
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:38,220
Working for The Covenant,
but loyal to the CIA.

404
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:40,267
What is it, Sydney?

405
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:42,896
This is classic.

406
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:45,602
Don't take my word for it.

407
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:49,476
Have Marshall analyse the video
he's making of me right now.

408
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:53,694
Why don't you examine
the lie detectors

409
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,740
you're running on my voice?

410
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,736
I promise you.

411
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,328
He'll verify that I am telling
the God's honest truth.

412
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,329
Now, as far as our technology
can detect,

413
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:11,128
and these are next-gen tests,
as high-end as it gets.

414
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,009
He's not lying, folks.

415
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:16,179
If there's someone who can fool
those tests, it's Sloane.

416
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:20,048
In theory, yes, but in practise,
he'd really have to be using

417
00:29:20,143 --> 00:29:23,097
the next gen's next-gen
lie-detector-defeating tech,

418
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:26,023
which, frankly,
even I can't imagine.

419
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,183
What do we do here?
Do we trust Sloane?

420
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:31,562
The position of the NSC is
that we accept Sloane's proposal

421
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:34,192
and use him as a double agent
within The Covenant.

422
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:36,191
Just so that
someone has said it.

423
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,609
In the past two years,
Sloane has obtained a pardon

424
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:41,490
based mainly on the capture
of a criminal who is now free.

425
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,206
In addition,
Sloane will be allowed

426
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,449
to openly participate
in Covenant activities

427
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:48,414
based on the promise he will
inform us of those activities.

428
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:50,912
One could argue he's pulled off
the con job of the century.

429
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:54,376
It also appears that Bomani will
kill Sloane if we interfere.

430
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:56,011
Who would lose sleep over that?

431
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,471
The U.S. government
would have lost

432
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:00,343
its most valuable source
of underworld intelligence.

433
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,758
The fact that Sloane
holds all the cards

434
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:04,263
is giving me a migraine.

435
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:06,726
According to Sloane,
Sark and Bomani are on their way

436
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:08,475
to a Yakuza-run casino in Osaka,

437
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,236
where they will download
the virus from a secure server.

438
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,063
Marshall will provide a program

439
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:15,906
that will rewrite the virus
and render it unusable.

440
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,939
Sorry to interrupt.

441
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,527
I did say I could do that,

442
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:21,654
but not if I haven't
seen the code.

443
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:25,032
I guess this means
I'm going on another mission.

444
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,785
If you sanction it.

445
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:30,921
I'll have Strategic Services
devise a scenario for you both.

446
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,204
Actually, another suggestion

447
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,714
for the CIA suggestion box,
which is a great idea.

448
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:36,336
Sorry.

449
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:40,212
What I was thinking is
a surefire way to get invited

450
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:43,058
into the back room
of a Yakuza casino.

451
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,969
Get caught cheating at gambling.

452
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,896
Yeah, I have
a little something here.

453
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,223
This will give us an example
of what I mean.

454
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,602
Now, in high school,

455
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:57,443
by applying the methodology
of statistical probability,

456
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:01,364
accounting for the continuous
random variable of luck,

457
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:02,863
I was able to come up

458
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:05,160
with a fairly effective
card-counting technique.

459
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:07,620
You know how to deal
a hand of blackjack?

460
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,583
Yes, Marshall.

461
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,163
Go ahead.
Deal one for yourself.

462
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:12,962
Can I get a cocktail?

463
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:14,210
Five, six.

464
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,256
Hit there.
Hit me there.

465
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,216
Stick there.

466
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:19,252
Hit me twice here.

467
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,804
Double down there.

468
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:21,968
Stick.

469
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:24,096
Hit me once there.

470
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,425
You're gonna have
a face card under there.

471
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,604
Go ahead and turn that over.
That gives you 17.

472
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,441
Look at that.
I've won nine times.

473
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:33,770
Wow.

474
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,359
I had a lot of free time
in high school.

475
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:42,111
Michael's doctors expect
he'll be released tomorrow.

476
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:44,325
If there's time,
you should go and see him.

477
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:45,823
I know he'd like that.

478
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:47,159
Thank you.

479
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,786
I don't know if there will be,
but thank you.

480
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:51,750
When you get back, then.

481
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,589
Thank you for meeting me.

482
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:02,926
Please.

483
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:04,295
After your excellent work,

484
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,882
you more than deserve
the professional courtesy.

485
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,684
Unfortunately,
we have to be brief.

486
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,976
I'm catching a plane to Osaka.

487
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,688
We've taken on a new client.

488
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:14,683
He says his name
is Gilbert Warner.

489
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:16,151
Corporate and personal
tax returns

490
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,605
confirm he's the CEO
of Rodgers Automotive.

491
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,441
But he knows how to lose a tail.

492
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,908
I think he's a pro.

493
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:24,985
I'd like some more
detailed background.

494
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,987
Would you mind running
the check?

495
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,907
I don't believe I have to.

496
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,413
His name is Jack Bristow.

497
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:34,245
He's CIA.

498
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:48,434
Enter your account password,
and within 90 seconds,

499
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:51,472
you'll receive confirmation
of an electronic transfer

500
00:32:51,563 --> 00:32:54,729
in the amount of $3 million.

501
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:02,526
You don't mind if I ask you
to look away?

502
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:04,074
Of course not.

503
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:12,283
Excuse me.

504
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:15,041
Yeah.

505
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,622
You're being set up.

506
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:18,919
The man you're standing with
is a CIA operative.

507
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,169
His name is Jack Bristow.

508
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,464
I hope you appreciate
hearing this as much as I do.

509
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:28,175
His daughter, Sydney Bristow,
also CIA, goes by an alias.

510
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:30,597
Great news, mate.

511
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:33,437
Mr. Warner will be happy
to hear it.

512
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:36,392
Hear what?

513
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,356
The team's been assembled.

514
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:41,610
As soon as the money's
transferred, we're in business.

515
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:45,741
You know, while we're waiting,

516
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,612
you never told me
how you met Julia.

517
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:53,615
Are you, like,
lovers or something?

518
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,534
No, not exactly.

519
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:58,834
I ask because if you ever
get the chance,

520
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,831
I highly recommend it.

521
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,914
Do you?

522
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,298
Oh, yeah, man.

523
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,174
On a scale of one to 10,

524
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:11,301
10 being the most degenerate
displays of sexual theatre

525
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:14,477
known to man...

526
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:16,769
Julia's like a 17.

527
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:22,192
You have your money.

528
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,943
As soon as the job's done,
we'll be in contact.

529
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:43,128
You shot me.

530
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,923
You shot me.

531
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:48,754
You bastard.

532
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:51,848
Listen to me very closely.
You're dying.

533
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:54,851
I'm the only one who can get you
to a hospital in time.

534
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,217
Tell me about Julia.

535
00:34:56,312 --> 00:34:58,601
Where you met her.
How you knew her.

536
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,435
I wasn't kidding
about screwing your daughter.

537
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:05,770
She's the wildest girl
I ever had.

538
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:08,615
Tell me about Julia
if you want to live.

539
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,904
You want to know
how she likes it?

540
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:17,559
Howdy.

541
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:23,398
If I were any more nervous,

542
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,021
I'd need new underpants
just about now.

543
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,695
I think I'm allergic
to this moustache.

544
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:32,157
I think it's cat fur.

545
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,950
Just relax, honey.

546
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:37,285
I'm just about to cheat at cards
at a casino run by gangsters.

547
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:39,115
I just want to keep
my pinky fingers.

548
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:41,413
We talked about this
on the plane.

549
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,992
I need to know you can do this.

550
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,583
Let's play cards.

551
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:41,550
I'll tell you something.

552
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,720
Can you get somebody
to help me with this?

553
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:44,762
I can't carry all this.

554
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:47,014
Yes, we can!

555
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,773
You are very lucky.

556
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:51,236
Oh, are you talking to me?

557
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:53,148
Well, thank you very much.
I am lucky.

558
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,695
I'm lucky to be born in Texas,
and I am rich enough

559
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:58,535
that a woman this beautiful
is willing to share my bed.

560
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,280
Come on!

561
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,613
Perhaps you might
come into the back.

562
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:04,949
I can convert your winnings
into diamonds,

563
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:07,119
or simply make
an electronic transfer

564
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:08,374
to the bank of your choice.

565
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:10,087
That would be mighty hospitable.

566
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:12,166
<i>Domo arigato,</i> Mr....

567
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:15,212
What is that?
Tomosaka.

568
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:16,299
We'll take care of that.

569
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:18,843
You're gonna take care of it?
Thank you.

570
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,805
Mr. Tomosaka,
we weren't cheating.

571
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:22,470
No, we weren't cheating.

572
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,802
You were counting cards.

573
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,770
Are you gonna cut off
your finger with that?

574
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:30,692
'Cause that looks mighty big
to take off a pinky.

575
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:32,770
I will take your hand!

576
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,143
Don't hurt him!

577
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,866
Put them in the closet.

578
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,672
Okay.

579
00:38:53,425 --> 00:38:54,835
What was the password
Sloane gave you?

580
00:38:54,926 --> 00:38:56,883
Ravenson 327.

581
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:01,883
Okay, okay, I found the virus.
God, the code on this thing.

582
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,255
It's gonna take me a second

583
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:06,601
to download a copy before I
can render the virus unusable.

584
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,474
You're gonna have to hurry.

585
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,765
Sark's here.

586
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,938
Come on!

587
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,409
It's disabled.

588
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,469
It'll take me a second to
transfer a copy to our server.

589
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,139
Done.

590
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:03,069
Sorry.

591
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,464
Vaughn will back me up.

592
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:16,924
This is a true story, I swear.

593
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,835
Sophomore year, college.

594
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:20,421
Her name was April First.

595
00:40:20,512 --> 00:40:21,626
Birth name, by the way.

596
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,761
Right. And for a month,
I was obsessed.

597
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:26,849
I thought this woman had
to have my children, okay?

598
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:30,055
The problem was that she only
dated guitar players. Literally.

599
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:31,806
A girl should have
her standards.

600
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:33,309
Since she worked
at a coffeehouse,

601
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,476
Eric decided to impress her
on open-mike night.

602
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:36,849
You play the guitar?

603
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:39,187
No, no, not even a little.

604
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,614
But I thought that, you know,
if I got up on that stage

605
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,278
and the spotlight
was in my face,

606
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:46,907
that maybe God
would imbue my hands

607
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,704
with the power of
Stevie Ray Vaughn.

608
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,821
So what happened?

609
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,196
Oh, disaster.

610
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,407
Just embarrassment.

611
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:54,376
I didn't play two notes
that went together.

612
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:56,538
And what about April First?

613
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:58,090
Oh, we made out in my Gremlin.

614
00:40:58,174 --> 00:40:59,337
You did what?

615
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,714
Yeah. She got to work
late that night.

616
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:04,804
All she saw was me coming out
with a guitar under my arm.

617
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:07,386
Is that a good idea?

618
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:09,468
If I have to hear that story
for the fifth time,

619
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,889
I'm gonna need it.

620
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:12,307
Feeling okay?

621
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:14,057
Okay.
Yeah, unlike this guy,

622
00:41:14,149 --> 00:41:16,853
who took six months to sit up
after he got shot.

623
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:18,686
I was shot in the jugular.

624
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:21,103
I was. I was unconscious
for three weeks.

625
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:22,526
And don't come crying to me

626
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:24,573
if beer starts spraying out
of your chest.

627
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,153
Don't you have to get up early?

628
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,407
Yes, I do.

629
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:30,069
Alright.
Good night, everybody.

630
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:31,279
Can I grab a ride?

631
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:32,749
Yeah.

632
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,256
Good night.

633
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,918
See you tomorrow.

634
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:56,394
Yeah. Wait, you know what?
I forgot my jacket.

635
00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:57,728
Alright.
I'll get the car.

636
00:41:57,817 --> 00:41:59,015
Okay.
