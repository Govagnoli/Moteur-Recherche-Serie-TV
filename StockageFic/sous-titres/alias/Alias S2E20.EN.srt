00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,334
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,289
I want satellite footage of Tuscany.

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,044
I wanna know who murdered my wife.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,688
I'll see you at home
after I get the kids.

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,899
- Good night.
- Good night, Diane.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,613
See you tomorrow.

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,005
Where the hell's the device?
Tell me or we both die.

8
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,374
Who are you? You're crazy.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,961
- Dixon, what are you doing?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,384
Stay back, Sydney.

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,261
- No way. You're gonna kill yourself.
- I have nothing to lose.

12
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,727
What the hell is your man doing?

13
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,638
Agent Dixon,
disarm your explosive immediately.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,723
- Can you see them from your position?
- Negative.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,231
Dixon, think. Don't do this.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,608
- Sydney, get outta here.
- I'm not leaving without you.

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,903
Dixon, I repeat,
deactivate that weapon.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,113
Tell me where the box is or we die.

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,118
- Base camp. Got a visual.
- Tell me. What's it gonna be?

20
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,077
Tell Vaughn to take him down.

21
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,663
Dixon may be holding a manual detonator.
Firing at him could trigger the explosion.

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,369
- Dixon, shut it down.
- 15... 14...

23
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,337
Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank.

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,128
Agent Vaughn, this is
NSA Deputy Director Brandon.

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,800
I am ordering you to take that shot
at first possible opportunity.

26
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,801
- Sydney, get outta here.
- Dixon, you must disarm now.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,904
Do not stand at my grave and weep

28
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,285
I am not there, I do not sleep

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,208
I am a thousand winds that flow...

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,251
Should I say something?

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,763
I am the gentle autumn's rain

32
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,395
I am the swift uplifting rush

33
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,486
Of quiet birds in circled flight

34
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,952
OK, come on. Come on.

35
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,260
Do not stand at my grave and cry

36
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:06,431
Do not stand at my grave and cry

37
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,811
- I saw Dixon take something.
- What do you mean?

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,941
Pills, uh... He just looked like
he was barely holding it together.

39
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,356
- It could've been aspirin.
- It wasn't aspirin.

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,826
What are you saying?

41
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,912
I'm saying that he's going back to work
days after his wife was murdered

42
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,286
and he's self-medicating.

43
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,792
I think he needs to feel like
he's doing everything he can.

44
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,957
To find Sloane.

45
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,084
I had the same thing with Danny.

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,100
Found the man we're looking for.
He lives in Panama City.

47
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,567
I can be there in 17 hours.

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:04,033
No. The CIA has a copy of the database
that Caplan decrypted.

49
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,488
They'll deduce who it is we're after,
if they haven't already done it.

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,703
Well, what do you suggest?

51
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,827
I suggest you call this number.

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,327
A recording will answer
for a limousine service.

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,913
You will leave your cell number only.

54
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,875
Within five minutes
a man will call you.

55
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,805
You tell him exactly what you need.

56
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,347
Have you heard from Irina?

57
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,513
She's in Cyprus.

58
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,983
Inspecting some properties
to take the place of the facility in Spain.

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,860
I see.

60
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:49,119
I thought I would have some measure
of satisfaction with Diane Dixon's death.

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,826
I killed the wrong person.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,463
Dixon.

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,254
I'm taking a leave.

64
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,716
I want you to continue without me.

65
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,802
Sir, not to belittle your grief,

66
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:13,886
but do not deny yourself
the victory of a 30-year pursuit.

67
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,523
If I don't see you again, Mr Sark,

68
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:25,737
tell Irina that I hope you both succeed
where I couldn't.

69
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,781
This is Frederick Brandon,
NSA Deputy Director.

70
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:35,617
He's coordinating an interagency task force
to locate and study Rambaldi's work.

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,456
First of all, I'd like to say thank you to all
of you for welcoming my associate and I.

72
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,837
I'm Carrie Bowman,
Special Projects.

73
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:47,920
Well, thanks to your technical services
specialist - it's a Mr Flinkman -

74
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,099
we've made an invaluable breakthrough
in the Rambaldi investigation.

75
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:56,179
Really? Actually, I'm Flinkman.
Marshall Flinkman.

76
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,731
Hi.

77
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,764
Hi.

78
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,356
So, while the CIA was in possession
of Rambaldi's study of the human heart,

79
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,527
Mr Flinkman catalogued and copied it.

80
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,455
Do you have that presentation?

81
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,451
Oh, uh...

82
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,704
Presentation... And, by the way...

83
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,878
You can call me Marshall.
Everybody calls me... Whatever.

84
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,301
Um... OK, uh...

85
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,257
Thing we got, uh, right here...
Now, these drawings are amazing.

86
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,677
Like, da-Vinci-in-his-prime amazing.

87
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,647
But the "What could he possibly have been
smoking?" element, well, that is right here.

88
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,608
Now, take a look in the corner.

89
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,818
You see these little drawings
in the corner of the pages?

90
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,072
Now, they look just like
normal squiggles or doodling,

91
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,447
like you would do
while you were on the phone, talking to...

92
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,742
Although he probably wouldn't be
on the phone because, you know,

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,080
it's the 15th century,
they didn't actually have phones yet.

94
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,198
But, um...

95
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,247
They are actually
specific strands of DNA.

96
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,466
Now, I strung them all together
and I got a DNA fingerprint.

97
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,633
The DNA of this man.
Proteo Di Regno.

98
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,513
Private citizen living in Panama City.
He works as an art restorer.

99
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,475
You're saying that 500 years ago

100
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,313
Rambaldi drew the DNA profile
of a man who's alive today?

101
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,098
It gets even better.
Di Regno's DNA profile was a code key.

102
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,941
It let us decrypt
page 94 of the Rambaldi manuscript.

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,236
- What's on the page?
- Times and dates.

104
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,649
Each marking an apocalyptic event.

105
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,990
September 7, 1812, Napoleon's
bloodiest battle with the Russians.

106
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:42,201
June 28, 1914, the assassination of
Archduke Ferdinand started World War I.

107
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,462
August 6, 1945, Hiroshima.
The list goes on.

108
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,961
There's a future date listed on the page.
Isn't there?

109
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,840
48 hours from now.

110
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,681
- What's the prediction?
- The page doesn't say. It just gives a time.

111
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,719
It's the equivalent of midnight,
Eastern Standard Time.

112
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,859
We're coordinating with local authorities
in Panama City.

113
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,814
When you find Di Regno,
you'll escort him back here.

114
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,989
Until the moment specified by Rambaldi
has come and gone,

115
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,198
by National Security directive,

116
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,161
this operation centre
is under the jurisdiction of NSA.

117
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,346
You've talked to the neighbours. No one
saw the person who might have done this.

118
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,430
So far, Forensics hasn't found anything.
No prints, nothing.

119
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,897
- And you believe this wasn't a burglary.
- No. Nothing was taken.

120
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,105
Besides his heart.

121
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,827
Look.

122
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,665
Rambaldi.

123
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,794
So why take his heart?

124
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,963
I don't know.

125
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,413
It looks like the fingertip from a latex glove.
Must have torn off.

126
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,832
I was able to enhance the partial print
you sent me off the latex glove.

127
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,754
There was a match.
Guy's name is Emilio Vargas.

128
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,883
He's a freelance assassin,
specialising in interrogation and wet work.

129
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,419
Clients include
Russian Mafia, Triad, Japanese yakuza...

130
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,344
- Any intel on where he operates from?
- Well, there is an address in Guadalajara.

131
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,472
Forward me everything you've got.

132
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,771
- I have a request concerning Agent Dixon.
- What is it?

133
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,975
I know he's been through a lot
and I know he wants to feel useful but,

134
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,195
until he's had a psychological evaluation
and it's cleared by Medical Services, I...

135
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,822
I believe it's in his best interest,
and ours, to remove him from field duty.

136
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,741
I've worked with Agent Dixon for a dozen
years. You've worked with him a month.

137
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,830
If he feels ready to be in the field,
I'm going to accord him that respect.

138
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,534
Given his state of mind, do you think he's
the right person to make that decision?

139
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,831
- Yes.
- Jack, he just lost his wife.

140
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,330
With all due respect,
why are you fighting me on this?

141
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,755
I'm not required to justify my decisions
to you, Agent Vaughn.

142
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,346
However, I recruited Dixon into SD-6.

143
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,802
I'm the man who sold him the lie
he was working for the CIA.

144
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,267
I introduced him
to the man who killed his wife.

145
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:16,148
I will not be the one to tell him
he can't assist in Sloane's capture.

146
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,746
Everything OK?

147
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,910
Miss Bowman?

148
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,680
Hey. Excuse me, I...

149
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,926
Thank you.

150
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,809
No problem. Is everything all right?

151
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,522
It's Joni Mitchell.

152
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,361
- Don't tell anyone, OK?
- No, I...

153
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,535
I shouldn't bring her to work.
It just makes me fatalistic.

154
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,496
Well, this work we're doing,
it doesn't really help.

155
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,461
Yeah. No kidding.

156
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,456
Researching this prophecy,

157
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,134
trying to predict what sort of disaster's
gonna hit 36 hours from now,

158
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,795
it makes me wanna throw up.

159
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,894
Do you believe in this stuff?

160
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,689
Rambaldi. His prophecy.

161
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,568
I was raised more or less
by agnostic parents.

162
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,358
I mean, they were inordinately empirical.
Logical to the point of foolishness, really.

163
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,739
Like "Marshall, you must wear your
sweater. It's 52 degrees outside."

164
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,658
But I'm like "Mom, I'm not cold. I don't..."

165
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,953
"Well, in this family, young man,
we wear sweaters at 52 degrees."

166
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,580
I mean, there were really
no prophecies growing up.

167
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,674
Or even Santa Claus, tooth fairies...

168
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,512
So the short answer's no.

169
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,885
Well, that's what
I keep telling myself.

170
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,058
To tell you the truth,
I'm exhausted by the world.

171
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,219
Everything. The...

172
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,850
The evil and the rage and the darkness.

173
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,065
The last thing I need is some 15th century
dork telling me I got a day and a half to live.

174
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,609
I understand. I mean, like,
I have so much left to do.

175
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,322
Right.

176
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,404
Are you gay?

177
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,656
Why? Is there someone
you wanna set me up with?

178
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,496
No. It's just every cute guy that I meet
turns out to be gay.

179
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,625
- I'm not stupid. I mean, I'm in Mensa.
- Hold on. Not gay.

180
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,132
I mean, I like men
in a kind of manly, friend sort...

181
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,432
How about sushi? I mean, because,
when we're done with this job,

182
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:56,059
after 36 hours,
of course, assuming we're all still here,

183
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,978
we could... Maybe we...
You wanna get some sushi?

184
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,560
Yeah, I...

185
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,815
I would love that.
Oh, and, um, Joni Mitchell...

186
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,748
Doctor Barnett.
This is Michael Vaughn.

187
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,755
Do you have a minute? There's
something I need to talk to you about.

188
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,620
Mr Vargas.
We come referred by Gurneyev.

189
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,703
He was very pleased with the work
you did for him in Gdansk.

190
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,047
The Kopernik job.

191
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,218
No. Janazek.

192
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,106
Janazek was a learning experience.

193
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,564
I found if you remove the eye slowly, you
can keep it connected to the optic nerve.

194
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,774
He saw himself
in a whole new light.

195
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,530
- Why did you kill Di Regno?
- Son of a bitch.

196
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,126
Why Di Regno?
Why'd you kill him?

197
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,417
Why'd you take his heart?

198
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,292
Talk. You son of a bitch.

199
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,917
It wasn't his heart.
It wasn't his heart.

200
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,048
It was a machine.

201
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,346
Where is it?

202
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,348
On a truck.
On its way to Colombia. Cartagena.

203
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, God.

204
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,769
- Is that where Sloane is?
- Who?

205
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,856
- Is that where Sloane is?
- Who?

206
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,524
- Sloane. Where is he?
- I don't know Sloane.

207
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,486
- The guy who hired you.
- I was hired by phone.

208
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,373
- How? How'd he pay you?
- Wire... wire transfer.

209
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,122
- Tell me how to find Sloane.
- Dixon.

210
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,506
Dixon.

211
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:13,183
I asked you to come in because
I wanted to know how you were doing,

212
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,563
during what has to be a most difficult time.

213
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,820
I am so sorry for your loss.

214
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,741
Thank you.

215
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,877
Do you mind if we talk about
the operation yesterday in Guadalajara?

216
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,037
No. Of course not.

217
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,962
This was four days
after the death of your wife.

218
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,634
That's correct.

219
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,761
- Were you ordered on this mission?
- No.

220
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,100
I was encouraged not to go.
I insisted.

221
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,562
Why?

222
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,731
Because I have unfinished business.

223
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,600
With Sloane.

224
00:19:55,904 --> 00:20:00,981
It says here that you and Agent Bristow
interrogated an associate of Sloane's.

225
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,653
That's right.

226
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,365
Was that difficult?

227
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,780
Being in the same room with someone

228
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:13,331
who might know the whereabouts
of the man who killed your wife.

229
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,588
- He didn't know.
- Did you ask him?

230
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,510
Did Agent Bristow talk to you?

231
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,137
Would she tell me something different?

232
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,014
I used necessary force.

233
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:35,347
There are people at this agency
who are working to bring Sloane to justice.

234
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,113
Not good enough.

235
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,731
- I need to be involved.
- Agent Dixon.

236
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:46,403
It is my job to determine whether,
at this time,

237
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,069
you are fit for duty.

238
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,250
Well, I reviewed his medical records
and Di Regno never had a heart transplant.

239
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,464
Nor did he have an artificial heart.
I'm sorry. You...?

240
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,303
Which leads us to at least two
disconcerting questions.

241
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:08,809
What in God's name was keeping him alive
and why did Sloane want it so badly?

242
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:12,262
There's more. Now, remember those
heart drawings that he did?

243
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,816
Well, I interpreted the text, and Rambaldi
refers to conquering tissue degeneration.

244
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,811
We know Rambaldi
was fascinated with immortality.

245
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:25,155
Yeah, but even so, what does this possibly
have to do with the doomsday prophecy?

246
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,819
23 hours left.

247
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:33,741
The satellites are tracking the truck.
We should get something soon.

248
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,836
Actually,
this probably has no connection at all,

249
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,044
but Di Regno
worked as an art restorer.

250
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:43,177
Now, Carrie reminded me.
Hitler was a painter.

251
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,013
- "Carrie"?
- What?

252
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,591
Oh, did I...? Um...

253
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,971
Miss Bowman.

254
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,390
I should go.

255
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,640
Syd.

256
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,020
Did you tell Barnett
that I wasn't fit for field duty?

257
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,311
Dixon, no.

258
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,407
You didn't put in a request
for me to undergo an eval?

259
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,781
I promise you, no.

260
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:18,996
Somebody did. I've been ordered to report
to Medical Services for a drug test.

261
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,374
You're worried.

262
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,801
I've been taking Vicodin.

263
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,928
Now, I stopped. I threw them away. But it
doesn't matter, it'll show up on the test.

264
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,930
Sydney.

265
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,858
They're gonna suspend me.

266
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,275
We've ID'd the truck. It just crossed
the border from Panama into Colombia.

267
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,071
Your father's developing an op
to intercept Di Regno's heart.

268
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,446
Did you report to Barnett
that Dixon was taking pills?

269
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,615
Yes.

270
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,618
Come here.

271
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,590
You should have called me first.

272
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,083
Well, I'm sorry I didn't, but
I don't need your permission to do my job.

273
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,970
Why go out of your way
to make things harder for him?

274
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm trying to protect him. And you.
One mistake could get you killed.

275
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,723
Dixon has saved my life
more times than I can count.

276
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,677
- He nearly beat a man to death.
- He got us a lead on the Di Regno device.

277
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,141
Look, I get that you both have
a personal stake in catching Sloane.

278
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,977
But it can also cloud your judgement.

279
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,978
It makes me insane
when you patronise me.

280
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:29,449
This conversation's over.
I stand by my decision.

281
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,257
Shall we continue?

282
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,135
I would like to cross the north summit.

283
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,098
You did not tell me this
when you hired me.

284
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:07,107
If I had, you wouldn't have come.

285
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:11,194
I will gladly pay you
double the amount we discussed.

286
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,944
No.

287
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,367
People that go there
do not return the same.

288
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,538
I see. Well...

289
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,672
Don't worry about me.

290
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,606
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
You caught me off guard.

291
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,362
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:51,823
I know you're just looking out for Dixon.
And me.

293
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,984
His test came back negative.

294
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,912
You were right.
Must have been aspirin.

295
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,404
Are we OK?

296
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,910
Yeah.

297
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,625
Good.

298
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,547
I hope I didn't wake the kids.

299
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,513
They're at Diane's sister's.

300
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,849
You passed the drug test.

301
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,266
I'm in trouble, Syd.

302
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,479
What did you do?
Switch the results?

303
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,231
As soon as I left the building,
I knew it was a mistake.

304
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,151
- Oh, Dixon.
- But it was too late.

305
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,995
- Oh, my God.
- The results were already catalogued.

306
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,077
Sloane murdered my wife.

307
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,918
I have to make him pay for that.

308
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,206
I've been called in
to talk to Barnett.

309
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,049
- You can't tell her.
- Dixon...

310
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,052
If they find out I doctored my test,
I'll never work for the government again.

311
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,673
How will I take care of my kids?
Sydney...

312
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:03,060
I don't know how to do this
without Diane.

313
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,651
I have to go.

314
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,610
Syd.

315
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,034
Thanks for coming in so late,

316
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,200
but I was about to finish my evaluation
on Marcus Dixon,

317
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,699
and I didn't feel
that it would be comprehensive

318
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:30,586
without getting some input
from the person who knows him best.

319
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,509
What would you like to know?

320
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,556
Your father has argued strongly
that Dixon should stay in the field.

321
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:47,183
And without any evidence of drug use,
I can't countermand him.

322
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:52,651
Is there anything that you think
that I should know,

323
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,524
before I give my final decision?

324
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:11,380
Marcus Dixon is one of
the strongest people I've ever known.

325
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,382
I trust him with my life,
without hesitation.

326
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:21,303
And I am confident that,
despite the agony he's feeling right now,

327
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,561
he will pull through this.

328
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:54,544
Hey.

329
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,292
- Hey.
- I got your message.

330
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,673
The truck left the Pan-American Highway
toward Cartagena.

331
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,838
It looks like its end point
is the Estrella shipyard.

332
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,219
- We're going in with Delta Force.
- What about Dixon?

333
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:08,646
I left word right after I called you.
He hasn't called me back.

334
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,810
This is the Estrella.
A cargo-freight area with its own security.

335
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,945
The perimeter has patrols covering
both the north and southeast sectors.

336
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,648
Intel indicates
the truck is located here, Sydney.

337
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,948
You'll infiltrate the weakest post
and secure it.

338
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,325
Vaughn and Delta Force
will then join you on board

339
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:29,909
to determine whether or not this heart
is actually a weapon, an explosive.

340
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:34,959
By the time you reach the truck, you'll only
have 20 minutes till the midnight deadline.

341
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,420
If you're unable to locate
the Rambaldi device,

342
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,628
I've been given authority
to initiate secondary protocol,

343
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,347
to rig the yard with enough C-4
to destroy whatever the device may be.

344
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,927
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.

345
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:50,886
Fill him in on the way.
You leave in an hour.

346
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,351
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.

347
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,196
- I'll see you in Tech Services.
- OK.

348
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,075
Thank you for not saying anything.

349
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,650
It wasn't just Barnett.

350
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,154
I lied to Vaughn.

351
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:10,996
Sydney.

352
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:17,288
I need you to look me in the eye
and promise me that you can handle this.

353
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,458
I promise.

354
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,678
OK.

355
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:25,969
Let's go.

356
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,318
Do you know who I am?

357
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:28,483
Do you?

358
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:32,742
- Arvin Sloane.
- That's right, you son of a bitch.

359
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:38,584
Your search for Rambaldi
has frustrated you.

360
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,581
Frustrated me?

361
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,208
You mean that meaningless quest
that you sent me on 30 years ago?

362
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:49,593
That made me abandon the CIA
and betray everyone I ever loved.

363
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:52,637
Your wife has been killed.

364
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:00,395
How did you know that?

365
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,439
Put away the gun.

366
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,780
There is something I must show you.

367
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:45,149
We found the truck. No sign of the driver.
I'm going to look for the device.

368
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:47,361
Copy, Mountaineer.
Base Camp, waiting on your signal.

369
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,856
Copy that, Boy Scout.
Hold your position.

370
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,991
Cover me.

371
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:58,868
It's not here. It's already been moved.
We have to search every container.

372
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,534
You do not have time.
Initiate secondary protocol.

373
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,796
Not yet. We'll give Sydney
as much time as we can to find the device.

374
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,290
At least move your team into place.

375
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,719
- Boy Scout, weapons free. Move out.
- Copy.

376
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,188
- Did you secure the freight?
- Yeah.

377
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,916
- Who the hell are you?
- CIA.

378
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,753
You just took possession of a cargo
coming from Panama City. Where is it?

379
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,337
No idea what you're talking about.

380
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,965
Where is it?

381
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:56,005
Maybe they didn't tell you, but
it could be a weapon of mass destruction.

382
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,639
Piss off.

383
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,139
OK. OK.

384
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,310
You see this? There's enough C-4 here
to blow us all to hell.

385
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,477
Where the hell's the device?

386
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,437
- Dixon, what are you doing?
- Stay back, Sydney.

387
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,319
- No way. You're gonna kill yourself.
- I have nothing to lose.

388
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,690
What the hell is your man doing?

389
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,862
Agent Dixon,
disarm your explosive immediately.

390
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,829
- Can you see them from your position?
- Negative.

391
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,284
Dixon, think. Don't do this.

392
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,666
- Sydney, get outta here.
- I'm not leaving without you.

393
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:28,538
- Dixon, I repeat, deactivate that weapon.
- Tell me where the box is or we die.

394
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:31,753
- Base Camp. Got a visual.
- What's it gonna be?

395
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,220
Tell Vaughn to take him down.

396
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:37,254
Dixon may be holding a manual detonator.
Firing at him could trigger the explosion.

397
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,933
15... 14...

398
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,894
Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank.

399
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,554
Agent Vaughn, this is
NSA Deputy Director Brandon.

400
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,897
I am ordering you to take that shot
at first possible opportunity.

401
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:54,235
Sydney, please, go.
What's it gonna be? Tell me.

402
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:57,362
OK. Container 246B.

403
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,787
Now shut it off.
Shut it off, shut it off.

404
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:16,677
I cut the primer cord.
I'm not that desperate.

405
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:26,768
- We've got a device.
- Two minutes, 40 seconds to midnight.

406
00:34:56,012 --> 00:35:00,591
30 years ago,
I could only tell you so much.

407
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:06,722
Information had to come to you
over time.

408
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,647
Or you would not have understood.

409
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:15,113
Certain events needed to unfold,

410
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:18,863
according to Rambaldi's writings.

411
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:26,494
Your wife's death,
though unfortunate,

412
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:30,582
was a necessary step on your journey.

413
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,792
You knew my wife was going to die.

414
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,095
And you didn't warn me.

415
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,299
If I had,

416
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,927
I could not have given you this.

417
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:56,356
No sign of radioactivity.
The device is self-contained.

418
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,532
Not hard-wired to the case.
Do I have authorisation to open it?

419
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:02,618
- 19 seconds.
- Open the box, Delta leader.

420
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,574
You can always choose to ignore it.

421
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:12,453
- I've opened the box.
- Can you deactivate it?

422
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,172
Negative.

423
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,673
- It's not a bomb.
- What is it?

424
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,294
Don't answer that, Delta leader.
You seal the box, bring it home.

425
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,523
Sir, it's Delta leader.
It's all clear. We're packing up.

426
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,899
I guess Rambaldi was wrong.

427
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,449
Your jurisdiction just expired.

428
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,118
I'll have a jet standing by
to take you back to Washington.

429
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,965
Now you understand.

430
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:59,169
Your journey has just begun.

431
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:26,199
Last night, asking you to lie for me.

432
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,205
I'm sorry I ever put you
in that position.

433
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:35,543
It's OK.

434
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:43,543
After you left...

435
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:48,971
I got in my car,
drove to this bridge I know.

436
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:54,270
I was standing there,
looking up at the sky.

437
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:59,233
Asking God for forgiveness
for what I was about to do.

438
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,323
And then I heard something.

439
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,901
It's a baby crying.

440
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:15,710
It's a baby crying. I didn't know
where it was coming from, I was alone.

441
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:20,124
And I started thinking
about my babies.

442
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:24,794
I could see them.
I saw them.

443
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:30,095
In the crib. I saw us sitting up with them
at night when they were sick.

444
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:36,982
And so I stepped down off the railing.

445
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:42,943
I looked up, and it wasn't a baby
that was crying.

446
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:49,783
It was just a tree branch
bending in the wind.

447
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,542
You're all I need to get by

448
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,296
You're all I need to get by

449
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,871
You're all I need to get by

450
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:05,793
Long as I got you then, baby,
you know that you got me, oh

451
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,598
Can I have a bite?

452
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,432
Dixon's gonna be OK.

453
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:25,778
He admitted what he did, he turned
himself in. That matters to Personnel.

454
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:35,032
Vaughn, I knew what he did.

455
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,240
I knew that he changed his results.

456
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,788
And I didn't say anything to Barnett.

457
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:46,042
Or you.

458
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:56,888
You know this, but my parents
were absent when I was growing up.

459
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,100
I never had anyone to disappoint.

460
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,481
That's different now.

461
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,940
I'm sorry.

462
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:23,707
You're all I need

463
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,707
Whoa whoa

464
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,134
You're all I need

465
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,130
Whoa whoa

466
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:36,015
You're all I need,
baby, baby, to get by

467
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,018
Yeah

468
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,229
Get by
