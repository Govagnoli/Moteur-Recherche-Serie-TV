1
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,494
Bonsoir, madame.

2
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,333
Margeaux Gerard.

3
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:33,133
She's in position. No sign of Connelly.

4
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:34,738
He'll reveal himself.

5
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,287
Madame.

6
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:37,084
Merci.

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,092
Okay, she's just made the announcement.

8
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,258
I thought you might not come.

9
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:12,584
You underestimate me already.

10
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:13,814
Well, I almost didn't come.

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,760
Why is that? Crisis of conscience?

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I thought I might find a buyer willing to pay more.

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,700
I am not here for small talk, monsieur Connelly.

14
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:25,182
Are you selling or no?

15
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:31,810
I presume you brought the down payment.

16
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:57,097
We may have a possible third party.

17
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,500
Sending you a visual, Outrigger.

18
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,078
Got it. Searching for a match.

19
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:08,758
So what are your plans

20
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,976
with your new purchase?

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,868
Monsieur Connelly,

22
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,185
where...

23
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:15,550
is...

24
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,721
the chip?

25
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,649
This is my way out.

26
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:30,012
Anything, Outrigger?

27
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:32,966
Come on.

28
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:35,461
No matches, Shotgun.

29
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,812
With this sale, I can buy a new life --

30
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,663
a house on the Mediterranean.

31
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,135
Maybe get a dog.

32
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,748
We're under fire!

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,053
Lâche le couteau!

34
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:05,804
Freeze!

35
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:14,893
He won't get me.

36
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,873
My family.

37
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,843
I'm not gonna be made an example of.

38
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:23,292
I won't have it.

39
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,207
My wife...

40
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,607
my kids.

41
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:29,694
Put down the knife.

42
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:36,946
Marshall ran analysis of the memory chip recovered in Paris.

43
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,688
The downloaded information confirms that a biometric targeting device

44
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,306
is in fact being developed at a secure facility in Austria.

45
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,013
Attached to a weapons system,

46
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,798
this device would facilitate the targeting of an individual

47
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,654
based solely on a DNA sample or a biometric scan.

48
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,169
Next gen sniper.

49
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:55,112
Precisely.

50
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:57,580
That's why I want you on a plane to Salzburg by nightfall.

51
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,908
Standard retrieval operation.

52
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:02,539
But...

53
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,623
the man who killed himself?

54
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:07,095
He was sent there to intercept the sale.

55
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,078
When the assassin realized that the mission was a failure,

56
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,783
he killed himself to protect his family from his employer.

57
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,085
Sasha Korjev.

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,435
I don't know that name.

59
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,285
Korjev is a monster.

60
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:27,427
He's run arms to rebel forces in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Angola,

61
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:30,689
and holds a very tight leash over his men.

62
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:34,482
Amongst Korjev's tactics is leveraging the lives of their families.

63
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:37,522
And it's Korjev's network that's developing the targeting device?

64
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,216
Yes, that's correct,

65
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,259
but now that we have confirmation that Korjev is alive,

66
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:43,853
I'm tasking Dixon to locate his whereabouts.

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,227
He'll report to CIA proper.

68
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,225
They'll send a tactical team to secure his arrest.

69
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,172
I have a liaison at the angolan chancery in D.C.

70
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,200
Put Dixon on something else.

71
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,749
You want to take this over?

72
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,926
For the sake of expediency.

73
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,586
What am I missing?

74
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,664
Okay, Jack. It's yours.

75
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,141
Good luck in Salzburg.

76
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,253
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

77
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,672
You got to bring the team in on this one.

78
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,045
No way. Not until I find out more.

79
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:21,401
All right, let's just assume that your father did write those journals --

80
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,491
Look, I know my father's handwriting, all right?

81
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,320
Things were referenced.

82
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,313
Things he couldn't know about. I know it sounds crazy --

83
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:27,877
No, the Sox winning the series is crazy.

84
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,489
What we're talking about doing here is insane.

85
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,865
The nurse who led me to those journals, she disappeared. She was a plant.

86
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,190
Fine, so someone's trying to manipulate you.

87
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,850
What if my father's still alive?

88
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:37,413
What if it's his way of trying to contact me?

89
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:38,869
Okay.

90
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,067
Okay, but why now?

91
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:45,249
Why let you and your mother believe that he's been dead for 25 years?

92
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,616
I don't know. That's what I'm gonna find out.

93
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:48,693
Hey.

94
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,732
What's this? Who's Frank Murdoch?

95
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,821
The code name that you asked me to check in the journals.

96
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:58,572
He's ex-special forces.

97
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:01,184
Changed his name several times, finally settled on Frank Murdoch.

98
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,800
He runs a furniture repair shop outside San Diego.

99
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:05,877
You didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?

100
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:06,581
D ude.

101
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,018
Nadia?

102
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:08,770
Hey.

103
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:10,833
Thanks.

104
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:23,822
The angolan chancery in D.C. Hmm.

105
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,742
Don't you think that's a bit thin, Jack?

106
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,380
You should have brought this to me first.

107
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,520
The details of Sasha Korjev's mission are classified.

108
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:35,798
As far as anyone else is concerned,

109
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,413
the assignment is merely to tag the location.

110
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:40,900
The  CIA wants him assassinated.

111
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:44,328
Which is why I thought it unfair to burden you with this.

112
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,750
Dixon has the necessary experience.

113
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,457
With Dixon it would have to be a distance hit.

114
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,396
I'll be able to get close to Korjev.

115
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,863
Oh, I'm aware of that.

116
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,228
And frankly, that concerns me.

117
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,299
I'll be fine.

118
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:04,147
Korjev should have been eliminated years ago...

119
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,216
when I had the chance.

120
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,821
Man, look at you. Back from the dead.

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,762
Hello, Jimmy.

122
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:29,717
You look awful.

123
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:34,456
I keep telling myself -- green vegetables.

124
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:36,586
Got to eat more of them.

125
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,383
But, uh, you know how that is.

126
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,941
So, uh, Jack, you come bearing gifts?

127
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:53,804
Only the best.

128
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:03,372
This -- this was hard to find.

129
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,044
Is this, uh...

130
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,416
I thought that it was just a rumor.

131
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:31,027
Ah! Ha ha. Jack...

132
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,067
Uh, what do you want?

133
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,156
- Information.
- Anything.

134
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,144
The protocol for contacting Sasha Korjev.

135
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,936
Um... come on, Jack. You know I can't.

136
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:49,705
I'm disappointed, Jimmy.

137
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:52,539
I thought you were a true connoisseur.

138
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,670
Seriously, man, that's just not right.

139
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,414
Jack! Uh, please.

140
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,437
Korjev finds out it was me...

141
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:06,649
My life may not be worth much.

142
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:07,880
Wh-whatever.

143
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:08,867
Still --

144
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,700
Okay.

145
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,010
I'll, uh...

146
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll lay it out for you.

147
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,522
One small step for Mitchell Flinkman,

148
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:54,278
one giant leap for mankind.

149
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:55,841
Look at those legs.

150
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,071
He's edible. He's delicious.

151
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,304
I've taken many a chomp.

152
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,298
Add a little salt and pepper.

153
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,613
He's the best. Makes it all worth it.

154
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,371
Sorry. Speaking of which -- Salzburg.

155
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,981
Now, according to the memory chip,

156
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,119
Korjev's storing the targeting system in the sub-basement

157
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,208
of a discotheque at he owns called the Club Felice,

158
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,937
which officially begs the question, what is it with these guys and nightclubs?

159
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,619
Korjev's regional security chief is a Jeremiah Gauster.

160
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,759
Gauster has instituted a security protocol based on access cards.

161
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,662
You'll need a level 3 clearance to enter the belly of the building.

162
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:54,092
Since the access card hardware is annoyingly difficult to duplicate,

163
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:56,799
you'll need to steal one from one of the nightclub employees.

164
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,798
Not bad.

165
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,260
Definitely in the ballpark.

166
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,635
Oh, my gosh, thank you for being an american.

167
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,239
I don't think I could bear mangling the language in front of one more local.

168
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,420
Shouldn't feel bad.

169
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:41,275
These people like to be offended. It's their comfort zone.

170
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,172
Let me guess. Upstate New York.

171
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:47,077
Yeah. Yeah, Rochester.

172
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:48,021
How'd you know that?

173
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,685
I went to Buffalo state. Undergrad.

174
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,440
Come on. Go Bengals.

175
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:55,867
Don't even say that. It makes me want to cry. God, I miss it so much.

176
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,336
This time of year, me and my girlfriends should be grabbing

177
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:01,667
two beef on weck and a six-pack, you know --

178
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,657
Oh, look at me -- root from the nosebleeds.

179
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:08,083
There's nothing like roast beef and pilsner in 30-degree weather,

180
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,104
you know what I mean?

181
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,468
Yeah.

182
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:12,165
Yeah, I do.

183
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,578
Sam!

184
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:16,856
That's me.

185
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:17,512
Sam.

186
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:19,597
Sorry I can't help you with your drink.

187
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:20,913
Barback.

188
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:26,526
The good thing/bad thing about living in Austria --

189
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,179
smoking's not prohibited.

190
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,844
Ergo, you've just developed a smoking habit.

191
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,157
No, thanks.

192
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:35,907
Good answer. Just checking.

193
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:41,477
It is actually a mag strip encoder.

194
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,664
Just slide it through here like so.

195
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:47,439
It will analyze the access control algorithms,

196
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,668
extrapolate the clearances,

197
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:51,282
and then reprogram the card to give you full access.

198
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,296
- Hey.
- Sam.

199
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:06,665
- Do you need a light?
- No.

200
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,167
Thank  you.

201
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,303
I was just looking.

202
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:10,194
Didn't mean to scare you.

203
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,715
Whoops. Duh. Found it.

204
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,936
Um, so, listen. Uh...

205
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:20,055
I never do this. Really.

206
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:23,325
But, um, I've been here for six months,

207
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,652
and, uh, I don't really know anybody.

208
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,536
At least not anybody who knows about beef on weck, so...

209
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:36,252
That smile and those dimples are

210
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:39,201
pretty much the greatest thing I've ever seen, so

211
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,669
I thought if I didn't come over --

212
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:41,757
I have a boyfriend.

213
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,456
Right. No, right. Of course you do.

214
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:45,397
But thank you.

215
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:48,151
Guy's gotta try.

216
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,395
Where's the bathroom?

217
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:54,393
It's, uh, just -- just --

218
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,310
Merlin?

219
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:11,572
Merlin?

220
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,702
Okay, I got you, Phoenix.

221
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,535
Heading in.

222
00:14:19,657 --> 00:14:21,187
No one's supposed to be down there.

223
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,313
Run a sweep on section Delta.

224
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,061
Pull up all the employee access records.

225
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,402
Let's find out who's down there.

226
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:40,403
What do you see?

227
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:41,888
Workstations cleared.

228
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:45,958
Hang on.

229
00:14:56,486 --> 00:15:00,824
Status report, operation Hawkeye, dated... today.

230
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:01,577
Open it up.

231
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,022
Nothing.

232
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,934
The report's embedded.

233
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:20,494
"Transport protocol enacted. Delivery on schedule."

234
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,193
They moved the targeting device.

235
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,815
"Scheduled to leave the country at 0600 hours."

236
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:27,378
Okay.

237
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:31,113
Let's see. Checking airfields and shipping yards.

238
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,138
"Installation complete. Status -- field ready."

239
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:36,829
My god.

240
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:38,243
It's already weaponized.

241
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:43,999
Syd?

242
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,202
Syd? Syd, are you okay?

243
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,629
Operation Hawkeye -- where's it being shipped out of?

244
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,240
- Tell me.
- No.

245
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,000
Sam Houser.

246
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,666
Breach initiated by Sam Houser. Club level employee.

247
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,468
All units, locate and detain him.

248
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,884
Wasn't a yes or no question.

249
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,916
The name of the shipping yard.

250
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,575
Delongpre shipping.

251
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:14,609
Syd, are you okay?

252
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:15,596
We're going in.

253
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,378
Let's get him.

254
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:32,308
I'm okay.

255
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,527
Be careful, okay?

256
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:35,623
What do you have?

257
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:37,186
Houser, Samuel David.

258
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,637
Living for a half a year in Austria on a student visa.

259
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:43,018
Odd jobs, owes money on some overdue movie rentals.

260
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:45,948
Other than that, he's just a guy.

261
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,406
Hey.

262
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,728
Let's get out of here.

263
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,770
Uh, but you said you had a boyfriend, and I thought --

264
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,412
A girl can change her mind, right?

265
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:09,876
Uh, I don't get off for like another hour,

266
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,727
but you could wait for me at the bar or I --

267
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:14,276
Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm.

268
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:17,037
If you don't leave with me right now, you will regret it.

269
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,212
All right, well, we could slip out the back door.

270
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,966
You took the words right out of my mouth.

271
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:29,372
Go check over there.

272
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,242
Delongpre shipping is 30 miles outside of Salzburg.

273
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,178
I have an in-country contact.

274
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,410
Use him. Have him supply you for the mission.

275
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,784
We need to secure the weapon before it leaves port.

276
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,046
If we cross over to Filton, I know a great wine bar.

277
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,087
I'm sorry. I'm on the phone with my sister.

278
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:52,642
Where's the phone?

279
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,779
We have another situation. A civilian.

280
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,871
Korjev's team tagged him as my accomplice. I can't leave him.

281
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,436
Pass him off to your contact.

282
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,842
We'll have him reestablished stateside by the weekend.

283
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,152
That cell is insane.

284
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,333
The guy at the store told me mine was the smallest,

285
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,470
but I knew he was jobbing me.

286
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:12,925
Sam?

287
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:14,050
Yeah?

288
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:15,660
There's something I have to tell you.

289
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,461
You're having second thoughts.

290
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:19,307
It's not about that.

291
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:20,823
If it's about your boyfriend, let me just say --

292
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:21,958
Forget about the boyfriend.

293
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,952
Well, maybe we could just go back to my place and talk then.

294
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:25,324
It would be nice to have a normal conversation,

295
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,171
if you don't mind a mess.

296
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:27,687
- Sam.
- Yeah.

297
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:30,991
You can never go back to your place.

298
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,301
- What?
- Listen to me.

299
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,919
Your bosses at the club are bad men.

300
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:39,011
I  was there tonight to stop them from doing a bad thing.

301
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,043
Wait a minute. I'm --

302
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,182
I needed your access card, and I took it.

303
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,842
And now they think we work together.

304
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,296
Work together?

305
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,057
What about beef on --

306
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,851
Who the hell are you?

307
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:55,893
I need you to trust me right now.

308
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,757
Oh, is that what you need?

309
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,586
Okay, that's good, because

310
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,438
I got to get back to work so I can get away from the mind games.

311
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:05,238
Wait.

312
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,711
If you go back there, they will kill you.

313
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:11,439
You're serious?

314
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:13,669
But if you stick with me, I promise I'll protect you.

315
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,730
We have ways of handling these situations.

316
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:18,911
Who's "we"?

317
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,309
I can't tell you that.

318
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,628
Hold on. You've already lied to me once.

319
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,005
So how do I know that you're not one of the bad guys?

320
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,656
If I was one of the bad guys,

321
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:31,499
you'd already be dead.

322
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,544
Thanks, Joe.

323
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:56,568
Hi. I'm looking for someone. Frank Murdoch. Do you know him?

324
00:19:58,858 --> 00:19:59,804
Nope.

325
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,407
Never heard of him.

326
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,675
Well, this shop's registered to his name.

327
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,746
What are you, a cop?

328
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,831
No, it's a personal matter regarding my father.

329
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,190
Tell you what.

330
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,319
If ever you get your memory back,

331
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,352
tell him Michael Vaughn's looking for him.

332
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,636
That's my number. Thanks for your help.

333
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,738
You're really Bill Vaughn's kid?

334
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:33,700
Yeah.

335
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,903
That's your dad in the middle.

336
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:39,305
That's me on the right.

337
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:41,617
Everyone else is dead.

338
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:45,788
You think he's still alive?

339
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,374
Well, I hope not.

340
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,807
When was the last time you saw him?

341
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,691
The Falkland conflict.

342
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:59,399
We were supposed to lead a team of locals to secure a british position.

343
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,851
Our men were ambushed.

344
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,743
And Bill didn't even flinch.

345
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:08,170
I broke command, charged in to defend our men,

346
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,735
and the next thing I know, my legs went numb.

347
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:14,585
He shot me in the back.

348
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:17,087
I don't remember hitting the ground,

349
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,183
but I remember lying there looking up at him completely paralyzed,

350
00:21:21,276 --> 00:21:25,805
and he just stared down at me, lit a cigarette,

351
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:27,416
and walked away.

352
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:29,073
That's the last I ever saw him.

353
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,065
I can't believe that's true.

354
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,586
Yeah, well, if he's still alive,

355
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:36,248
I'll give you one piece of advice.

356
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,836
Don't turn your back on him.

357
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:50,278
Who are you calling?

358
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:54,524
Oh, right, right, right. Sorry. My bad.

359
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:56,773
Good evening.

360
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:59,619
Phoenix inquiring about a late-night snack.

361
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:01,275
And how many will we be serving?

362
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:04,128
Two. One house special, the other will be ordering off the menu.

363
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,928
When will you be joining us?

364
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:07,301
As soon as possible.

365
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,150
I'll make sure the table is ready.

366
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:10,233
Thank you.

367
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:16,550
Let me guess.

368
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:17,876
That wasn't a real restaurant.

369
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:21,947
Hello?

370
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,778
I'll have them for you shortly.

371
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,529
Good. I assure you, mr. Tauber,

372
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:29,767
Sasha Korjev will be made aware of your allegiance.

373
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,392
That is all I ask.

374
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:08,825
I'm looking for the Rug Merchant.

375
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:21,091
His shop is sixty kilometers up the Bantu River.

376
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,821
When are they coming?

377
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:54,328
It should be soon, Sam.

378
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,484
I'm not stupid, okay?

379
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:03,432
I understand what happens in the witness protection program.

380
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:07,514
I get shipped off to some boring suburb.

381
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:10,321
They pick a name right out of the episcopalian registry.

382
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,507
I don't get to see my family anymore.

383
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,618
You think my mother's gonna be able to handle that?

384
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:20,567
When I know everything's safe, I'll let her know you're okay.

385
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:25,149
You know what the real pisser of this whole thing is?

386
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:29,802
Is I came here to pump some thunder through my veins.

387
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,448
Try to find some inspiration,

388
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,490
maybe take a shot at writing something.

389
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,121
Didn't happen.

390
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:39,517
Just...

391
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:42,345
drank a lot of beer.

392
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:45,296
Here we go.

393
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:58,834
Agent Bristow. So good to see you again.

394
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:01,230
Is this the cargo?

395
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,511
This is Sam. Yeah.

396
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,923
We'll have him whitewashed within the hour.

397
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:09,876
Come, please. No worries. Your supplies are in the vehicle.

398
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,532
You have a weapon for me?

399
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,568
Of course, my dear.

400
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,657
But let's get out of the cold first, hmm?

401
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,903
We need to get out of here. We're not safe.

402
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,276
I'm not going anywhere with you.

403
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:52,702
Sam, take my hand. We have to go.

404
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:54,770
Look at what you did to him.

405
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:57,336
We just got blindsided, and we dealt with it.

406
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:00,620
That doesn't meanwe give up. It doesn't change who we are.

407
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:02,318
I'm on your side.

408
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,344
I'm not gonna lie to you, Sam.

409
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,147
I'm not gonna have the supplies I was counting on.

410
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,077
I can't promise you how this thing is gonna turn out.

411
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:10,971
You don't have backup?

412
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,054
I'm it.

413
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,831
I need you to think.

414
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:17,444
Do you know any back ways to the Delongpre shipping yards?

415
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:22,250
I mean -- yeah, you could take the metro. Why?

416
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:26,954
The people who are after us have a weapon they shouldn't have.

417
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:31,813
I want to take it from them before they use it and people die.

418
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:39,161
Let's go to the metro.

419
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,605
Hey, hold on.

420
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:45,117
You do understand that I don't have any skills...

421
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,815
in the physical sense.

422
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,288
It's okay. I got you.

423
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,027
Come on. Come on.

424
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,647
This is your stop.

425
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:04,948
Remove his hood.

426
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:06,933
Untie his hands.

427
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,969
Did this man carry identification?

428
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:13,147
Yes, sir.

429
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:14,901
And do you know who he is?

430
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,112
Sir, I --

431
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:20,048
I didn't --

432
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:25,958
You strike this man, you strike me in the heart. Understand?

433
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:33,696
Jack, my dear friend.

434
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:35,484
Hello, Sasha.

435
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,597
I apologize for that scene outside.

436
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:43,333
I've always remembered what you taught me --

437
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,723
treat your men like children.

438
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:48,448
Give them rope to become their own men.

439
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,287
But if they make mistakes,

440
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:52,026
hang them with it.

441
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,182
I'd say my lessons have served you well.

442
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:58,887
I'd ask how you managed to find me, but I know you too well.

443
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:02,197
You can rest assured, you're well insulated.

444
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,622
I do what is necessary to stay alive.

445
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:09,313
After all, I don't have you or the CIA to watch my back anymore.

446
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:13,635
I must say, I was shocked at how abruptly our association ended.

447
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:17,439
One day we are working together, arming a rebellion.

448
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:20,368
The next, you're gone.

449
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:22,886
My mandate changed.

450
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:26,423
Yet here you are.

451
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:30,070
Why are you here, Jack?

452
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,251
I'm entering the private sector.

453
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,243
Now that I'm out from under their watchful eye, I was hoping

454
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,235
we could talk business.

455
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,913
It would be my honor to work with you.

456
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:46,641
Excuse me.

457
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:50,712
Yes?

458
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,848
The delivery of the package is proceeding on schedule.

459
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:54,978
Keep me posted.

460
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:01,405
Jack, I want to show you my zoo.

461
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:03,955
It was a dusty ride.

462
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,801
Of course. Forgive me.

463
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:11,839
I have an 18-year-old single malt that should remedy that, huh?

464
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:12,734
Excellent.

465
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:22,237
Jack, I'd like you to meet my wife.

466
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:23,557
Lani.

467
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:27,051
- Pleasure.
- The Jack?

468
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:28,232
The one.

469
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,412
Then the pleasure is all mine.

470
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,067
I hope you'll be staying a while.

471
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,779
I'd like to get to know the man my husband talks about.

472
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:38,152
That's very kind, but I'm not certain how long I can stay.

473
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:39,835
Well, dinner at least.

474
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,448
I'll see that the staff prepare something wonderful.

475
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:46,042
Truly, it's so good to finally meet you.

476
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:46,983
You too.

477
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,880
I need to steal Sasha from you just a moment.

478
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:51,822
Certainly.

479
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:54,912
Make yourself comfortable in my office. First door on the right.

480
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:05,011
Can you tell what it is?

481
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:06,720
UAV assault chopper.

482
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:09,900
It's kind of small.

483
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,558
- They customized it.
- What?

484
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,221
The biometric targeting system -- it's in the chopper.

485
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:18,776
Once that thing locks onto its target, there's no hiding.

486
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,402
So that thing kills people?

487
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:27,387
- Can you drive this thing?
- Yeah.

488
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:30,521
Remember whan you said you wanted to pump some thunder into your veins?

489
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,127
You're about to get your chance.

490
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,210
I'll get the weapon.

491
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,821
You drive the van into the warehouse.

492
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:36,290
Pick me up in three minutes.

493
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,673
Don't touch that. I'll be in my office.

494
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,769
You can do this, Sam.

495
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,904
Just... stay cool, man.

496
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,871
- Get in.
- Here. Take this.

497
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,577
Get down! Stay inside!

498
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:07,431
I missed.

499
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:09,542
I noticed.

500
00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:15,316
That guy was my boss, and he shot me.

501
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:19,985
- It doesn't hurt.
- It will soon.

502
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:21,781
Oh. Oh.

503
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,880
We did it, huh?

504
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:26,808
We saved the world.

505
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:28,887
Something like that.

506
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,312
She's lovely your wife.

507
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:42,168
Indeed. We just found out -- she's pregnant.

508
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:45,410
Congratulations.

509
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:47,526
I'll be honest with you.

510
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:50,696
When we first saw the heartbeat, I was scared.

511
00:35:51,022 --> 00:35:53,927
I thought, what kind of a father will I be?

512
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,193
But seeing you here, I'm reminded

513
00:35:57,285 --> 00:36:01,241
of the tools you've given me, the tools of being a man.

514
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:11,660
I gave you the tools. You chose how to use them.

515
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:13,777
There was a time, Jack,

516
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,390
when we were both working for the higher purpose

517
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,183
but our goals were not the same.

518
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:23,369
That became clear when you and your agency decided to abandon me.

519
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:27,537
I realized on that day how naive I'd been.

520
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:30,291
I had no option but to pick myself up,

521
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:31,281
stay on course,

522
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,458
because that is the man you taught me to be.

523
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,166
I know there are some in your government that see my business as a form of betrayal --

524
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,041
You betrayed me.

525
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:10,088
Mr Korjev asked not to be distirbed. He'll be out shortly.

526
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:13,261
I need a car. I need to go to town.

527
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,119
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:22,109
When did you get back?

529
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:23,477
About an hour ago.

530
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:25,311
Did you find Murdoch?

531
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,541
Nah, I couldn't track him down.

532
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:29,655
Ready?

533
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:30,549
We should go.

534
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:32,346
We're going to the movies. Want to come?

535
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,428
Oh. No, thanks. Not tonight.

536
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,325
Is it important? We don't have to go.

537
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,558
Oh, no. No, no. You guys go. I'll see you tomorrow.

538
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:43,828
All right.

539
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:45,392
- Good night.
- Good night.

540
00:37:59,005 --> 00:37:59,774
Hey.

541
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,556
I spoke to my people,

542
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,019
they spoke to people.

543
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,054
It's safe for you to go back home.

544
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:22,288
I think I'm done here.

545
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,935
It's time for me to move on.

546
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:29,627
Must kill you.

547
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:34,151
Get to do all these crazy things

548
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:37,697
and see all these amazing places.

549
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:39,527
You gotta keep it to yourself.

550
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:45,125
You know what? It's not so bad.

551
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,537
It gives people like us something in common.

552
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:55,068
"People like us," huh?

553
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:08,992
Hey.

554
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,640
I'll see you around the globe.

555
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:17,457
Goodbye, Sam.

556
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:35,691
Hey Dad! I heard you located Korjev.

557
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:36,915
Yes, I did.

558
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:39,767
Sloane said he was taken in a standoff. Were you there?

559
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,157
I saw it play out.

560
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,435
Heading home?

561
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,891
Yeah, I'm gonna grab some dinner first.

562
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:49,487
Okay.

563
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,036
- Good night.
- Godd night.

564
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:57,935
Dad!

565
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,385
I'm kind of hungry myself --

566
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,701
if you wouldn't mind the company.

567
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:06,355
What about your report?

568
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:08,892
It'll keep.

569
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:35,592
