00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:04,005
Marshall counted 12 sources
that make up Prophet Five.

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:05,261
They killed Vaughn.

3
00:00:07,338 --> 00:00:09,141
I'm not sure if I can do this, dad.

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,913
It's hard being without him.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,033
You've got an active one there,
just like mommy.

6
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,716
You're suggesting
that we abduct Sydney Bristow.

7
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,367
Prophet five has Sydney.

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,602
There!

12
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,593
This is field agent I.D.
Black, seven, niner, three, sierra.

13
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,287
Confirmation Foxtrot...

14
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,505
Repeat, confirmation Foxtrot One.

15
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,975
Status, M.I.A. I'm being held aboard
a cargo freighter, registry unknown.

16
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:01,503
Do it.

17
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,152
Organize a deck-by-deck search
and find her.

18
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,326
Damn it!

19
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,120
What did you find out?

20
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,763
I have confirmation that Prophet Five
is holding Sydney.

21
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,389
I believe they've had designs on her
from the beginning.

22
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,199
They knew precisely where and when
she'd be most vulnerable.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,745
They must have been tracking her.

24
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:34,985
Have they made any demands?

25
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:37,406
None. But whatever their intentions,
for now,

26
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:39,730
I have reason to believe
they need her alive.

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,182
Listen, Jack, we've seen Sydney
come through some bad situations.

28
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,746
Whatever you need, I'm here.

29
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:48,121
For now, contact everyone you know,
official or otherwise.

30
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,388
I'll do the same.

31
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,700
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

32
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:57,701
Mr. Bristow!

33
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,330
I just recovered a field transmission.

34
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,067
- It's from Sydney.
- Where is she?

35
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:06,180
This is field agent I.D.
Black, seven, niner, three, sierra.

36
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,458
Confirmation fox...

37
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,411
...repeat, confirmation foxtrot one.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,344
Status, M.I.A. I'm being held...

39
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,948
- Held where? What happened?
- I don't know.

40
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,515
Looks like the file's
just corrupted.

41
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,287
I can't seem to pull 'em up.
You know what?

42
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:26,056
It's okay. I just need the tags
to triangulate the signal of origin.

43
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,965
Then I'll have the exact location
Sydney sent it from.

44
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,861
Wait a minute. You know what?
They're being deleted.

45
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,103
This doesn't make any sense.

46
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,383
It's like someone just wiped out
the archive...

47
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,392
Marshall, what archive?

48
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,806
- Whose system are you logged into?
- This must be wrong.

49
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:49,302
It's not wrong.

50
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,542
Gather everyone in the briefing room.

51
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,626
No, we haven't located her yet.

52
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,610
No, that won't be necessary.

53
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,932
Should we prepare to welcome company?

54
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,101
The transmission's been taken care of.

55
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:11,055
We've cleared the lower deck.
Still nothing.

56
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,306
Then why are you still standing here?

57
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,228
Moments ago, we receive
a field communication from Sydney.

58
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,113
>From the little we were able
to decipher,

59
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:43,835
it appears she's still being held
in the custody of Prophet Five.

60
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:47,164
However, before we were able
to resolve the entire transmission,

61
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,232
someone deleted it.

62
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,517
Someone at Langley.

63
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,868
Based on our current intel,
we already have reason

64
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,214
to believe that Prophet Five's network
has infiltrated

65
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,757
the intelligence agencies
of several foreign governments.

66
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:04,152
It now appears they may
have infiltrated our own.

67
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:08,388
Someone within the C.I.A.
did not want us to receive that message.

68
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,875
It's standard protocol
for all incoming signals

69
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:12,946
priority three and above

70
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:16,194
to be automatically backed up
on Echelon's comm. archive.

71
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:18,444
Unfortunately,
the only way to gain access

72
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,694
to this archive
is on the premises itself.

73
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,165
Not an easy task,
given security measures.

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,334
Wait, are you suggesting
that we break into C.I.A. Headquarters?

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,258
Yes.

76
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,692
Wouldn't it be prudent to consider
other possibilities?

77
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,232
Maybe the message was purged
accidentally.

78
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,504
We could ask Langley
for a copy of the archives.

79
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,382
I appreciate your concerns,
but at this point

80
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:42,184
we have no way of knowing
how deep this conspiracy reaches.

81
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,437
We can't risk tipping them off
to our agenda.

82
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,005
Effective as of this moment,

83
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,616
all information relating
to this task force

84
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:54,078
and its activities is to be strictly
compartmentalized

85
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,763
even from the C.I.A. Itself.

86
00:05:57,822 --> 00:06:00,351
I understand what I'm asking
of all of you.

87
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,068
An action of this kind
could be considered treason.

88
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:07,243
Given that, if anyone feels
they need to take

89
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,685
a leave of absence,
you're free to do so,

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,378
No questions asked,
but now is the time to speak up.

91
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:25,508
All right then.

92
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,095
We're wheels up in an hour.

93
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,484
I want a visual inspection
of every container on that deck.

94
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,117
Post four, do you copy?

95
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,550
Post four, reporting in.

96
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,702
You tracked me with the radio.

97
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:08,702
Not really.

98
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,114
You're just predictable.

99
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,321
A woman in your condition,
shouldn't you be resting?

100
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,388
Thanks.

101
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,468
I don't plan on staying long.

102
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,022
Turn around. Give me your radio.

103
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Whatever.

104
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,985
But you should know
that no one's coming for you.

105
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,187
- We intercepted your message.
- Nice try.

106
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,950
My message didn't go through a relay,
but directly to my people.

107
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,302
That's not true exactly.

108
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,646
Technically, it went to Langley.

109
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,646
That's where it was intercepted.

110
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,138
You're bluffing.

111
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:43,702
If you really had an undercover asset
within the C.I.A.,

112
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,938
Why would you risk admitting it to me?

113
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,864
Because you're not
getting off this ship.

114
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:54,473
Dixon just called.

115
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,715
They're in position.

116
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,337
We're ready out here.

117
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,226
I'd like to welcome everyone

118
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,662
to the C.I.A.'s
new headquarters building

119
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:07,227
here in Langley, Virginia.

120
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:12,502
Comprising 1.1 million square feet
of space and resting on 258 acres,

121
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,101
this building was an expansion
of the original structure

122
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,379
completed in 1991.

123
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,409
Aside from the obvious human presence,

124
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,666
there are over
5,000 surveillance cameras

125
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,979
that watch over
very inch of the complex

126
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,868
and chemical and biological weapons

127
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,457
detection sensors
that monitor the air quality

128
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:32,625
as well as various other
state-of-the-art technologies that...

129
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,833
if we told you, we'd have to kill you.

130
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:38,914
Now if you'll follow me, you'll notice

131
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,101
the commemorative plaque
off to your right.

132
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,718
It honors the unsung
heroes of World War II,

133
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,102
the intelligence gatherers of the C.I.A.

134
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,223
Sidewinder, we're almost ready here.

135
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,409
Roger that.
Near security on my way to payroll.

136
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:59,716
Hi, I have an appointment
with human resources. Emily Higgins.

137
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,040
Right. Just need an I.D.

138
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,164
Sure. Sorry.

139
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,402
Job interview. I'M...

140
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,962
- I'm a little nervous.
- I'm sure you'll do just fine.

141
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:11,394
Please place your purse on the table.

142
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,015
Excuse me,
do you know where payroll is?

143
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,576
I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't allow
camera phones on the premises.

144
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,910
You can pick it up
at the security office on your way out.

145
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,723
Okay, thanks.

146
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,147
The third floor.
Elevator's to your right.

147
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,768
Sorry, there's a problem
with my check.

148
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:53,769
Yeah, just a sec.

149
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,163
Ma'am, I'm actually...

150
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:56,914
- I'm kind of in A...
- Name?

151
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,351
Thomas Grace.

152
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,412
it says here you're no longer
an employee of this agency.

153
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,915
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here.
I've had several back checks owed to me.

154
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,037
I never received them.

155
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,278
Well, our records show
that all your checks went out,

156
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,190
and they were cashed.

157
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,348
That's impossible.

158
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,421
It's usually the spouse
that cashes them.

159
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,477
I suggest you check with your wife.

160
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,851
Look, I'm sure if you check
your file again,

161
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,860
you'll see that you're mistaken.

162
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:29,006
Mr. Grace, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize..

163
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,390
maybe there's something I can do here.

164
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:44,475
Sidewinder, we're logging
in to the server now.

165
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:48,038
Look, I don't have six months
to wait for the claim to be processed.

166
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,975
- I understand, but...
- I've got a mortgage to pay, so

167
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,940
could you please just...
just help me out?

168
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,826
Connection's established.

169
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,102
Sidewinder, stand by
for the access code.

170
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,354
All right, I'll check
with my supervisor.

171
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,237
Maybe he can help clear this up.

172
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,927
Access code is Alpha, 7,
Delta, Lima, 22.

173
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,727
Copy that.

174
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:25,104
I've got access.

175
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,598
Outrigger, I'm approaching your 20.

176
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,729
Copy.

177
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,616
I'm going to need item number two.

178
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,604
And here's another one of our
display items.

179
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,605
It looks like ordinary pocket change,

180
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:43,300
but spies used devices like these
during the cold war

181
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,629
to smuggle tiny microfilm and messages.

182
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,139
You can only imagine
what's in use today.

183
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:58,507
Oracle...

184
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,166
<i>you're clear to the server room.</i>

185
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,755
<i>Call us when you get there.</i>

186
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:10,319
- She's in. I'm done here.
- Copy that.

187
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,172
Log out and move
to the rendezvous point.

188
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:13,112
<i>Affirmative.</i>

189
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,113
I'm on my way.

190
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,263
I'm at the server room.
Guards are in position.

191
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,138
Copy that.

192
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,452
<i>Stand by for the signal.</i>

193
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:27,511
Merlin, you're up.

194
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,756
Titled "Kryptos," this sculpture
was designed in part as a monument

195
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:34,948
to the code breakers who helped
crack the German Enigma cipher.

196
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:38,199
In fact, as you can see,
the sculpture is itself a code,

197
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,573
apparently a very good one.

198
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:42,985
To this day, no one has been able
to decipher the message.

199
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:45,718
- Now, if we move on...
- I got it!

200
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,731
Sorry, It just came to me.

201
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,517
I play a lot of Sudoku.

202
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,023
Excuse me, I'll just... if you could...

203
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,332
I'll tell you more.
The letters that are overlaid

204
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,457
onto the coding sections,

205
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,323
well, they act as a key to the cipher.

206
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:05,449
Based off that, you just need
to transpose the letters.

207
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:09,151
Right? That's all you need to do, see?

208
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,192
What's that?

209
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,751
Maybe they found out
I decoded the message. We should run!

210
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,881
- Take it down a notch, Hamlet.
- Please, everyone,

211
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,184
we need to move quickly to the exits.

212
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,762
Anthrax alert!

213
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:26,880
All report to deck.

214
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:31,887
I'm in.

215
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:32,851
I need the server number

216
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,988
- for Syd's transmission.
- We're looking for 8577.

217
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,435
8577. Copy that.

218
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,261
I found it.

219
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,317
I'm pulling the archive now.

220
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:18,924
Sydney's transmission
is time-stamped 9:55 A.M.

221
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,510
The archive's been purged.
The message isn't here.

222
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,726
Could you pull the hard drive?

223
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:27,951
We still can recover the data.

224
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,128
Okay, hold on a sec.

225
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,836
It's no good. The hard drive
is patched into the security grid.

226
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:35,795
If I remove the drive,

227
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,825
- it'll trigger the alarm.
- Pull the hard drive.

228
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,634
Langley will initiate a lockdown, Jack.

229
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,636
We'll never get them out.

230
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,048
Pull the hard drive now!

231
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:43,263
<i>I'll get you out.</i>

232
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,376
Make the call, Jack.

233
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:03,994
Excuse me.
I'm going to have to ask you

234
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,266
to hold it right here.
We're locking down the facility.

235
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,805
Four in the north corridor.

236
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:12,923
Sorry, everyone. It appears
we're having a minor security incident.

237
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,964
No one will be able
to leave the building just yet.

238
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:19,713
A lockdown?

239
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,341
30 seconds ago I got a call about
an evacuation due to an Anthrax attack.

240
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:26,009
There's a big difference.
Evacuation means everyone has to leave.

241
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,402
Lockdown means everyone has...

242
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,103
No, he's with the delegation.
I'm not gonna disturb him.

243
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,216
And what could I tell him?

244
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:32,339
I've got a great idea.

245
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,765
Why don't you get your facts straight
and then call me back?

246
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,034
Great.

247
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:38,091
Put in a call to state. Cancel my 4:00.

248
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:41,017
And I cannot believe this,
but I have to cancel my Pilates again.

249
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,096
Eric, it's Jack Bristow.

250
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,982
Sydney's in trouble. I need your help.

251
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,191
What?

252
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,691
Whatever you need.

253
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,106
Outrigger, you copy?

254
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,455
What's going on out there?

255
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:07,760
The building's locked down.

256
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,839
<i>Are you at the rendezvous point?</i>

257
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:12,603
I'm stuck in the witness protection
archives.

258
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:15,510
The door must have sealed
because of the lockdown.

259
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:18,073
Hold your position.

260
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,060
I'll see what I can do.

261
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,675
What is it?

262
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,940
Think he's here to arrest us?

263
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,216
He looks like he's coming to arrest us.

264
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,116
Ambassador Utland...

265
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:34,984
- Yes.
- How are you, sir?

266
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,731
And you must be Mr. Cornish.

267
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,734
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

268
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:39,970
I am, Eric Weiss.

269
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,106
I'll be your liaison.

270
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:44,439
I apologize for the security problems
that we're having today.

271
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:46,481
Please, it's not a problem.

272
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,892
I understand. These things happen.

273
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,478
And I understand you have a meeting
on the hill in 30 minutes.

274
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,482
I'm here to make sure
that you make that meeting.

275
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:55,188
Thank you.
I'll escort our visitors from here.

276
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,161
All right, Jack briefed me.
What's going on?

277
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,055
Tom's trapped in witsec records.

278
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,432
Rachel is still
in the Echelon server facility.

279
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:04,293
You know what, witsec records
is in the northeast corridor.

280
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,921
This should get you in through
the door,

281
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,459
and Marshall and I can handle Rachel.

282
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,128
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

283
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,422
Tom?

284
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,329
What were you doing here?

285
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,888
I got detoured.
I needed someplace to hide.

286
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:30,891
Come on, we need to move.

287
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,546
Okay, got it.

288
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:40,671
That's not good.

289
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,270
- Where is she?
- There.

290
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,045
Okay, what's her call sign?

291
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,481
- Oracle.
- Oracle, listen to me very carefully.

292
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,482
- Who is this?
- Right now I'm your superior.

293
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,296
I need you to do exactly as I tell you.

294
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,048
There's a guard that's about to go
right down the row that you're in.

295
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,802
I need you to turn left.
Make a left right now! Make a left!

296
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,976
Good, good, good. Okay, go straight.

297
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>Keep going straight.</i>

298
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:05,190
- Weiss, look
- Okay, stop right there! Stop.

299
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,869
Marshall, how long
with that door?

300
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:09,922
Just give me 10 sec.

301
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,516
All right, when I say "go," run as fast

302
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,670
as you possibly can towards the doors
at the far end.

303
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:14,482
Don't stop.

304
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,731
We will have those doors open
by the time you get there.

305
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,118
- Okay, got it!
- Okay, go!

306
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,412
Sorry. I forgot to hit "enter."
Okay, now go.

307
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,358
How'd it go?

308
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,359
Not well.

309
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:48,920
Don't worry.

310
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,733
He's with us.

311
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:50,734
Eric Weiss.

312
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:53,609
Rachel Gibson.
Thank you for the help back there.

313
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,484
Oh, my pleasure.

314
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,236
Any luck with Sydney's message?

315
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,589
They wiped the backups.

316
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,235
We may be able to run data recovery
on this,

317
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:02,659
but if they went to all the trouble
of deleting the message,

318
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:06,114
I don't think they'd be careless enough
to leave any traces behind.

319
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:07,610
Better get a move on.

320
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:08,809
Take this tunnel to the end,

321
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,654
it leads at the southeast edge
of the complex.

322
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,086
I have to go back inside
to delete the surveillance footage.

323
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,984
Oh, if you hear anything
about Sydney...

324
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,627
- We will.
- Okay, and one more thing.

325
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,298
Next time, just call.

326
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,931
Care to tell me exactly
where we're going?

327
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,058
This ship has lifeboats.

328
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,059
We're taking one.

329
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,306
Good idea. You'll be spotted
the minute you step on the deck.

330
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:31,972
Not if you order your men
to search the lower decks.

331
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,273
Do it.

332
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,890
Get in there, go.

333
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,715
Make a sound, and you're dead.

334
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:58,666
Something's wrong, isn't it?

335
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:02,841
Move.

336
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,496
Whatever you say,
but you don't look so good.

337
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,350
Stop, stop!

338
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:36,666
Come on.

339
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,442
What is this?

340
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:44,812
Why is this here?

341
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,433
You have until three
to start giving me some answers.

342
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:50,521
One...

343
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,130
two...

344
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,755
Oh, no, no, no, no, you must not move.

345
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,239
What are you doing to me?

346
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Just be still.

347
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:41,779
The doctor is on the way.

348
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
What doctor?

349
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:44,518
Just tell me what's wrong.

350
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,871
Is something wrong with my baby?

351
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,880
I need to tell them you're awake.

352
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,225
You should be still.

353
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,544
Wait, please don't go.

354
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,648
- I will come back soon.
- Wait!

355
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,344
You can crack into this hard drive
and find Sydney's transmission?

356
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,578
Uh, cracking Langley's encryption
won't be a problem.

357
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,363
I wrote a program that can handle
anything under 512-bit encoding.

358
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,479
I can't seem to recover
Sydney's transmission.

359
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,829
Whoever wiped it
used a secure deletion program.

360
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,395
Basically, it rewrites
random junk over it hundreds of times.

361
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:40,242
Yeah, but the original data's
still there,

362
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:41,699
so it should be retrievable, right?

363
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,249
Well, yeah, if I had
an electron microscope

364
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,523
and two weeks, maybe.

365
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:49,037
I think we found something
in the hard copies of the server logs.

366
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:50,038
Check line 522.

367
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,648
Looks like an authorization tag.

368
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:52,598
That's what I thought.

369
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,716
Well, this tag has an "A.B." Prefix.

370
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,647
But that means
whoever authorized the deletion

371
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,648
of Sydney's transmission
had Alpha Black clearance.

372
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,158
What's alpha black clearance?

373
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,688
Alpha Black is the highest
clearance level within the C.I.A.

374
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,718
If Prophet Five has ties to the C.I.A.'s
upper echelons,

375
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:14,979
that would give them unlimited access
to all classified operations,

376
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,599
undercover agent rosters,
our entire infrastructure.

377
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,593
The good news is

378
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:21,728
that if whoever deleted Sydney's message
had Alpha Black clearance,

379
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:25,248
well, that narrows our list of suspects
down to just a handful of guys.

380
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,506
Only seven people
in the entire agency have it,

381
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,330
all of them division directors.

382
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:30,759
Aside from that,

383
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,015
the only other thing
that these guys have in common--

384
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,314
they were all assigned
a modified version

385
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:36,608
of the standard S.T.U.,

386
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,570
- A secure cell phone.
- What are you thinking?

387
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,959
Well, each cell phone
broadcasts a unique device I.D.

388
00:24:40,994 --> 00:24:42,473
Now it took some digging,

389
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:45,080
but I was able to match
the Alpha Black authorization

390
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,129
code from the server
logs to the cell phone I.D.

391
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,230
Of the person in question.

392
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,284
So does that mean
we know who it belongs to?

393
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,353
Not exactly.
I mean, for security purposes,

394
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:53,891
Langley doesn't put names to numbers,

395
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,099
but if you can get within just 50 feet
of that person's cell phone,

396
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,197
I might be able to scan it
and see if it matches.

397
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:00,309
We'd have our guy.

398
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,499
We could divide into teams,

399
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,108
put all 7 of them
under surveillance.

400
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:05,259
That could take days.

401
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,907
Whatever Prophet Five
has planned for Sydney,

402
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,150
we can assume we don't have much time.

403
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:11,861
I have an idea.

404
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,679
- Gentlemen.
- Jack!

405
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,434
It's been a long time.

406
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,240
How's life underground treating you?

407
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,305
Good,

408
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:54,008
always full of surprises.

409
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:56,262
I can imagine.

410
00:25:56,412 --> 00:25:57,633
Can't say I miss it.

411
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:00,419
Scanner's hot.

412
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:02,579
Jack... we've got connection here.

413
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,868
So, Jack, you care to enlighten us
as to why

414
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,341
you called an operations meeting
at 8:00 on a Friday?

415
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:11,891
I didn't call you all here
for an operations meeting.

416
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:16,105
Given that all of you
have Alpha Black clearance,

417
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,856
most of you may already
be aware that A.P.O.

418
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:22,072
has been investigating an organization
known as Prophet Five.

419
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,308
What may, however, come as news to you

420
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:26,375
is we have reason to believe

421
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:30,997
that someone within our own agency
is in collusion with this organization.

422
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,194
Someone with Alpha Black clearance.

423
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:35,687
What have we got so far?

424
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,040
Four down, three to go.

425
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,557
Still nothing.

426
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,556
The reason I've gathered you all here,

427
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:44,145
if it isn't obvious by now,

428
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:48,629
only seven people in the entire agency
have this level of clearance,

429
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:51,605
and all of them are sitting
in this room.

430
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:53,084
Oh, come on!

431
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:54,423
Jack, this is absurd.

432
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:59,690
Are you suggesting that one of us
is working for a terrorist organization?

433
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:02,595
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

434
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:04,744
I got a match.

435
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,417
Jack, we've got a signal match.

436
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,317
One of you is working for Prophet Five,

437
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:10,561
and we have your number.

438
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:13,057
That's enough. This meeting's over.

439
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,178
Go.

440
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,084
Jack, what in the hell are you doing?

441
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,387
Tell me where Sydney is.

442
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,677
Do yourself a favor. Stand back.

443
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,102
I'm going to give you one chance.

444
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,976
- Where are they holding my daughter?
- What the hell...

445
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:41,242
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:42,294
Wrong answer.

447
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:45,161
Stop, for god's sakes, Jack!

448
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:51,590
I sealed the doors!

449
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,714
Where she is?

450
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,016
You're crazy!

451
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,966
Answer me!

452
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,691
"the Athena"...

453
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,423
cargo ship...

454
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,043
Where is the ship?

455
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:09,588
The north Atlantic...

456
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,355
Did you get that?

457
00:28:17,514 --> 00:28:18,504
We got it, Jack.

458
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:19,505
We're on it.

459
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,735
- What is that?
- Something to make you relax.

460
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:42,250
But...

461
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:55,947
Marshall, can you find the cargo ship
where Sydney's being held?

462
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:57,639
There are miles and miles
of ocean here.

463
00:29:57,686 --> 00:30:00,115
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

464
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:02,276
What if you patched into the radarsat?

465
00:30:02,337 --> 00:30:04,160
Overlay it on the optical feed.

466
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:05,419
Right. That's genius!

467
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:10,058
Okay, it looks like
multiple radar returns.

468
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:11,095
No, ignore those.

469
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,300
It's a commercial shipping route,
heavily patrolled.

470
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,305
They wouldn't run the risk
of random inspection.

471
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:16,306
Right.

472
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,005
There, that one.

473
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,464
It's in international waters.

474
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:22,523
A ship that size wouldn't typically
be that far out.

475
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:23,565
Got it.

476
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:28,863
- Hello?
- We have a hit.

477
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:31,782
Marshall's uploading the coordinates
to your onboard G.P.S.

478
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:32,886
You're clear to go.

479
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:33,887
Understood.

480
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,711
All right, let's move out!

481
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,102
What else besides abdominal pains?

482
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,488
Dizziness. Her complexion was pale.

483
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,001
Any trouble breathing?

484
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,011
Yes.

485
00:30:58,757 --> 00:30:59,879
Hello, Sydney.

486
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,739
- You...
- I understand you've had some trouble.

487
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:06,364
Don't worry.
We're going to take care of it.

488
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,253
It's good you called me.

489
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:13,249
Let's take this off her.

490
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:14,998
You bitch.

491
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:18,692
What did you do to me?

492
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:21,846
My job as your doctor,
Sydney, nothing more.

493
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,457
I understand this must be hard
to accept,

494
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:27,752
but it would be much better
if you could just relax now.

495
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,089
Sydney I'm going to need you
to hold very still.

496
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:45,788
I have to draw a sample
of amniotic fluid.

497
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,285
You can go to hell.

498
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,613
Please, I need you to listen.

499
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,483
This is a delicate procedure.

500
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:54,922
Any sudden movements could risk
the health of your baby.

501
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:56,831
Please don't.

502
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:58,917
This might pinch a little.

503
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:27,738
Prep the room.

504
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:29,584
We need to start right away.

505
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,326
Sierra one, what's your status?

506
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,296
We're en route and closing!

507
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,794
E.T.A. 2300.

508
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,961
You're sure she gave us
the wrong information?

509
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,962
What if you...

510
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,868
no, I'm not doubting you.

511
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:49,163
I-I just don't see how that's possible.

512
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:51,995
What do you mean? How far out?

513
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:56,077
I'm not sure that gives us
enough time for what...

514
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:58,038
Of course.

515
00:32:58,538 --> 00:32:59,538
Yes.

516
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,281
I'll let you know as soon as it's done.

517
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:10,300
Our timetable's changed.

518
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:11,861
You're going to need to work quickly.

519
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,022
- We're just about to start.
- How long?

520
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,190
About an hour.

521
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:17,509
We've got about 40 minutes.

522
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,884
Let me know the second you're finished.

523
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Please...

524
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,451
Just relax.

525
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:27,415
I'm going to take care of you.

526
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,356
I don't like this. Where are they?

527
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,205
They've probably taken
a defensive position below deck.

528
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,656
We'll split into teams.

529
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,692
You start clearing from the aft forward.

530
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,156
We'll come around the other side.

531
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:12,044
- Outflank them.
- Let's go!

532
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,450
Where is everybody?

533
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:43,734
It's all clear.

534
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,235
Bravo, we're all clear here.

535
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,299
They must have known we were coming.
The ship's been abandoned.

536
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,323
Not entirely.

537
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,343
What do you mean?

538
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:29,021
Come down to the infirmary.

539
00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:44,803
Syd, are you all right?

540
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:45,804
I can't move.

541
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:49,056
Get the helicopter ready. We'll need
to medevac her out of here.

542
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,526
Dixon, is the baby okay?

543
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,751
It's going to be okay, Syd.

544
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,119
<i>I'm sure you're quite pleased
with Sydney's return.</i>

545
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:37,563
<i>You, however,
made a grave error, Mr. Sloane.</i>

546
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:39,192
<i>You should have contacted us</i>

547
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:41,765
<i>the second your agency
identified our ship.</i>

548
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,766
If you recall, I tried contacting you
earlier regarding this matter.

549
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:48,593
- I was told...
- Don't play games with me.

550
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,802
<i>I am aware of your fondness
for power,</i>

551
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:52,201
<i>so I imagine this arrangement</i>

552
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,025
<i>is less than desirable for you.</i>

553
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:56,438
<i>If you value your own
daughter's life,</i>

554
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:59,863
<i>from this point on,
you are not to take a single action</i>

555
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:01,711
<i>without clearing it
with us first.</i>

556
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:04,491
<i>As far as you're concerned,
we own you.</i>

557
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,675
<i>Is that clear enough?</i>

558
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,923
Yeah, yes, that is perfectly clear.

559
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:12,989
<i>You may consider this a victory
right now,</i>

560
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,997
<i>but you should understand
every action has consequences.</i>

561
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:19,825
We'll be in touch soon.

562
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,666
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

563
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:32,890
You know that decryption program
I wrote?

564
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:35,773
Somebody accessed it
when I was out of my office.

565
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:37,770
We should tell Jack about the breach.

566
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,013
With all that happened...

567
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:41,111
I was able to recover the data
that was decrypted.

568
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:42,413
When you were in Langley,

569
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:44,355
tom accessed the witsec archives.

570
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:48,307
- Amanda Grace.
- Yeah.

571
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,030
Did you know he was married?

572
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,134
No.

573
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:56,442
This is the guy that did it.

574
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:57,525
Yeah,

575
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:00,290
I think that's who tom was looking for.

576
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,227
Hallo, Karl.

577
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,754
<i>Dr. Meither to C.C.U.</i>

578
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,583
<i>Dr. Meither to C.C.U.</i>

579
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,790
Sweetheart...

580
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,590
I'm sorry it took me so long.

581
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:30,238
They just keep running tests,
but nobody's...

582
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,340
they won't tell me...

583
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:33,402
I know. They wanted to be sure.

584
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:36,952
And?

585
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,690
It's okay.
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

586
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,480
It seems there was a crisis
with your pregnancy

587
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:53,128
while you were on that ship.

588
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,241
Sydney, the baby's fine.

589
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,190
It's fine.

590
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,986
What they did to you on the boat,

591
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,628
you were suffering from something
called placental abruption.

592
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,338
They corrected the problem.

593
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,164
They weren't harming the baby.

594
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,639
They were saving its life.

595
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Why?

596
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,276
Why would they do that?

597
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,728
We're not sure.
We don't know what it means,

598
00:40:23,784 --> 00:40:26,611
but I promise you,
we'll get to the bottom of it.

599
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,555
Oh, Sydney.

600
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,442
While I was on the ship, they...

601
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,315
they tried to extract information,

602
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:43,433
but I lied to them.

603
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:45,492
Not here.

604
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,691
Mr. Bristow, I'm sorry, sir.
That's time.

605
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,905
It's nothing.

606
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:58,395
It's just a small matter
I need to tend to.
