00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:29,912
Mr. Sloane,

2
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,042
welcome to Mount Inferno monastery of the vespertine order.

3
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:34,794
Thank you.

4
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,833
You will forgive us our cautions.

5
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,292
Of course.

6
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:44,016
Hunting season?

7
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,889
Come. Father Kampinski is waiting.

8
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:04,596
- Mr. Sloane.
- Father Kampinski.

9
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,135
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

10
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,918
What can I do for you, Mr. Sloane?

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,500
Our institute is mandated to develop measures to counter terrorism.

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,930
We have, of course, heard about the work you've done here,

13
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,920
and, you know, wanted to perhaps --

14
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:25,495
Our bees are not for sale.

15
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,201
Well, of course they're not.

16
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,814
What we wanted was your... knowledge,

17
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,323
not your insects, per se.

18
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,980
I understand you've bred the aggression out of them.

19
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,877
This is not strictly true.

20
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,201
The aggression is there.

21
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:43,574
The need for it, happily, is not.

22
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:46,522
Come, Mr. Sloane. I'll show you.

23
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,742
The truth is, these bees have an exceptionally venomous sting.

24
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,164
They're very hard to antagonize.

25
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,559
They choose productivity over aggression. Aggression is a distraction,

26
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:59,936
which is why we're able to work among the apiaries

27
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,838
without the traditional protective garments.

28
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:03,830
Remarkable.

29
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:07,686
There is so very much we can learn from these exquisite beings.

30
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,459
Fascinating.

31
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,311
They're imbued with a kind of grace --

32
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,491
unlike so many humans.

33
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:18,341
And you've achieved that grace? How?

34
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,952
At Monte Inferno,

35
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,134
we're dedicated to the --

36
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,463
the marriage of supposed opposites,

37
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,695
amongst them man and his science, God and his miracles

38
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:29,835
coming together for the profit of all.

39
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:31,159
Just think about it.

40
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,243
The right blend of genetic engineering,

41
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,747
dietetic supplements, behavior modification, and --

42
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,409
You could create a new species.

43
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,928
Oh, no. No, my son. Merely a better bee.

44
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,156
One closer to God's grand design.

45
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:49,749
We even have the ability to control their body temperatures,

46
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:52,795
makes the bees work harder, longer, more in synch --

47
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,793
all for the common good.

48
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,890
Extraordinary. Paphiopedilum khan.

49
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:05,512
The rarest of lady slipper orchid species, generally thought to be extinct.

50
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,971
Not exactly. A close cousin.

51
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:12,069
No. This is the genuine article.

52
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:17,922
Brought here to Italy from China by Marco Polo in 1269,

53
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,193
a gift from Kubla Khan.

54
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,614
And what do you want?

55
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:22,938
If I might,

56
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,952
I'd like to spend a little time here,

57
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,758
examine your historical papers,

58
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,704
take a cutting of your orchid.

59
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,746
A cutting? Ha ha ha.

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,655
For $50 million deposited immediately to your accounts in Vanuatu and Samoa.

61
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,239
Yes, it's true, I have a little put away for a rainy day.

62
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,562
The fact is, I'm uninterested in money.

63
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,824
I'm a man of God, not a merchant.

64
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,496
In my experience, father,

65
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:59,826
the two are hard mutually exclusive.

66
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,648
I'm so sorry you came all this way for nothing.

67
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:04,491
No.

68
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,691
I'm the one who's sorry.

69
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:10,954
I'm coming home.

70
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,397
Plan "B."

71
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,685
Please... help me.

72
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,674
Certainly.

73
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,748
Anti-venom.

74
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,602
Enough to give you a shot at actually surviving.

75
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,968
But first -- the Rambaldi orchid formulas

76
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,655
which you used on your bees.

77
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:41,091
You go to hell.

78
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:42,975
You first.

79
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,309
Now keep both arms up like this.

80
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:51,784
Yes, I know, I know. You tell me every day, thank you.

81
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,738
They treat you like an idiot.

82
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:59,880
Keep 'em up, dad. It's for your own good.

83
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:03,843
Dr. Liddell said you have to follow procedure to the letter if you want to make a full recovery.

84
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,817
I never thanked you for what you did --

85
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,658
helping to find Liddell.

86
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,197
You don't have to.

87
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,015
That other charade --

88
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,046
you pretending to be your mother -- whose idea was that?

89
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,050
Sloane's.

90
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:28,007
You were living in 1981. You were delusional.

91
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:31,550
It was the only way we could get you to reveal Liddell's whereabouts.

92
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,438
You told her, dad.

93
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,699
You told mom you were a CIA agent.

94
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,261
You broke protocol.

95
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,593
That's how she stole agency secrets.

96
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,431
I'm putting these down now.

97
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,050
You also said you were thinking about resigning from the CIA.

98
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,528
You would have, right, dad, if she hadn't left?

99
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,306
I didn't like being away all the time...

100
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:08,375
not  being a part of your life.

101
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,270
You're part of it now.

102
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,718
They're ready for the briefing.

103
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,138
Thank you. We're coming.

104
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:25,126
Yesterday a rare orchid was stolen

105
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,656
from the Monte Inferno monastery in Umbria.

106
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,973
45 monks were killed to obtain it.

107
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:33,633
Satellite photos confirm it's the same man we encountered in Santiago,

108
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,650
the man who claims to be me.

109
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,156
Details are in your briefing folders.

110
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,682
What's  so special about this orchid?

111
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:44,433
It has chemical properties which heighten the receptivity in the neural pathways...

112
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:47,289
we think -- we assume. Well, we don't know, really.

113
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,241
It's just that nobody in the scientific community has laid eyes on it for centuries.

114
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:53,324
We have been asked to recover it.

115
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,317
Find the impostor. Get the orchid.

116
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:59,122
I want a plan on my desk by 2200.

117
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,466
That's it.

118
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:02,680
Arvin...

119
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,699
a word.

120
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:06,811
Of course.

121
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,878
You said it was harmless, this could never happen.

122
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,349
I didn't know it could.

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,581
I never imagined the effects of the orchid could be reversed.

124
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,432
No. But somebody did.

125
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,163
Let's not overreact, Jack.

126
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:21,778
What we saw -- the effect of the Mueller device --

127
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,863
was a demonstration on insects, not on humans.

128
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:27,286
We are staring at the potential for global disaster,

129
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:30,327
in no small part because of what you've put in place.

130
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,373
Don't you think I realize the responsibility I bear?

131
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,113
We need to find the orchid, Jack,

132
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:40,447
not waste time arguing over what we can't change.

133
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,031
72 hours.

134
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,495
If we haven't recovered the orchid in that time,

135
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,294
I'm going to Langley with this.

136
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,310
It'll mean the end of you, Arvin.

137
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,636
You too, jack.

138
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,852
I know.

139
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,143
72 hours.

140
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,279
The italian police dead-ended on both vehicles.

141
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,062
Satellite surveillance was a bust.

142
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:40,502
Echelon's bone-dry.

143
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:43,427
Apparently our Sloane Clone has vanished into the ether.

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,990
- Then we're back to square one.
- Not exactly.

145
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,740
If we can't find him, we'll make him find us.

146
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,440
The vespertine papers --

147
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,334
Rambaldi text that refer to our stolen orchid.

148
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:54,991
Rumor is they were destroyed during World War II.

149
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:56,412
You want to bring them out of hiding?

150
00:09:56,504 --> 00:10:00,507
Leak dummy intel that they were found in father Kampinski's personal belongings.

151
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,692
We can get the DSR to loan us some documents.

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,169
Set it up as an auction.

153
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:07,062
I have a contact at the Paris antiquities house.

154
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,338
Smile and look like a lot of money.

155
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,765
- Dollars or Euros?
- Euros, definitely.

156
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:27,905
Mark Mullins from the Carolina institute.

157
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,322
Ah, yes.

158
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,016
Thank you.

159
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:37,921
Evergreen, you are on the air.

160
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,622
Uplinking to A.P.O.

161
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,804
I'd love to be there.

162
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:43,083
It's too risky. The impostor's seen you before.

163
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,140
- I know. Just --
- Nadia will do fine.

164
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,308
Let's hope so.

165
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:50,816
Sold, for 5 million euros to the man in the gray flannel suit.

166
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:55,878
Our next item -- lot 47 -- is a last-minute addition.

167
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,105
The vespertine papers.

168
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,036
All interested bidders should take a few moments to examine the documents.

169
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,751
Look, but, please, do not touch.

170
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,901
Let's see who takes the bait.

171
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:19,360
Identity?

172
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,305
Toshiro Takenada. Wealthy Rambaldi collector from Kyoto.

173
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:34,674
Efraim Dousseau Ngumbe. Dilettante, far more money than vision.

174
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:36,962
Remarkable.

175
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,473
I've never seen her before.

176
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,866
Evergreen, get a look at her name tag.

177
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,559
Pamela McNabb, Stanwyck institute.

178
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,979
- Yowza.
- Easy.

179
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,164
What? We can't appreciate beautiful things?

180
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,953
No, you're right. Watch tv, can't touch the knobs.

181
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,108
It's a dummy corp. McNabb's a phoney.

182
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:02,621
We will start the bidding at 2 million euros.

183
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,702
I have 2 million. Do I hear 2.5?

184
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,508
2.5. Do I have 3 million?

185
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,348
4 million?

186
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:13,660
6 million?

187
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,203
9 million?

188
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:17,783
10 million?

189
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:20,255
- The girl stopped bidding.
- Something went wrong.

190
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,496
- Merlin, McNabb's cell phone.
- I'm all over it.

191
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,854
Scanning to get a GSM source.

192
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,928
Her conversation's encrypted.

193
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,616
11.5?

194
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,315
McNabb's on the move.

195
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,069
- Stop the woman.
- Copy that.

196
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,373
12 million?

197
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,046
Suppose she's not working for your impostor.

198
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,266
- No, it's her.
- Then why's she leaving?

199
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,494
I would only stop bidding

200
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:45,065
if  I was certain that I could recover the papers through some other means.

201
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,126
13 million?

202
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:53,648
She's a decoy. Outrigger, check the papers.

203
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:54,573
Copy that.

204
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:13,671
Evergreen, forget about her. The papers are gone. Out the back.

205
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,163
Marcus. What a surprise.

206
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:52,526
We got him.

207
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:56,226
Good work. Bring him home.

208
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,401
We'll make him tell us where the orchid is.

209
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,711
Jack.

210
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,831
Of course. I should have known.

211
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:35,518
You know me?

212
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,547
What kind of question is that? Of course I know you.

213
00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:39,709
And me?

214
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:42,339
- What about you?
- Do you know me?

215
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:44,443
No.

216
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,138
I am Arvin Sloane.

217
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,548
I see.

218
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,640
This is your idea, Jack -- play with my sense of reality.

219
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,398
I don't know what you're talking about.

220
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,137
I've never met you.

221
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,354
It's not going to work.

222
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,815
Okay.

223
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,866
Shall we state this for the record?

224
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,806
I am Arvin Sloane.

225
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,176
Posing as Arvin Sloane,

226
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,828
you recently stole a rare orchid from the Monte Inferno monastery.

227
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,248
Your masquerade is over. You've been caught.

228
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,767
What happens next? You deprive me of food?

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,045
Try to alter my sense of time?

230
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,639
Childish attempts to break me down.

231
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,447
You, Jack, of all people, should know that.

232
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:34,963
Who are you?

233
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,307
Who am I?

234
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,452
1985.

235
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:40,989
Belize.

236
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:47,320
For 72 hours, we were stuck in a safe house questioning a revolutionary.

237
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,689
And after you cut off --

238
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:52,236
how many fingers was it? --

239
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,551
Eight...

240
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,391
He told us what we wanted.

241
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,224
Only you and I know that.

242
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:03,357
You left it off the after-action report.

243
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,690
How desperate the company must be to play this pitiable mind game.

244
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,990
Think you could call this... actor,

245
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,585
this -- this clown Arvin Sloane and make me doubt my own identity?

246
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:17,411
Tell me, how do you account for the fact that in the recent past, this man

247
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:21,392
created and ran an international relief agency called OMNIFAM?

248
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:24,819
The world knows his face as Arvin Sloane.

249
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:30,896
He's a CIA stooge with my good looks, and I can prove it.

250
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,577
The affair in Santiago --

251
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,843
I noticed that both Marcus Dixon and Sydney Bristow were in on that mission.

252
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:40,142
It beggars reason to believe that these same two agents

253
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:46,291
would ever agree to work for the man who killed their loved ones.

254
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,993
What's the most logical scenario?

255
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:51,628
That I'm the impostor...

256
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,602
or that you are?

257
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,291
This is weird.

258
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,283
Unless you have something better to offer,

259
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:08,236
either start cutting off my fingers, or kindly call my lawyer.

260
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,699
Marshall would like to see you.

261
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
- Tell him I say hello.
- Try not to kill him.

262
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,387
What have we got?

263
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,344
Oh, hey, uh, I think you should see for yourself.

264
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:24,682
What am I looking at?

265
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:29,189
Well, these are the impostor's EEG readings, his brain activity.

266
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,707
Basically every individual has a unique brain pattern,

267
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:34,800
a signature, and -- take a look at this other one.

268
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,374
- They're identical.
- Exactly.

269
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,464
- Whose EEG is this?
- Well, that's the weird part.

270
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,342
I pulled these from the CIA's database.

271
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:45,830
This is Arvin Sloane. The real Sloane. Our Sloane.

272
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,094
You're telling me these two men share identical brains?

273
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,424
For all intents and purposes, well, yes.

274
00:17:50,723 --> 00:17:53,031
I mean, this man is Arvin Sloane.

275
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:55,663
- At least his brain is.
- How is that possible?

276
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,522
Back at SD-6, I worked on a project

277
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,026
that focused on brain imprinting -- engram encoding.

278
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:03,637
That program was run out of psy-ops by McCullough.

279
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:05,518
Who's McCullough?

280
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:09,384
Calvin McCullough, senior partner at SD-6.

281
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:12,655
He headed the psychological warfare and operations division.

282
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,777
Among the numerous programs he oversaw

283
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,151
was something called Project Brainstorm.

284
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:22,275
Its purpose -- to explore experimental technologies to aid in interrogation,

285
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,463
brainwashing, the creation of sleeper agents,

286
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,987
as well as the transfer of memories from one subject to another.

287
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,455
This is what we think happened to this man?

288
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,115
He was made to believe he's Sloane?

289
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,611
Not just believe, but to act.

290
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,202
Among other things, he shares the same desires,

291
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:39,531
which explains his pursuit of Rambaldi artifacts.

292
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:40,673
Well, if you think about it,

293
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:43,423
this guy's been able to stay two steps ahead of us the entire time.

294
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:47,998
He thinks like you, he knows your strategies, your playbooks, your secrets.

295
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,854
When we were in Santiago going after Sloane Clone the first time,

296
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:54,580
you knew the access code to his facility -- "Jacquelyn."

297
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,707
I had no reference for that. It just came to me.

298
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,480
Probably because it's buried deep inside your subconscious,

299
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:04,159
which also means it's buried inside his.

300
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:07,252
But  you said the were only experimental technologies at the time.

301
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:11,702
So someone must have continued McCullough's research after SD-6 was taken down.

302
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:14,586
McCullough was tipped off to the raid. He evaded capture.

303
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,895
- Who tipped him?
- I did.

304
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,052
I owed him a favor, one he clearly didn't return to me.

305
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,049
If McCullough is holding the strings, then we may have a lead on the orchid.

306
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,984
I have a good idea where he might be.

307
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,692
I'll put Dixon and Vaughn on McCullough.

308
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,013
In the meantime, we continue the interrogation here.

309
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,582
I see you're enjoying your retirement.

310
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,661
Don't mind if we join you, do you?

311
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,231
It's been a long time, Mr. Dixon.

312
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,197
To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?

313
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:05,093
Arvin Sloane sent us.

314
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,886
The real Arvin Sloane.

315
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:13,921
Tell us where the orchid is, and we might be able to cut you a deal.

316
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,453
I don't know where it is.

317
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,620
Listen to me. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life

318
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,879
in a federal prison, I suggest you start cooperating with us now.

319
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,974
And I am telling you I don't have the answers you're looking for.

320
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,591
We know you used Project Brainstorm technology

321
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:34,595
to make that man believe he's Arvin Sloane.

322
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,476
And I'm not denying that.

323
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,869
You had him acquire the orchid for you.

324
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,282
Where is it?

325
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,951
Yes.

326
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,389
I made him believe he's Sloane.

327
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,551
But I did too good a job.

328
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:52,019
He double-crossed me and kept the orchid for himself.

329
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:55,748
Just like Arvin would have done.

330
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,485
You're lying.

331
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,982
I'm beyond lying.

332
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,767
All that really matters now

333
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:07,927
is that my employer would never let me live long enough

334
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:12,101
to be interrogated, and that right now

335
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,921
I have 300 milligrams of cyanide coursing through my veins.

336
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,081
- The coffee!
- Get an ambulance.

337
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,235
Who are you working for?

338
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:26,357
Tell Arvin I --

339
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm so happy to see you, Sydney.

340
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,204
I have only one question to ask you.

341
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,935
Where's the orchid?

342
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:52,149
Four years is a long time not to see someone you love.

343
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,587
It appears you've done well.

344
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:59,149
Look, if you want to tell me where to find the orchid,

345
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,256
I'll be happy to continue this farce.

346
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,946
Otherwise...

347
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:04,889
Are you sure that's what you want, Sydney?

348
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:09,551
Think about it. There are so many things you could ask of me.

349
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,638
Why not choose one that matters?

350
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:14,696
Such as?

351
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:24,856
The reengineering of the evolution of the species.

352
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:27,644
You found an application for one of Rambaldi's formulas.

353
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:28,873
Mm-hmm. Finally.

354
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:33,474
I'm the first to admit that some of Rambaldi's quests occasionally

355
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:37,836
degenerated into sheer foly, but not this one.

356
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,169
Go on.

357
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:44,433
The work we did -- the work you do now --

358
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:47,382
taking down bad guys, putting out fires --

359
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,209
you're a beat cop. Not making a dent.

360
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:54,114
You've got to go to the source -- human nature itself.

361
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,173
Where we are headed.

362
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:58,789
What will become of human beings.

363
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,330
You want to change the world?

364
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:06,577
You want to really deal in the vanquishing of evil

365
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,747
and the ascendency of good?

366
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,549
Well, I'm your guy.

367
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,444
You're telling me you're one of the good guys?

368
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,584
Come work with me.

369
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:17,114
This work -- would it involve genetics and bioengineering?

370
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,045
In part.

371
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,941
A vulgarian would use the word "mutate,"

372
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,128
but it has such negative connotations.

373
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,834
Mutate into what?

374
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:29,142
Ostensibly into a more evolved, less aggressive being --

375
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:31,031
you know, cooperative, calmer.

376
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:33,956
Easier to control, like the bees at the monastery.

377
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,520
You turned them into killers.

378
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,799
The bees were a test.

379
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,746
I wanted to see if what goes down could come up, so to speak.

380
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,569
Oh, come on, Sydney.

381
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,572
How many wars were there last century?

382
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:48,184
And how many people died in those wars through genocide or political repression?

383
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,125
We're disgusting, humans.

384
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:57,752
Do we learn from grace or beauty or what we call God?

385
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,487
What were you gonna do about it?

386
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:05,121
Suppose one could administer a formula to the general population

387
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:10,410
that would quietly alter our brain chemistry,

388
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:16,479
exponentially expanding our capacity for qualities like empathy

389
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,944
and harmonic coexistence.

390
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:26,827
This formula -- how would you administer it?

391
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:30,669
Nothing could be more simple.

392
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:38,574
Do you have any idea how many additives are in our drinking water?

393
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:47,494
If I could undo what I did, I would.

394
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:52,409
The truth is, through OMNIFAM I introduced a combination of substances

395
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,324
into water supplies throughout the world.

396
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,978
It was my intent, based on Rambaldi's formulas,

397
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,687
to create a more peaceful species.

398
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,344
To breed the aggression out of the population

399
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:06,407
just as the monks had done with their bees.

400
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,452
We don't have time for your rationalizations.

401
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:09,633
- No --
- Excuse me.

402
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,134
I'm assuming that you failed, right?

403
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:13,988
Yes, I failed.

404
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:16,971
Because I didn't have the orchid,

405
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:19,990
I attempted to artificially manufacture its nectar.

406
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,023
Because your impostor already has the orchid,

407
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:25,117
he doesn't need to acquire any of the other substances you mentioned.

408
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:29,105
All he has to do is put the nectar into the water you contaminated.

409
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,662
You loaded the gun.

410
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:32,678
That's right.

411
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,315
How many people are we talking about?

412
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:36,590
How many people drank the contaminated water?

413
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:39,054
Somewhere between 300 and 400 million.

414
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:40,900
What?

415
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:42,492
Assuming the impostor's organization

416
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:45,211
is already harvesting the chemical from inside that orchid,

417
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:48,772
I suggest we not waste time on accusations right now.

418
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:52,037
What are the options?

419
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:54,470
Dixon and Vaughn are uplinking all of McCullough's files.

420
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:56,463
There might be a lead in there.

421
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,553
Divide it up. See what you can find.

422
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:05,145
I'd like to talk to you.

423
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,599
I saw it on your face. You knew.

424
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,660
You knew what he did, and you ignored it.

425
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,212
- I want to know why.
- Sydney --

426
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,710
He's sick, dad. Can't you see that?

427
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,594
He was at the height of his obsession with Rambaldi,

428
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,080
but he abandoned his scheme.

429
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:21,441
You still trust him.

430
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:23,324
I trust that when he laid the seeds for this crisis,

431
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,573
he thought he was doing something good,

432
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,328
that he didn't see this as a trigger for global genocide.

433
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:30,710
So he's simply a delusional megalomaniac with benign intentions?

434
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,820
Sydney, what Sloane did cannot be undone.

435
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:34,955
To alert the public would be worse than useless.

436
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,344
It would create worldwide panic. We need that flower.

437
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,300
Which we could have recovered long ago and turned over to the DSR for safe keeping,

438
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:45,395
but we didn't, because you sat on what you knew,

439
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,329
which makes you as guilty as he is.

440
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,836
Yes, Marshall?

441
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,062
I think I found something.

442
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:54,073
Okay, from what I was able to get from McCullough's files,

443
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:57,002
SD-6 performed detailed brain scans on Sloane.

444
00:26:57,142 --> 00:27:00,592
McCullough then recreated Sloane's brain digitally

445
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:01,931
and then uploaded it to this guy.

446
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,251
I mean, those files -- they're ingrained deep.

447
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,478
Which leaves us very few options.

448
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:09,028
He'll never give us the location of the orchid

449
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:11,193
as long as he still believes that he's me.

450
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,448
That's right. We'll have to shock it out of him --

451
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,294
you know, split it off from his dual persona

452
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:17,985
and then get his real personality to tell us where the orchid is.

453
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:21,133
- Are we talking shock therapy?
- No, not in the traditional sense.

454
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:22,613
According to the research,

455
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,021
reliving a painful memory

456
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:27,146
or a tragic experience will literally shake his moorings,

457
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,688
but  has to be something really bad.

458
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,644
It can't be, you know, like, "I'm sorry --"

459
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,970
Hypnotic regression. Take him back to a point in the past and --

460
00:27:33,057 --> 00:27:35,961
your past -- and make him recall the memory.

461
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,000
Arvin Clone? He'll probably resist that.

462
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:42,549
You would have to relive a painful memory.

463
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:44,612
And then record it using McCullough's technology,

464
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:47,366
and then upload it to Sloane II.

465
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:49,820
You know, it's kind of like throwing a switch.

466
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:53,183
One second he's Arvin Clone, and then shazam, he's himself again.

467
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,447
What are the risks?

468
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,941
To the subject? I'm not sure. It'll either break him down or not.

469
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:58,897
What about to him?

470
00:27:59,055 --> 00:27:59,634
The thing is,

471
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:02,582
I'm gonna need a little bit more time to run some tests before I synthesize, so --

472
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,888
No.

473
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:06,353
We do it now.

474
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:07,792
Fine.

475
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,142
Where do we begin?

476
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,040
Jacquelyn.

477
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,591
Who's Jacquelyn?

478
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,931
- 30 years ago, I --
- No! Don't.

479
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:22,365
Sorry, sir. It's just --

480
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:25,722
it's better if you experience it in the moment. Don't verbalize.

481
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:29,039
Okay, now, this should help you feel nice and relaxed.

482
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,774
Once you're semi-conscious,

483
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,780
the electrodes will administer small pulses to put you into a hypnotic state.

484
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,586
I'm going to need some help accessing Jacquelyn.

485
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:41,212
Right. Mr. Bristow will speak to you through your ear bugs.

486
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:43,871
He'll administer certain verbal cues

487
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:46,363
which should bring your mind into the right place.

488
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,266
- I see.
- Okay. Good luck.

489
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:12,777
We are ready to record his experience. You're on.

490
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,066
Arvin, I'm going to count back from 10 to 1.

491
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,123
When I get to 1,

492
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:21,057
you'll be in a place where you can tell me about Jacquelyn.

493
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,595
10... 9... 8...

494
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,160
What was that?

495
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:27,960
He's fighting it.

496
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,865
He doesn't want to go back to Jacquelyn. Keep going.

497
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:33,060
7... 6...

498
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,774
5... 4...

499
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:40,048
3... 2... 1.

500
00:29:58,311 --> 00:30:01,229
I thought we could take the boat before it gets too cold.

501
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:06,312
Perhaps have lunch in Bellagio, hmm? What do you think?

502
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:08,037
I like just being here.

503
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,477
You can see the wind in the trees. Maybe you should go.

504
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:16,556
No, no.

505
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:19,582
No, we can sit here for as long as you like.

506
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:21,821
For as long as you need.

507
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:29,155
And I promise you we will get past Jacquelyn.

508
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,671
I don't want to hear that name. You can't say it, Arvin.

509
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,916
It hurts too much.

510
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:44,639
Will you promise me that? You won't speak her name again?

511
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,089
Never say... her name.

512
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,422
Let me in, Emily, please.

513
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,833
I'm alone in this, Arvin.

514
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,136
Right now I am alone.

515
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:01,135
No.

516
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:05,420
Jacquelyn.

517
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:08,127
Jacquelyn. Could she have been a mistress?

518
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:13,482
Please.

519
00:31:14,732 --> 00:31:16,414
Wait a minute. Look at this.

520
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:17,821
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

521
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:21,288
Arvin, we're not quite there yet. You need to go back.

522
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:26,404
Who is Jacquelyn, Arvin? Go back to when you met her.

523
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,340
You're supposed to be doing exactly nothing.

524
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,837
And that means not gardening.

525
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,149
It's the nesting instinct. I can't help it.

526
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:54,998
Emily...

527
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,100
please.

528
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,931
Please, no more funny names of italian villages.

529
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:05,161
We can't have a daughter named Carlotta, Tabanabia,

530
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,023
or Fabina.

531
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:09,236
Fabina. That name is perfect.

532
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:13,752
How about Jacquelyn? Hmm?

533
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,004
Jacquelyn.

534
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:21,507
Yeah.

535
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:24,190
Do you like it? Ha ha ha.

536
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,950
Baby Jacquelyn.

537
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,804
Jacquelyn. I like that.

538
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:31,642
Baby Jacquelyn.

539
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:34,358
Dad, did you have any idea?

540
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,104
Sloane's numbers are wild.

541
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,656
His beta brainwaves are cycling at 14 per second,

542
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:41,138
and he's releasing massive amounts of glycine onto the motoneurons.

543
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:42,465
We have to bring him out.

544
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:44,267
Do we have enough? Enough to confront the impostor?

545
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,171
No, not yet.

546
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,242
Arvin...

547
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:49,203
keep going.

548
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:50,636
What happened to Jacquelyn?

549
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,154
How is she?

550
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:03,674
No.

551
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:09,073
No, no... no, please, Arvin.

552
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:11,413
It's a mistake. Please, no.

553
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,459
No, no, Arvin, please.

554
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,855
Listen to me. This was a risky pregnancy.

555
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,590
And she fought.

556
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,977
She tried so hard to stay with us.

557
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,152
It was too much. Her heart couldn't --

558
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:27,535
No, no...

559
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:30,791
My baby!

560
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:41,429
Emily...

561
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:55,221
Oh, my baby...

562
00:33:58,678 --> 00:33:59,624
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:01,412
I'm so sorry.

564
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:08,210
No.

565
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,066
Guys... that's it.

566
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,802
We have enough to break down the impostor.

567
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:18,115
Come with me, Marshall. Bring Sloane out.

568
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:25,020
Jack, please, are you really wasting our time with this?

569
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,965
After all, it was you who taught me how to endure torture.

570
00:34:28,229 --> 00:34:30,250
It was your training that enabled me to get through

571
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,524
McKenas Cole and the needles of fire.

572
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,766
Listen to me, you pathetic freak.

573
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,569
Even if what you're saying was true,

574
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,356
you can be sure that I kept a few things to myself.

575
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,281
Tell us your name.

576
00:35:06,907 --> 00:35:07,758
My name --

577
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:09,657
Ned Bolger.

578
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,828
Corporal.

579
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:13,607
U.S. Army.

580
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,790
Serial number 112762.

581
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,487
Where's the orchid?

582
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:23,983
Who are you?

583
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:26,220
Corporal, where's the flower?

584
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:31,680
At a warehouse.

585
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:33,531
Ugano, Switzerland.

586
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,984
43 Paseo Mantello.

587
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,563
Damn you, Jack!

588
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:42,679
I always knew you were a traitor, and you turn me in?

589
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,859
Sydney, please. Please don't let him do this.

590
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,522
I'm Ned Bolger.

591
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,168
I'm from Torch Lake, Michigan.

592
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:52,514
You can't torture POWs.

593
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:55,032
Geneva convention.

594
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:59,183
Who a-- who am --

595
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:01,862
Who am I? Who are you?

596
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,281
Who -- who are you?

597
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:06,591
There's a problem.

598
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,882
It's Sloane. He's not coming back.

599
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,274
I'm trying to bring himout of it, but he's fighting it.

600
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:12,856
I mean, he's supposed to be waking up.

601
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:29,741
Honey...

602
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:33,561
is everything okay?

603
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:37,608
Yeah.

604
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:40,237
Yeah.

605
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,465
Everything is wonderful.

606
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:47,006
Take a look right here.

607
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,436
You see that spike right there? That's his serotonin release.

608
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,805
You know, like a please center.

609
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:54,420
It mirrors the exact reaction he had at the time of Emily's pregnancy.

610
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,893
He's there right now. He's stuck there. He's kind of in that state.

611
00:36:58,071 --> 00:36:59,073
Can't we just wake him up?

612
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,122
You saw what happened to Bolger, and the shock could kill him.

613
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,037
Right. Think of it like in computer terms.

614
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,228
You can't just force-quit. We have to reboot his brain.

615
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:06,282
How?

616
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:07,626
Beats me.

617
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,376
What if one us tried to guide him back the way that Jack

618
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:13,576
was able to prompt some of my father's memories by talking to him?

619
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,791
Well, it could work.

620
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:17,138
But it also could kill him.

621
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,796
You know, serotonin overload.

622
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:21,246
I mean, he could die of happiness -- literally.

623
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,607
- You have a better idea?
- No.

624
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:25,366
Let's get started.

625
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:30,260
Okay, he can hear you now.

626
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:33,312
Hi, dad.

627
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,411
Keep going.

628
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:39,836
Dad, it's me. Nadia. Your daughter.

629
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:47,862
You know that nice lady in the little store in town, Angelina?

630
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,658
Uh-huh.

631
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:53,337
She told me that she didn't approve of the way I was dressing Jacquelyn.

632
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:54,462
Dad?

633
00:37:57,363 --> 00:38:00,073
- Who's that?
- She's a very lovely girl.

634
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,799
She's my...

635
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,056
she's my Nadia.

636
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,224
You can't stay here, dad. I'm sorry.

637
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:12,739
I'm happy here.

638
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:14,646
You may be, but your work isn't done.

639
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,144
What a beautiful girl you are.

640
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,197
How proud you make me.

641
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:26,494
But I can't come with you. The terrible things I've done.

642
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:28,556
That's why you have to.

643
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,568
Why don't you stay here with us?

644
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:36,732
Stay here with us. Nadia...

645
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:42,118
Stay with us, darling. We're family.

646
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,952
Emily and Jacquelyn are gone, and you have to let them go.

647
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:49,794
I will never let them go again.

648
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:50,881
No.

649
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:54,617
They're already gone.

650
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,082
What did you do?

651
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:06,469
I was a good man once.

652
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:08,782
Now I'm a monster.

653
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:13,014
And monsters cannot be allowed in this world.

654
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,295
Yes, you were once a good man.

655
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,775
I believe it.

656
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,619
And you can be again.

657
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:21,876
But you have to undo what you've set in motion.

658
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,763
You have not earned the right to rest.

659
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,375
I'm tired, Nadia.

660
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:28,301
I am tired,

661
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:31,270
and I am ashamed.

662
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,565
Then there's hope.

663
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,506
Come back and redeem yourself.

664
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,721
It's so beautiful here.

665
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,284
But it's not real.

666
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:49,849
Be brave. Come back with me.

667
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:53,168
Show me who you are deep down.

668
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,098
I believe in you.

669
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,299
Please, do not betray that belief.

670
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:02,031
Do not betray it again.

671
00:40:08,648 --> 00:40:09,569
Goodbye.

672
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:13,221
No. Don't go. Dad --

673
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,197
Uhh!

674
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:18,953
Dad.

675
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,135
The first time I heard the name Rambaldi,

676
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,667
I was working with the army corps of engineers.

677
00:40:50,642 --> 00:40:53,430
It meant nothing to me -- his life, his works.

678
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:56,377
It was simply a curiosity.

679
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,923
Something I quickly set aside.

680
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,328
And then when we lost Jacquelyn...

681
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:08,798
when Emily lost the baby...

682
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:12,275
I felt utterly abandoned.

683
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:17,451
One night I came across some of his writings that I had stored in a drawer.

684
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:20,887
And somehow...

685
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:25,734
it filled the hole in my heart.

686
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:30,321
Oddly, it wasn't until I saw him

687
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:34,935
that I realized how much of myself I had lost.

688
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:40,416
I am going to rectify this, Jack.

689
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:44,420
I will clean up this mess that I have made.

690
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,800
I'd like to believe that, Arvin.

691
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:47,849
But you can't.

692
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,521
I've heard it before.

693
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:51,141
Yeah.

694
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,675
Well, Jack, all I can say is I'm trying.

695
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,317
And every day it's a struggle.

696
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:05,257
Every day.
