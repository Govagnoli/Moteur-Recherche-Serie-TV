1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,652
I'm counting on you, Aleksander.

2
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,908
I'll call you when it's done.

3
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,173
Visa.

4
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,136
Hi.

5
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,042
You're looking at the work

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,837
of an emerging terrorist organization known as the Beograd Faction.

7
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,592
Yesterday at 5:00 they hit the indonesian embassy in Copenhagen.

8
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,553
It was their fourth major attack within the last several months.

9
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,472
And their first overtly political act.

10
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,099
If that's in fact what it is. Just looking at their files,

11
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,060
they haven't claimed any ideology.

12
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,270
They've made no demands, no pronouncements.

13
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,480
Something doesn't add up.

14
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,899
Langley is desperate to acquire intel on this group.

15
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,528
To that end, they placed an undercover agent within the organization.

16
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,112
His name is Thomas Raimes.

17
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,782
He specializes in prolonged deep cover work.

18
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,283
He's been in place for the last few months

19
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,328
posing as a document expert in forging, counterfeiting.

20
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:46,250
Two weeks ago he warned Langley of a pending attack in Denmark.

21
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,001
And he never followed up with the details?

22
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,504
Agent Raimes has missed the last four meetings with his handler

23
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,089
and hasn't notified headquarters.

24
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,966
Which means he was either caught or killed.

25
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,884
In one of his last communications,

26
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,389
he was able to identify the leader of this group, a man named Milos Kradic.

27
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,934
Echelon intercepts suggest that Kradic has a meet set up

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,811
tomorrow at a location in Amsterdam.

29
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,146
Dixon, Vaughn, you'll run surveillance on that location.

30
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,314
If Kradic shows up,

31
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,400
neutralize him and take him into custody.

32
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,403
Sydney, coordinate with Jack when he gets in.

33
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,904
You'll run the operations from here.

34
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,033
Until then, find out what other motives they could have had

35
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,577
for hitting that embassy.

36
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,037
Okay, that's it. Thank you.

37
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,336
Hello?

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,462
Nadia.

39
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,550
Sophia? Is that you?

40
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,469
It's so good to hear your voice.

41
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:43,015
Yours too. I'm so surprised you're calling. It's been --

42
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,433
A long time, yes.

43
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,560
I am flying to Los Angeles.

44
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,061
I was hoping we might catch up.

45
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,440
I'd love to. Why don't I meet you at the airport?

46
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,027
That'll be wonderful.

47
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,738
I arrive in the morning.

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,406
Okay, I'll see you then.

49
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,454
So how long has it been since you've heard from Sophia?

50
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,580
Like 10 years.

51
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,290
Why has she cometo Los Angeles now?

52
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,125
I don't know. She didn't say.

53
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,336
Are you sure you're okay with this?

54
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,879
She can stay as long as she wants.

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,339
- You know that.
- Thanks.

56
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,425
Where else am I gonna hear embarrassing stories about you as a kid?

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,387
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

58
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,764
You don't seem very excited.

59
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,059
I know, but I am. It's just

60
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,853
last time I saw her, I was in jail.

61
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,231
I don't want to be a disappointment to her.

62
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,358
Who knows if she'll even recognize me?

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,821
Oceanic airlines, nonstop flight to Sydney is now ready for boarding at gate 17.

64
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,284
Oceanic airlines nonstop flight to Sydney is now ready...

65
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:45,452
Sophia.

66
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,373
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

67
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,583
What happened?

68
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,503
I didn't have anywhere to go.

69
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,844
It's so good to see you.

70
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:14,189
For the last few weeks, I had a feeling that I was being watched.

71
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:18,110
I kept seeing the same faces everywhere I went.

72
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,196
Then last night I came home early from work,

73
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,116
and they were in my house.

74
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,160
As soon as I walked in, they attacked me.

75
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,289
What did they want?

76
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,915
I don't know.

77
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,625
Did they take anything?

78
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,129
I honestly don't know.

79
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,215
When I regained consciousness,

80
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,638
the house was ransacked and they were gone.

81
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,724
I couldn't stay there.

82
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,894
I'm sorry I came here like this.

83
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,979
It's okay. You did the right thing.

84
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,772
We should let her get some sleep.

85
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,481
Yes.

86
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,861
I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.

87
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,656
You're family to Nadia, which means you're family to me.

88
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,659
I'll see to it that you're well taken care of.

89
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,661
You have nothing to worry about from now on.

90
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,079
Thank you.

91
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,801
That woman took care of Nadia when I couldn't.

92
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,220
I owe her.

93
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,971
As soon as I get back to the office,

94
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,057
I'll reach out to our connections in Portugal.

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,934
- Whatever I can do.
- - You need a ride?

96
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,394
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

97
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,021
I'll meet you there.

98
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,506
That should take the edge off.

99
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,843
It's less painful than the last few times.

100
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,427
Glad  to hear it.

101
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,556
I've increased the dosage of lipoic acid.

102
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,059
Sorry to say, you may experience some increased side effects.

103
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,186
It's not a cure, but, um,

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,188
should keep it at bay for a while.

105
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:23,902
I've been looking into studies from the institute of radiology in Prague

106
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,238
based on treatment protocols in Chernobyl --

107
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,407
It's apples and oranges, Jack.

108
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,120
We're not talking about alpha particles and beta particles, gamma or neutron rays.

109
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,665
The radiation you were exposed to when you walked into that reactor --

110
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,209
Well,  it's a different fruit altogether.

111
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,170
Then we'll keep looking.

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,715
20 years I've known you. You're not one iota less stubborn.

113
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,551
- How's Sydney?
- She's doing well.

114
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,555
I remember when she was just starting school.

115
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,517
Where do the years go?

116
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,314
Jack, I've watched countless people die.

117
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,651
Had to look into my patients' eyes when I tell them what they have is terminal.

118
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,196
And you know what?

119
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,781
That stuff about laughter being the best medicine?

120
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,450
It's a load of bunk.

121
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,911
I assume you have a point.

122
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,996
A clean conscience --

123
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,624
that's a treatment I can stand behind.

124
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,544
We both know how this is going to end.

125
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,588
We can filter your blood till the cows come home,

126
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,548
but there's no changing the outcome.

127
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,842
Clear your conscience, Jack.

128
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,555
That would take another lifetime at least.

129
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,475
I'm not suggesting you write your memoirs.

130
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,353
Although I'm sure they would make a hell of a read.

131
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,982
Start small. Talk to your daughter.

132
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,028
She's better off not knowing.

133
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,905
Jack, these secrets you're keeping --

134
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,783
they're not yours to keep.

135
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,005
We've been waiting over an hour. Think Kradic's gonna show?

136
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,591
I hope so.

137
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,220
You have history with the target?

138
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,432
I knew the undercover agent -- Raimes.

139
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,476
From Langley?

140
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,478
We were in the corps together.

141
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,021
Force recon.

142
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,024
Toughest guy in our platoon.

143
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,278
Didn't think the bullet was made that could take him down.

144
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,030
We don't know that he's dead. He could've been captured.

145
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,610
If Raimes were alive, he would have made contact.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
Okay, there's Kradic.

147
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,467
There's another guy there. Brown jacket. You see him?

148
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,764
That's Raimes.

149
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,267
Do you think he's gone rogue?

150
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,430
You've grown into a beautiful woman, you know.

151
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,058
So different from the girl I once knew.

152
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,603
You were so angry then.

153
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,775
I know it's hard to believe -- at least it is for me --

154
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,986
but I have a home now, a family.

155
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,950
I finally feel like I belong somewhere.

156
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,455
Your father's a good man. I can tell.

157
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,085
You should rest now.

158
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,629
I'll be by tonight to check on you.

159
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,465
Nadia, wait.

160
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,936
It's San Marcos, the orphanage's namesake.

161
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:32,025
My happiest times were there watching over you girls.

162
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,031
I want you to have it.

163
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,242
I can't.

164
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,326
Please.

165
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:48,625
It is my way of thanking you for taking care of me.

166
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,844
Whoa!

167
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,931
Oh, hey. I -- sorry, Mr. Sloane.

168
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,850
I was testing out a mod on a virtual imager, and,

169
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,144
well, you looked a little freaky.

170
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,812
There's a latent fingerprint in here.

171
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,607
I want to get everything you can on the person it belongs to.

172
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,192
I want it kept between us.

173
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,986
Yeah. Sure, no problem.

174
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,029
Thank you.

175
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,297
Dad, Dixon and Vaughn called in. They found Raimes. He's alive.

176
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,965
He's traveling with Kradic.

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,592
Have our team shadow Raimes.

178
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,511
The second he's alone, pull him aside for questioning.

179
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,305
I want to know why he hasn't contacted Langley.

180
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,723
I'll let them know.

181
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,143
Dad?

182
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,021
Let me know when Dixon and Vaughn have secured Raimes.

183
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,192
I'll keep you posted.

184
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,635
Got the target.

185
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,346
He just ordered a whiskey straight up.

186
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,848
Okay, go for it.

187
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,023
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

188
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:46,702
Cheers.

189
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,416
We're in Amsterdam. This is the best place we can find?

190
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,672
No. If I chose the meet, we'd be in a park or near a beautiful canal.

191
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,304
Where are you going?

192
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,763
Where are you going?

193
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,992
Last time I saw you like this was in a bar in Baghdad.

194
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,123
Marcus.

195
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,210
What are you doing here?

196
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,795
Langley assumed you were compromised. What's going on?

197
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,840
The embassy bombing.

198
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,676
You warned of an attack somewhere in Denmark two weeks ago,

199
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,719
then nothing.

200
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,222
Why  didn't you send a second warning that the bomb would go off?

201
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,806
You know what? I'll fill out a report later.

202
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,099
Right now I gotta get back out there,

203
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,809
because Kradic is meeting with an associate.

204
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,728
Then talk fast. Tom, we need answers.

205
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,855
- You don't understand.
- So explain it to us.

206
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,357
Why haven't you checked in with your handlers?

207
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,484
Kradic is paranoid. If I would have radioed in --

208
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,610
There are other ways.

209
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:02,903
I have to report in, Tom.

210
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,405
And right now, we're looking at two scenarios.

211
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,951
Either you blew your intel, or you've gone over. Which is it?

212
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,662
- You think I sold out?
- You tell us.

213
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,331
All right, I had the intel, okay?

214
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,376
But if I would have warned Langley, Kradic would have known we were on to him.

215
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,336
So you decided to let 15 people die?

216
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,879
I had my reasons.

217
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,422
We're listening.

218
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,220
Kradic is after a new weapon developed by the indonesians.

219
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,763
It's a water contaminant.

220
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,099
It can wipe out whole ecosystems.

221
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,809
Kradic has a line on it.

222
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,229
The embassy bombing was crucial to acquiring the weapon.

223
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,441
It was a handful of lives against a half a million.

224
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,819
That's not your call to make.

225
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,365
You weren't there.

226
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,201
Now, look, if I'm not back in a few minutes,

227
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,203
Kradic is gonna know something's wrong.

228
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,831
Yes, 15 people died,

229
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,041
but if we don't recover that weapon,

230
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,210
it'll be hundreds of thousands.

231
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,213
So, you gonna let me walk out that door, or what?

232
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,299
Your call, Marcus.

233
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,142
Indonesians developed a sample of hydrosec, but he didn't know where.

234
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,228
So he bombed the embassy as cover for the intel theft.

235
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,564
Emergency protocol dictates that if a bomb goes off,

236
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,193
all confidential intelligence is transferred to off-site servers.

237
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,153
The explosion triggered those protocols.

238
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,655
Kradic must have been prepared to intercept the outgoing data.

239
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,325
The location of the hydrosec must have been in those files.

240
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,367
He knows where it is,

241
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,287
and now he's putting together a team to steal it from the indonesians.

242
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,749
Indonesian officials deny their intelligence has been compromised.

243
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,917
What else could they say?

244
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,460
If they admit to developing hydrosec,

245
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,629
they'd be violating international weapons treaties.

246
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,172
We're talking in circles here.

247
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,384
The only option we've got is to make Kradic lead us to the weapon.

248
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,678
We could take him out before he gets a chance to use it.

249
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,972
Dixon, what's your tactical assessment?

250
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,975
Considering the situation,

251
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,187
I think our best bet is to keep agent Raimes in the field.

252
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,356
Agreed. You and Vaughn will shadow.

253
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,440
Copy that.

254
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,530
Go check on Raimes.

255
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,949
Make sure he's okay.

256
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,537
We'll outfit you for comms.

257
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,120
No dice.

258
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,540
Kradic has state-of-the-art countersurveillance detection.

259
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,208
If I show up there wired for sound,

260
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,751
I'll light up like a Christmas tree.

261
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,086
Then we'll modify the comms.

262
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,879
Spread-spectrum burst transmitters.

263
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,631
Should be beyond Kradic's capabilities.

264
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,174
It'll take us a few minutes to get them ready.

265
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,425
I'll brush past you with them.

266
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,261
Fine. I'll meet you at the bar in 10 minutes.

267
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,720
Wait.

268
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,973
This meet -- who is it?

269
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,016
A hacker. Linus Halsey. Why?

270
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,231
Does Kradic know this hacker face to face?

271
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,149
You're thinking of switching him out?

272
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,027
Well, you stand a better chance with another man on the inside.

273
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,364
Fine. But you better hurry. He'll be here in one hour.

274
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,454
Hey, what the hell? Where did you go?

275
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,415
Let me tell you something.

276
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,126
Shooting whiskey on an empty stomach -- not good.

277
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,961
What's the matter? Milos pushing you around again?

278
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:06,795
He's waiting.

279
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,505
You're like a little girl. Come on, let's go.

280
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,342
I'll start with Langley, see if they have an open file on Halsey.

281
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,468
If there's a current file photo,

282
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,054
we can run his faceprint through Interpol's biometric city scan.

283
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,140
Make it fast. We don't have much time.

284
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,477
Mr. Sloane, sir. Mr. --

285
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,856
Here's that background check that you asked me to run.

286
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:26,398
Yeah.

287
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,608
Sophia Vargas.

288
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,361
Yeah, you actually probably just want to skip to the last page.

289
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:44,750
Thank you, Marshall.

290
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:45,667
Sure.

291
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,719
I found the hacker, Linus Halsey.

292
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,515
He was an MIT graduate with a degree in nonlinear cryptoalgorithsms

293
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,892
and stochastic systems analysis.

294
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,562
Because if they called it "code-breaking," they couldn't charge 30 grand tuition.

295
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,275
Okay, I'm linked with Amsterdam's urban surveillance network.

296
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,445
I'm checking the database for hotel reservations.

297
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,405
Got him. Hotel ruisseau.

298
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,574
It's just a few blocks over from where they are.

299
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,251
Got eyes on Halsey.

300
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,379
Okay,  let me know when you've got him, and I'll head inside.

301
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,359
Shotgun, what's going on?

302
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,772
Dixon, coming your way.

303
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,126
I would have had him.

304
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,085
I know.

305
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,089
Hey.

306
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,134
Good work on hotel Ruisseau.

307
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:00,260
They caught Halsey.

308
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,221
Thanks. We aim to please.

309
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,472
You're in a good mood.

310
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,265
Yeah, I guess so.

311
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,309
So things went well with Sophia after we left?

312
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,645
Yeah. I've missed her so much.

313
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,896
It's been a long time.

314
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,898
I was so different back then.

315
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,358
You wouldn't have known me.

316
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,526
I bet I would have.

317
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,195
No. I was crazy, wild.

318
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,156
I don't know what Sophia saw in me.

319
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,825
She was always telling me I was her special one.

320
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:27,120
For years after I left the orphanage,

321
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,915
that was the only thing I could hang on to.

322
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,252
I knew someone, somewhere believed in me.

323
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,839
You were lucky to have a person like that in your life.

324
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:37,506
Yeah.

325
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:46,765
Why did you really come here? Tell me.

326
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,726
I don't know what you mean.

327
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,396
I know all about Jose Pedraza.

328
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,190
I know how the argentine police found his body.

329
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,276
I know they found a suspect's fingerprint.

330
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,529
But they couldn't find a match. I did.

331
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,197
He was hurting my girls,

332
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:05,909
and I was the one who hired him to tend the grounds.

333
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,163
I didn't realize.

334
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,168
- Did he hurt Nadia?
- He tried.

335
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,462
I didn't give him the second chance.

336
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,591
I know what I did was wrong,

337
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,760
but they were my children.

338
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:24,761
Yeah.

339
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,930
I would have done the same thing.

340
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,059
Still, that doesn't answer my question.

341
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:40,319
All I ever wanted was to protect Nadia.

342
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:44,198
When she was brought to me as a baby, she was in danger.

343
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:49,244
I changed her last name to Santos so nobody could find her.

344
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:54,208
The men who attacked me in Lisbon -- they weren't after me.

345
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,293
They were after Nadia.

346
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,963
They wanted to know what name I had given her.

347
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,715
And what did you tell them?

348
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:02,382
Nothing.

349
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,389
Why didn't you tell Nadia?

350
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,768
When I saw her

351
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,562
with her sister,

352
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:17,606
with you...

353
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,109
she deserves the happiness she's found here.

354
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:26,323
I couldn't bring back all that pain to her life.

355
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,033
Don't worry.

356
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,078
Now I can take care of her.

357
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,666
How can you be sure?

358
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,294
Because I know who's after my child.

359
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,595
You wanted to show me something?

360
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,014
Oh, yeah. Hey, Syd. Yeah, check this out.

361
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,642
Now this is one nanogram of hydrosec,

362
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,979
which is one billionth of a gram in a 500 milliliter beaker of water.

363
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:59,606
According to my simulation,

364
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,733
the toxin actually feeds off the water.

365
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,195
One gram of hydrosec, Lake Michigan turns into sludge.

366
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,239
It's incredible, really, you know...

367
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,784
you know, Dr. Evil sort of way.

368
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,121
What would it take to manufacture this stuff,

369
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,164
level 4 biohazard containment?

370
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,250
Yeah, and a massive cooling system,

371
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,835
which should narrow down the possible locations.

372
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,003
Give me a couple hours.

373
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,841
- What's this?
- Huh?

374
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:33,599
Uh... you know, it's just a copy of some research I'm doing for --

375
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:34,600
ahem -- Mr. Sloane.

376
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,102
It's not -- damn it.

377
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,106
What the hell are you thinking?

378
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,735
I'm sure you mean that in the most polite way.

379
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,905
Using CIA resources to check up on Sophia.

380
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,283
I was merely being cautious.

381
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,539
I don't understand this,

382
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,666
but Nadia believes in you.

383
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,921
Somehow you've earned her trust.

384
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:08,008
Every time you lie to her, you break that bond.

385
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,637
I want you to understand that

386
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,598
I'm not telling you this out of concern for you.

387
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,977
Only my sister.

388
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,957
Nobody reads the paper anymore.

389
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,923
There is too much tragedy in the world.

390
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,644
Clean.

391
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,523
Have a seat.

392
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:13,532
Your reputation proceeds you, Mr. Halsey.

393
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,325
You're too kind.

394
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,995
Temperamental. Arrogant.

395
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,788
Vindictive.

396
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,125
Violent. Vain.

397
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,294
Petty and deceitful.

398
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,713
You're forgetting talented...

399
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,381
brilliant...

400
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,134
and easy on the eye.

401
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,136
Ha. There is that.

402
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,680
You are supposed to be brilliant.

403
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,057
They say you're the best hacker in the E.U.

404
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,060
That's the rep.

405
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,314
But what went wrong on the Kroner job?

406
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,441
Kroner job -- what happened?

407
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:50,485
Petty? Who the hell's that son of a bitch to call me petty?

408
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,279
You know what? You can all go f-- Aah!

409
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,365
Nothing went wrong.

410
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,243
Then why does Kroner hate you so much, hmm?

411
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:02,289
I finished the job as agreed.

412
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,833
Perfectly, I may add.

413
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,001
Aah!

414
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,294
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

415
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,630
I'm not gonna let you hang my partner out to dry.

416
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,049
Uhh!

417
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,219
The son of a bitch shorted me 10 grand.

418
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,762
Kroner stiffed him 10,000 euros.

419
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,055
Then Kroner turned around,

420
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,307
forgot to pay me my 10,000 euros.

421
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,564
That doesn't explain why he hates you.

422
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,069
Now by my count, you still have three rings left.

423
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:34,279
That's on one ear. What happened?

424
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,657
After he stiffed me...

425
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,617
He hacked Kroner's credit card to buy hookers.

426
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,203
I hacked into his credit card account,

427
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:46,375
charged it exactly 10,000 euros to several young ladies in the red light district,

428
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,002
and then sent the bills to his wife.

429
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,422
Yes, I did.

430
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,935
We leave in an hour.

431
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,313
Aleksander, tell the team to meet us at Tuege airfield.

432
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,122
You wanted to see me?

433
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:27,666
I was thinking...

434
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,920
the embassy transmission that Kradic intercepted --

435
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,923
the network tap he installed

436
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,718
would have had to have been physically placed on the premises.

437
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,011
I don't follow.

438
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,513
It would be too risky to send someone to retrieve it afterwards,

439
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,558
so we can assume it stores the information.

440
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,436
Which means we might be able to access it remotely as well

441
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,272
and download the same intel Kradic got off it.

442
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,276
This is all assuming the indonesians haven't already located and removed the tap.

443
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,820
It's worth a shot. I'll get Marshall right on it.

444
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,279
Decades of research went into the development of this little marvel,

445
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,657
and you yank it out with a letter opener?

446
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:43,158
What are you talking about?

447
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,913
You don't have the faintest --

448
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,123
I implanted it

449
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:53,085
to regulate the medication in your bloodstream.

450
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,171
I explained the entire procedure to you.

451
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:57,339
You did?

452
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:58,674
I did.

453
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,137
I have no memory of this.

454
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,933
Well, we talked about the fact that memory loss could be a side effect.

455
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,978
I even implanted a second one in your calf.

456
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,402
You don't remember that, either, do you?

457
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,155
My position...

458
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:26,493
my job -- this side effect is unacceptable.

459
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,203
I can adjust the medication.

460
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,375
But your condition is progressing quicker than I had anticipated.

461
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:38,172
Jack, have you thought any more about what we discussed? About Sydney?

462
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,008
Sydney has had to face so many things in her life.

463
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,554
Too many for someone so young.

464
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,472
And now, given my condition,

465
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,267
I don't want to burden her. It's not fair.

466
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,852
Honesty --

467
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,562
that's fair.

468
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,315
You won't always be around to protect her, Jack.

469
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,361
She has to know the truth before it's too late.

470
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,956
You disagree with my decision?

471
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,918
The embassy?

472
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,087
I wasn't there.

473
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,549
I was boxed in. So I made a call.

474
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,429
Did some civilians die? Yes. Would I do it again?

475
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:29,973
Absolutely.

476
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,601
There are sacrifices we have to make.

477
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:36,396
There are casualties in the business that we're in.

478
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:38,815
You disappoint me, Marcus.

479
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,984
There was a time you understood that.

480
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:43,904
That was a long time ago.

481
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,199
Things are... different.

482
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,576
What happened, you get religion?

483
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,328
I had that.

484
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,873
No, I got married.

485
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,459
Had kids.

486
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,337
- Changes a man.
- Mm.

487
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,591
- You mean it softens.
- I mean it deepens,

488
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,510
gives a man perspective.

489
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,389
Maybe we need men who can make the hard call,

490
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,307
weigh the many against the few.

491
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:18,313
I just know that every time I think of those 15 people at the embassy,

492
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:21,441
it weighs on me.

493
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,494
How many kids you got?

494
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:37,708
A daughter, Robin, and a son, Steven.

495
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,085
And the lucky lady?

496
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,257
My wife was killed a few years ago.

497
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:51,346
What you would call a casualty of the business we're in.

498
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,588
Make sure the plane's ready to go.

499
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,094
Ooh, hope it's warm where we're going, 'cause this weather's killing me.

500
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,721
We are 15 minutes behind schedule.

501
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,681
We'll have to make it up in the air.

502
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,475
Vaughn just checked in.

503
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,685
Kradic's men just arrived at Tuege airfield.

504
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:42,147
Marshall was able to run a network probe at the indonesian embassy.

505
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,607
It turns out my father was right.

506
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:44,983
We've got a source on the hydrosec.

507
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,528
It's in a manufacturing plant in Peru.

508
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,697
Unfortunately, Kradic beat us to it. He must have had a team in place.

509
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:53,575
Four hours ago there was a fire in one of the research labs.

510
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,496
Our theory is that Kradic's men caused the accident to steal the hydrosec.

511
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,830
It fits their M.O.

512
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,750
Using disaster to achieve their operational objectives.

513
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,752
Well, the big question is, since they have it,

514
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,462
where do they plan to use it?

515
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,174
It's most likely that Kradic will set up a rendezvous with the heist team.

516
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:13,178
Our best course of action would still be to keep Dixon in play.

517
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,137
That's it.

518
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,311
Something else, Jack?

519
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,817
I know we agreed to keep this between ourselves,

520
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,694
but the time has arrived.

521
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:33,448
Personal considerations have been weighing on me, Arvin.

522
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,660
We need to tell them the truth.

523
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,708
Yes, I know. You're right.

524
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,008
I'm afraid that Nadia's already in danger.

525
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,098
Fully fueled and ready to take us over the border.

526
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,767
Get the gear. Let's move.

527
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,234
I'm in place. Do you read?

528
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,110
Go ahead.

529
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,116
Kradic has gathered a total of six team members,

530
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,367
and they're en routeto the plane.

531
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:18,869
And agent Dixon is still embedded?

532
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:19,494
Securely.

533
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:32,799
Hey!

534
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:36,470
What's going on?

535
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,432
Outrigger, I'm in position.

536
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,184
I have a better question.

537
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,520
Which one of you two

538
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,939
is agent Dixon?

539
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,776
What?

540
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,320
Milos, come on. Put the gun down. Take it easy.

541
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,448
Enough! Aleksander intercepted a transmission.

542
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:57,324
Transmission?

543
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,243
What are you talking about? You're just being paranoid.

544
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,994
I know one of you is an agent.

545
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,914
If I move any closer, I'll be made. Do you have a weapon?

546
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,375
Milos, come on. Let's see this thing through. Come on.

547
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,253
We are not doing anything till I find out the truth!

548
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,589
I sensed something was wrong about you.

549
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,174
No, no, no. You wrong!

550
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,094
You know my reputation. You checked out the Kroner job.

551
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,096
I should have trusted my instincts.

552
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,723
Now, see, this is insane. I'm not an agent!

553
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,308
Take it easy.

554
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,935
Who do you work for?

555
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,562
CIA? Mossad?

556
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:27,855
Man, what you talking about?

557
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,148
Milos, nobody here is an agent.

558
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:34,152
Okay. Then you leave me little choice, huh?

559
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,072
I'll have to kill both you.

560
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,032
Which one of you would like to die first?

561
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:42,327
Nobody's got to die. We're all on the same side here.

562
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,914
Everybody just needs to calm down. Lower your guns.

563
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,125
Okay.

564
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,094
Kill both of them.

565
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,021
Enough!

566
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,983
Outrigger, don't shoot Kradic! We need him to lead us to the hydrosec.

567
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,029
Let me finish this.

568
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:19,239
Get on your knees.

569
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,660
This is how you deal with traitors.

570
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,790
What you got to say now, agent Dixon?

571
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,890
So, Dixon, any last words?

572
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:49,186
Hey, casualty of the business I'm in.

573
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,315
He's giving us an out.

574
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,401
He's sacrificing himself to save the mission. Shoot him.

575
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,028
Do it!

576
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,455
We have business to do,

577
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,291
and we need to get out of here before this guy's backup shows.

578
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,501
You're welcome!

579
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:16,713
Let's go.

580
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:16,940
This is agent Vaughn, field code alpha-5-0-niner-charlie.

581
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:20,068
Request authorization for a code 4 medivac. We have an agent down.

582
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:25,657
Vaughn just reported in.

583
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,534
Agent Raimes is being medivacted to Deventer.

584
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,994
He's critical but stable.

585
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,663
They're saying the shot didn't hit any of his vital organs.

586
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,123
Dixon saved his life.

587
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,083
He just boarded the plane with Kradic and his team.

588
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,668
Here's the tail number of his flight.

589
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,254
All right, I'll put in a call to euro control, see if we can track it.

590
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,256
I think I might be able to triangulate

591
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,634
Dixon's signal using one of NSA's comm sats. Just --

592
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,011
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

593
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,057
What is this about?

594
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,141
Please, come in.

595
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,228
There's something we need to tell you,

596
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,771
something you have the right to know.

597
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,231
It concerns your mother's sister.

598
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,941
- Katya?
- Yelena.

599
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,903
She was one of the KGB's foremost assassins,

600
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:04,947
responsible for the murders of

601
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:08,617
countless diplomats and politicians throughout eastern europe.

602
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,119
In the course of her work,

603
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,915
she earned a reputation for being the cruelest of the Derevko women.

604
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,333
Why are you telling us this now?

605
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,877
Because almost 30 years ago, Yelena disappeared.

606
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:22,339
It was rumored that she had a falling out with Irina.

607
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,009
Yelena severed all ties with the KGB as well as her family.

608
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:30,556
Both the CIA and the KGB tried to find her, but to no avail.

609
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,182
Even Irina couldn't locate her.

610
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,267
But you found something?

611
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,144
I received a message from an old associate about a year ago that led me

612
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,856
to one of Yelena's safehouses in Warsaw.

613
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,607
Inside we found this.

614
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,030
It's me in college.

615
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,157
This is my old apartment in Argentina.

616
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,494
My grad school transcripts.

617
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,122
I was 9 here.

618
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:59,001
Given what's here, we can assume she's been surveilling you both

619
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,752
for at least a decade.

620
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:04,882
We can also assume that she's responsible for the attack on Sophia.

621
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,177
Why? What does she want from us?

622
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,094
We don't know.

623
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:12,973
We're doing everything we can to find out.

624
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,811
It's me.

625
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,272
The plane is in the air. Do we know where they're headed?

626
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:24,610
I'll contact you once I have their final destination.

627
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,028
I'll be waiting.

628
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,821
I won't let you down, Yelena.

629
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,160
Do you have any idea where Yelena is now?

630
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,954
At this point, she could be anywhere.

631
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:41,251
