1
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,564
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:10,736
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,406
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,952
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:23,040
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,335
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,588
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:34,927
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA,
where my handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,350
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,688
My father.

12
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:50,192
I don't want this job any more.
I want out.

13
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:52,611
You're helping bring an end to SD-6.

14
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,114
- Not any more.
- Sydney.

15
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,160
- You like hockey. The Kings?
- How'd you...?

16
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:03,622
They're playing the Islanders
next week. We should go.

17
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,958
You can't do this.

18
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,043
- It's suicide.
- I don't think it is.

19
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,421
What is your exit strategy here?

20
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:25,060
Cole.

21
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,070
Emergency lockdown procedures.

22
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:39,116
The elevator is returning to SD-6.
The doors will automatically open.

23
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,369
What do you want?

24
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:47,333
There's a certain little something
you got in the SD-6 vault.

25
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,002
Sloane's activated
the emergency fail-safe.

26
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:54,590
There are 500lbs of C4
within this building's substructure.

27
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:57,510
Opening the vault
will trigger that C4.

28
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,845
You want to scramble the vault codes.

29
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,635
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Just stay there.

30
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:43,180
- No, Dad, don't.
- Hold your fire! I'm coming through!

31
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,766
I'm coming out!

32
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,201
Are you OK?

33
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:08,205
Except for my head injury, yeah.

34
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:15,546
Mr Cool Customer here was caught
crawling around the vents.

35
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,298
Sit his butt down.

36
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,219
How long's it gonna take
to open the vault?

37
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,097
The sooner I get started,
the sooner I'll know.

38
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,896
I need, like,
awesome good news, baby.

39
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,314
I know.

40
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,735
Endo, Tchen,
I'll be in the conversation room.

41
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:58,255
Follow this map to the three
locations where the explosives are.

42
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,428
You must deactivate
all three C4 packages

43
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,514
before the vault door opens.

44
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,893
Good luck.

45
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,580
I can get to the PDA
and email Langley.

46
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:33,707
- That's not an option.
- Look.

47
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,960
We need plausible deniability here.

48
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,463
- The CIA cannot acknowledge SD-6.
- I know that.

49
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:43,467
But we can't afford to let these
people get whatever it is they want.

50
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,636
Do nothing.

51
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,098
The man running this group
claims to be former SD-6.

52
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:54,437
Sloane left him for dead in Chechnya.
He's interrogating Sloane now.

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,565
Maybe killing him. And we're next.

54
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,609
Sydney's in the ducts.

55
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,779
- What?
- The fail-safe's been activated.

56
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:07,741
If the vault's opened,
it'll detonate C4 charges

57
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:10,870
hidden throughout
the building's sub-level.

58
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:15,666
Sydney has a chance to disarm them,
but only if there are no surprises.

59
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,878
All the more reason
we need to call Langley.

60
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:24,133
Jack, under normal conditions,
you can pull rank.

61
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,678
These are not normal conditions.

62
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,023
Each set of charges
is located behind the steel plate

63
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:23,609
at the end of the corridors
marked on the map.

64
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:54,515
- Two numbers down. Ten to go.
- Copy that, baby.

65
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:01,439
Now, as bad as you feel right now,

66
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,774
with all that pain,

67
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,610
that is just
the pudding next to the pie.

68
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,823
It's so easy for you to blame me.

69
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,325
When you know the truth.

70
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,911
You got your own men killed.

71
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:19,248
- That helicopter waited for you.
- I had a man down.

72
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,959
I was saving Witney's life.
You knew that!

73
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,753
At the expense of all the other men.

74
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:28,299
Those men counted on you
to lead them to safety.

75
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,802
They trusted their life to you.

76
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,472
And you led them to slaughter.

77
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:18,140
- Why don't you go check it out?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,238
No.

79
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:35,801
Three of the security monitors
just lost picture.

80
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,805
- Then, check it out.
- Yes, sir

81
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,700
Ready for this? Langley's server just
received an incoming email from SD-6.

82
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:02,745
- From Jack?
- No, not Jack. Dixon.

83
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,705
Why is Dixon sending me email?

84
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:09,418
He's calling the CIA for help.
They forwarded this to you.

85
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,129
"I am Marcus Dixon. Agent of SD-6."

86
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:15,174
- "We are under attack. Help us."?
- What's going on?

87
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:17,426
- Vaughn.
- Not now!

88
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,179
- Sir, we have a situation.
- Mr Vaughn.

89
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:22,723
I really think
you should look at this.

90
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:25,643
You've had a bad day.
I hope this doesn't make it worse.

91
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:29,688
I know I've been suspended,
but this message was routed to me.

92
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:32,650
Sir, if you don't mind,
may I see that?

93
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,861
It is my province,
and Vaughn is off the Bristow case.

94
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,617
- Do we have confirmation?
- Like a dead body? No.

95
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,744
It's a fair question.

96
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,997
- No, sir.
- Any local authorities reporting?

97
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:50,042
Fire, police?
Any irregularities at all?

98
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:53,212
Other than a desperate message
begging for help?

99
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,756
- You want to send a team?
- We must do something.

100
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,510
Like we had to do something at
Denati Park? I think this is Sloane.

101
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,096
- What?
- I think he's bluffing again.

102
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,515
By sending CIA into the SD-6 office?

103
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,308
Sloane is bold like that.

104
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,811
- Why is he even here?
- We wait for now.

105
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:10,563
- But, sir.
- We wait!

106
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,773
Is that understood?

107
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,118
Go back and convince Devlin
on your own.

108
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,287
- No point.
- You can't go by yourself.

109
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,457
My cop friend was told by a guard
the bank closed early.

110
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,459
- Maybe it did.
- I would've known.

111
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,379
- If there has been a takeover?
- If I'm not back, I may be dead.

112
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,383
Good to know.

113
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,788
- That's five.
- Copy that, baby.

114
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,124
Well...

115
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,002
It's almost over.

116
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:54,041
Alpha 14, standing by.

117
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,498
I'm a Federal Officer.
Step out of the car, please.

118
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,749
No problem.

119
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:30,114
Have you seen Mr Weiss?
I have Mr Vaughn calling for him.

120
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,992
I'll take the call.

121
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,247
- Extraction Teams "R" Us.
- Where's Weiss?

122
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,041
- Probably getting pizza.
- I got confirmation.

123
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,502
- I'm at SD-6.
- You're at SD-6?

124
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,380
- Did you hear me?
- That is a breach of protocol.

125
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:48,632
- Screw that!
- Devlin told you to wait.

126
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:53,220
The break-in is confirmed.
Tell Bendis to send in a team.

127
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,848
They can get in using a card splice.

128
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,309
- You're finished.
- Just do it!

129
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:11,155
Tchen, what's up?
Where are we? I need status.

130
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:23,542
Tell him
you're still checking it out.

131
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,920
- Tchen, where the hell are you?
- Do it!

132
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:27,213
Screw you.

133
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,926
I'm disappointed.

134
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:45,106
Being a reporter sucks.
Can I establish that?

135
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,732
- OK.
- Hi.

136
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:50,236
- Hi. And what have we been drinking?
- I don't know.

137
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,864
It had a little horse on the label.
Or a dog. Like a dog-horse.

138
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:58,077
A mythical creature condemned
to live in a bottle for eternity.

139
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,913
Did I mention that my life sucks?

140
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,295
The Rileys forgive you. Seating
arrangement for the wedding.

141
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:12,258
God, that's so normal.
Their life is so normal, Fran.

142
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:16,053
Sydney's life's normal, outside
of her obsession with the bank,

143
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:17,805
but my life is just not normal.

144
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:20,933
This story I'm working on
is about a guy who's in jail.

145
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,018
His wife committed suicide.

146
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:26,981
It's just very suspicious.
The guy's been totally set up.

147
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:29,525
He's a good guy
with no criminal record.

148
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:32,319
He's got two speeding tickets
in his life.

149
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,405
He's been in jail for eight years.

150
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:37,158
He's got another eight years to go.

151
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:41,162
So I went to see him cos I thought
I could shed some light on it.

152
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:45,291
Maybe I could research and write an
article that might do some justice.

153
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:49,670
But... he was so scared.

154
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:52,214
He had this look in his eyes.
It was like...

155
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,050
...horror.

156
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:59,722
I stopped the story. It's his life,
he wants to make his own decisions.

157
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,391
And then his kid comes to see me.

158
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:03,642
- His kid?
- His kid.

159
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:07,980
And she begs me to help out her dad.

160
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:10,232
And she was just so desperate.

161
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,319
Then I got this key.

162
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,863
"Pier 19, number 305"? I don't know.

163
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,407
- What's there?
- I don't know.

164
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:22,578
- How'd you get it?
- I don't wanna tell you.

165
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,080
- Why?
- It's very dangerous.

166
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:26,832
OK.

167
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:29,043
Francie, I'm serious.

168
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,007
Well, if I were you and I thought
I might be able to help somebody,

169
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,550
I would.

170
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:46,894
- Have you seen Tchen?
- Not lately.

171
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,813
I feel like a mom at the mall.

172
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,649
I don't know
if his walkie's not working...

173
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,027
We're five numbers down.
The code program's running.

174
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,987
I'll go get him.

175
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,700
Who is more tough-ass than you?
Who? Nobody, baby!

176
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,176
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Dixon contacted us.

177
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,139
- Dixon contacted you?
- He said SD-6 was under attack.

178
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:27,393
It's true. There's a team of seven.
They're after something in the vault.

179
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,478
- I took one out.
- Russian accent?

180
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:32,857
- Yeah. K-Directorate?
- I don't think they'd do this.

181
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,608
- Then, who?
- I don't know.

182
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:38,195
But right now, what do you know
about deactivating C4?

183
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,866
There's got to be 200lbs in here.
Enough to level the building.

184
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,034
It's a fail-safe. There's three.

185
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:47,121
- The vault opens, they blow.
- They shouldn't open it.

186
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:50,458
- They being the six with guns.
- When will they hack the code?

187
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,710
Soon. Did you study bomb defusion?

188
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:56,213
- Nothing field-specific.
- Does anyone learn anything?

189
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:59,592
Let's take this slowly.
This is a charge of C4.

190
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,178
I can tell
because it says "C4" everywhere.

191
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:06,140
There are eight black and yellow
wires, only six red, blue and black.

192
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,726
- Which of these 14 wires do we cut?
- Maybe none.

193
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,853
- What are those prisms?
- I don't know.

194
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,981
There may be more than one lead
to the firing mechanism.

195
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:15,649
- That pin.
- Where?

196
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,319
- There, in the back.
- What is that?

197
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:21,238
It's a crystal.
That's a radio receiver.

198
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:24,033
It's probably helping
the vault trigger the C4.

199
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:27,411
So, all we have to do
is pull out the crystal?

200
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:32,082
Wait. No. It can't be this easy.

201
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,503
- There's a tamper wire?
- Or a secondary trigger.

202
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:47,973
Now we know what the prisms are for.
Spray it again.

203
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:54,480
You know, I think I can pull out the
crystal without touching the lasers.

204
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:57,274
- My hands are pretty steady.
- So are mine.

205
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,572
One more spray on three.

206
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:06,033
- One.
- Two.

207
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:07,785
Three.

208
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,713
- One down.
- We'd better hurry.

209
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,230
Inside.

210
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:40,693
Over there.

211
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,242
Tie his hands.

212
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,711
Don't!

213
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:00,588
Why don't you tie her up?

214
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,215
- Wait.
- Shut up.

215
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,634
I'm British SIS!

216
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:09,764
For the past year, I've been trying
to penetrate Cole's network.

217
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:12,391
- Cole?
- McKenas Cole. Former SD-6.

218
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:16,979
Now he works for the Third Party.
There's a new player called The Man.

219
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:20,524
SIS has been tying to identify
The Man for the past three years.

220
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,984
- Your tie.
- My tie?

221
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:25,696
If this is a success,
Cole will trust me enough to tell me.

222
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,116
- So, what's in the vault?
- None of us know.

223
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,119
But it has to do
with someone named Rambaldi.

224
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:37,333
If you don't let me go, Cole
will send someone looking for me.

225
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,044
He'll know someone's here
and they'll find you.

226
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,880
If you're lying,
you'll make sure that happens.

227
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:46,175
When they find me, I'll tell them
there's only one of you.

228
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,803
The other C4 packages
are here and here.

229
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:16,891
- We'll each take one.
- They're behind steel wall plates.

230
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:20,644
- Which you opened by yourself?
- Find a fire extinguisher.

231
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,647
Use CO2 to freeze the bolts.
Go easy or you'll run out.

232
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,149
Here.

233
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,318
I memorised the laser grid.

234
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,696
Your C4
is located along this corridor.

235
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,074
Cross through engineering
to electrical. It's far, so run.

236
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,951
We'll meet in the storage room.

237
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,245
Then we can go to that hockey game.

238
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:40,498
- Maybe. Be careful.
- You, too.

239
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:47,463
- You took a call from Vaughn?
- Yeah, now that you mention it.

240
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:52,134
- A call made to me. What did he say?
- It was a bad connection.

241
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:55,012
- Did he confirm the attack?
- He was hysterical.

242
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:57,181
I wouldn't read much into it.

243
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,360
Tchen, Toni. Does anyone copy?

244
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:12,571
- Cole, this is Endo.
- Endo, this has got to stop.

245
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:16,700
You find Toni, you find Tchen,
you find the problem and fix it!

246
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:44,270
- How many were there?
- One. Only one.

247
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,673
Endo.

248
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,801
Endo. Tchen. Somebody come in.

249
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,303
Who the hell's shooting?

250
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,555
Cole, Tchen's dead.

251
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,641
Who the hell killed him?

252
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,060
I did.

253
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:10,773
Endo.

254
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,275
Endo!

255
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:23,452
Dear person, beating up my men,

256
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:26,372
I assume
that you're an employee here.

257
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:31,544
I am now standing in Sloane's...
tastefully minimalistic office.

258
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:36,090
If you are not in front of me
in the next 20 seconds,

259
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:39,176
I am gonna start
executing your friends.

260
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,805
Starting with the man
that I assume to be your partner.

261
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,891
Mr Jack Bristow.

262
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,633
I'm here.

263
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:24,722
You're the bad-ass
that's been killing my men?

264
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:27,850
I don't know, I just thought
you'd be an ugly guy.

265
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,060
- Damn it.
- Step in, girlie.

266
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:41,822
Search her.

267
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,202
Good and tight.

268
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,121
Seven numbers locked, five to go.

269
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:54,293
If she moves a muscle,
you drill her!

270
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:03,969
Roadblocks at intersections
and an ambulance standing by.

271
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,679
- You've got a call.
- Not now.

272
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,432
It's Vaughn. Line three.

273
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,184
- Talk to me.
- Where are you?

274
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:13,771
- We're on our way.
- This place is wired with C4.

275
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:17,399
We deactivated two.
Sydney was going for the third.

276
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,652
- Can you get to it?
- I don't know where it is.

277
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:23,989
They've got everyone. When they
open the vault, the C4 will go off.

278
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:25,116
How soon is that?

279
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,076
- Soon. Hurry.
- Got it.

280
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,244
What's going on?

281
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:31,330
If you've screwed Vaughn,
your ass is mine.

282
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:34,625
- I'm not scared.
- Yeah, well, you should start.

283
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:48,222
You know,
a lot of guys, it's their socks,

284
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:55,938
or their piece, their gun
and bullets, custom hollow tips,

285
00:29:56,021 --> 00:30:03,404
but for me, I have always sucked
my luck from a bottle of champagne.

286
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:06,365
I bring one... every job.

287
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:17,501
Would you care for some?

288
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:35,144
You don't remember, do you?
I didn't at first either.

289
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,150
We've met before.
It was about five years ago.

290
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,777
Here at SD-6.

291
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,821
Which was really rare for me,
cos I was a freelancer.

292
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:50,826
But I was here. And I saw you
in the coffee room.

293
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,288
You were wearing pigtails
and I asked you out.

294
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:59,126
Now, I know I'm not the subtlest guy
when it comes to women,

295
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,714
and I probably said something
insanely inappropriate,

296
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:07,384
because you told me
if I ever talked to you again,

297
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:09,011
you'd break my kneecaps.

298
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,686
Which just made me love you.

299
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,482
I've thought about you
these last five years, I have.

300
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:26,403
Just every once in a while I think,
"I wonder what happened to Pigtails."

301
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:31,492
And what I took away from
that encounter in the coffee room

302
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:37,081
was you didn't wanna go see some
mediocre romantic comedy with me,

303
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:40,417
sit in my Pontiac in the parking lot,

304
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:43,379
while we talked for an hour
before I made my move.

305
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,424
And you didn't wanna kiss me.

306
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,469
- Remember?
- No, I do not.

307
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,432
But I can see
not wanting to kiss you.

308
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,812
Well, you make bad choices.

309
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:04,775
Yeah, you didn't wanna kiss me,

310
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:09,447
but working for a scumbutt like
Sloane, that's alright by you?

311
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:13,117
Let me tell you
about that weasel boss of yours.

312
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,953
He will disappoint you.

313
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,250
And, one day, and I hope to God
I'm there when that day happens,

314
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,170
you will hate him.

315
00:32:27,923 --> 00:32:30,926
It was good to see you
in the office again, Pigtails.

316
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,637
I know you didn't wanna kiss me,

317
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:36,390
but when I was taking
the head off that bottle,

318
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:40,686
I backwashed in it.
I mean, like, really big time.

319
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:43,230
See you.

320
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,946
- I didn't think you'd come.
- I know, me neither.

321
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,867
I made sure I wasn't followed. I took
two cabs and a bus to get here.

322
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,078
I wore this the whole time.
I look like Gabe Kaplan.

323
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:00,206
- Who's that?
- It doesn't matter.

324
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:03,501
- You sure you still wanna do this?
- You know I do.

325
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,461
OK.

326
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:08,589
- You gotta get this to your dad.
- What is it?

327
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:11,383
- I don't want you to look at it.
- Tell me what it is.

328
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,427
It's your mother's autopsy.

329
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:15,596
There are photos you shouldn't see.

330
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,681
- Yeah.
- You understand?

331
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:21,185
OK. What you said to me
about going away,

332
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:25,106
if your father's gonna pursue
this, you have got to do that.

333
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:42,706
Do you remember Griff?
That big guy?

334
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,960
Well, the MVDs,
they worked him over really hard.

335
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:50,172
They had straps with blades in them.

336
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:56,887
These tricky glass syringes.
Acid. They were really creative.

337
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:00,683
But he didn't go down,
not until they opened up the box.

338
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:04,812
It took him about three needles
then his heart gave out.

339
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,440
How many did you take?

340
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,859
I wanna hear you scream.

341
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:14,113
Just the way... that Griff did.

342
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,827
Scream for me.

343
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:30,212
They broke you, didn't they?

344
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:36,093
- They made you beg.
- Don't you wish?

345
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:38,679
- One number left.
- "I can't take any more."

346
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:40,848
- That was it.
- I have more needles!

347
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,475
- You did.
- Let's go.

348
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,393
- You cried for mercy.
- I did not.

349
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:46,395
- It's almost open.
- Wept like a baby.

350
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,773
- That is not what happened!
- A little baby.

351
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:51,108
- We have...
- That is not what happened!

352
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,693
- Come on!
- Shut up!

353
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:55,196
- Come on!
- Shut up!

354
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:08,793
Baby!

355
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,686
I have to go to the vault.

356
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:03,806
Chopper, I want you to kill 'em all.

357
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:09,770
Back up over here.
Up against the wall now, all of you.

358
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:13,524
Lisbon. Last July.

359
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:19,363
- Now! Now!
- Get against the wall! Come on!

360
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:23,325
You! Don't look at me like that.
Get against that wall!

361
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,120
You heard him.
Get against that wall.

362
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:28,873
Over there.

363
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:50,144
- Can you shut off the fail-safe?
- Only Sloane can.

364
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:52,146
- I'll go to the vault.
- I'll go, too.

365
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:55,357
- You've just had surgery.
- I'll meet you there.

366
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,279
Arvin.
Did you execute the fail-safe?

367
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,531
- Yes.
- We need to deactivate it.

368
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,325
- Are they still here?
- One left.

369
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:07,077
- They won't get in the vault.
- Sydney will stop them.

370
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:10,080
- Sydney's here?
- How do I shut off the fail-safe?

371
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:13,334
The override is a keypad
in my office, but it's biometric.

372
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,462
It won't deactivate
without my fingerprint.

373
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:22,843
It'll take you hours
to get my hands out of here.

374
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:26,138
Marshall has a device
that can duplicate fingerprints,

375
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:28,182
but we haven't got the time.

376
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,976
You could take my... fingerprint.

377
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,145
Jack.

378
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,398
Take my right index fingerprint.

379
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,278
Just take it!

380
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:54,500
Right index.

381
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,231
Yes!

382
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:25,656
Looking for me?

383
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:33,998
Felt that one, didn't you?
A kickboxer, eh?

384
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,125
I love me kickboxers.

385
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:44,467
I got your kicks
and I got your moves.

386
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,720
Bring it on.

387
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,774
That's the problem
with you kickboxers,

388
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:02,276
ain't none of you can take a punch.

389
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:04,987
System accessed.

390
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,617
Yes!

391
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:46,130
I think you're right. Taking a punch
is something I gotta learn how to do.

392
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:58,058
- What's happening downstairs?
- I think everything's taken care of.

393
00:40:58,142 --> 00:40:59,643
We got lucky.

394
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,688
I'll get my guys out.
SD-6 will never know we were here.

395
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:03,814
You should go.

396
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:06,776
- You OK?
- Yeah.

397
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:09,278
Thanks for coming.

398
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,406
He had this.

399
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:19,246
What is that? Perfume?

400
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,209
Whatever it is, we have it now
and they don't because of you.

401
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,586
- Not just me.
- Because of you.

402
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:28,547
- It had better be good perfume.
- I'm not kidding.

403
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:30,674
Think about what you do.

404
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:35,554
Hockey can wait. I don't think
what you're doing here can.

405
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:36,972
Let's go.

406
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:40,518
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

407
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,543
- Are you alright?
- None of us are.

408
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,339
What happened here tonight is...

409
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:54,842
This is unacceptable.

410
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:59,513
The people who did this,
we're gonna find them,

411
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:01,766
retrieve what they've taken.

412
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:10,065
Even then,
this has changed everything.

413
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:17,156
Sir, I got the digit right here
and the medics are on their way.

414
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:18,908
Thanks, Marshall.

415
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:21,035
Sloane gave me the finger.

416
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,506
- OK?
- Yeah.

417
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:41,138
Are you OK?

418
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:45,935
I sent the email to Langley,
but I guess it didn't get through.

419
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:48,979
It's OK. You did a good job.

420
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:05,621
This morning, before all this...
you wanted to talk to Sloane.

421
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:08,833
What did you tell him?

422
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:11,127
I told him
that I'd see him tomorrow.

423
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:14,922
Thank you.
