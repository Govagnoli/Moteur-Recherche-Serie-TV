1
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:05,706
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,458
Seven years ago I was recruited

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,711
by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.

4
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:12,254
I was sworn to secrecy

5
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,423
but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé.

6
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:17,927
When the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,182
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

8
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:26,477
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting against.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,730
So I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

10
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,066
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,360
My handler is a man
named Michael Vaughn.

12
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:38,697
Only one other person
knows the truth about me.

13
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,574
Another double agent inside SD-6.

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,410
Someone I hardly know.

15
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,788
My father.

16
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:50,084
Mr Tippin?

17
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,835
I'm Kate Jones.

18
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,590
Danny and I had an affair.
I knew he was seeing someone

19
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:59,385
but I wasn't really thinking
so much about her.

20
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:02,972
Here's what doesn't make any sense.
I did a trace on you.

21
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,057
Kate Jones.

22
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:08,644
You died in 1973.

23
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,231
- I have to go.
- Who the hell are you?

24
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,110
Oh, no.

25
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,740
That leak. The glitch. There's
a worm, a hacker on the network.

26
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:25,119
They're downloading files.
Gotta cut the hard line.

27
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:30,624
Hello, Alain? We need to meet.

28
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,168
I think we have a mole.

29
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:36,130
Parkashoff was assassinated
by Martin Shepard.

30
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,009
Shepard checked into a mental
institution in southern Romania.

31
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,719
Get close enough to Shepard

32
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,763
and get him to tell you
where Parkashoff is buried.

33
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:50,728
Agent Fisher will be your support
on this.

34
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,439
His alias is Dr Carlos Fontanetta.

35
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:55,107
Fisher?

36
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,660
Jack, I thought you should know,

37
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,997
Sydney and Fisher
missed their scheduled contact.

38
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,958
What are you thinking?

39
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,460
Worst case is
they're not alone in there.

40
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,380
Maybe someone posing
as a patient or a doctor.

41
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,759
Come on, Jack. Sydney's a smart kid.

42
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:48,262
We've seen her through
worse than this.

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,182
Maybe not.

44
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,102
Maybe not. But I believe in her.

45
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,066
I believe in her
as if she were my own daughter.

46
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,737
That's nice to hear.

47
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,911
- When's her next scheduled contact?
- Ten hours.

48
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:14,288
Then we'll know
how hot the water is.

49
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,128
Let us not waste time.

50
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,756
I know that you work for SD-6.

51
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,343
I know that you are here to find out

52
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,095
where Martin Shepard
buried Parkashoff.

53
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:35,267
That you need Parkashoff's DNA
to read FTL code.

54
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,897
What I do not know
is whether you have succeeded.

55
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,942
Since we're not playing games,

56
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:48,530
which is refreshing,
I'd like to know who's asking.

57
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,575
My affiliation is unimportant.

58
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,080
You have until the machine charges.

59
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,123
Answer my question.

60
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:03,587
Wait. This can't be the best version
of this conversation.

61
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,007
Shepard didn't talk. I don't
know where Parkashoff is buried.

62
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,719
Wait. I'm telling you.
I don't know anything. Wait!

63
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:22,856
Mr Bristow.

64
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,443
Your usual table is waiting for you,
sir.

65
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,028
Thank you, Joey.

66
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,828
Mr Bristow, sorry about...

67
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,832
- Who are you?
- I'm CIA.

68
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:42,626
Operations Officer Vaughn.
Sydney's handler.

69
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,628
I cleared this meet with Devlin.

70
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,715
Kretchmer walked me through
your SOP. We're safe.

71
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,888
Are Sydney and I switching handlers
or is this a special occasion?

72
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:57,057
- We have a problem.
- Fisher hasn't made contact.

73
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:01,020
We believe K-Directorate had
an agent waiting in the hospital.

74
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,482
SD-6 does not have
confirmation of that.

75
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,942
The CIA does.

76
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:10,529
We have an extraction team
on the ready line out of Serbia.

77
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,198
I want to pull Sydney out.

78
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:21,624
I was hoping that maybe we could
co-ordinate this together.

79
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:23,459
Mr Vaughn, you're young.

80
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,921
You're eager. I understand that.
One thing you're not,

81
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:31,926
and this is something only time
can provide, really, is wise.

82
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:37,389
- You don't think this is right?
- Listen carefully, Mr Vaughn.

83
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:41,852
Even with a minimal extraction team,
you can't guarantee containment.

84
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,357
- If Sloane finds out, Sydney dies.
- Retire her. End her service.

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,859
Expose your operation at SD-6?

86
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:52,655
- Sydney's life is worth the risk.
- Not to Sydney.

87
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:56,075
Taking them down
is what gets her up in the morning.

88
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,705
Or did you think it was
those meetings she has with you?

89
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,334
- What is your problem with me?
- You pulled my file last week.

90
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,878
That's my problem, Mr Vaughn.

91
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:10,965
Did curiosity get the better of you?

92
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:13,592
Or were you trying
to impress my daughter?

93
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,765
She thinks you were KGB.

94
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,893
But I'm sure you knew that.

95
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,145
So I'm wondering,
what were you doing

96
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,606
checking up on me
checking up on you?

97
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,945
This meeting is over.

98
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,507
You can't torture Shepard
for information.

99
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,014
Electroshock won't work.

100
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,727
FTL trained him
to forget everything he did.

101
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,399
That's why you're here
posing as his shrink.

102
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,152
You're K-Directorate.

103
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,662
What makes you think
I work with K-Directorate?

104
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:27,291
Your accent's Georgian.
Georgia, former Soviet Union.

105
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,293
Their main recruiting ground.

106
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,963
Shepard thinks I'm a patient.

107
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,757
He's more likely to trust me.

108
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,176
Except he has already attacked you.

109
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,762
Which I can use
to seal his transference,

110
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,806
by bringing his guilt to the surface
then forgiving him.

111
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,810
I suppose you'd like
your life in return?

112
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:51,857
If you get Shepard to recall
the location of Parkashoff,

113
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,777
you might just live out your life

114
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,488
in a Chechnyan internment camp.

115
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,491
You have until lockdown tonight.

116
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:45,828
Stay away from me.

117
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,372
I'm here to help you.

118
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:53,460
I don't want your help.

119
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:56,297
I'm not open to your help.

120
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,675
I think I know
what's happening to you.

121
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:03,095
I'm sure you do.
Because you're one of them.

122
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:06,015
You know the words
that are going on in my head.

123
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,061
I know.
I've seen you somewhere before.

124
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,230
- I've seen you.
- No, you haven't.

125
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,441
I'm safe here.

126
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:18,193
Safe here. I thought I was safe.

127
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:22,615
What I'm about to say to you
is the truth. You gotta listen to me.

128
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,916
They are gonna kill us both

129
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,502
if we don't help each other
to get out of here.

130
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,130
Then you have a real problem.

131
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,134
Because I'm not leaving here.

132
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:45,012
I would rather die...

133
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:49,892
...than leave the way I am now.

134
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,412
Do you have the chart
Dr Kreshnik asked for?

135
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,885
Yellow sky. Interesting choice.

136
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,970
I told you to stay away from me.

137
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:53,098
I know that you're starting
to remember some things.

138
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:56,644
I know you think I had something
to do with them, but I didn't.

139
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,604
Piss off.

140
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,773
You can't see colours?

141
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,610
Who are you?

142
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,530
If you're not one of them,
then how do you know that?

143
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,617
I'll tell you what you need to know.

144
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,661
But first you have to help me.

145
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:18,582
I was sent here to get information
but I don't care about that any more.

146
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,795
All I care about is that the main
exit door has a dual-key lock.

147
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:26,757
That means two people using two keys
at the same time to open it.

148
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,802
- I'm not leaving here.
- Please believe me.

149
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:32,555
Other people want
to find out what's in your head.

150
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,890
When they don't,
they will kill us both.

151
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,893
You want me to believe you
but don't tell me anything.

152
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,771
I know... I've seen you somewhere.

153
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,068
Look.

154
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:48,779
You were trained...

155
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:52,116
You were programmed
to follow orders.

156
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,909
Whose orders?

157
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,412
Whose orders?

158
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,539
To do what? To do...?

159
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:01,709
To kill.

160
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:08,173
- No.
- The things you remember are real.

161
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,635
I know it's hard to hear.
Accept that you did these things.

162
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,345
I'd rather be crazy, then.

163
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:17,766
When you're following orders, you're
trained to see in black-and-white,

164
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,935
to keep you detached
from what you do.

165
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,689
You're not supposed to remember
but you are.

166
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:27,067
Your training
must be short-circuiting.

167
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,528
What you did
is so painful to remember

168
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:32,907
you see black-and-white all the time,
as a defence mechanism.

169
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,118
But it's good,
you're starting to heal.

170
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,829
Stop it, please. Guard!

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,668
Take him.

172
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,256
Lockdown.

173
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,220
Tell Dr Kreshnik...

174
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:58,140
...I have the information he needs.

175
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,649
A memo from Legal about reporters
quoting other reporters.

176
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,860
- What's it say?
- "Cut it out."

177
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:13,489
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Thanks, Jenny.

178
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,205
Davis, scroll down a second.

179
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,959
- Did you get the memo?
- Show me the picture.

180
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,418
Alright. Jeez.

181
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,590
Her name was Eloise Kurtz,
local girl,

182
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:34,218
found shot to death in Echo Park.

183
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,053
Do you know her?

184
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,765
She called herself Kate Jones,
not Eloise Kurtz.

185
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:42,309
She was my source
about Danny Hecht.

186
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,144
She was involved somehow.

187
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:46,480
She was trying to tell me something.

188
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:48,732
You're not hearing me.
I'm not saying...

189
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:52,736
You won't publish this even though
there are now two murders?

190
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,197
The fastest way to be discredited

191
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:58,617
is to author a conspiracy theory
without background.

192
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:01,912
Believe me, you might as well publish
your own homepage.

193
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:04,498
But will you at least
take a look at my notes?

194
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,584
Leave them on my desk
when you go.

195
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:10,170
I'm not telling you to drop this,
I'm not being a monster.

196
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:13,090
I'm telling you to bring it back
more developed.

197
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,503
My God.

198
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:54,965
- Ferroq, report.
- We are coming, Doctor.

199
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:58,052
What is that tattoo on your arm?
Special Forces?

200
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:01,972
I almost got a tattoo once.
I was on the guy's chair.

201
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,483
Take her.

202
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,151
Hurts, doesn't it?

203
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:24,532
You're right.
I don't want to die here.

204
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:28,118
- How'd you get out of your room?
- I was quite good.

205
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:33,541
I pretended to swallow my tongue
and lifted the RN's keys.

206
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,101
Look at me.

207
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,063
You can do this.

208
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:04,613
You think I'd help you out
if I thought you'd kill someone?

209
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:08,409
Unless you're planning
on killing me.

210
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,370
Why would I do that?

211
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,690
Sorry.

212
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,233
Get in.

213
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,197
Seatbelt.

214
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,379
Whoa, company.

215
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,383
Here, I'm totally a mess in here.
Sorry.

216
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:09,678
I wasn't expecting anyone.

217
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,263
Do you wanna have a seat?

218
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:15,809
I have a minor form of scoliosis.
The air ergonomically hugs me.

219
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:20,522
You want to stretch out?
I can inflate the couch.

220
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,608
I'll stand.

221
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:25,861
By the way, I scanned every byte of
the computer network.

222
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,280
No more virus, that leak is plugged.

223
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:31,408
Even better, as it exported files
at a low bandwidth...

224
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:34,995
Marshall, the virus
was a security section drill.

225
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,374
A drill?

226
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,711
- Like a test?
- You were the only one to catch it.

227
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:46,840
Faster than anyone anticipated.
So good work.

228
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:53,889
It transmitted over an unsecured
connection. Isn't that risky?

229
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:57,810
Security Section
was surveilling it the whole time.

230
00:21:57,893 --> 00:21:59,853
I just wanted to let you know.

231
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:01,230
Thanks.

232
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:30,217
- Yes?
- Dad, where's Vaughn?

233
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:34,305
I had his number forwarded.
Are you alright?

234
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:38,684
- I'm at the safe house.
- Any trouble finding it?

235
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,562
Only took six hours
driving in the dark.

236
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,689
Is Shepard with you?

237
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:48,569
Get to Rinas airport in Tirana.

238
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:51,739
There's a charter flight waiting
under Kraja Petrol Corp.

239
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,158
The hardest part's over.

240
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:56,410
We'll talk when you get back.

241
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,049
Why me?

242
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,719
Why did you ever come talk to me?

243
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,266
- I was looking for a man.
- Who?

244
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,270
A man who you killed and buried.

245
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:26,273
His name was Gareth Parkashoff.

246
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:28,609
That's what I was sent in to find.

247
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,152
A man I killed?

248
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:36,283
The first time I had the images
in my head it was like...

249
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:39,995
...a seizure.

250
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,874
Flashes of people, places...

251
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,919
...a street sign.

252
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:49,338
I thought I was remembering
bad dreams.

253
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:53,676
It was in black-and-white,
but it was so vivid.

254
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:57,638
I didn't know
how much of it was real.

255
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:03,018
I found the street.

256
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,939
I heard there had been a murder.

257
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,111
A shopkeeper recognised me.

258
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,824
I was convinced I was delusional.

259
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:19,410
I couldn't be a killer,
I couldn't be.

260
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:27,251
Where you found me was...

261
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:32,214
...as... remote a place
as I could find

262
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:35,759
to lock myself away in case...

263
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,014
...in case I was wrong.

264
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,474
It's not your fault.

265
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:51,859
I feel like I've been stolen...

266
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,112
...from myself.

267
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:58,991
I don't know if there was ever a me.

268
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,578
I don't know who...

269
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:08,375
Please tell me who you are, Sydney.
Maybe that will...

270
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,002
How did you know my name?

271
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,383
How did you know my name?

272
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,436
The banner.

273
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,730
What banner?

274
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:37,613
It said, "Happy Birthday, Sydney."

275
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:51,085
I heard the water... running.

276
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:33,252
I'm so... sorry.

277
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,185
The man you were ordered to kill
was my fiancé.

278
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:33,479
His name was Danny.

279
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:48,953
I told Danny...

280
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:53,541
...l'm a spy.

281
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:58,504
Because he was the one part of
my life I couldn't stand to be a lie.

282
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:05,511
And when SD-6 found out
they called on one of their hit men,

283
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:07,930
someone they'd already enlisted.

284
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:11,809
They called on you.

285
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:21,861
I think the man who programmed
you is named McCullough.

286
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:25,781
- He's their neurotech.
- McCullough?

287
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:32,746
He's in here.

288
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:41,297
The irony is, they never lied about
what would happen if I told someone.

289
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,676
It was the one thing they said
that turned out to be true.

290
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:52,558
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.

291
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,271
And I will be until SD-6 is gone.

292
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,065
Will...

293
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:07,448
...finding
where Parkashoff is buried...

294
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:11,410
...help you to take down the people
that did this to us?

295
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:12,953
Yes.

296
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,461
I left his body in marshland.

297
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:24,673
The Louisiana-Texas border.

298
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,344
Off the l-ten.

299
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:54,870
So that's the deal?

300
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:03,295
Shepard wrote down
the location of Parkashoff's body.

301
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:08,300
In exchange I helped him
escape the asylum.

302
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,594
I see.

303
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,388
Where is Shepard now?

304
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,724
He committed suicide.

305
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:18,727
Something went wrong.

306
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:22,648
He started remembering
what he had done. He snapped.

307
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:27,194
When we were crossing
the border into Bulgaria...

308
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:32,825
...he jumped. Threw himself
off the bridge into Lake Scutari.

309
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:35,661
There is no way
he could've survived.

310
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:45,880
If by some miracle he did survive,
we'll hear about it sooner or later.

311
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:50,175
I told SD-6 Shepard was dead.

312
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:54,096
I was gonna lie to you about it too,
but the truth is...

313
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:56,932
...I can't stand lying to anyone else.

314
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,894
I appreciate that.

315
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:05,357
I'll be honest. Some people
at the agency will want him found.

316
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:09,111
He's as much a victim
of SD-6 as I am.

317
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:14,700
Shepard buried Parkashoff's body
in a Louisiana marshland.

318
00:31:14,783 --> 00:31:17,828
Sloane sent out a forensics team
to get a DNA sample.

319
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:21,165
They should be able to
decode the FTL message by tonight.

320
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:26,545
- We were worried.
- The CIA hates to lose its assets.

321
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,590
I mean, I was worried.

322
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,050
For you.

323
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:34,845
In fact, I...

324
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:36,513
I contacted your father.

325
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,517
Just so you know...

326
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:43,979
...he knows I pulled his file
and suspects you've seen it.

327
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:49,318
It's OK.

328
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,863
It's me.

329
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:54,823
That's what I thought.

330
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:58,327
Seems our SD-6 computer virus
is turning into a gold mine.

331
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,247
Good. Maybe we can
get ahead of them for once.

332
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,667
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

333
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,127
Happy Thanksgiving.

334
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:09,129
Oh, God.

335
00:32:14,677 --> 00:32:17,263
OK, were you ever
gonna call me back?

336
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:18,389
Sorry.

337
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:21,183
Where the hell were you?
I left three messages.

338
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:24,144
- My trip was extended.
- You can't just disappear.

339
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,313
- What's burning?
- Just an oven fire.

340
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:29,191
- I just moved in.
- I fricasseed the turkey.

341
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,405
Are you OK?

342
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,202
I'm glad to be home.

343
00:32:41,078 --> 00:32:43,789
OK, but the turkey's really burning.

344
00:32:43,873 --> 00:32:45,624
Everything's burning.

345
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,587
Greasy steam. What'd you do?

346
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:35,633
This is Jenny. She works with me.

347
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:40,262
Thanks for letting me
crash your party.

348
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:43,724
I would have totally brought
some wine but I got carded.

349
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:45,267
So, cider.

350
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,728
Cider's perfect, thank you. Come in.

351
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,566
You look great.

352
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:56,111
Is this the sweater I got you?

353
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,698
That's not why I wore it.

354
00:34:01,492 --> 00:34:03,160
I'm gonna go put that on ice.

355
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:10,584
- She's cute.
- Yeah. It's our new intern.

356
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,962
Her parents were in Europe
so I felt bad.

357
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,755
That's Jenny?

358
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:17,716
- It's strictly professional.
- Really?

359
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,678
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

360
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,225
Happy Thanksgiving. Cheers.

361
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:51,041
Are your parents really away?

362
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:07,600
Somebody's
always gotta bang the glass.

363
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:09,518
This year it's me.

364
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:13,022
I wanted all of you to be here
for what I'm about to do,

365
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:15,232
which is probably going to be

366
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:18,235
one of the most embarrassing
moments ever.

367
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,157
This thing
is burning a hole in my pocket.

368
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:37,588
The last stop, baby.

369
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,343
Will you marry me?

370
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:47,097
Yes.

371
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:49,058
Yes, Charlie, I will.

372
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,317
OK, watch your tongue.

373
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:08,035
Glad you're taking it slow.

374
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,586
Dad.

375
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:25,511
This was on your lawn.

376
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,180
It's my neighbour's.

377
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,099
I'll give it to him.

378
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:37,565
- Do you...?
- Shepard killed Danny.

379
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:39,275
I'm assuming you know that.

380
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:44,029
If I hadn't, thank you
for breaking it to me so gently.

381
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:46,323
I'm telling you
because I don't want you

382
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:49,410
to think it's my mission in life
to keep things from you.

383
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:50,953
Then why do you?

384
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,917
FBI report,

385
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,961
signed by the Deputy Director,

386
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:02,590
clearing me of having
any involvement with the KGB.

387
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:07,970
You have to understand
it was the height of the Cold War.

388
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,347
After they caught Boyce and Lee
in '77,

389
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,850
everybody was under suspicion.

390
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,979
So I suppose, in a way...

391
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:23,235
...your mother's accident
was my fault,

392
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,738
since the FBI was after me.

393
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,119
If I could give her back to you,
I would.

394
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:38,000
Take it.

395
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,002
I don't need to.

396
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:45,216
- You should stay.
- Work.

397
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:50,262
I'm glad your trip went well.

398
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:55,142
Happy Thanksgiving.

399
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,186
You too.

400
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:18,457
We found Parkashoff's body
and ran a DNA sample

401
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:21,085
through the genetic decoder
you obtained.

402
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:26,507
It decoded the FTL communiqué.
Here's the full text.

403
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:31,053
Possible location of Rambaldi
Artefact discovered in Tunisia.

404
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,513
Dig proceeding.

405
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:36,684
Now we know where those FTL
agents went off to in such a hurry.

406
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:40,980
- So I'm off to Tunisia?
- Actually, no.

407
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:44,942
We sent an advance team there
on a recon mission.

408
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,194
But the dig had been evacuated.

409
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:49,947
FTL must have found
whatever was buried there.

410
00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:53,033
We traced a shipment
out of El Kef

411
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:56,036
to the Department of
Engineering Science at Oxford.

412
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,497
FTL has no idea
what they've uncovered

413
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:01,959
or else they wouldn't send it
to civilians for analysis.

414
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:04,461
But whatever it is,

415
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:08,173
some of the best minds in the world
are studying it as we speak.

416
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,555
The University holds a reception for
visiting professors tomorrow night.

417
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:17,600
You're going as a scout
for the Marisa Foundation,

418
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:19,894
looking for grant candidates.

419
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:24,982
Keep in mind that FTL is likely
to have a large presence

420
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:28,736
to make sure that we don't try
what we are about to try.

421
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:34,366
In the interest of fairness,
I reread your notes.

422
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,035
There wasn't much there.

423
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:39,747
You need more shoe leather to go
with the story you're looking for.

424
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,416
You're right.
I think it's better to drop it.

425
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:46,879
You've got enough for a piece on
why the police are not more curious.

426
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:50,299
So take it from that angle.
We go to press on Tuesday.

427
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,053
Wait. I'm not... I mean...

428
00:39:55,179 --> 00:39:58,098
Thank you.
Tuesday? Is that, like, set?

429
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:00,351
Will, are you on dope?

430
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:02,895
24 hours ago,
you were begging me to publish.

431
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:04,688
OK. Here's the thing.

432
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:05,856
Danny Hecht.

433
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:09,777
The murder that started this,
he's my friend's...

434
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,155
He was my friend's fiancé.

435
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,493
I'm having second thoughts.
She doesn't know about the story.

436
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:20,329
I think she'd want it investigated.

437
00:40:20,412 --> 00:40:22,915
I did tell her, a while ago.

438
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:27,294
She asked me to drop it.
I don't want to hurt her.

439
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm genuinely sorry to hear that.
This is now a legitimate piece.

440
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,636
If you don't want it,
it goes to somebody else.

441
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,471
Don't chicken out on me now.

442
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:43,727
Whatever the Rambaldi Artefact is,
the CIA wants photographs.

443
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:47,147
Do it in your hotel room. We'll plant
a mini-camera in the Bible.

444
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,692
There's one more thing.

445
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:52,903
One of our Romanian assets
spotted Anna Espinosa

446
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:55,865
leaving the psychiatric hospital
after you escaped.

447
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:57,867
Be careful. She's on this.

448
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,002
How was your Thanksgiving?

449
00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:09,295
Good.

450
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,590
My friend got engaged.

451
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:15,009
What's her name?

452
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,598
- How was yours?
- Typical.

453
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,474
Spent it with my mom.

454
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,563
- What about...? Is it Alice?
- Yeah, we broke up.

455
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:26,330
The security section
has made us aware

456
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:30,167
of the concern that you may have
a mole in your department.

457
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:34,547
It would appear so.

458
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:48,686
Some in the alliance
believe you may have more than one.

459
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:52,189
Well, if that's true
McCullough will draw them out.

460
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,750
It is our intention
to make an example of them.

461
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:14,003
I know.

462
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:16,255
I'm taking care of it.
