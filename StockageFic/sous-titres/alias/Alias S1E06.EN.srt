1
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,778
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,448
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth,
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,377
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,630
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:34,969
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA,
where my handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:41,392
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,729
My father.

12
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,734
We have a lot of questions
about your father. I copied his file.

13
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,863
What do you know about case 3-32L?

14
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,782
There are missing pages in my
father's file,

15
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,410
and references to case 3-32L.

16
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,371
- An Agent Calder.
- You read that too.

17
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,957
Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,626
Why would the FBI
be working with my father?

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,961
They wouldn't.

20
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:13,132
Unless they suspected him
of selling secrets.

21
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,927
Break into the building as planned.

22
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,431
While Dixon sets the explosives,
get the inhaler

23
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:25,060
and meet the CIA team inside.
By then, Dixon should be outside.

24
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:27,146
You'll disable the explosive

25
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,691
while the CIA team searches
the lab's main computer system.

26
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:35,362
- We gotta go. What are you doing?
- I brought a secondary detonator.

27
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,574
Good to go?

28
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:51,921
Let's go. Sydney? We've gotta run.

29
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,257
Sydney, we've gotta move.

30
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,719
Sydney, we've gotta move! Now!

31
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,765
- What's the matter? Are you hurt?
- No.

32
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,893
Go.

33
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:08,229
Run!

34
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,983
Go, go, go, go!

35
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:24,221
Come on, Sydney. We gotta go.

36
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,307
I couldn't move.

37
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,269
Dixon had to drag me to my feet
just to get to the van.

38
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:35,816
And when he asked me
what was wrong, why I'd just frozen,

39
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,361
I made up something
about having a flashback to Danny.

40
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:43,616
- You did everything you could.
- I was meant to stop the detonation.

41
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,409
I didn't.

42
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,662
Because of that,
four CIA agents were killed.

43
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:52,416
You had no way of knowing
Dixon had a second trigger.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,463
- There was nothing you could do.
- I could have told him the truth.

45
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:00,925
Dixon needs to know
who he's really working for.

46
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,259
- Sydney...
- I know.

47
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,887
- I can't put his family at risk.
- Or yourself.

48
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,557
I know all of that,
but it's the right thing to do.

49
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:13,813
- Those men died for no reason.
- Those men died for their country.

50
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,285
Sydney, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

51
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,379
- You worked late.
- Bar Association dinner.

52
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:25,384
A lawyer wanted to sue me because
his chicken was undercooked.

53
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:28,929
Can you believe that?
An obnoxious lawyer?

54
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,894
Have you talked to
your obnoxious lawyer?

55
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,146
I'm meeting Charlie
for lunch this week.

56
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,273
That's good.

57
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:46,363
- Syd, he's gonna break up with me.
- Did he say that? He didn't say it.

58
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,158
He didn't have to.
He was sneaking around on me.

59
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,368
We saw him with that girl, Rachel.

60
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,539
There's stuff he's doing that
he can't tell me about? Please.

61
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,501
He wouldn't meet with you
just to break up with you.

62
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,794
Guys don't do that.

63
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:03,172
If they wanna end things,
they just vanish.

64
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:07,051
Your mom was so pretty.

65
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,555
Yeah, she was.

66
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:14,850
Thanks.

67
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:19,355
I gotta go change.
I feel a binge coming on.

68
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:27,655
How was your trip?

69
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:36,914
Not good. I was working
with these people who...

70
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,958
They were terminated.

71
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,043
Oh, man.

72
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,004
The economy sucks.

73
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,902
- Hello?
- This is Helen Calder.

74
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:11,699
You left me a message about my
husband working with your father.

75
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:15,411
I know that your husband
worked for the FBI

76
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:20,207
and he investigated CIA agents
suspected of spying for Russia.

77
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:25,212
My dad was one of the agents
that your husband investigated.

78
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:26,505
I know that much.

79
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,717
Did he ever mention
the name Jack Bristow?

80
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:34,472
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,475
Bentley didn't talk much
about his work.

82
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,688
He looks kind.

83
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:45,065
He is.

84
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,027
- I thought Bentley was dead.
- Oh, dear, no.

85
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,448
That isn't Bentley.
That's my boyfriend, Gary.

86
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,839
This... is Bentley.

87
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,176
He wasn't so nice.

88
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:26,273
- When did Bentley pass away?
- 1981, in a car accident.

89
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:35,032
- Do you have a copy of this?
- I think so.

90
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,652
For 20 years
I thought I knew how my mom died.

91
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:57,990
She and my dad had been out at the
movies. They were coming home late,

92
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:01,744
and a postal worker
was driving in the other direction.

93
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:04,663
Alcohol wasn't a factor.
He'd fallen asleep.

94
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:09,835
His car drifted over the white line.
Dad swerved and went off the bridge.

95
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,049
I always told myself Mom didn't have
time to know what was happening.

96
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:20,971
Now, I know that Calder was hunting
down a KGB agent, my father.

97
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,434
Whatever happened that night was no
accident. Calder was chasing them.

98
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:28,813
They probably lost control
and the cars crashed.

99
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:33,025
Whatever it was, it brings me back
to the same conclusion.

100
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:35,986
If my father
hadn't been a double agent...

101
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:40,533
...my mom would still be alive today.

102
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,496
I'm sorry to lay all this on you.

103
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,832
But I have no one
to talk to about this.

104
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:51,168
- It's OK.
- I want to report him.

105
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,838
- What?
- I want to turn him in.

106
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,924
For being under suspicion
20 years ago?

107
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,094
What about the file?
There were pages missing.

108
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:02,847
Maybe he still works for Russia.

109
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,598
Stop, OK? Just stop.

110
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:08,561
What matters is taking down SD-6.
Your father's helping us do that.

111
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,438
You suggest I do nothing?

112
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:13,023
We have too much to do
on your relationship.

113
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:18,654
I wasn't to do anything about Dixon.
Is anything unacceptable to you?

114
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:22,992
It's your dad. If he sold secrets
or is selling secrets, that's hard.

115
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:26,036
- I hope it would be hard on you.
- Before you do anything,

116
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,834
let me find out if he's under
suspicion. Just give me two days.

117
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:38,090
I get it.
You wanted to do it in person,

118
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,009
but instead of coming out with it,

119
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,595
you're making small talk,
which is pathetic.

120
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,721
Francie...

121
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,891
I have always supported you,
no matter what.

122
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:52,104
The idea that you'd sneak around
and lie about it is the worst part.

123
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:56,025
- After all we've been through...
- I want to be a singer.

124
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,279
A singer?

125
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:04,200
I wasn't gonna say anything
till I had everything set up.

126
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,827
That woman, Rachel?
She plays piano.

127
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:11,332
When you saw us that night,
we were rehearsing.

128
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,169
We have our first gig
this Friday night.

129
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,800
A singer?

130
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,886
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry I wasn't upfront before,

131
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,765
but my being a lawyer
has been the family's goal forever,

132
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:31,560
and the thought of me doing
something else or wanting to is...

133
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,979
I've been too afraid to admit that.

134
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:38,234
- You're not breaking up with me?
- Are you kidding?

135
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,611
You're my baby.

136
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:49,078
Charlie singing? I wouldn't miss it.

137
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:53,249
- Will.
- Yeah, I'll be there. Yes.

138
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,168
Yes. Best behaviour. I got it.

139
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:59,213
- Get off my chair.
- How's Sydney? That was Sydney?

140
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,299
You gotta stop doing that.
Anybody call when I was ill?

141
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,343
Yeah, a guy from the DMV.

142
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:07,638
He ran the licence plate
off Kate Jones's car.

143
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,682
Or the woman pretending to be her.

144
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:13,936
According to her social security
number, Kate Jones died in 1973.

145
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,356
Hello, Hank? Hello, it's Will.

146
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
You come up with anything?

147
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:24,113
Did it match a licence plate
for a 663 Sam Tango Frank?

148
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:27,241
You're the best. OK...

149
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,870
Eloise Kurtz.

150
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:35,916
Eloise Kurtz is proof someone's
covering up Danny's murder.

151
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,421
And she was lying
about having an affair with him.

152
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:43,966
223 Whitley Place, Hollywood.

153
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:57,313
Good work in Germany. The inhaler
prototype's safely in analysis.

154
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:01,275
The Badenweiler factory
was demolished without casualties.

155
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:05,029
Thanks.
Dixon deserves the credit, not me.

156
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:10,201
Jack will no longer be working
out of Jennings Aerospace.

157
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,579
His assignment there is complete.

158
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,748
As of today, he'll be working here

159
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:19,084
with a cover as portfolio manager
for Credit Dauphine.

160
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,630
This way,
he can more actively participate

161
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:26,008
in the planning and execution
of missions.

162
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,928
- Good.
- Jack?

163
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:32,056
Two months ago,
FTL vacated their base at Rabat

164
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,850
and their support station at Shaneer.

165
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:38,395
All the heavy equipment was moved,
including the T47 s.

166
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:42,233
At the time,
recovery team found this at Rabat.

167
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:53,327
Last week, we learned FTL
abandoned their transfer facility.

168
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,123
Our recovery team did a sweep
and returned with this.

169
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,462
Is the ink encoded?

170
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,715
That was my first thought, as well.

171
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,136
I'm sorry. You want some fritter?
It's apple.

172
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,388
Analysis studied the music sample.

173
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:16,851
They found an identical pattern of
numbers buried in higher frequencies.

174
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:20,771
It's not noise.
It's where they hid the code.

175
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,482
- Have we deciphered it?
- No.

176
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,404
Mirage.
It's a converted salvage tug.

177
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:33,325
FTL uses it as a floating lab.
Weapon design, data storage, crypto.

178
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:36,245
An SD-6 commando team
stormed the ship last night

179
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:38,456
as it passed through
the Panama Canal.

180
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,791
They brought back this.

181
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,170
- What is it?
- FTL's latest code machine.

182
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:47,590
Without this, we're unable
to read their communications.

183
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:51,010
- How does it work?
- Very well.

184
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,014
- We don't know yet.
- The team got what they could.

185
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,850
But there was a self-destruct
on the ship.

186
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:01,187
Needless to say,
they left fairly quickly.

187
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,190
They found out
only eight decoders were produced.

188
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,567
One is now
in the possession of this man.

189
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,654
John Smythe, owner of
Hobbs End Photo Gallery in London.

190
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,198
Also an FTL operative.

191
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,242
One of the code machines
is being held at the gallery

192
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,536
awaiting pick-up next Tuesday.

193
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,373
You leave for London tonight.

194
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:24,960
We want to know where FTL went
and what they're up to.

195
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:27,922
Your job is to bring back
the encoding machine.

196
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:33,177
I would have told you
about the realignment,

197
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,137
but you were in Badenweiler.

198
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,848
I heard about what happened.
It's tragic.

199
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:42,019
I know about you.
That you were hunted by the FBI

200
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:45,022
and I know that Mom died
because they were after you.

201
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:45,940
Sydney.

202
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:49,235
Every time I think I know
just how awful you are,

203
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,070
I learn something worse.

204
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:03,207
But this time,
I'm gonna make sure you pay.

205
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,907
- What's this?
- A bug.

206
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,827
- What are you, 12 years old?
- No, a bug.

207
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,122
We didn't know about Smythe.

208
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:47,793
- They'll scan for listening devices.
- The technology is passive.

209
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:51,922
Langley cribbed the design
from a Russian device.

210
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:55,885
It works when hit with
a microwave beam off a satellite.

211
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:59,638
Then it acts as a microphone.
It's undetectable.

212
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:03,350
- They'll just think it's a bug.
- Exactly.

213
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,269
What about the code machine?

214
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,564
We won't have time to switch,
so deliver it to SD-6.

215
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:12,526
When the code's broken, they'll
inform officers using the network.

216
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,738
Thanks to you, we're still
downloading their data.

217
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:19,200
- How much have you got so far?
- Almost two percent.

218
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:21,869
In all this time, that's all you got?

219
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:25,956
If we take too much too quickly
they'll notice, but if we're patient,

220
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,293
we can get all their files
and do some real damage.

221
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,836
Good.

222
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,842
I checked about your dad. He's clean.
No internal investigations.

223
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,595
- I told him.
- Told him what?

224
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:43,891
That I know about Calder, his spying
for the KGB, the accident.

225
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:46,310
Damn it,
I asked you not to say anything.

226
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,604
I don't care.
If you were in my position,

227
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:51,607
you wouldn't be able
to control yourself.

228
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,028
- You're gonna have to learn to.
- Don't lecture me about my father.

229
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:58,948
Because of this spy trade,
my mother is dead.

230
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:03,953
You couldn't understand what it's
like to have a parent die that way.

231
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:14,839
There's a book back at Langley.
They keep it locked up under glass.

232
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,301
Behind it is a marble wall
with stars carved in it.

233
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:23,013
It's a memorial
to the agents lost in action.

234
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:26,267
Families are never told
how they died or where,

235
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,769
only that they won't be coming home.

236
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:34,942
I was eight when my father
became one of those stars.

237
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:40,698
At the funerals, there's a protocol

238
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,285
the agency representative
has to follow.

239
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,912
What to say, whose hand to shake.

240
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,543
You're admonished. That's the word
they use, admonished,

241
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,920
not to be conspicuously emotional.

242
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:58,048
Vaughn, I'm so sorry.

243
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:01,135
The agents
that died at Badenweiler...

244
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:07,475
...l've been assigned to represent
the agency at their funerals.

245
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,743
Delivery.
Got a package for Eloise Kurtz.

246
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,873
I just need five minutes.

247
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:34,376
- How did you know my name?
- I won't use it if you're afraid.

248
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,170
I don't know anything.

249
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,048
People who say that
know more than they think.

250
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:43,636
Do you know how they killed Danny?
Shot him in his bathtub.

251
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,972
- I don't know anything.
- Three bullets, one in his heart.

252
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,517
- I'm warning you.
- Five minutes.

253
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,935
I have pepper spray.

254
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,312
- God!
- I told you.

255
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,438
My eyes!

256
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,941
- I warned you. Now just go away!
- OK!

257
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,753
Ready?

258
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,674
It should take me 20 seconds
to get down the hall.

259
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:16,103
Excuse me, sir. Hello. Actually,
this is a non-smoking gallery.

260
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,772
Not any more.

261
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:23,068
I'm afraid if you don't put that out,
we'll escort you to the door.

262
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:26,530
What kind of a deal
do you think I can get

263
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:31,577
if I take, say,
the entire collection?

264
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:36,248
I'll go call the owner.

265
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,559
Yeah?

266
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,229
I'll be right there.

267
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:00,374
Chester Conlan
is an award-winning artist.

268
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:04,336
- It is almost Keiferesque.
- I said the same thing.

269
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:10,468
Is this bothering you, by the way?

270
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,137
Not at all.

271
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:08,692
I am tempted, but... I don't know.

272
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:12,071
Sir, I've already offered
to come down ten percent.

273
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:16,325
Ten... percent is not 20 percent.

274
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,299
I'll eat the tax, but that is it.

275
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,639
Chéri?
I think I prefer the Lamborghini.

276
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:05,518
You are the birthday girl.

277
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:08,312
Could you do something with this?

278
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:22,993
He doesn't sing in the car
or in the shower.

279
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,163
He doesn't even the national
anthem at baseball games.

280
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,456
He doesn't even hum.

281
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,085
Too, like,
"I'm with the band", kinda.

282
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:35,923
If he had a good voice, he would have
used it somewhere, once.

283
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,508
I would have heard it.

284
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:43,973
You'll be there, right?
I mean, I need you there.

285
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,599
Of course I will.

286
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:49,728
When he's not... If he's not good,

287
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,648
he's gonna be so devastated,
you know that.

288
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:56,861
Or it could be the start
of something great.

289
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:59,572
- Raid my closet.
- Thanks.

290
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:01,740
But I got boobs.

291
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:07,288
Hey. I'm Rachel. Charlie
has told me so much about you.

292
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:10,749
- Really?
- Going for her MBA, best cook ever.

293
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:14,211
- You're like this mythic person.
- OK, I like her.

294
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:16,589
And this is Will.

295
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:19,258
- Know anything about me?
- And Sydney.

296
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,595
This is my sister, Amy.

297
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:27,808
- Will Tippin.
- It's Eloise Kurtz.

298
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:30,102
Sorry, I can't hear you. Hold on.

299
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,398
- This is so exciting.
- A little terrifying.

300
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:38,277
- We gotta get ready.
- You guys are gonna be great.

301
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,201
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- Stop it.

302
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:48,370
- Hi.
- Are you alright?

303
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:50,206
You mean, can I see again?

304
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:53,542
- I feel horrible.
- It's OK. I was wearing my glasses.

305
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:57,171
- I'm really not a bad person.
- I never said you were.

306
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:59,215
Help me out, please.

307
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:03,636
They gave me $2,000 to say I was
having an affair with Danny Hecht.

308
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,179
Who did?

309
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:07,848
I was between jobs.
My car was broken.

310
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,684
Anybody in my position
would have done the same.

311
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:13,938
Can I buy you a coffee
and meet you in person?

312
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,440
Come by my apartment
tomorrow afternoon.

313
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:22,113
How about three o'clock? I have a
great car mechanic if you need one.

314
00:29:22,738 --> 00:29:24,240
Hello?

315
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,577
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

316
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,205
Listen. Everything's gonna be OK.

317
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:46,595
- Fact checker. How's Francie?
- A wreck.

318
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,274
Charlie!

319
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:16,083
When the road gets dark

320
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,839
And you can no longer see

321
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,011
Just let my love throw a spark

322
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:32,349
And have a little faith in me

323
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:37,980
When the tears you cry

324
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:44,403
Are all you can believe

325
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:50,326
Just give these loving arms a try

326
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:54,663
And have a little faith in me

327
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:59,376
And have a little faith in me

328
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:05,800
Have a little faith in me...

329
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:07,384
That's my boyfriend.

330
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:11,680
Have a little faith in me

331
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,435
Have a little faith in me

332
00:31:20,272 --> 00:31:24,693
When your secret heart

333
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:29,907
Cannot sleep so easily

334
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:34,161
Come here, darlin',
I'm gonna whisper start

335
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:41,335
Have a little faith in me

336
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:06,402
It tickles. What just happened?

337
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:11,282
It took a piece of your thumb,
a speck. And this is true genius.

338
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:14,118
It created a code from your DNA.

339
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,370
That's how the code
from the cards works.

340
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,164
The encryption was DNA-based.

341
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,958
- Whose?
- We know he had a card.

342
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,295
Gareth Parkashoff,
leader of the FTL in Rabat.

343
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:29,383
That's the good news. We know it's
Parkashoff. Bad news is he's dead.

344
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:33,554
We need his DNA, but we don't know
where he's buried. Marshall?

345
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:37,683
Marshall?

346
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:41,353
- The system's a little sluggish.
- Marshall, get Fisher.

347
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:45,316
Last month, we received intel

348
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,986
that Parkashoff was assassinated
by Martin Shepard.

349
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,905
Shepard's an interesting case.

350
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:54,074
His subconscious was programmed
to respond to a phrase.

351
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:56,827
Say it to him and he'd do
what you asked, even kill.

352
00:32:56,911 --> 00:33:00,706
Say it again and those acts
would be erased from his mind.

353
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,375
He'd have no recollection
of his acts.

354
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,962
We have known for some time
what that phrase is.

355
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:08,714
- It's by John Donne.
- Right.

356
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,217
Get close to Shepard,
recite the poem

357
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,261
and get him to tell you
where Parkashoff is buried.

358
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:15,763
Where is he?

359
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:18,557
He checked himself
into a mental institution

360
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:21,769
in Bucharest, southern Romania.

361
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:23,395
If you don't mind...

362
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,899
There's something weird going on
with the computer network.

363
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:30,653
- Marshall?
- Kind of a bandwidth leak.

364
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:33,948
Why don't you get me a report
by the end of the day?

365
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:39,787
Agent Fisher will be your support.
His alias is Dr Carlos Fontanetta.

366
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,540
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

367
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:45,376
The Mangalev clinic
is expecting Dr Fontanetta

368
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:48,129
to check a patient in
the day after tomorrow.

369
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:50,548
You are that patient.

370
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:02,059
Your handler's unavailable. Locate
Parkashoff. Relay the coordinates.

371
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:05,438
Vaughn's at a funeral. Heroes died
because of people like you.

372
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:08,732
Relay the correct coordinates
to SD-6.

373
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:12,236
- Go to hell.
- People's lives are at stake.

374
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,238
Your life.

375
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,326
What you think you know,
you don't know.

376
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,454
Then, you explain it to me.

377
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,791
You don't have clearance.

378
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,919
Clearance?
To be told how my mother died?

379
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:31,422
- There are rules.
- Then you break them.

380
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,507
Think about what you're saying.

381
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:36,719
Acting cavalier
about breaking the rules.

382
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:40,723
Think about the last time
you did something like that.

383
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:44,477
I'm not a perfect man, I know that.

384
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,856
But I am smart enough not to draw
simple conclusions and act upon them.

385
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:55,237
I'd think that if anyone had learned
that lesson, it would have been you.

386
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:21,430
Miss DiCamillo is bipolar.

387
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:25,518
We were doing some relief work
up in the north,

388
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:28,354
when she suffered a psychotic break.

389
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:33,526
She's suffering from
auditory hallucinations.

390
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,779
She thinks her government
wants to kill her.

391
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,996
Her previous doctor submitted her
for some experimental treatments,

392
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,625
lithium substitutes,
neurolinguistic programming,

393
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:53,003
all of which
had no effect on her condition.

394
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:57,967
I'm trying to find her parents, but,
till then, I need a place for her.

395
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,847
- Is she taking any anti-psychotics?
- Olanzapine, 20 milligrams QPM.

396
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,990
There are other institutions
in Bucharest.

397
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:23,659
How is it you honour us?

398
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:27,371
The consulate, they directed me here.

399
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:35,296
This way. We'll get her admitted.

400
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,231
Miss Kurtz?

401
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,948
I'm coming in.
Easy on the pepper spray.

402
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:57,354
Your dad was a hero.

403
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:17,792
Oh, no.

404
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,339
Oh, no!

405
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:28,969
That leak...
There's a hack on the network!

406
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:32,014
They're downloading files
off the server!

407
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:34,892
Gotta cut the hard line!

408
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:50,533
Hello. Alain? We need to meet.

409
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,161
I think we have a mole.

410
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,110
Hi.

411
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:31,824
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- This is not a problem.

412
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:35,536
Two more forms
and her admission is complete.

413
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:46,088
By the way, while you were waiting,
I called to the consulate. Yes.

414
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:50,843
I'm speaking at a UN conference
on refugees in New York next month.

415
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,262
I called them about a visa.

416
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,934
Naturally, I thanked them for having
recommended our institution,

417
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:02,688
and I was surprised to hear
that they were unaware

418
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:06,192
of any such recommendation.

419
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:14,116
Do I know you?

420
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:21,791
"No man is an island,
entire of itself."

421
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:24,668
"Every man
is a piece of the continent."

422
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:31,300
Who are you?

423
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:38,974
Who are you?

424
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:41,352
That is because the consulate

425
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:45,147
referred me
to the local health department.

426
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,274
That explains it.

427
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:16,387
We know what you're doing,
Miss Bristow.

428
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:32,862
- Where's Vaughn?
- He's covering the funerals.

429
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:35,739
Badenweiler?
Why, did you finally get a date?

430
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,325
That asylum Bristow's been sent to?

431
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:43,747
The doctor who's running the place,
Kreshnik? He's with K-Directorate.

432
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:41,305
Fisher?
