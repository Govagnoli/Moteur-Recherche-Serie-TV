1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,165
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,968
I woke up like it was one night!

3
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,963
I have a scar on my stomach
I have never seen.

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:08,428
You're telling me two years have
passed and I need to be patient?

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:09,465
You have to relax.

6
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,931
I deserve to know what happened
to people in my life!

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,641
Sydney can no longer be
your primary concern.

8
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,059
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,640
Be cruel if you have to.

10
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:24,571
Make her despise you because
your kindness tortures her.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,694
So what does the prophecy say?

12
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,118
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks.

13
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,743
Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works.

14
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,126
At vulgar cost, this woman
will render the greatest power

15
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:39,963
unto utter desolation."

16
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:46,421
You wouldn't do
something like this.

17
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,011
Not to your own father.

18
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,723
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what this means.

19
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:01,390
- What is that?
- What was inside the box.

20
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:02,814
It's human tissue.

21
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:06,439
There was a name
etched inside the box.

22
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,236
Milo Rambaldi.

23
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,122
Marshall, have you
analysed the cube?

24
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,954
I wish.

25
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,290
The jerks are here.

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,167
Pretentious Classified
Division of Intelligence.

27
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,049
You know,
conspiracy theorists' wet dream.

28
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,128
- I don't understand.
- That's the point.

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,379
Who they are exactly
is on a need-to-know basis.

30
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:15,257
Suffice it to say, their
jurisdiction supercedes ours.

31
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,474
Well, they have a convoy here.

32
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,219
They're taking the cube away.

33
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:21,306
Wait.
Taking it where?

34
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,810
If I knew, I'd go there.

35
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,107
I should probably
put a tracer on the cube

36
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,357
and track it to their lab.

37
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,522
Imagine how cool
that place would be.

38
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,943
I'm kidding.

39
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,109
Excuse me.
I'm Sydney Bristow.

40
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,443
I recovered that cube.
May I ask what you're doing?

41
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,324
We've been sent to retrieve
the artefact for analysis.

42
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,622
- Sent by whom?
- Department of Special Research.

43
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:40,658
You're DSR?

44
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:41,867
We're a division, yes.

45
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,290
Can I ask where
you'll be taking it?

46
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,328
No, you cannot.

47
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,249
If you'll excuse me.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,045
This is unacceptable.

49
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,384
Every time I get close to some
answers, the door gets slammed.

50
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,882
I know.

51
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,550
Lazarey knew
what happened to me.

52
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,349
He led me to that cube.

53
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,261
And before
we just handed it off,

54
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:01,270
I at least wanted Marshall
to finish his review.

55
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:02,767
Sydney, listen to me.

56
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:05,064
We've broken at least
a dozen federal Laws

57
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,811
in pursuit
of what happened to you.

58
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,943
If necessary,
we'll break a dozen more.

59
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,023
But for now,
there's nothing we can do.

60
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,740
We can bring Dixon
into the loop.

61
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,201
This wasn't his call.

62
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,361
The order to remove
the cube came from Langley.

63
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,162
There has to be
something we can do.

64
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:21,249
We need to re-evaluate
every piece of information

65
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,330
we've collected.

66
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,289
Start from the beginning.
Assume nothing.

67
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,547
Do that, and we may find a lead.

68
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,214
Good to see you.

69
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,263
Kendall.

70
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,524
I'm sorry we had
to do it this way.

71
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,396
You're part of this?

72
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,774
Well, that all depends on
which part you're referring to.

73
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,693
You're Covenant.

74
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,445
No.
No, no.

75
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:23,288
No, that wouldn't go over
too well at home.

76
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,698
No, I'm with Special Research.

77
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,335
I had a team transporting the
Rambaldi cube to our facility,

78
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,877
and they were ambushed
in transit.

79
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,043
The Covenant got the cube.

80
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,225
What does that
have to do with me?

81
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,472
It has everything
to do with you.

82
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,359
We need to talk
about the past two years.

83
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,321
As you may be aware,
Mr. Kendall,

84
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,484
I have no recollection
of that time.

85
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,237
I know you don't.

86
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,404
But I do.

87
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,129
I know what happened
to you, Sydney.

88
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,039
I know the whole story.

89
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,800
Or most of it.

90
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,545
You've known?

91
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,345
All this time?

92
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,258
Yeah.

93
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,302
Then...

94
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,802
...why haven't you
said anything?

95
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:34,441
Because you asked me not to.

96
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,228
Place your hand on the scanner.

97
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:15,020
I need clearance to hear
about my own life.

98
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,601
You understand the information
is classified?

99
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,355
Any unauthorized
disclosure is a violation

100
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,903
of section 23, paragraph 5
of the Patriot Act?

101
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,616
Yes.

102
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:24,900
Before we get started,

103
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,987
I'm curious about
how you found the cube.

104
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,455
What led you to it?

105
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,950
You got to be kidding me.

106
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,535
Start at the beginning.

107
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,583
I'm all out of patience.

108
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,462
You died.

109
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:41,593
Or at least we believed you did.

110
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,514
We found a body
in your apartment.

111
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,802
The existing DNA
matched your own.

112
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,681
And I went to your
memorial service myself.

113
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:56,184
Watched Vaughn spread your ashes
in the sea.

114
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,898
Nine months went by.

115
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,479
One day I got a phone call.

116
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,241
It was your voice.

117
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,363
You were calling from Rome.

118
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,577
You said you had escaped
from The Covenant.

119
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,621
You wanted to come in.

120
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,785
We met at a safe house
in Tuscany.

121
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,085
Does my father know I'm alive?
Does Vaughn?

122
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,498
They will be informed at the
earliest possible opportunity.

123
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,967
What about Will?
Did he make it?

124
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,214
What you've been through

125
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,379
may have National Security
implications.

126
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,760
I need you to get them
on the phone right now!

127
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,806
All your questions
will be answered in time.

128
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,885
First, we need to know
what happened.

129
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,389
You looked different.

130
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,935
It was an alias of yours
I hadn't seen.

131
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:37,732
I had a lot of questions, too.

132
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,771
We knew almost nothing about
The Covenant at that time.

133
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:43,483
So you took me back
to the beginning.

134
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,151
You told me the first thing
you remembered

135
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:48,112
after your fight with Allison.

136
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,995
So this is what happened to you,
in your own words.

137
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,664
I shot her.

138
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,005
Three times.

139
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,127
Then I passed out.

140
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,589
Dead to the world.

141
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,976
When I woke up,
it was days later.

142
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:19,606
I was in the back of a van,
strapped down.

143
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:35,582
You and I are going
to work together.

144
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:39,832
We will spend
lots of time together.

145
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:45,209
But we will get the results that
my employers have requested.

146
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,923
I always do.

147
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,889
He injected me
with a neurotoxin.

148
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,268
Temporary paralysis.

149
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,565
I couldn't move or speak.

150
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,561
All I could do was watch.

151
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:12,448
Your roommate was easy.

152
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:14,613
We unearthed her.

153
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:18,490
We left her in your apartment
before we burned it.

154
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,458
But you.

155
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,455
That was more difficult.

156
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,383
When a body
is burned badly enough,

157
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:30,168
the DNA they test for
is in the teeth.

158
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:35,215
We extracted pulp
from your teeth

159
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,552
and injected it into the teeth

160
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:41,939
of the corpse that was
to be your replacement.

161
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:50,358
Of course, they tested
the body they found.

162
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:55,861
To them, it was you.

163
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:24,605
He will mourn and move on.

164
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,610
Find someone else, perhaps.

165
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:39,123
The sooner you accept that
you are no longer who you were,

166
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:42,825
the easier this will be.

167
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:50,166
Sydney Bristow is gone.

168
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,262
Why don't I remember
any of this?

169
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,142
I'll get to that.

170
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,602
From your funeral,
you were taken

171
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,094
to a Covenant facility
near St. Petersburg.

172
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,060
This was the man
who took you there.

173
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,977
The man from the van.

174
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,276
Oleg Madrczyk.

175
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,857
I killed this man.

176
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,203
It was only a week after
I woke up in Hong Kong.

177
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,695
He had all the answers.

178
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,286
He died right in front of me.

179
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,163
You kept your promise.

180
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:29,255
You said you would kill me.

181
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:33,045
You were my favourite.

182
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,464
Who the hell are you?

183
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,760
What are you talking about?

184
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:40,466
Why did The Covenant
take two years of my life?

185
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:44,980
What did he do to me?

186
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,816
The Covenant believed you were
crucial to their operation.

187
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,566
They needed your cooperation,
which you wouldn't offer.

188
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,359
So Oleg began
a brainwash protocol.

189
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,908
He spent months
breaking you down.

190
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,246
He used sensory deprivation.

191
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,543
Electroshock.

192
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,256
He would put you to sleep
by running an I.V.

193
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,753
with a barbiturate into one arm,

194
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,417
and shock you awake with an
amphetamine into the other arm.

195
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,885
I will kill you,
you son of a bitch!

196
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,096
I promise you!

197
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,558
Once Oleg believed
you'd been broken,

198
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:26,314
he began a conditioning process.

199
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,224
He started with hypnosis.

200
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,985
Your name is Julia Thorne.

201
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:36,360
You were born in London
on August 2, 1973.

202
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,367
My name is Sydney Bristow,
you ugly bastard.

203
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,409
He disoriented you
with narcotics.

204
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:45,707
Your name is Julia Thorne.

205
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:49,243
Really? Then why is my name
Sydney Bristow?

206
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:52,587
He withheld food
for weeks at a time.

207
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:27,578
He bombarded you with images,
information.

208
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,917
Classic techniques,
tried and true.

209
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,918
Julia, your father's name
was Kenneth Thorne.

210
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,419
Julia is who you are.

211
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,044
Your two brothers,
Daniel and Tom.

212
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,131
The Latin school.

213
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,975
Confirmation
at the All Souls Church.

214
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,136
After that...

215
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:48,936
Julia is who you are.

216
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,809
You lost your family in a fire.

217
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,605
After that, you became
a contract killer.

218
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:03,316
Your first targets were the men
who destroyed your family.

219
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:04,953
You became a contract killer.

220
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,410
You showed no pity.

221
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,250
Your first targets
were the men...

222
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,419
Julia will eat well.

223
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:14,668
Live well.

224
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:17,959
Julia is who you are.

225
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,336
This went on over six months.

226
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,134
It was about that time that Oleg
felt he'd had a breakthrough.

227
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,593
That his therapy
was starting to work.

228
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,181
Yes?

229
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,148
Lunch.

230
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,280
Once Oleg believed
that you were ready,

231
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,071
they gave you a test

232
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,616
to prove to them
that you were a believer.

233
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,662
That you were, in fact,
another woman.

234
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,164
May I present Julia Thorne?

235
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,007
Welcome, Miss Thorne.

236
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:04,007
The work you'll be doing for us
requires a certain commitment.

237
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,556
Of course.

238
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,511
Who this man is
is not important.

239
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,009
What is important
is the knife on the table.

240
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,847
Use it.

241
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,398
Kill this unimportant man.

242
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,356
No! No!

243
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,519
No! No!

244
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:23,231
No! No!

245
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,815
No! No!
Please don't!

246
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,393
Who was he?

247
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,389
We don't know.

248
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,057
So I was programmed.

249
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,101
No.

250
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,104
Not by The Covenant.

251
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,407
Wait.
Kendall, I don't understand.

252
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,491
I murdered that man.

253
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,201
What do you mean I wasn't
programmed by The Covenant?

254
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,533
When you were young,
your father subjected you

255
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,584
to the CIA's
experimental programme

256
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,959
to train and prepare children
for intelligence work.

257
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,210
Project: Christmas.

258
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,173
Among other things,
that programme contained

259
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,667
a fail-safe to protect
its subjects from being turned.

260
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,968
Jack hardwired you to stand up

261
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,677
to some pretty intense
efforts at brainwashing.

262
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,469
I traded his life for mine.

263
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:36,021
That man, whoever he was,

264
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:38,347
was taken, brought
into a Covenant facility.

265
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,900
He was dead
no matter what you did,

266
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:42,143
and you must have known that.

267
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,861
It doesn't lessen what I did.

268
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,983
But if you hadn't convinced them
you'd been programmed,

269
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,652
you would have both been killed.

270
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:51,032
You could never
have contacted me.

271
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,795
I want to go home.

272
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,041
I want to see my dad.

273
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,581
Your father can't be contacted.
He's under deep cover.

274
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,166
And as it is, you have
no home to return to.

275
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:07,210
Let me be clear.

276
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,055
You return home,
you're putting in jeopardy

277
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,381
the lives of the people
you claim to love.

278
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,886
You're just trying to scare me.

279
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,601
Look at your friend Will.

280
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,260
The Covenant left
the son of a bitch for dead.

281
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,435
Listen to me.

282
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:21,600
If what intel
we have on The Covenant

283
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:23,899
is anywhere near accurate,
they have the potential

284
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,229
to be far more deadly
than The Alliance ever was,

285
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,738
which is why it is imperative
you continue as Julia Thorne.

286
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,783
The Covenant believes
they have you programmed.

287
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,076
If you think I'm going back,
you're insane.

288
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:36,203
If you don't,
they're gonna come after you.

289
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,782
After your friends, your family.

290
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,079
After Vaughn.

291
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:45,673
I have to see him.

292
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,296
Sydney, you've been gone
nine months.

293
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,643
He loves me.

294
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,770
Nine months is nothing.

295
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,146
So I let you go.

296
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,906
And you went home.

297
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,085
As hard as it was
to see them together,

298
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,586
you couldn't confront Vaughn.

299
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,136
You realised your presence
was a danger to him,

300
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,391
so you did the only thing
you could.

301
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,142
This is Kendall.

302
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:48,394
I'll do whatever you want.

303
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,775
And that's how we started
working together.

304
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,247
So I became Julia.

305
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,790
Yes, you did.

306
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:43,034
They sent you to Algeria,
where you met with this man.

307
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,543
Simon Walker.

308
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,250
He was a thief.

309
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:49,296
You were introduced
as a contract killer.

310
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,707
You started working together
for The Covenant.

311
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,672
The mission was simple. They
wanted you to find the cube.

312
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:59,015
During your time with Simon,
you pursued a variety of leads,

313
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,429
all the while
keeping me informed

314
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:03,685
by passing on the intel
to one of our operatives.

315
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,975
You informed me that Simon
had found Andrian Lazarey.

316
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,640
A Russian diplomat,
member of the Romanov family,

317
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:13,235
who, like Sloane, was devoted
to studying Rambaldi.

318
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:15,896
You believed Lazarey would know
where to find the cube.

319
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,367
It was a crucial acquisition,

320
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:20,322
because it contained
the DNA of Rambaldi himself.

321
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,073
You told me
The Covenant wanted you

322
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,573
to get the information
from him and then kill him.

323
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,040
It turns out you saved his life.

324
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,035
You went to Lazarey

325
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,455
the night before you were
supposed to kill him.

326
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,127
He's a reasonable man.

327
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,839
The two of you struck a deal.

328
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:40,799
I'll make this as simple
as possible, Mr. Lazarey.

329
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:44,937
Unless you do exactly as I say,

330
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:47,346
by this time tomorrow night,
you will be dead.

331
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,105
So that's why
I faked Lazarey's death.

332
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:55,648
So the videotape.

333
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,697
We presumed there'd be
surveillance cameras.

334
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,159
The murder had to look real.

335
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:00,786
The paramedics
were CIA operatives

336
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,281
working under my orders.

337
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,945
The Kremlin carried out
a thorough investigation,

338
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,666
and they believed,
as did The Covenant,

339
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,373
that Andrian Lazarey
was assassinated.

340
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,502
Assuming everything
you're telling me is true,

341
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,582
Mr. Kendall,
what am I doing here?

342
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:16,427
Why are you telling me this now?
And where are we going?

343
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,717
We're going to my facility
in Nevada.

344
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,180
Project: Black Hole.

345
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:23,135
Four years ago when I was
called in to question you,

346
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:25,598
I was never FBI.

347
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:28,854
I was Special Research
overseeing the project.

348
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,063
I've never heard
of Project: Black Hole.

349
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,775
Thank you.

350
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:37,946
This is everything
the government has collected

351
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,448
on or about Milo Rambaldi
since the 1940s.

352
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:44,572
A quarter of the artefacts
we have were collected by you.

353
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,416
You're actually something
of a celebrity in-house.

354
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,371
Which is also
why The Covenant needed you.

355
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:52,335
They believe
Rambaldi's prophecies.

356
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:54,461
They believe a lot of things,

357
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:57,503
including the idea
that you are...

358
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:02,463
The Chosen One.

359
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:09,230
My mother said that
the night I disappeared.

360
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,643
Get off the ledge!

361
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:19,405
I'll tell you
what you need to know.

362
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:20,736
Get off the ledge now.

363
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:24,905
It's you in the prophecy,
Sydney, not me.

364
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,498
Four months ago, you asked me
not to tell you this.

365
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,955
I honoured that request
as long as possible.

366
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:34,128
Trust me. When I finish
the story, you will understand.

367
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,756
The Covenant had you.

368
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,955
If they could get the cube,

369
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,253
they'd have everything
to fulfil Rambaldi's prophecy.

370
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,670
You continued to feed
The Covenant false leads.

371
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:46,844
In truth, you and Lazarey
were working for the CIA

372
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,678
trying to find that cube.

373
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,103
And it took you nine months,
but you found it.

374
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,183
Where was it?

375
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,854
Nothing's ever easy, is it?

376
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:03,739
It was in the Fish River Gorge
in Namibia.

377
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,961
For 500 years,
the key to Rambaldi's prophecy

378
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:24,468
Iay buried in the depths
of this cave.

379
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:33,180
To Rambaldi's followers,
this was the Holy Grail.

380
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,070
A mile-long trek brought you

381
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:51,745
to an elaborate vault
that housed the cube.

382
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,291
Lazarey had devoted
30 years of his life

383
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:05,007
to acquiring
the 12 keys to the vault,

384
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:09,557
the last of which he found only
two weeks before your journey.

385
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,181
Each one had a name on it

386
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:17,937
that corresponded
to a keyhole in the wall.

387
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,163
This lock won't stay open.

388
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,793
I need to hold the key in place.

389
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,761
Lazarey was trapped,

390
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,977
and the cave began
to collapse around you.

391
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:04,900
Here, bite down on this.

392
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:09,322
There was only one way
you could both get out alive.

393
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,670
So you got the cube,
and you got Lazarey out.

394
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,467
Come on, you've got to run.
Let's go.

395
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:27,751
Let's go.

396
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,803
Come on, keep going.

397
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,178
Our agreement with Lazarey

398
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,391
was that after he helped
track down the cube,

399
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,681
we would let him
disappear untraced.

400
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:42,142
After you let him go, you were
supposed to deliver me the cube.

401
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,646
But I didn't show up.

402
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,480
No, you didn't.

403
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:50,489
Instead I got this.

404
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,620
Do you want to know
what happened to your memory?

405
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:11,473
You might want
to sit down for this.

406
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,314
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,820
I know you were expecting
the cube with the DNA.

408
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,737
Instead you get this.

409
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:37,530
You've been great to me.

410
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,991
A real friend,
and I am grateful for that.

411
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:47,125
But I can't go along with it.

412
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:49,043
The plan we had.

413
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:55,678
You know what this is about.

414
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,179
And I'm hoping
you can understand.

415
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:59,680
What am I talking about?

416
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,764
So I'm taking care of it myself.

417
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:02,805
The DNA.

418
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:06,102
Even if it's with the CIA,
it'll never be safe, not really.

419
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:07,143
I've seen too much.

420
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,395
Everything gets stolen.

421
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,067
Everything.

422
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,443
So I've got a plan.

423
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:18,198
I found someone,
someone who can help me.

424
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:21,908
A man who has done
advanced research

425
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:26,248
on how the brain stores
short- and long-term memory.

426
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:32,386
I'm not gonna tell you specifics
of what I'm doing with the DNA.

427
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:36,764
In fact, I don't want
to know them myself.

428
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:42,770
Which is why I'm gonna try
and have my memories...

429
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:45,975
...erased.

430
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:50,528
To keep The Covenant
from ever doing

431
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:53,484
what they want with
Rambaldi's DNA, I'm gonna have

432
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:57,407
everything that's happened
in the past two years removed.

433
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:01,451
If this doesn't work.

434
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,462
I mean, if this kills me...

435
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,294
...better I did it
than The Covenant.

436
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:17,012
But if it works, if I come back
and I don't remember,

437
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:18,925
do me a favour.

438
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,392
Don't ever tell me
about what I've been through.

439
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:40,276
Why are you doing this?

440
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:45,322
Telling me all this?

441
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:48,419
In his prophecy, Rambaldi
spoke of a second coming.

442
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:50,165
Those freaks want to clone him.

443
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,961
No. What The Covenant believes
is that Rambaldi's work

444
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:56,052
was destined to continue
beyond his time.

445
00:29:56,805 --> 00:30:00,055
That he was due a second coming
by way of a child.

446
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:08,556
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks.

447
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,694
Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works."

448
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:19,698
"She will render the greatest
power unto utter desolation."

449
00:30:19,786 --> 00:30:22,194
The fanatical point of view
believes Rambaldi's DNA

450
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,533
can be transformed.

451
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:26,079
Used to fertilise the egg
of a surrogate mother.

452
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:31,292
Someone referred to in his
prophecy as "The Chosen One."

453
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:50,607
That's why they cut me open.

454
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:51,854
Yes.

455
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:57,020
So they could extract my eggs.

456
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:02,279
And that's why you went
to such extraordinary lengths.

457
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,739
Because his child
would also be yours.

458
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:08,913
Sydney, that's why
I came to you.

459
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,745
Not protocol.
There was no official order.

460
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:14,123
Sydney, a couple years ago,
I got to know you a little bit.

461
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,504
What I believed was,
despite your protests,

462
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:19,000
you would want to know
about this.

463
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,969
The Covenant has it all now.

464
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,929
I got this video two days before
you turned up in Hong Kong.

465
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,724
And despite my being pissed off,
I respected your choice.

466
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:29,762
I opted to let it go.

467
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:33,640
But here we are 4 months later,
and you went for the cube.

468
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:37,649
Why, when you nearly killed
yourself trying to hide it?

469
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,450
Three weeks ago,
Sloane gave me a package

470
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:45,453
that I had sent to him
in the mail.

471
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:48,488
It was addressed
in my handwriting.

472
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,786
Inside was a key and an address
to an apartment in Rome

473
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:53,787
that I had rented
as Julia Thorne.

474
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,751
I found a code there.

475
00:31:56,841 --> 00:32:00,839
Coordinates that led me
to a box buried in the sand.

476
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:02,008
It was a hand.

477
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:06,723
It was Lazarey's hand,
which led me to Lazarey.

478
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:09,511
To the cube.

479
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:13,270
When The Covenant learned
I'd hidden the cube,

480
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:14,733
they kept looking.

481
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:16,063
Eventually, they found it.

482
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:17,528
They found the cave.

483
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:19,403
Lazarey's hand.

484
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,316
So they forged my handwriting.

485
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:24,159
They planted the code.

486
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:27,660
They wanted me to find
the hand in the desert.

487
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:29,028
They planted it there.

488
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:32,789
They wanted me to ask these
questions to smoke out Lazarey.

489
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:35,368
They tricked me into leading
them back to the cube.

490
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:36,744
Why didn't you destroy it?

491
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,876
I don't know. And why did I
just leave it at the hotel?

492
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:44,678
Maybe there was another step.

493
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:47,386
Maybe there was
someone else involved.

494
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:52,102
When we get back, I want you
to look at all the artefacts.

495
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:53,137
I need a phone.

496
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,354
I need a phone right now.

497
00:32:58,486 --> 00:32:59,435
This is Marshall.

498
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,198
Marshall, I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

499
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,951
You said that the jerks
were taking it away.

500
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,944
That you should put
a tracer on it and track it

501
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:09,444
because you can imagine
how cool it must be.

502
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,998
I need you to tell me the truth.

503
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:13,490
Did you put a tracer
on that cube?

504
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:17,417
If you did, and if you're afraid
you're gonna get disciplined,

505
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,581
I swear to God
you're gonna be okay.

506
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:21,833
I'm sorry.
I didn't put a tracer on it.

507
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,171
I know you.

508
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:26,962
No one is more curious
about technology than you.

509
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,634
I need to find that cube!

510
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:32,473
I didn't put a tracer on it.
I swear to you I didn't, okay?

511
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,770
Okay.

512
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,683
I put a tracer on it,
but you cannot tell.

513
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:39,602
If they find out,
they will fire me.

514
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:41,651
I cannot be fired.
I'm about to have a baby.

515
00:33:41,738 --> 00:33:42,936
Marshall, I love you.

516
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:44,110
I love you, too, Syd.

517
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,156
But seriously,
you can't tell anyone.

518
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:47,653
Can you locate the cube?

519
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,820
Well, not exactly,
but I can narrow it down

520
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:51,111
to a 10-yard radius.

521
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:53,661
Marshall,
that's called locating it.

522
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,458
Where is it?

523
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:25,729
Here's the big picture.

524
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:26,689
At 2100 hours,

525
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:29,108
you'll be dropped from
10,000 feet over Patagonia.

526
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:31,658
You'll hit the ground a
quarter-mile from the building.

527
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,703
We have minimal intelligence
on this,

528
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,495
but we believe the fertilisation
will happen tonight.

529
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:39,626
Chopper will be here
in two minutes.

530
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,255
We'll review the operation
en route.

531
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,881
This is Kendall.

532
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,757
Where is he?

533
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,586
Tell him I'm waiting.

534
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:59,182
What's going on with you two?

535
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:00,934
Nothing.

536
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,520
Come on, we got to prep.

537
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:07,023
What are you doing?

538
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:18,413
The day you showed up in Rome,
when you called in,

539
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:20,375
they put you through to Kendall.

540
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:25,378
I was there that day
in the office.

541
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:30,674
When he hung up,
he told me that it was you.

542
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:34,174
I've known the truth
about what happened,

543
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:36,639
and I was ordered
to say nothing.

544
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,850
Dixon, we've been
working together for months.

545
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:45,111
It's not easy, is it?

546
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,563
Keeping the truth
from someone you love?

547
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:55,619
Now I have an idea what
it was like for you at SD-6.

548
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:02,001
You're coming with us.

549
00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:04,163
Of course I am.

550
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:06,793
It's personal for me, too.

551
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:28,354
Let's do it!

552
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:54,169
Let's move.

553
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,755
Okay.

554
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:15,354
Kendall wants all of this
brought back for analysis.

555
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:21,908
Do your thing.

556
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,102
They have my father.

557
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,731
Take care of it.

558
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,616
Mr. Lazarey.

559
00:40:57,298 --> 00:41:02,126
You know about the passenger?

560
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:04,543
Excuse me?

561
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,591
The passenger.

562
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:18,690
We'll have time to talk
at the hospital.

563
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:56,064
Get him inside!

564
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,098
Move!

565
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,065
Shooter! Shooter!

566
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,407
Dixon,
I'm at the naval hospital.

567
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,071
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

568
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:11,487
He's dead.
Get me a team out here now!

569
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:26,423
The matter's taken care of.

570
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,506
Yes, sir.

571
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,176
I will.
