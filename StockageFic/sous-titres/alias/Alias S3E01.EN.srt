1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,616
<i>Last season on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,173
I'm approaching the finish line
of a 30-year odyssey.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,296
I won't let anyone else
take the final steps for me.

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,970
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,516
You have been a plague
on my life.

6
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,933
You repulse me.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,430
Every time I sat
listening to your lies,

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,443
all I could do was fantasise
about slashing your throat.

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,901
Drop it!

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,459
Why are you wearing that ring?

11
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,253
Since that night...

12
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,712
You've been missing
for almost two years.

13
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,230
There was a fire
at your apartment.

14
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,987
Will survived, but you...

15
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,793
They found remains.

16
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:16,466
The DNA was a match.

17
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,347
You were dead.

18
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,808
You were dead.

19
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,075
And you got married.

20
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,031
I did.

21
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,959
They asked me
to come to Hong Kong.

22
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,297
The agency thought it would be
best if you were reintroduced

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,225
by someone
from your life before.

24
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,899
They could have sent my father.

25
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,307
He's CIA.

26
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,234
He's from my life before.

27
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,698
I can't answer that.

28
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,155
I chose not to stay
with the CIA after your death.

29
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,035
You're not with the agency?

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,579
No.

31
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,535
I'm a teacher.

32
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,382
This is gonna take me awhile.

33
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,797
They want me to bring you back.

34
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,556
You can imagine what kind of
investigation's being called.

35
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,193
Hell of a way to wake up.

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,865
How much time do I have
before I have to go?

37
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,821
They said
they want you back as...

38
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,330
I don't know who the hell
you are, but you are not Vaughn!

39
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,668
Tell me who you're working for!
Is it Sloane?

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,162
Tell me you're working
for Sloane!

41
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,678
Don't...

42
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,972
Don't...

43
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,241
You're safe.

44
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,368
You're at
the Stafford Naval Hospital.

45
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,958
You're home again.

46
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:08,092
Sydney, there are no words
to make this easy.

47
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,511
It was Vaughn who came for you
in Hong Kong.

48
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,053
And what he told you
was the truth.

49
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,817
Dixon, what happened to me?

50
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,279
We don't know.

51
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,107
Where's my father?

52
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,531
Or my mom? Have you heard
from her since Mexico City?

53
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,537
Vaughn said Will's alive.

54
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,531
If there was a fire
in my apartment,

55
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,790
if he thought I was dead,
how did Will survive?

56
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,834
And where is he?

57
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,795
And Francie, is she dead?

58
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,087
- Did they find her body?
- You have a million questions.

59
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,883
I have more
than a million questions.

60
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,294
I wish I only had
a million questions!

61
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,798
- Be patient.
- I can't be patient.

62
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,047
I woke up like it was one night.

63
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,012
I have a scar on my stomach
I have never seen.

64
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,676
Two years have passed,
and I need to be patient?

65
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,681
I deserve to know what happened
to the people in my life!

66
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,648
Where the hell is Kendall?

67
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,150
Kendall is not the director
of our division anymore.

68
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,198
I am.

69
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,904
Almost six months now.

70
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,616
Congratulations.

71
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,837
How you feeling?

72
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,586
I'm okay.

73
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,764
You look great.
You lost weight.

74
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,805
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

75
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,765
I gave up all the foods I enjoy.

76
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,177
I'm miserable,
but I look really good.

77
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,055
We got something.

78
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,818
I need just a minute.
Excuse me.

79
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,436
- I'm sorry to be all cryptic.
- It's okay. I get it.

80
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,323
We received a transmission
from Mr. Kingsley.

81
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,990
He got the package
and the decoy.

82
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,750
He's on schedule,
aboard a train to Avignon.

83
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,787
We received intel The Covenant

84
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,462
may be moving to intercept
Kingsley and get the chip.

85
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,136
- And we can't reach Kingsley?
- No, he's radio silent.

86
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,264
But we have a lead,
an address outside of Paris,

87
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,976
a possible outpost
for The Covenant.

88
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,010
Contact the SNCF.

89
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,812
Have them stop the train
at the next station

90
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,977
and recheck Kingsley's ticket.

91
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,476
He'll know to make contact.

92
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,102
And get a team in prep.
I want to raid this outpost.

93
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,031
I have to get back.

94
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,446
Dixon, I want to see my dad.

95
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,870
What is the big deal?

96
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,759
Your father's in prison.

97
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,639
National Security Council
has had him in solitary

98
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,717
for almost a year.

99
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,728
Their policy, without exception,

100
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,305
is that he is to have
no visitors.

101
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:33,682
Mr. Kingsley,
you know what I want.

102
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,654
Give it to me, and I make
your death painless.

103
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,208
One more time.

104
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,088
My shoe.

105
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,370
My left shoe.

106
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,101
Not what I wanted.

107
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,544
What?

108
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,130
You okay?

109
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,840
I think I know.

110
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,217
Oh, my God.

111
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,304
I think I know where I was.

112
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,933
There are so many new people.
I don't know anyone here.

113
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,566
Just give it time.

114
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,521
Excuse me.
Excuse me, hello?

115
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,155
Hi. Sydney,
I'm Marshall Flinkman.

116
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,201
I work here.
Tech Design and Operation here.

117
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,992
Marshall, of course
I know who you are.

118
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,280
Oh, thank God.

119
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,866
Sydney, it is so amazing
to see you.

120
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,709
I can't even really...
Actually, I wrote a poem.

121
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,004
"I've lost my keys.
Where are they?"

122
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,092
- Sydney.
- Carrie.

123
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,560
Welcome back.

124
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,855
- You're pregnant.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. I am.

125
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,941
I wonder who the father is.

126
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,146
- Are you guys married, too?
- No.

127
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,157
We're not married.
We're not even engaged.

128
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,151
But we're talking
about getting married.

129
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,275
Not really.

130
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,197
She just has
an issue with wedlock.

131
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,163
Syd, Dixon's expecting us.

132
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,957
If you need anything, just ask.

133
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,209
"I've lost my keys.
Where are they?"

134
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,288
That's a metaphor.

135
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,797
We'd like to hear about
what happened last night.

136
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,376
I had a memory, a vivid memory
of the interior

137
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,796
of the building
where I was being held.

138
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,844
I know that it was in Paris,
and I remember the faces

139
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,010
of at least three of my captors.

140
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,018
Mr. Weiss' report says you
recall overhearing voices,

141
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,227
names,
including Mr. Kingsley?

142
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,730
This is Robert Lindsey.

143
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,394
He's our NSC liaison.

144
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,235
Yes.
So far that's all I remember.

145
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,406
It sounds like the group
we're looking for

146
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,701
is the one
that was holding our girl.

147
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,074
Last night there was a mass
murder on a passenger train.

148
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:03,496
Among the dead was a CIA asset,
Scott Kingsley.

149
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,916
Kingsley did work for us.

150
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,499
He designed an aircraft,
a spy drone,

151
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,883
that could fly undetected
by radar.

152
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,723
Kingsley was en route to Avignon
to deliver the schematics.

153
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,634
They were stolen.

154
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,012
This drone can be converted
into a delivery system.

155
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,393
Biological weapons, chemical.
I get it.

156
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,973
This group. We know
almost nothing about them.

157
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,859
They refer to themselves
as "The Covenant."

158
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,273
We have some intelligence

159
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,320
identifying
one of their outposts.

160
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,483
We believe this is where
they've taken the chip.

161
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,066
We're sending a team to Paris
to raid the building.

162
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,442
Look familiar?

163
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,112
Yes.

164
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,532
See, we're going in
with or without you.

165
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,204
Without you, we're blind.

166
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,785
You might recognise details
we wouldn't see otherwise.

167
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,296
I'm personally of the mind
that sending you into the field

168
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,258
so soon after your recovery
is asinine.

169
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,720
Well, you might ask yourself

170
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,797
how much you want to apprehend
these killers.

171
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,467
Do not question my resolve.

172
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,431
What you are suggesting
is premature.

173
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,890
Listen to what I'm suggesting.

174
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,896
I've experienced trauma myself.
Return to the field prematurely.

175
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,473
It's as dangerous as not
being trained at all.

176
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,477
Excuse me.
I'm standing right here.

177
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,608
I think I might be helpful
in Paris.

178
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,238
But I will not even consider
going unless you help me first.

179
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,076
I want to see my father
right now.

180
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,621
Miss Bristow,
just so we're clear,

181
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:30,588
I have no intention of doing
your father one single favour.

182
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,335
Ever.

183
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,930
That said, it's not your fault
he's your father.

184
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,927
And I'm not without a heart,
as you will come to see.

185
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,972
I'll get you in this one time.

186
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,733
Thanks.

187
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,279
Sweetheart,
you look so beautiful.

188
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,086
They told me you were charged
with resisting authority.

189
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,332
Yes.

190
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,212
Dad, I don't understand.

191
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,753
I became obsessed
with your death,

192
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,965
with finding those responsible.

193
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,468
And at a certain point
in my pursuit, I needed help.

194
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,307
So I contacted the one person
I believed I could trust,

195
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,634
given the circumstances.

196
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:05,676
Your mother.

197
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,440
You were working with mom?

198
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,188
At the time, she was number six
on the CIA's Most Wanted list.

199
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:16,061
The National Security Council,
primarily Robert Lindsey...

200
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,947
- Have you met him?
- Yes.

201
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,824
He discovered I was
collaborating with your mother,

202
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,858
so he threatened me.

203
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,988
Questioned my allegiance
to this country.

204
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,867
He chose to make
an example of me.

205
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,709
An NSC power play.
Here we are.

206
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,711
I was told you have a memory.

207
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,711
That you believe you were
being held in Paris.

208
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,425
It's an anti-eavesdrop device.

209
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,267
I got it from Marshall.
We have 90 seconds.

210
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,889
Dad, I don't remember a thing.

211
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,313
I read Dixon's lips when he was
outside my hospital room.

212
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,317
I made it up to get leverage,
and they want me on a mission.

213
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,154
- Leverage for what?
- To see you.

214
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:03,327
They told me I couldn't see you,
and I needed to.

215
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,290
I don't know if I can explain
what it's like waking up

216
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,248
and having everything
be different.

217
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,331
My friends are gone.

218
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,459
I have no job, no home,
and Vaughn's married.

219
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,334
- You're in prison, and...
- Vaughn's what?

220
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,676
He got married.

221
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,965
Michael Vaughn is just a boy

222
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,263
who was never good enough
for you anyway.

223
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,975
Sydney, listen to me.

224
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,935
My investigation into your death

225
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,228
became more disturbing
than I expected.

226
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:35,102
You must continue my work
and find what happened to you.

227
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,649
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

228
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,857
The only way is by getting
your CIA clearance restored,

229
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,570
having access to my files,
getting out in the field.

230
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,284
I don't think I can do this
without you.

231
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,406
We both know that's not true,
and you have no choice anyway.

232
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,415
The CIA, I am certain,
is dubious about your return.

233
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,209
You must get them
to trust you again.

234
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,130
If they learn you are bluffing
about your memory, it's over.

235
00:20:56,214 --> 00:21:00,378
Dad, what did you mean, the
investigation was disturbing?

236
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,011
Sydney, I knew you were alive.

237
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,510
I made a discovery
that you need...

238
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:26,738
You probably know this,
but I love you.

239
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,449
I love you, too.

240
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,210
The object
of tonight's mission is to find

241
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,502
and retrieve the microchip.

242
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,551
Also, to acquire any intel
about The Covenant,

243
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,551
who we believe is in possession
of this chip.

244
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,924
We've had the building
under surveillance.

245
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,558
It appears to be abandoned,
but no guarantees.

246
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,106
You've all met Agent Bristow.

247
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,649
She was held prisoner
in this building.

248
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,394
So while I will be leading
the operation,

249
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,858
we will take into consideration
any warnings and insights

250
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,275
that Agent Bristow has to offer.

251
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,527
Any questions?

252
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:05,778
Let's go.

253
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,070
Hey, you alright?

254
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,574
Yeah.

255
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,167
Move, move, move!

256
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,212
Base, we're in position.
Any last-minute fun?

257
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,466
We've got no activity
outside the building,

258
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,552
and thermal imaging shows
the interior to be clean.

259
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,684
- Good to hear.
- Anything from Mountaineer?

260
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,643
Hey, any of this look familiar?

261
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,311
Not yet.

262
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,017
- Negative.
- Roger that.

263
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,069
Retriever, move on your call.

264
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,231
Okay, let's keep an eye out
for tripwires.

265
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,364
Watch your back.
Let's move.

266
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,039
Alpha team, no sign
of hostiles in quadrant two.

267
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,165
Heading east down
quadrant six corridor.

268
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,133
Hallway clear.
Heading towards quadrant three.

269
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,419
Alpha team, hallway clear.

270
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,803
Building
appears to be abandoned.

271
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,635
Hey, you remember this?

272
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,885
- Base to retriever.
- Go, base.

273
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,980
We're picking up some company.
Quadrant 16, heading 2.00.

274
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,687
Retriever to team, be alert
for a possible hostile.

275
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,187
Quadrant 16 headed
toward quadrant 9.

276
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,653
Retriever,
we're seeing activity.

277
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,153
I'm counting three,
now five additionals.

278
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,108
We have five potential hostiles.
Let's get ready to engage.

279
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,912
Base, we're under attack.
We're under attack!

280
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,996
Fall back now!

281
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,993
- Fall back now!
- Go, go, go!

282
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,710
There are two more of them.
Quadrant six.

283
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,420
All agents abort.
Fall back now.

284
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,336
Let's split up
and take them from behind.

285
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,970
Okay.

286
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,091
Go!

287
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,088
Come on, Morris.
Stay with me.

288
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,281
Come on.

289
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,028
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, go get him.

290
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,681
They're dead.
All of them.

291
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,809
Oh, my God, Weiss.

292
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,806
If I told the truth,
this might not have happened.

293
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,975
What are you talking about?

294
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,606
I've never been here before.

295
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,229
The dream I had...
I just...

296
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,530
I needed to regain
the CIA's trust.

297
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,657
And now the team's dead.

298
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,000
Syd, this operation was on
whether you came or not.

299
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,086
And if you hadn't,
I'd be dead, too.

300
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,164
I don't know what to do.
I...

301
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,878
Everything's wrong.
Everything is upside down.

302
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,087
- We got to get home.
- I can't go back!

303
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,097
Robert Lindsey hates my father.
He doesn't trust me.

304
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,847
He wanted results from this.
He wanted the chip.

305
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,810
If I go back,
he'll pull my clearance.

306
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,387
I'll never be able
to help my father.

307
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,564
What are you thinking?

308
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,145
This was obviously an ambush.

309
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,356
Those gunmen work
for The Covenant.

310
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,652
The one who was gonna kill you,
I saw his face.

311
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:06,496
If I can make a positive I.D.,
that could lead to the chip.

312
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,043
- Leverage.
- To do what?

313
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,666
To get my father out of custody.

314
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,540
To recover what was stolen
from the CIA.

315
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,504
To make sure these men
didn't die for nothing.

316
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,970
I'm gonna need a contact.

317
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,628
A freelancer, not with the CIA.

318
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,297
Someone with resources.

319
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,062
All my names are two years old.

320
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,553
You're not gonna like
my suggestion.

321
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,444
You should go see Arvin Sloane.

322
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,477
What?

323
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:38,485
Sloane negotiated a pardon
after your death.

324
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,244
He's now a consultant
for the CIA.

325
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:45,111
Yeah, he now runs a world health
organisation in Zurich.

326
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,033
Omnifam.

327
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,454
Listen to me.
We never had this conversation.

328
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,208
After the gunfight,
I disappeared.

329
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,633
- You never saw me again.
- So what are you gonna do?

330
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,980
Excuse me.
Miss?

331
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,227
Miss, you can't go in there!

332
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,918
It's okay.
We're fine.

333
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,931
Hello, Sydney.

334
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,143
There's a group
the CIA has targeted.

335
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,183
They call themselves
The Covenant.

336
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:55,310
They've stolen something
I need to get back.

337
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,356
I've made a visual I.D.
of one of their members.

338
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,447
I need to put a name
to his face.

339
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,869
You're gonna help me find him.

340
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:09,366
You must be in real trouble
to come to me for assistance.

341
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,928
His name is Gordei Volkov.

342
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:34,270
He's a former Russian MVD,
a high-class hit man.

343
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,895
You just happen to have
his file sitting on your desk?

344
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:40,436
I had it ready because
I was expecting you.

345
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,074
Sydney, I know you've gone rogue

346
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,863
and that your father
is being held in solitary.

347
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,910
And based
on my experience with you,

348
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,570
I would say you're looking
for a way to win his freedom.

349
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,623
Am I right?

350
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,085
Sydney, just try and remember

351
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:02,293
the bond that we had
between us, you and I.

352
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,508
I loved you like a daughter.

353
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,719
I loved you.

354
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,800
And even you would admit
there were times...

355
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,220
I would see it in your eyes.

356
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,180
You looked at me
like I was your...

357
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,815
Where have I been
the last two years?

358
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,811
I know it was you!
What did you do to me?

359
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,276
- Do you believe in redemption?
- Not for you, no.

360
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:27,445
We've helped to feed over 3 1/2
million children worldwide.

361
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,113
We do research.

362
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,161
Our work on cancer
has the potential

363
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,074
to save millions of lives,
Sydney.

364
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,950
So much has changed
since you've been gone.

365
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,425
Remember the Rambaldi device?

366
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,967
A machine designed
500 years ago by a prophet.

367
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:59,143
All I did was bring the pieces
together and have it assembled.

368
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,858
And when I turned it on,

369
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:04,395
it delivered a message,
as I suspected it would.

370
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,398
I wasn't prepared
for what it said.

371
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,779
The message was just one word,
one simple word.

372
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,783
"Peace."

373
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,828
The epiphany I had
at that moment...

374
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,126
Suddenly I saw
all the mistakes I made,

375
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:26,421
the pain that I had inflicted on
the world, the people I loved.

376
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:30,723
So I chose right then and there
to give information to the CIA,

377
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,681
with which they were able
to dismantle

378
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,970
over two dozen terrorist cells.

379
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,229
I don't know how you convinced
the CIA that you're trustworthy.

380
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,226
Why don't you check my files?

381
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,691
I know you too well.

382
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,105
I don't buy any of it.

383
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:39,248
I tried to reach
over two dozen contacts.

384
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,208
You're the only one
still active.

385
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:42,836
Thank you for coming.

386
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,795
Of course.

387
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,836
Forgive me if I look
shocking to you,

388
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,918
but I was believing
you were dead.

389
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:53,012
I was, but now I'm not.

390
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,221
This is why I love our business.

391
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,767
I need some information.

392
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,180
I hope I can help you.

393
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,974
Gordei Volkov.

394
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,770
I just got a call
from the D.O.J.

395
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,650
You had Sydney Bristow listed
as an enemy of the state?

396
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,777
Mr. Dixon, your operative ran.
Sydney Bristow is a fugitive.

397
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,359
This is why I did not
want to send her out.

398
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,162
Given her condition,
we should be helping her.

399
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,742
I hate to pull rank,
but the Department of Justice

400
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,956
is my jurisdiction,
blindly trusting Sydney...

401
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,285
I never suggested
we blindly trust anyone,

402
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,206
but classifying her in this way
makes her a target.

403
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,293
Then make a suggestion.

404
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:31,249
I suggest that we use
our resources to locate her.

405
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,551
Oh, she'll be located.

406
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,545
I want her back
in this office alive.

407
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,016
Volkov has a meeting scheduled
for tomorrow night in Prague.

408
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,764
I have the address.

409
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,098
He's supposed to be
delivering something.

410
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,433
What it is, I do not know.

411
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,152
Perhaps it is your thing.

412
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,518
Do you know what he drives?

413
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,991
A sedan, armoured, of course,
with a protective detail.

414
00:33:55,076 --> 00:34:00,533
Sydney, if you want to stop
that car, you will need backup.

415
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,082
No, I don't.

416
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,536
But I will need clothes.

417
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,602
I have the plans for the drone.

418
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,852
If you want them back,

419
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,567
get the NSC to release
my father immediately.

420
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,492
Excuse me. I won't be
blackmailed by a fugitive.

421
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:27,076
Did you really think you could
come in here and threaten me?

422
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,203
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?

423
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,335
I want it in writing that today
Jack Bristow is to be released.

424
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,665
Mr. Dixon, talk to her.

425
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,414
I'm addressing you, Mr. Lindsey.

426
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,962
I want that "get out of gaol
free" card for my father,

427
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,046
or these are gone.

428
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,333
This is ridiculous.

429
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,716
Mr. Dixon, please provide
Mr. Lindsey with a pen.

430
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,557
I got my own pen, and there's
not a chance I'm using it.

431
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,349
It's your call.
5...

432
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,059
- This is insane.
- 4...

433
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,769
Mr. Lindsey, she will
destroy those plans.

434
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,105
3...2...

435
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,057
1.

436
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,942
Fine.

437
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,616
Thank you.

438
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,531
B-R-l-S-T-O-W.

439
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,407
I know how to spell your name.

440
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,226
I came by to see how you were.

441
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,491
Are you kidding me?

442
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:47,449
No, I just wanted to
make sure you're...

443
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,157
You didn't come here
to see how I am.

444
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,450
You came to see how you are,
because you know what you did.

445
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,949
You want to make sure
you're okay.

446
00:38:56,878 --> 00:39:00,247
I buried you.
Consider that for one second...

447
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,463
Don't use rational thought
as a defence with me,

448
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,421
not after all you and I
have seen.

449
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,884
Vaughn, you and I live
and breathe madness

450
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:10,005
every day on the job.

451
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,634
There is no rational thought.

452
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,980
I can't pretend to have
a conversation

453
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,096
about anything else with you.

454
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,065
What it comes down to is faith.

455
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,108
What I was hoping
you would say is,

456
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:24,235
"I gave up on us.
I lost faith."

457
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:28,190
But what you came here for
was closure,

458
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:33,361
and there is not a chance
you are getting that from me.

459
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,202
I'm not gonna say I understand.

460
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,333
I'm not gonna sympathise
with you

461
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,579
and tell you how hard
it must be for you.

462
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,958
But you want to know how I am?
I am horrible.

463
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,925
Vaughn, I am ripped apart.

464
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:55,933
And not because I lost you,
but because if it had been me,

465
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:58,346
I would have waited.

466
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,898
I would have found the truth.

467
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,653
I wouldn't have given up on you.

468
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:15,118
And now I realise
what an absolute waste

469
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,282
that would have been.

470
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:57,987
Thank you.

471
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,255
There's something
I need to show you.

472
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:13,513
Not here.

473
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,966
Almost a year
after your apparent death,

474
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,349
I was on an operation.

475
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:26,727
One of the men I was tracking
was this man, Andrian Lazarey.

476
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,528
Russian diplomat.

477
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:31,104
I've never seen him before.

478
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,320
This was from a hidden camera
that I placed.

479
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:54,294
This is how I knew
you were alive.

480
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,805
You don't recall that man
at all?

481
00:41:58,518 --> 00:41:59,846
No.

482
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,155
No!
