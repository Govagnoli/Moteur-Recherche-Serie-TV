1
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:07,423
I was pleased to get your note.

2
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,930
This party looks insufferable.

3
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:17,802
I would prefer not to spend the little time we have together with idle banter.

4
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:22,779
Well, then...

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,416
what do you suggest?

6
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,352
A dance.

7
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,162
You broke my heart, Irina.

8
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,009
That was another lifetime.

9
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,891
I won't do it again.

10
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,654
Good to know.

11
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,850
This has been lovely, but I should go back.

12
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,170
Tell me, Irina.

13
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,740
How did it feel giving the order?

14
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,977
Was it difficult, or...

15
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,309
were you able to remain cold, indifferent?

16
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,607
Were you amused?

17
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,160
Jack, this is cryptic, even for you.

18
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,773
Then let me be clear.

19
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:00,513
How did it feel to pay a man

20
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:04,858
to kill your own daughter?

21
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,047
You weren't supposed to find out.

22
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:16,108
You didn't feel a thing, did you?

23
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:20,777
How is that possible?

24
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:25,698
Were Sydney and I nothing to you, merely strategic alliances

25
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:31,117
to be disposed of once we'd outlived our usefulness?

26
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,531
After all we've been through, Irina,

27
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,179
I deserve an explanation.

28
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,371
Why?

29
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,291
I need a reason.

30
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,761
Because it had to be done.

31
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:54,813
Jack.

32
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,739
Damn you.

33
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:30,895
How's Dixon?

34
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,697
- Stable.
- Has his story changed?

35
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,119
No, he still swears he saw her,

36
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,594
but the amount of blood he lost, he must be delusional.

37
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:38,876
I would have thought you'd place more trust in your partner.

38
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,727
- It's impossible.
- We've seen impossible before.

39
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,579
- This is a distraction.
- You don't know that.

40
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,239
Dad, you killed her.

41
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:48,368
I killed a woman I believed to be your mother.

42
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,785
Sound familiar?

43
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,395
You know doubling technology exists. The Helix protocol.

44
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,625
Dad, we're being set up.

45
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:56,702
Elena and Sloane are gone,

46
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,556
and the only person capable of stopping them is dangled right in front of us.

47
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,365
Doesn't that seem a little convenient?

48
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,299
Think about it. This wouldn't be the first time.

49
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,194
Elena manipulated Vaughn into searching for his father.

50
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,529
Look how that turned out. No, they want us to pursue this.

51
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,840
I understand your skepticism, although

52
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:16,893
your unwillingness to even entertain the idea suggests fear.

53
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,162
Fear? Of what?

54
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,349
Perhaps a false hope.

55
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:26,528
Maybe it's easier for you to believe mom's alive

56
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,612
than to live with what you did.

57
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,606
Maybe so.

58
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,593
But the fact remains,

59
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:38,674
as long as Sloane and Elena are out there, we're pursuing every lead.

60
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,995
We have work to do.

61
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,748
- How's Dixon?
- He's lost a lot of blood...

62
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,976
No, sir, we still don't know what their endgame is.

63
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,013
Vaughn, come here and check this out.

64
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,442
Uh, hold on. We may have just gotten something.

65
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,713
DCI. Tell me you just got something.

66
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,162
Well, you know the tapes from the DSR break-in?

67
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,259
I found some data blocks that are still intact. Is that enough for a positive I.D.?

68
00:06:06,353 --> 00:06:07,347
Yeah, that's enough for an I.D.

69
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:07,958
Up top.

70
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:10,144
We're identifying one of Elena Derevko's associates right now.

71
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,042
I'll keep you updated.

72
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,229
I just talked to Langley. They are all over this.

73
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,028
Yeah, you have no idea.

74
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,502
  

75
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,358
  

76
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:23,309
I know we're in crisis mode, but did you ask her?

77
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,072
  

78
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,401
It's not exactly the right time.

79
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,771
When's the right time? What, the night time?

80
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,001
Eric, come on.

81
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:33,570
Look, it's not like you have a ring burning a hole in your --

82
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,467
You have the ring on you right now?

83
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,881
  

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,988
We got it. He's former Covenant. Lucien Nisard.

85
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,554
And he didn't just head up the DSR break-in.

86
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,172
Once we had a name, I ran a series of traces on a cell network in Prague.

87
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,790
Turns out Nisard made phone calls from the same location

88
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,119
at the same time Dixon says he saw Irina.

89
00:06:57,352 --> 00:06:59,447
Of course, tracking him, that's gonna take some time.

90
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:01,922
I need you to log in through Sloane's computer.

91
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,912
Check the Blackwell index.

92
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,362
Wait a minute, the Blackwell index?

93
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,875
Sloane doesn't have that. He gave that over to Langley.

94
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:10,882
Didn't he?

95
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,285
How are you holding up?

96
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,801
I'm trying to stay focused.

97
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:20,790
- By reopening the Bishop files?
- He killed my mother supposedly.

98
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:24,119
If she's alive, then the CIA obviously missed something.

99
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:29,469
Nadia, researching Martin Bishop, it's --

100
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,225
it's  not the most productive use of your time.

101
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:33,877
What do you mean?

102
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,853
You should talk to Jack.

103
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:43,738
Okay.

104
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:49,068
Um, I hope you don't mind me asking, Mr. Bristow, but

105
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,936
when you helped Sloane steal this thing,

106
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:54,976
you didn't realize he was going to switch sides, did you?

107
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,292
I mean, you didn't see it coming?

108
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,478
- No.
- Okay.

109
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:01,093
I was just curious because I didn't think that --

110
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:02,882
W ow.

111
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,094
Look at the people on this thing.

112
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:06,651
Lucien Nisard.

113
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:10,317
I want all aliases, addresses, contacts, vices, weaknesses.

114
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,027
No problem. Just give me a sec.

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,824
I need to speak with you.

116
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,731
Give us a minute, would you?

117
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,106
Sure. Hey.

118
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:23,356
What is it?

119
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,442
My mother's killer -- Martin Bishop --

120
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,193
what is it you haven't told me?

121
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm tired of lies, Jack.

122
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,983
After what my father and Elena have done,

123
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,501
I want the truth.

124
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:38,007
Martin Bishop didn't kill Irina. I did.

125
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,646
I learned Irina had put a contct out on Sydney's life.

126
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,725
I believed she was going to have her killed. I had no other viable option.

127
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,964
I killed Martin Bishop because you told me it was him.

128
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:49,621
Yes.

129
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,097
I learned later that I had been set up by Elena.

130
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,712
Perhaps I was too quick to assume Irina had betrayed me and Sydney again.

131
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,177
Does Sydney know?

132
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:04,894
This is not the time for recriminations. Your mother may be alive.

133
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:08,037
I hope she is. And you should, too.

134
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,926
Syd, something's happened.

135
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,834
What's going on?

136
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,263
There's been some sort of accident.

137
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,642
We don't know the details. Russia isn't saying.

138
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:33,113
But look at the satellite footage.

139
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:34,580
The city -- Sevogda --

140
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:37,014
they're coordinating some sort of military perimeter around it.

141
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,193
- Is it a quarantine?
- No idea.

142
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,680
I just spoke to director Chase.

143
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:49,045
Intelligence on this incident is nonexistent.

144
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,430
Not even our agents within the Kremlin have any inkling as to what's happening.

145
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,760
What is it?

146
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,800
It's from a hacker friend of mine in Moscow.

147
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,535
It's raw footage. You guys should see this.

148
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,142
It's them.

149
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:44,369
The russian government's officially claiming an industrial accident.

150
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:45,637
And they expect that story to last?

151
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,967
Well, conspiracy theories have already been posted on the web.

152
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,010
Terrorist attack, military experiment gone wrong --

153
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,907
Don't forget aliens.

154
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:54,098
I mean, there's lots and lots of speculation about extraterrestrials.

155
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,536
Given what we know, have you been able to put anything together?

156
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,329
You mean Sloane and Elena's endgame?

157
00:10:58,516 --> 00:10:59,224
It's unclear.

158
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,372
But what is obvious is they've activated some sort of ginormous Mueller device.

159
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:07,807
From the footage, I'd say it's at least six blocks in diameter.

160
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,329
Now, the russian government, they're keeping a tight lid on

161
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,614
what's actually happened, but from what's leaking out,

162
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,806
I'd say the citizens of Sevogda, they're going postal.

163
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:19,523
I mean, you know, mass violence, aggression, inability to reason.

164
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:23,146
They must have infected the water supply with the chemical properties of the orchid,

165
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,757
priming the population of the city,

166
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,233
making them susceptible to the effects of the Mueller device.

167
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:31,524
So what you're saying is, a large red ball plus contaminated water

168
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:34,044
equals a city full of homicidal maniacs.

169
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:35,988
That was a sentence I never thought I'd say.

170
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,125
But what's the point?

171
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:39,356
I mean, besides the weirdest terrorist attack of all time?

172
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:40,739
Their purpose remains a mystery.

173
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:43,635
Perhaps Sevogda serves some strategic importance.

174
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:46,062
I'd go with world domination, but that's always my go-to.

175
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,296
Why isn't important. Stopping them is.

176
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:50,109
You've destroyed a Mueller device before?

177
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:56,448
Guys, sorry to interrupt here, but, you know, this thing is beyond toxic.

178
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,707
I mean, and one this size?

179
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,368
Unless it was shut down properly,

180
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:02,564
it would be like draining primary coolant from a nuclear plant times 10 million.

181
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,939
I don't know how to disarm the device safely anyway.

182
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,265
I know someone who might.

183
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,883
Based on the eyewitness account from agent Dixon,

184
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:12,698
Irina Derevko is currently being held prisoner by her sister.

185
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,279
Any ideas on how to find her?

186
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:21,396
Lucien Nisard -- former Covenant member and a own associate of Elena's.

187
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:24,342
Flight records indicate he flew to Ibiza this morning.

188
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:28,282
The sordid details in these files should make it easy to isolate him,

189
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,463
get him to talk.

190
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:31,356
Do whatever it takes.

191
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:34,426
Wheels up in two hours.

192
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:38,188
The usual?

193
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,076
Not with what I'll be wearing.

194
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,154
I had this feeling before.

195
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,565
A sense.

196
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,376
I almost felt like I was going to pass out.

197
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:55,081
I don't know how to describe it, but it was just like dread,

198
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:57,156
like something horrible was happening.

199
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,502
We've been tasked to rescue a woman who killed my father --

200
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:12,163
your  mother, who is supposed to be dead, by the way,

201
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,350
and to disable a giant red ball

202
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,625
floating over a russian city.

203
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,315
Crazier things have happened.

204
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:20,831
That's kinda my point.

205
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:22,342
Syd, without you.

206
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:23,990
I'd be lost.

207
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:28,001
I mean, this world, this job, everything. It would make me insane.

208
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,285
I know.

209
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,638
We're gonna get through this.

210
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,113
How can you be sure?

211
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:41,380
How can I not be? We're still here

212
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,040
Syd...

213
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:48,521
What?

214
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,813
Hey. Sorry to interrupt. You ready to roll?

215
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,348
Yeah.

216
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,252
- All right.
- Thanks.

217
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:02,651
Vaughn?

218
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,148
We should go.

219
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,150
Nadia.

220
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,753
My dad told me he spoke to you.

221
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,701
I was only trying to protect you.

222
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:20,547
And him.

223
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,327
Yes, and him.

224
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:27,147
I should have told you. I'm sorry.

225
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:31,580
It's not important now. You may not believe our mother's alive, but I do.

226
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:33,238
Please find her.

227
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:11,682
Got him.

228
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:13,756
- Where?
- At the bar.

229
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:16,685
That's him.

230
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,155
How you want to play this?

231
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,912
You want to be rough, or you want me to be rough?

232
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,639
- You're always rough.
- No, I'm not.

233
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,320
- Yes, you are.
- That's not true.

234
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,165
Yes, it is.

235
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,646
Are you talking about at home or on ops?

236
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:28,446
Both.

237
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,210
Hey, I'm not complaining.

238
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:34,283
If I'm rough, it's because you like it when --

239
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:36,924
Are we on comms?

240
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:40,218
Yes, you're both on comms right now.

241
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,623
We'll both be rough.

242
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:48,217
Move it.

243
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,425
Water.

244
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,897
Bite me.

245
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,248
- Want me to bite you again?
- Shut up.

246
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:39,944
Bonsoir.

247
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:45,737
You're enjoying yourselves?

248
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,517
He's french.

249
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,576
I like the french. They're tender.

250
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,122
Fine.

251
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,580
Are you just gonna stand there and watch all night, or do you want to get involved?

252
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,859
What exactly did you have in mind?

253
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,009
Check the stalls.

254
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:07,273
Is he going to join us, or just observe?

255
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,694
I think I'll just watch.

256
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,233
Suit yourself.

257
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,419
All this trouble just to rob me?

258
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,809
I would have paid handsomely.

259
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,568
- Transmitting.
- Okay, receiving transmission.

260
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,528
It's encrypted. Standard. Give me a sec.

261
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,268
What do you know about Irina Derevko?

262
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,163
Who?

263
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,927
You'd be surprised what I know about you besides what turns you on.

264
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,161
I know who you've betrayed.

265
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,718
If you don't tell me what you know --

266
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:46,046
You haven't been watching the news, have you?

267
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,476
Bad timing, sweetheart.

268
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,080
It's the end of the world. Or haven't you heard?

269
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:54,984
Blackmail is not as effective as it once was.

270
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,140
Numbers, numbers, numbers. Some past girlfriends. Let's see here.

271
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,001
Wait a minute. No Elena, no Sloane.

272
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,698
Stop there! Sydney, there's a mention of Helix in his files.

273
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:09,859
Tell me what you know about the Helix protocol.

274
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,472
If you know so much about me,

275
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:15,999
you know this isn't so much a threat as it is a treat.

276
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,076
It's too late. You can't stop this.

277
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,058
Okay, okay! Please.

278
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:38,952
The Helix protocol.

279
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:43,155
Elena -- she found it.

280
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,968
Did she use it? Was Irina doubled?

281
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:56,859
Okay, okay, Elena wanted people to believe Irina was dead.

282
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:58,894
A follower --

283
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,412
a follower agreed to do it.

284
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:06,022
Someone volunteered to be murdered?

285
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:10,989
You have no idea how willing we are to do what is necessary

286
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,041
for what is about to come.

287
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:17,198
Is Irina Derevko alive?!

288
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,306
Of course she is.

289
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,647
Sydney and Vaughn learned that Irina was moved yesterday from Prague.

290
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,832
She was taken to a remote location in Guatemala.

291
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,364
- Is she okay?
- We don't know.

292
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:48,500
While Vaughn secures Lucien Nisard for extradition and transport,

293
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,296
you and I are meeting Sydney in country.

294
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,469
You don't seem relieved.

295
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:56,285
Transport's waiting.

296
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,570
Here's a satellite layout of the camp where your mother's being held.

297
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,447
The river will take you within 100 yards of the perimeter.

298
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,781
How exactly will we find her?

299
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,869
See these cold spots?

300
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:29,570
They're  all carrying automatic weapons.

301
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,953
- Except for this one.
- Mom.

302
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,055
It appears she's being held in the north east quadrant of the camp.

303
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,948
Once you retrieve her, I'll be waiting two klicks down river.

304
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,871
It's okay to be nervous.

305
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,447
It's just not about meeting Irina.

306
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,095
It's just this feeling.

307
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:52,289
- Dread? Darkness?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,410
How do you know?

309
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,395
I've been feeling it, too.

310
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:59,670
I never believed in prophecies -- you know, fate --

311
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:02,202
but... now I'm not so sure.

312
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,168
Nadia, is this your gear pack?

313
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:10,853
That's some of Irina's clothes from CIA storage.

314
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,792
I thought she might need them.

315
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:17,968
I want to be the one to tell her who I am.

316
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:19,959
Of course.

317
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:27,708
I'll see you both at the exfil point.

318
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:31,263
Be careful.

319
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,978
This is Phoenix. We've reached the perimeter.

320
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:31,552
Copy that. Proceed.

321
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,328
Phoenix, incoming guard.

322
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:48,905
All clear. Proceed.

323
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,270
Copy that. We're moving in.

324
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:54,403
Up ahead 20 yards there should be a small clearing to your left.

325
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,847
No movement from the guards. You're clear.

326
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:17,680
She's 15 feet straight in front of you.

327
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,286
Over here. This should be it.

328
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:29,336
She's not here.

329
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,821
Phoenix, you're standing right next to her.

330
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,569
There's nobody here. This -- this can't be it.

331
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:37,207
Shh.

332
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:53,574
Okay...

333
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:15,688
Mom?

334
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:28,020
Mom.

335
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:30,882
Mom, I'm here.

336
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,706
S-- Syd.

337
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:36,535
You're gonna be okay.

338
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,386
Sydney.

339
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,259
I knew you'd come.

340
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:13,522
Trip wire!

341
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:32,231
Give me your knife.

342
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:34,050
I can't reach it.

343
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,430
Here, take mine. I'll hold them off.

344
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,045
They're right behind us.

345
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:25,462
Dad.

346
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:50,017
Irina.

347
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,358
Mom, Elena's already begun.

348
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:11,921
Sloane is with her.

349
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,322
Sloane. Of course.

350
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:19,061
The only person as driven as she is.

351
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,743
Though her cruelty runs deeper.

352
00:28:23,677 --> 00:28:26,783
I'm sorry we didn't find you sooner, mom. We didn't know.

353
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,205
What did she do to you?

354
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:44,204
I found a Rambaldi manuscript -- one I knew Elena was looking for.

355
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,777
It's called "il diluvio."

356
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:49,055
The flood.

357
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:52,310
Rambaldi imagined a moment when the world would be cleansed,

358
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,730
when everything would begin anew.

359
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,239
An apocalypse.

360
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,873
When I saw what was in the manuscript,

361
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,045
I had to destroy it.

362
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:02,183
Of course, which is why Elena needed you.

363
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:06,121
She kept me in darkness.

364
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:07,271
I don't know...

365
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,386
where, or how long.

366
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,248
I had barely enough food, water.

367
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:21,174
There came a time I didn't know whether I was alive or dead.

368
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:27,008
She'd release me only for questioning.

369
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,047
Elena was always volatile, quick tempered.

370
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:35,502
I expected her to get angry and kill me.

371
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,692
But she had learned patience.

372
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:56,815
Eventually I was moved to a medical facility and injected with something.

373
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,291
The pain was excruciating.

374
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,907
I'd go into cardiac arrest.

375
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,127
She'd simply stabilize my heartbeat and allow me to rest so I could endure more.

376
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,261
And she did this dozens and dozens of times.

377
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:18,469
I couldn't fight it.

378
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:26,607
I told her everything.

379
00:30:28,017 --> 00:30:30,266
Mom... mom...

380
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:32,553
Sydney...

381
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:40,111
I wish I could spare you from what's about to come,

382
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,103
but I need you to come with me.

383
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,756
I'm with you.

384
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,229
We must go to Sevogda.

385
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,886
Irina, they've activated the Mueller device.

386
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:52,606
The effects are already evident. It's too late for that city.

387
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:54,972
Elena's already there. So is Sloane.

388
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:58,615
If we don't stop them now, they'll move on to another city, and another.

389
00:30:58,632 --> 00:30:59,529
We'll send a team.

390
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:03,055
I helped Elena build the device. I can figure out how to destroy it.

391
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,018
There are no alternatives.

392
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:16,996
All right. I'll tell the pilot to change course.

393
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:23,612
Is there anywhere I can clean up?

394
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:26,688
In the back.

395
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,098
Here. I brought you these.

396
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:40,195
Thank you.

397
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,037
Just some clothes.

398
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:11,459
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Mom.

399
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:28,289
Give me an update.

400
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,637
NRO just sent over the satellite images from Sevogda.

401
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:32,393
There was heavy cloud cover. They couldn't see much.

402
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:33,724
Has Langley got anything from inside?

403
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:35,454
Yeah, DSR has a field team in the city.

404
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:36,312
What'd they find?

405
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,822
We made contact, but their transmission was interrupted.

406
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,652
Langley's trying to reestablish a connection, but so far they're not responding.

407
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,201
- Let me know if I can help.
- Oh, you can. Where's Jack?

408
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:45,766
He's not here.

409
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:48,252
He's acting director on this task force,

410
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:50,833
and right now we're in the middle of a crisis. Where is he?

411
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:54,261
He's heading up a tactical rescue mission in Guatemala.

412
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:57,078
A tactical mission? To rescue whom?

413
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,857
Irina Derevko.

414
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,830
We can expect the military perimeter to be heavily guarded.

415
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,358
Entry to Sevogda will be at best difficult.

416
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,819
Do you have any idea what to expect once we're in there?

417
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:30,630
Is this where the device has been activated?

418
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,407
Yes.

419
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:34,255
Elena and Sloane need to hole up somewhere safe,

420
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:36,605
away from the hazards of the Mueller device.

421
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,164
Bristow.

422
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,965
Perhaps a bunker, a warehouse. Needs to be a fortified location.

423
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:44,949
Yes.

424
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:48,820
Dad.

425
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:52,610
It was our pilot. Our plane is being diverted.

426
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:55,365
Official orders from Langley.

427
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,902
She's working with us. She's not a threat.

428
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,257
Irina Derevko is a fugitive.

429
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:18,717
You got a problem, you can take it to Langley.

430
00:34:19,866 --> 00:34:20,687
I'll see you.

431
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:36,672
Taking my mother into custody was a mistake.

432
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,294
Irina Derevko is an enemy of the state.

433
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,525
My mother helped Elena engineer the device. She can disarm it.

434
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:44,123
She was convicted of espionage, of murdering CIA operatives. Do I need to go on?

435
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,762
We don't have time to debate her record.

436
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:48,909
If this were any other situation, I would say fine, interrogate her,

437
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:52,059
vet her intel. But people are dying, and it's only gonna get worse.

438
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,764
It is under control. The matter is being handled.

439
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:57,051
Really? How? By whom?

440
00:34:57,311 --> 00:35:00,877
The russians are prepping a tactical air strike of Sevogda.

441
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,003
It will be over in a few hours.

442
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:08,650
An air strike, director Chase, will release toxins into the atmosphere.

443
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,830
The results would be catastrophic.

444
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,180
This is what Elena wanted.

445
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:16,565
She anticipated how the government would respond.

446
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:20,667
We need to stall the russians. Let us go in there and shut down the device.

447
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:25,733
I will not trust Irina Derevko.

448
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,111
When you brought me into A.P.O.

449
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:32,438
And placed me under Arvin Sloane's supervision,

450
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,056
you asked me to trust you, and I did.

451
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:36,798
My mind is made up, agent Bristow.

452
00:35:36,877 --> 00:35:38,190
You put Sloane in charge.

453
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:41,903
You gave Sloane full access to the resources of the CIA.

454
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:44,823
And now he is going to do more harm than you can even imagine.

455
00:35:45,224 --> 00:35:47,415
We need to find him and end this,

456
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,331
and the only person who can do that is my mother.

457
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,522
Please, director Chase.

458
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,812
This time you'll have to trust me.

459
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,097
Come with me.

460
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,730
You can accompany us to Sevogda on the condition that if --

461
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:48,130
when we capture Sloane and Elena and deactivate the Mueller device,

462
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:52,416
you will be returned to CIA custody to serve out your sentence.

463
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:54,545
Life in prison.

464
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:56,441
Yes.

465
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:09,798
How's your jaw?

466
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,131
I've been through worse.

467
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:19,608
Jack, I understand why you believed you had to kill me, but the truth is,

468
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,687
if the situation had been reversed...

469
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,604
I would have found another way.

470
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,655
I can't imagine this will give you any comfort,

471
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:32,612
considering what you've been through, but...

472
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,086
the truth is,

473
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:42,069
there wasn't a day that went by that I didn't regret what I did.

474
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:48,540
And about my indiscretion with Sloane --

475
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,031
I can hope you'll accept my apology.

476
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:56,336
Of all the things you've done, that's what you're going to apologize for?

477
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:05,496
You're going to enjoy getting to know Nadia.

478
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,123
She's exceptional.

479
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:13,177
I wonder where she got that from.

480
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:25,399
Let me help you.

481
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,806
I've seen you all my life in my mind.

482
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:38,768
When this is over, maybe we could spend some time.

483
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,392
I'd like that.

484
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:45,271
Yes?

485
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,083
The russians are moving up their timetable.

486
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:48,977
I've tried every channel, but they're resolved.

487
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:51,266
- How long do we have?
- Uh, about four hours.

488
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:54,135
We have four hours before a tactical strike levels the city.

489
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,498
Syd, come here.

490
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:08,704
- I had it all planned out.
- What?

491
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,732
I was gonna take youto the beach, Santa Barbara.

492
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:14,012
We'd go out for a walk, maybe when the sun was setting.

493
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,855
But now we're here, and I don't know what we're jumping into.

494
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,556
And I may never get another chance to do this again.

495
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:29,901
Sometimes I wake up before you do, and I watch you sleep.

496
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,600
And I'm overwhelmed, because...

497
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:37,812
you're so amazing.

498
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,111
And I don't know why I'm lucky enough to have you in my life,

499
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,059
but you're here with me.

500
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,970
And I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you

501
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:54,064
trying to make you as happy as you make me.

502
00:39:55,556 --> 00:39:56,942
My god, Vaughn.

503
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,789
Sydney Bristow, will you marry me?

504
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:25,275
We're gonna make it out of here.

505
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,373
Is that a yes?

506
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,300
Ask me on the beach.

507
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:39,699
We have 60 seconds.

508
