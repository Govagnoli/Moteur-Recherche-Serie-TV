1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Bonsoir, madame.

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,300
Margeaux Gerard.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,100
She's in position. No sign of Connelly.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,700
He'll reveal himself.

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,200
Madame.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,000
Merci.

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, she's just made the announcement.

8
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,200
I thought you might not come.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
You underestimate me already.

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
Well, I almost didn't come.

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,700
Why is that? Crisis of conscience?

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I thought I might find a buyer willing to pay more.

13
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,700
I am not here for small talk, monsieur Connelly.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,100
Are you selling or no?

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,800
I presume you brought the down payment.

16
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
We may have a possible third party.

17
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,500
Sending you a visual, Outrigger.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Got it. Searching for a match.

19
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,700
So what are your plans

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,900
with your new purchase?

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,800
Monsieur Connelly,

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
where...

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,500
is...

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,700
the chip?

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,600
This is my way out.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
Anything, Outrigger?

27
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Come on.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
No matches, Shotgun.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
With this sale, I can buy a new life --

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
a house on the Mediterranean.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,100
Maybe get a dog.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,700
We're under fire!

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Lâche le couteau!

34
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,800
Freeze!

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
He won't get me.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
My family.

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm not gonna be made an example of.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
I won't have it.

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,200
My wife...

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
my kids.

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,600
Put down the knife.

42
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,900
Marshall ran analysis of the memory chip recovered in Paris.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,600
The downloaded information confirms that a biometric targeting device

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,300
is in fact being developed at a secure facility in Austria.

45
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,000
Attached to a weapons system,

46
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
this device would facilitate the targeting of an individual

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
based solely on a DNA sample or a biometric scan.

48
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Next gen sniper.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,100
Precisely.

50
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
That's why I want you on a plane to Salzburg by nightfall.

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,900
Standard retrieval operation.

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,500
But...

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
the man who killed himself?

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
He was sent there to intercept the sale.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
When the assassin realized that the mission was a failure,

56
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,700
he killed himself to protect his family from his employer.

57
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Sasha Korjev.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
I don't know that name.

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,200
Korjev is a monster.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
He's run arms to rebel forces in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Angola,

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,600
and holds a very tight leash over his men.

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,400
Amongst Korjev's tactics is leveraging the lives of their families.

63
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,500
And it's Korjev's network that's developing the targeting device?

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes, that's correct,

65
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,200
but now that we have confirmation that Korjev is alive,

66
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm tasking Dixon to locate his whereabouts.

67
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
He'll report to CIA proper.

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
They'll send a tactical team to secure his arrest.

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,100
I have a liaison at the angolan chancery in D.C.

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,200
Put Dixon on something else.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,700
You want to take this over?

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,900
For the sake of expediency.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
What am I missing?

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Okay, Jack. It's yours.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,100
Good luck in Salzburg.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,600
You got to bring the team in on this one.

78
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,000
No way. Not until I find out more.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
All right, let's just assume that your father did write those journals --

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Look, I know my father's handwriting, all right?

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,300
Things were referenced.

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,300
Things he couldn't know about. I know it sounds crazy --

83
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
No, the Sox winning the series is crazy.

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,400
What we're talking about doing here is insane.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,800
The nurse who led me to those journals, she disappeared. She was a plant.

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,100
Fine, so someone's trying to manipulate you.

87
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
What if my father's still alive?

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,400
What if it's his way of trying to contact me?

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Okay.

90
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay, but why now?

91
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,200
Why let you and your mother believe that he's been dead for 25 years?

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't know. That's what I'm gonna find out.

93
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,600
Hey.

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
What's this? Who's Frank Murdoch?

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
The code name that you asked me to check in the journals.

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
He's ex-special forces.

97
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,100
Changed his name several times, finally settled on Frank Murdoch.

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,800
He runs a furniture repair shop outside San Diego.

99
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
You didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?

100
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,500
D  ude.

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,000
Nadia?

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Hey.

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,800
Thanks.

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,800
The angolan chancery in D.C. Hmm.

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Don't you think that's a bit thin, Jack?

106
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,300
You should have brought this to me first.

107
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,500
The details of Sasha Korjev's mission are classified.

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,700
As far as anyone else is concerned,

109
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
the assignment is merely to tag the location.

110
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,900
The   CIA wants him assassinated.

111
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,300
Which is why I thought it unfair to burden you with this.

112
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,700
Dixon has the necessary experience.

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,400
With Dixon it would have to be a distance hit.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
I'll be able to get close to Korjev.

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,800
Oh, I'm aware of that.

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,200
And frankly, that concerns me.

117
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll be fine.

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,100
Korjev should have been eliminated years ago...

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,200
when I had the chance.

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,800
Man, look at you. Back from the dead.

121
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,700
Hello, Jimmy.

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,700
You look awful.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,400
I keep telling myself -- green vegetables.

124
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Got to eat more of them.

125
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,300
But, uh, you know how that is.

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,900
So, uh, Jack, you come bearing gifts?

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Only the best.

128
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,300
This -- this was hard to find.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Is this, uh...

130
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,400
I thought that it was just a rumor.

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Ah! Ha ha. Jack...

132
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
Uh, what do you want?

133
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
- Information.
- Anything.

134
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,100
The protocol for contacting Sasha Korjev.

135
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Um... come on, Jack. You know I can't.

136
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
I'm disappointed, Jimmy.

137
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,500
I thought you were a true connoisseur.

138
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,600
Seriously, man, that's just not right.

139
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,400
Jack! Uh, please.

140
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,400
Korjev finds out it was me...

141
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,600
My life may not be worth much.

142
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,800
Wh-whatever.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Still --

144
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Okay.

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll, uh...

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
I'll lay it out for you.

147
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,500
One small step for Mitchell Flinkman,

148
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
one giant leap for mankind.

149
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,800
Look at those legs.

150
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
He's edible. He's delicious.

151
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,300
I've taken many a chomp.

152
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,200
Add a little salt and pepper.

153
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,600
He's the best. Makes it all worth it.

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,300
Sorry. Speaking of which -- Salzburg.

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,900
Now, according to the memory chip,

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,100
Korjev's storing the targeting system in the sub-basement

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
of a discotheque at he owns called the Club Felice,

158
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,900
which officially begs the question, what is it with these guys and nightclubs?

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Korjev's regional security chief is a Jeremiah Gauster.

160
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Gauster has instituted a security protocol based on access cards.

161
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
You'll need a level 3 clearance to enter the belly of the building.

162
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,000
Since the access card hardware is annoyingly difficult to duplicate,

163
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,700
you'll need to steal one from one of the nightclub employees.

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
Not bad.

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Definitely in the ballpark.

166
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,600
Oh, my gosh, thank you for being an american.

167
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,200
I don't think I could bear mangling the language in front of one more local.

168
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,400
Shouldn't feel bad.

169
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,200
These people like to be offended. It's their comfort zone.

170
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
Let me guess. Upstate New York.

171
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah. Yeah, Rochester.

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,000
How'd you know that?

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
I went to Buffalo state. Undergrad.

174
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,400
Come on. Go Bengals.

175
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,800
Don't even say that. It makes me want to cry. God, I miss it so much.

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
This time of year, me and my girlfriends should be grabbing

177
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,600
two beef on weck and a six-pack, you know --

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Oh, look at me -- root from the nosebleeds.

179
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,000
There's nothing like roast beef and pilsner in 30-degree weather,

180
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
you know what I mean?

181
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,400
Yeah.

182
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Yeah, I do.

183
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Sam!

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,800
That's me.

185
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,500
Sam.

186
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,500
Sorry I can't help you with your drink.

187
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Barback.

188
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,500
The good thing/bad thing about living in Austria --

189
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,100
smoking's not prohibited.

190
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Ergo, you've just developed a smoking habit.

191
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,100
No, thanks.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
Good answer. Just checking.

193
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,400
It is actually a mag strip encoder.

194
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Just slide it through here like so.

195
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
It will analyze the access control algorithms,

196
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,600
extrapolate the clearances,

197
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,200
and then reprogram the card to give you full access.

198
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
- Hey.
- Sam.

199
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
- Do you need a light?
- No.

200
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,100
Thank   you.

201
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,300
I was just looking.

202
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,100
Didn't mean to scare you.

203
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,700
Whoops. Duh. Found it.

204
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,900
Um, so, listen. Uh...

205
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,000
I never do this. Really.

206
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,300
But, um, I've been here for six months,

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,600
and, uh, I don't really know anybody.

208
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,500
At least not anybody who knows about beef on weck, so...

209
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
That smile and those dimples are

210
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,200
pretty much the greatest thing I've ever seen, so

211
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,600
I thought if I didn't come over --

212
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
I have a boyfriend.

213
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,400
Right. No, right. Of course you do.

214
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,300
But thank you.

215
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,100
Guy's gotta try.

216
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Where's the bathroom?

217
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,300
It's, uh, just -- just --

218
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,300
Merlin?

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,500
Merlin?

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,700
Okay, I got you, Phoenix.

221
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Heading in.

222
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,100
No one's supposed to be down there.

223
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
Run a sweep on section Delta.

224
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,000
Pull up all the employee access records.

225
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,400
Let's find out who's down there.

226
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,400
What do you see?

227
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Workstations cleared.

228
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,900
Hang on.

229
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,800
Status report, operation Hawkeye, dated... today.

230
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Open it up.

231
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Nothing.

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,900
The report's embedded.

233
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
"Transport protocol enacted. Delivery on schedule."

234
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,100
They moved the targeting device.

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
"Scheduled to leave the country at 0600 hours."

236
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay.

237
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,100
Let's see. Checking airfields and shipping yards.

238
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,100
"Installation complete. Status -- field ready."

239
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,800
My god.

240
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,200
It's already weaponized.

241
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Syd?

242
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,200
Syd? Syd, are you okay?

243
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,600
Operation Hawkeye -- where's it being shipped out of?

244
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,200
- Tell me.
- No.

245
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Sam Houser.

246
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,600
Breach initiated by Sam Houser. Club level employee.

247
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
All units, locate and detain him.

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Wasn't a yes or no question.

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,900
The name of the shipping yard.

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
Delongpre shipping.

251
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Syd, are you okay?

252
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,500
We're going in.

253
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,300
Let's get him.

254
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm okay.

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
Be careful, okay?

256
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,600
What do you have?

257
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
Houser, Samuel David.

258
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
Living for a half a year in Austria on a student visa.

259
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,000
Odd jobs, owes money on some overdue movie rentals.

260
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,900
Other than that, he's just a guy.

261
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,400
Hey.

262
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's get out of here.

263
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Uh, but you said you had a boyfriend, and I thought --

264
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,400
A girl can change her mind, right?

265
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,800
Uh, I don't get off for like another hour,

266
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,700
but you could wait for me at the bar or I --

267
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,200
Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm.

268
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,000
If you don't leave with me right now, you will regret it.

269
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,200
All right, well, we could slip out the back door.

270
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,900
You took the words right out of my mouth.

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
Go check over there.

272
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,200
Delongpre shipping is 30 miles outside of Salzburg.

273
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,100
I have an in-country contact.

274
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Use him. Have him supply you for the mission.

275
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,700
We need to secure the weapon before it leaves port.

276
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,000
If we cross over to Filton, I know a great wine bar.

277
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry. I'm on the phone with my sister.

278
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Where's the phone?

279
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
We have another situation. A civilian.

280
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Korjev's team tagged him as my accomplice. I can't leave him.

281
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,400
Pass him off to your contact.

282
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,800
We'll have him reestablished stateside by the weekend.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
That cell is insane.

284
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
The guy at the store told me mine was the smallest,

285
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
but I knew he was jobbing me.

286
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,900
Sam?

287
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah?

288
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,600
There's something I have to tell you.

289
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,400
You're having second thoughts.

290
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,300
It's not about that.

291
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
If it's about your boyfriend, let me just say --

292
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,900
Forget about the boyfriend.

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,900
Well, maybe we could just go back to my place and talk then.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,300
It would be nice to have a normal conversation,

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,100
if you don't mind a mess.

296
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
- Sam.
- Yeah.

297
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,900
You can never go back to your place.

298
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,300
- What?
- Listen to me.

299
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,900
Your bosses at the club are bad men.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I   was there tonight to stop them from doing a bad thing.

301
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
Wait a minute. I'm --

302
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I needed your access card, and I took it.

303
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
And now they think we work together.

304
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,200
Work together?

305
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
What about beef on --

306
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
Who the hell are you?

307
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,800
I need you to trust me right now.

308
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh, is that what you need?

309
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,500
Okay, that's good, because

310
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,400
I got to get back to work so I can get away from the mind games.

311
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,200
Wait.

312
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,700
If you go back there, they will kill you.

313
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,400
You're serious?

314
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
But if you stick with me, I promise I'll protect you.

315
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,700
We have ways of handling these situations.

316
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,900
Who's "we"?

317
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,300
I can't tell you that.

318
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Hold on. You've already lied to me once.

319
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,000
So how do I know that you're not one of the bad guys?

320
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,600
If I was one of the bad guys,

321
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,400
you'd already be dead.

322
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,500
Thanks, Joe.

323
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,500
Hi. I'm looking for someone. Frank Murdoch. Do you know him?

324
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Nope.

325
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Never heard of him.

326
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Well, this shop's registered to his name.

327
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
What are you, a cop?

328
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,800
No, it's a personal matter regarding my father.

329
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Tell you what.

330
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,300
If ever you get your memory back,

331
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,300
tell him Michael Vaughn's looking for him.

332
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,600
That's my number. Thanks for your help.

333
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
You're really Bill Vaughn's kid?

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,700
Yeah.

335
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,900
That's your dad in the middle.

336
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
That's me on the right.

337
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,600
Everyone else is dead.

338
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,700
You think he's still alive?

339
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,300
Well, I hope not.

340
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,800
When was the last time you saw him?

341
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
The Falkland conflict.

342
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,300
We were supposed to lead a team of locals to secure a british position.

343
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
Our men were ambushed.

344
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,700
And Bill didn't even flinch.

345
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,100
I broke command, charged in to defend our men,

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,700
and the next thing I know, my legs went numb.

347
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,500
He shot me in the back.

348
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't remember hitting the ground,

349
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
but I remember lying there looking up at him completely paralyzed,

350
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,800
and he just stared down at me, lit a cigarette,

351
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
and walked away.

352
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
That's the last I ever saw him.

353
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,000
I can't believe that's true.

354
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah, well, if he's still alive,

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
I'll give you one piece of advice.

356
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,800
Don't turn your back on him.

357
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,200
Who are you calling?

358
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,500
Oh, right, right, right. Sorry. My bad.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,700
Good evening.

360
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
Phoenix inquiring about a late-night snack.

361
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,200
And how many will we be serving?

362
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,100
Two. One house special, the other will be ordering off the menu.

363
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,900
When will you be joining us?

364
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,300
As soon as possible.

365
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,100
I'll make sure the table is ready.

366
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,200
Thank you.

367
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Let me guess.

368
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
That wasn't a real restaurant.

369
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,900
Hello?

370
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
I'll have them for you shortly.

371
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,500
Good. I assure you, mr. Tauber,

372
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,700
Sasha Korjev will be made aware of your allegiance.

373
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,300
That is all I ask.

374
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm looking for the Rug Merchant.

375
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,000
His shop is sixty kilometers up the Bantu River.

376
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,800
When are they coming?

377
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,300
It should be soon, Sam.

378
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm not stupid, okay?

379
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
I understand what happens in the witness protection program.

380
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,500
I get shipped off to some boring suburb.

381
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,300
They pick a name right out of the episcopalian registry.

382
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,500
I don't get to see my family anymore.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
You think my mother's gonna be able to handle that?

384
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
When I know everything's safe, I'll let her know you're okay.

385
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,100
You know what the real pisser of this whole thing is?

386
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,800
Is I came here to pump some thunder through my veins.

387
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Try to find some inspiration,

388
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,400
maybe take a shot at writing something.

389
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,100
Didn't happen.

390
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Just...

391
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,300
drank a lot of beer.

392
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,200
Here we go.

393
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,800
Agent Bristow. So good to see you again.

394
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Is this the cargo?

395
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
This is Sam. Yeah.

396
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,900
We'll have him whitewashed within the hour.

397
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Come, please. No worries. Your supplies are in the vehicle.

398
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,500
You have a weapon for me?

399
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,500
Of course, my dear.

400
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
But let's get out of the cold first, hmm?

401
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,900
We need to get out of here. We're not safe.

402
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm not going anywhere with you.

403
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,700
Sam, take my hand. We have to go.

404
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,700
Look at what you did to him.

405
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,300
We just got blindsided, and we dealt with it.

406
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,600
That doesn't meanwe give up. It doesn't change who we are.

407
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,300
I'm on your side.

408
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,300
I'm not gonna lie to you, Sam.

409
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,100
I'm not gonna have the supplies I was counting on.

410
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
I can't promise you how this thing is gonna turn out.

411
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,900
You don't have backup?

412
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm it.

413
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,800
I need you to think.

414
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Do you know any back ways to the Delongpre shipping yards?

415
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,200
I mean -- yeah, you could take the metro. Why?

416
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,900
The people who are after us have a weapon they shouldn't have.

417
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,800
I want to take it from them before they use it and people die.

418
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,100
Let's go to the metro.

419
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,600
Hey, hold on.

420
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,100
You do understand that I don't have any skills...

421
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,800
in the physical sense.

422
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,200
It's okay. I got you.

423
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Come on. Come on.

424
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,600
This is your stop.

425
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,900
Remove his hood.

426
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,900
Untie his hands.

427
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,900
Did this man carry identification?

428
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,100
Yes, sir.

429
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,900
And do you know who he is?

430
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,100
Sir, I --

431
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,000
I didn't --

432
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,900
You strike this man, you strike me in the heart. Understand?

433
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,600
Jack, my dear friend.

434
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,400
Hello, Sasha.

435
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I apologize for that scene outside.

436
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
I've always remembered what you taught me --

437
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,700
treat your men like children.

438
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,400
Give them rope to become their own men.

439
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,200
But if they make mistakes,

440
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
hang them with it.

441
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,100
I'd say my lessons have served you well.

442
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I'd ask how you managed to find me, but I know you too well.

443
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,100
You can rest assured, you're well insulated.

444
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,600
I do what is necessary to stay alive.

445
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,300
After all, I don't have you or the CIA to watch my back anymore.

446
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
I must say, I was shocked at how abruptly our association ended.

447
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,400
One day we are working together, arming a rebellion.

448
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,300
The next, you're gone.

449
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
My mandate changed.

450
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,400
Yet here you are.

451
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
Why are you here, Jack?

452
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm entering the private sector.

453
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,200
Now that I'm out from under their watchful eye, I was hoping

454
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
we could talk business.

455
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,900
It would be my honor to work with you.

456
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Excuse me.

457
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,700
Yes?

458
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,800
The delivery of the package is proceeding on schedule.

459
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,900
Keep me posted.

460
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,400
Jack, I want to show you my zoo.

461
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,900
It was a dusty ride.

462
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,800
Of course. Forgive me.

463
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,800
I have an 18-year-old single malt that should remedy that, huh?

464
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,700
Excellent.

465
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Jack, I'd like you to meet my wife.

466
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Lani.

467
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,000
- Pleasure.
- The Jack?

468
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,200
The one.

469
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,400
Then the pleasure is all mine.

470
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
I hope you'll be staying a while.

471
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,700
I'd like to get to know the man my husband talks about.

472
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,100
That's very kind, but I'm not certain how long I can stay.

473
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Well, dinner at least.

474
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,400
I'll see that the staff prepare something wonderful.

475
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,000
Truly, it's so good to finally meet you.

476
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,900
You too.

477
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,800
I need to steal Sasha from you just a moment.

478
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,800
Certainly.

479
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,900
Make yourself comfortable in my office. First door on the right.

480
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,000
Can you tell what it is?

481
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,700
UAV assault chopper.

482
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,900
It's kind of small.

483
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
- They customized it.
- What?

484
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,200
The biometric targeting system -- it's in the chopper.

485
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,700
Once that thing locks onto its target, there's no hiding.

486
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
So that thing kills people?

487
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
- Can you drive this thing?
- Yeah.

488
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,500
Remember whan you said you wanted to pump some thunder into your veins?

489
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,100
You're about to get your chance.

490
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,200
I'll get the weapon.

491
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
You drive the van into the warehouse.

492
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,200
Pick me up in three minutes.

493
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Don't touch that. I'll be in my office.

494
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,700
You can do this, Sam.

495
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Just... stay cool, man.

496
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
- Get in.
- Here. Take this.

497
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,500
Get down! Stay inside!

498
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,400
I missed.

499
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,500
I noticed.

500
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,300
That guy was my boss, and he shot me.

501
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,900
- It doesn't hurt.
- It will soon.

502
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,700
Oh. Oh.

503
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,800
We did it, huh?

504
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
We saved the world.

505
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,800
Something like that.

506
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,300
She's lovely your wife.

507
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,100
Indeed. We just found out -- she's pregnant.

508
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,400
Congratulations.

509
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,500
I'll be honest with you.

510
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
When we first saw the heartbeat, I was scared.

511
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,900
I thought, what kind of a father will I be?

512
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,100
But seeing you here, I'm reminded

513
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,200
of the tools you've given me, the tools of being a man.

514
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,600
I gave you the tools. You chose how to use them.

515
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,700
There was a time, Jack,

516
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,300
when we were both working for the higher purpose

517
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,100
but our goals were not the same.

518
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,300
That became clear when you and your agency decided to abandon me.

519
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I realized on that day how naive I'd been.

520
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
I had no option but to pick myself up,

521
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,200
stay on course,

522
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,400
because that is the man you taught me to be.

523
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,100
I know there are some in your government that see my business as a form of betrayal --

524
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,000
You betrayed me.

525
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,000
Mr Korjev asked not to be distirbed. He'll be out shortly.

526
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
I need a car. I need to go to town.

527
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,100
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,100
When did you get back?

529
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,400
About an hour ago.

530
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Did you find Murdoch?

531
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Nah, I couldn't track him down.

532
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,600
Ready?

533
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,500
We should go.

534
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
We're going to the movies. Want to come?

535
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,400
Oh. No, thanks. Not tonight.

536
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Is it important? We don't have to go.

537
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Oh, no. No, no. You guys go. I'll see you tomorrow.

538
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,800
All right.

539
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

540
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,700
Hey.

541
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
I spoke to my people,

542
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,000
they spoke to people.

543
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
It's safe for you to go back home.

544
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I think I'm done here.

545
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,900
It's time for me to move on.

546
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,600
Must kill you.

547
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Get to do all these crazy things

548
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,600
and see all these amazing places.

549
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,500
You gotta keep it to yourself.

550
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
You know what? It's not so bad.

551
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,500
It gives people like us something in common.

552
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,000
"People like us," huh?

553
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,900
Hey.

554
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,600
I'll see you around the globe.

555
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Goodbye, Sam.

556
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Hey Dad! I heard you located Korjev.

557
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,900
Yes, I did.

558
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,700
Sloane said he was taken in a standoff. Were you there?

559
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,100
I saw it play out.

560
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,400
Heading home?

561
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,800
Yeah, I'm gonna grab some dinner first.

562
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,400
Okay.

563
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,000
- Good night.
- Godd night.

564
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,900
Dad!

565
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,300
I'm kind of hungry myself --

566
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,700
if you wouldn't mind the company.

567
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,300
What about your report?

568
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
It'll keep.

569
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,500
