00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:01,623
Previsouly on Alias...

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:04,685
Hello, Arvin.

3
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:06,686
Hello, Gordon.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,247
So you're my mysterious benefactor.

5
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:12,749
Your security clearance
hasn't been reinstated.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,434
My chances of returning to A.P.O.
are slim.

7
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,185
I need you at A.P.O.

8
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,121
I had to dig through my friends
yesterday

9
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,749
because of Gordon Dean.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,435
If I can help you stop him,
then that's what I need to do.

11
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:39,749
Hey, dad, Fiona wants to know
if I can come over and study for awhile.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,875
Maybe tomorrow night, okay kiddo?

13
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:51,311
I left another message.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,812
Look, you know she's always travelling.

15
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,375
I mean, where is she now, Europe?

16
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:58,126
Yeah, but she usually calls.

17
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,233
Come... that's okay. I got it.

18
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,988
It's probably just, you know,
a circuit breaker.

19
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,111
How much do they know?

20
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:45,363
Not much...

21
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:48,273
that this is a government facility,

22
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,050
that they're here
for their own protection.

23
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,737
- I've ruined their lives.
- That's not true.

24
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:56,425
They can't go home.

25
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:57,714
They can't go back to work.

26
00:01:57,715 --> 00:01:59,685
They can't even say good-bye
to their friends.

27
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,735
Because it's not safe. You know that.

28
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,049
There were taps on their phones.

29
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,112
There was surveillance equipment.

30
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:10,797
Witness protection is the best way
to ensure their safety.

31
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,111
They say I won't even be able
to call them.

32
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,984
How am I supposed to do this alone?

33
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:25,423
You do it because
you don't have a choice...

34
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:30,423
because you want the world to be safe
for the people you love.

35
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,800
I know some people think I'm crazy,
still working like this,

36
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:42,738
but I can't go home and sit there
and just be pregnant.

37
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:47,924
Not when the men who killed Vaughn
are still out there.

38
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:51,110
It's my responsibility to stop them

39
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,237
so this baby can be safe...

40
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,550
so you can be with your family.

41
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:07,237
We're kind of a weird family.

42
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,989
We actually like each other.

43
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,548
Then go in there
and let them see you're okay.

44
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:21,299
That's all they care about.

45
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:26,923
Okay.

46
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,186
My God! Rachel!

47
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,237
I wanted to call. I just... I couldn't.

48
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,987
We were worried
something had happened to you.

49
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:46,050
Something did happen,
and that's why you're here.

50
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,111
Where do I begin?

51
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,799
Okay...

52
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:55,051
Rachel Gibson's family has been moved
to a witness protection program.

53
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,677
We knew that might happen.

54
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,548
I will not hurt Rachel
or anyone else from A.P.O.

55
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,985
It was not part of our agreement.

56
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,361
Our agreement is whatever I say it is.

57
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,111
I'm the one who got you out of prison,
and I can easily put you back.

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,075
Let me say this again.

59
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:12,799
I will not hurt those people.

60
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:16,114
I'm not telling you to...
not yet, at least.

61
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,365
But we both know you'll do
whatever it takes to save your daughter.

62
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:24,616
If that means you have to hurt
a few people along the way, so be it.

63
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,611
- Are we finished?
- Almost.

64
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:31,426
Have you heard of a weapons designer
named Janos Vak?

65
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:32,675
No.

66
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:36,487
We've been after him
for some time. He's disappeared.

67
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:39,988
I want you to use
your resources at A.P.O. and find him.

68
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:46,116
What would your colleagues do
if they knew you answered to me...

69
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,674
that you were betraying them
on a daily basis?

70
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,986
Same thing I hope to do to you someday.

71
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,991
Call me when you find Vak.

72
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,577
Now that Arvin's returned
in the capacity of Assistant Director,

73
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:56,703
I've asked him to read
Rachel Gibson's debriefing.

74
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:57,827
I believe his

75
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,200
unique insights
into a covert organization like The Shed

76
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,138
will be extremely useful to us.

77
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,450
Thank you, Jack.

78
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,453
This is an extremely well insulated
organization.

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,763
Of all the names
mentioned in the debrief,

80
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:13,515
there was only one
that I recognized immediately...

81
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,703
a weapons designer named Janos Vak.

82
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,826
Mr. Vak is a Hungarian national.

83
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:23,140
For the past decade, he has specialized
in designing targeting software.

84
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,578
His present obsession...

85
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,738
he calls it "lasso technology."

86
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,736
D.O.D.'s been worried about this.

87
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,426
It's a software program that would allow

88
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,718
an incoming missile to be

89
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,989
electronically intercepted
and redirected.

90
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,115
Right. Basically,

91
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,301
you could lasso a missile

92
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,111
that was headed
for a military target, say

93
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:41,674
in the Middle East, and then
redirect it to Switzerland, you know?

94
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:43,647
And then the Swiss call,
and they're like,

95
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,114
"Hey, we're neutral, remember?"

96
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,114
Thank you, Marshall.
I think we all understand.

97
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,731
Right. That was just a hypothetical...

98
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,489
Based on Ms. Gibson's statement,

99
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,675
Gordon Dean has been trying
to locate Vak for the past six months.

100
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,603
Arvin has suggested, and I agree,
that if we can find Vak first,

101
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,564
we can then use him as bait
to catch Gordon Dean.

102
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,798
In the past, he has been known
to frequently partner

103
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,411
with an Algerian arms broker.

104
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:08,615
Evidently, they had a meeting
a few months ago.

105
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,423
Nobody has heard from Vak since.

106
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:13,924
The Algerian underworld is particularly
difficult to penetrate.

107
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,237
I think I know someone who can do it.

108
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:18,802
- Renée Rienne.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:25,492
Make contact with her.
See if she can get a lead on Janos Vak.

110
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,903
Sydney, I haven't had a chance
to thank you

111
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:36,549
for the letter of recommendation
you wrote to the tribunal.

112
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,175
I know it helped persuade the judges
regarding my release.

113
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,176
You're welcome.

114
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,109
Look, there's something
I need to confess to you,

115
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,801
and I hope you don't judge me
too harshly for it.

116
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:55,779
Every day, I go to the hospital
to visit Nadia.

117
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,600
I get off at her floor,
talk to the doctors.

118
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:08,279
And yet, I cannot set foot
into her room.

119
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,339
I can't bear to see her hooked up
to all those machines,

120
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,025
knowing that it's my fault.

121
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:23,175
I know you'll do
everything in your power

122
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,776
to find a cure for Nadia.

123
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:26,594
Yes, I will.

124
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,845
I will do whatever it takes
to save my daughter.

126
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,330
Sorry.

127
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:03,456
No, you can use the bag. I'm done.

128
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:06,013
No, I don't really like to work out
around other people.

129
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:08,805
Hey... I could use somebody
to spar with.

130
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,904
I don't really... spar.

131
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,146
I don't either.

132
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,707
Which is why
I could really use your help.

133
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,956
Don't want to get my ass
kicked in the field.

134
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,459
What do you say?

135
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,897
How many fights you been in?

136
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,510
I don't know. Enough.

137
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:27,705
You win?

138
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,583
Of course.

139
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,645
Mostly.

140
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:35,895
Why, what did you hear?

141
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,958
Nothing. I've just never been
in any real fights.

142
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,458
I kind of want to know what to do.

143
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:50,255
Not that. Don't ever do
that spinning kung fu crap.

144
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:51,728
You'll get yourself killed.

145
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,845
Okay, fine. What should I be doing?

146
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,143
All right.

147
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:57,894
For real?

148
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,271
- I fight dirty.
- Dirty?

149
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,329
Go for the eyes, the throat, the nuts.

150
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
The nuts?

151
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:10,555
Cause as much damage, inflict
as much pain as humanly possible.

152
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,268
I don't know if I can do that.

153
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,331
Well, then you shouldn't be here.

154
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm serious! Look,
everybody is taking care of you.

155
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,896
If they can't depend on you...

156
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,772
just go pack up your playthings!
Go home to mom and...

157
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:33,707
That was better.

158
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,271
I want to see more of that.

159
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,393
Tom Grace.

160
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,832
Got it.

161
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,707
Briefing in 15.

162
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,520
Renée located the Algerian arms dealer.

163
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:58,644
The lasso technology
is no longer a rumor.

164
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:02,519
Janos Vak designed a program
to intercept and redirect missiles.

165
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,768
According to the arms dealer,
three months ago,

166
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,330
Vak met with a Chinese official
who bought the new weapon.

167
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,081
Do we know where Vak is now?

168
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:12,185
No one's seen him since the meet.
He's just dropped off the planet.

169
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,513
Which is why we're going
to pursue the Chinese official.

170
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,834
His name is General Li Yum Sung,

171
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,458
and he's staying
at the Chinese consulate in Bombay.

172
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,208
The General is marrying
an Indian woman next month.

173
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,893
The consulate is throwing them
an engagement party.

174
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,083
I've checked with our contact
in Indian intelligence.

175
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:28,396
He says the General
keeps an encrypted copy

176
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,456
of his contacts and schedule
in a safe in his room.

177
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,144
They should lead us to Vak.

178
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,574
Sydney, you're to break
into the General's safe

179
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:36,685
and acquire the intel.

180
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,522
Agents Dixon and Grace
will offer support.

181
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:42,583
Marshall and Miss Gibson
will run op tech. Good luck.

182
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:21,710
The General is still upstairs.

183
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,411
Doesn't the man know it's kind of hard
to break into his safe

184
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,085
if he's sitting right in front of it?

185
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,157
I don't think he's coming down tonight.

186
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:33,658
See that woman over there?
That's the General's fiancée.

187
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,222
She looks pretty unhappy.

188
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,406
I think the General
might be having second thoughts.

189
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,344
- Hey, Marshall?
- Go, Phoenix.

190
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,844
What's going on upstairs?

191
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,845
Wait for uno momento, por favor.

192
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,535
Okay, looks like all's quiet.

193
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:52,135
Just one soldier outside
the General's door,

194
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:53,406
very sharply dressed.

195
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,721
We've got to go about this
a different way.

196
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,348
Remember the prince in Bahrein?

197
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:58,723
The guy with the harem?

198
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:01,020
- Let's try and do that.
- What are you talking about?

199
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:02,031
I'll need your watch.

200
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,969
It's okay, I'm not really here...

201
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:07,223
Just follow my lead.

202
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,645
I am sorry, but I cannot allow you
to marry the other man.

203
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,873
You belong to me.

204
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:29,086
It is time we told the world the truth.

205
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,658
Our love cannot be denied.

206
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:40,717
Marry me, Naomika.

207
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,705
Let us share our joy with everyone!

208
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:47,245
Let go of me!

209
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:49,244
I know that you love me!

210
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:51,807
Uh, the lady said let her go.

211
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,433
- What?
- Let her go! Hey!

212
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,430
We are destined for each other, Naomika.

213
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,481
Tell them! Tell them!

214
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,318
Ours is a forbidden love!

215
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,115
She improvised that whole thing.

216
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,540
Yeah, who'd think you could turn
a pregnancy into an alias?

217
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,581
And in chinese.

218
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:57,275
Listen, I've had to do
little alias magic myself

219
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:58,869
to save the day a few times.

220
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,370
- Do you know what a spork is?
- They're letting her in.

221
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:14,772
I just need more time.

222
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,461
I just...

223
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,958
need more time.

224
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:20,524
It's okay.

225
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:22,398
It's still early.

226
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,146
Okay, Marshall, I'm ready.

227
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,147
Okay...

228
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,957
You know what?
I'm not getting a reading, Phoenix.

229
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,055
There must be too much shielding
in the building.

230
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,710
Are you saying you can't do it?

231
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,211
Well, no. Of course not.

232
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,956
All right, Phoenix,
this is gonna take a sec.

233
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:48,988
I need to set a relay

234
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,085
closer to the building
so I can boost your signal.

235
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,461
- Copy that.
- Got it.

236
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:55,708
I can do it. You'll need to be here
when it's activated.

237
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,271
It'll be faster this way.

238
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,186
Thanks.

239
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,046
Okay.

240
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,335
Thank you for your help.

241
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,523
He's not a bad guy.
He's just had his heart broken.

242
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,712
I'll get him home.

243
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,527
Thanks.

244
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:17,276
Heads up, Phoenix.
Fiancée's moving your way.

245
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,839
Marshall, what's the E.T.A.?

246
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:22,024
Oracle, what's your status?

247
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,400
- Relay's set.
- Okay.

248
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:26,464
Hang on a sec.

249
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,090
Great. We're at five by five. Way to go.

250
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:45,399
I've got it. I'm on my way.

251
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:02,985
I'm busted.

252
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:04,478
East side of the building.

253
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,479
Wait for Sydney.

254
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,430
Get down.

255
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,414
You okay?

256
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,165
If by okay you mean freaked
and embarrassed, then yeah, I'm great.

257
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,043
Finding everything okay?

258
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:24,664
Yes, thank you.
Oh, I'd like to get this, please.

259
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,665
Okay, great.

260
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,915
We get so many dads
in the store these days.

261
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:35,352
I don't think my husband
ever bought so much as a diaper.

262
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:36,353
Yeah.

263
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,730
My dad wasn't exactly hands-on either.

264
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,666
What about your husband?
Is he doing his part?

265
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:46,103
He's been great.

266
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,791
Wishes he could do more.

267
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,166
I love hearing that.

268
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,044
Times sure have changed.

269
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,044
Yeah.

270
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:05,372
Hello.

271
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,156
Hello.

272
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:10,843
You altered a suit for me.
Here's the ticket.

273
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,605
Oh, yes, why don't you wait in the back,
and I'll bring it to you?

274
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:17,721
Thank you.

275
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,816
You should've told me
about the Chinese Consulate

276
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:31,905
before your team went in.

277
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:34,468
There was no reason
to complicate things.

278
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:38,782
Anyway, I assumed that you wanted A.P.O.
to do the heavy lifting.

279
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,845
You don't get to assume anything.

280
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:43,968
Did you locate Janos Vak?

281
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:45,906
The intel was encrypted.

282
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,094
I'll have an answer for you
before the end of the day.

283
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,345
Call me when you do.

284
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:04,970
I don't have time to explain.
Yeah, she's here now, thank you.

285
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,531
- Hey.
- Hey.

286
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:08,846
We found Vak.

287
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,781
He's secluded on an oil platform
in the South China Sea

288
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:14,219
while he finishes his software program.

289
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,846
Marshall's still pinpointing
the exact coordinates.

290
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,534
Great. How are we going in?

291
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,344
We're not.

292
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:22,161
We're backup.

293
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,032
- Who's my dad sending?
- Rachel Gibson.

294
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:28,472
Rachel?

295
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:30,969
He's sending her in solo?

296
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:34,595
Why would he do that?

297
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:37,222
The Chinese government has suspended

298
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,155
all shore leave for the men
working on the platform.

299
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:41,970
No one gets on or off until Vak is done.

300
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:47,071
The sole exception is that
every other weekend, Vak is allowed...

301
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,782
female companionship.

302
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:54,723
We can't send her in alone.

303
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,361
Rachel's incredibly bright.
You've seen it yourself.

304
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,594
You saw what happened
on our last mission. She ran.

305
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:01,720
The mission was a success, Sydney.

306
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:05,344
You may not want to hear it,
but this isn't an assignment you can do.

307
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:07,095
You know it as well as I do.

308
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:10,472
She's not ready.

309
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,032
At least, delay the mission a few weeks.
Just give her time to train.

310
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,047
That's not an option.

311
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,938
If we're going to use Vak and his weapon
as bait to catch Gordon Dean,

312
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,222
we can't afford to wait.

313
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,345
This is no different than
when you were sent back into SD-6.

314
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,535
It's completely different.

315
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,659
I had Vaughn.

316
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,535
And Rachel will have you.

317
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,346
Okay, once you see Vak alone,
you'll need to knock him out, right?

318
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:48,419
You know, I don't mean, you know,
like, rock 'em, sock 'em, knock him out.

319
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,784
It's more of a, um,
actually, here we go.

320
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:53,264
Okay, take a look.
Righ, this looks like a normal lipstick.

321
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,720
It's a very nice shade of red.
I think it would look good...

322
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:58,408
but, anyway,
touch it anywhere on his skin,

323
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,386
it'll knock him out
for at least two hours.

324
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:03,296
By the time he wakes up,
he'll think he had the time of his life.

325
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:05,104
You... you'll be on a chopper
halfway home.

326
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:08,794
Oh, and, also...
I spring-loaded an ice pick into here.

327
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:10,661
You know, just in case.

328
00:23:13,096 --> 00:23:15,983
But you're probably not gonna...
need that.

329
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,911
I mean, I'm sure you'll be...
you'll be fine.

330
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,285
Are you about ready?

331
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:29,971
I've been going to the firing range
every night

332
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:32,534
so that when the time came,
I'd be ready.

333
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,346
Of course, on my first solo mission,

334
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,096
I have to go in unarmed.

335
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:39,847
Rachel...

336
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:43,532
Jack wouldn't send you in
if he didn't have complete faith

337
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,220
in your ability to succeed.

338
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:49,720
I appreciate you saying that,
but I know what everyone is thinking.

339
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,408
I'm the new girl.

340
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,783
I panicked on the last mission.

341
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:59,158
And everybody is asking whether or not
I can do it. And the truth is...

342
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,159
I don't know.

343
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:02,411
I'm terrified.

344
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:07,285
But I'm more terrified of not trying.

345
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:09,565
So...

346
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:15,222
I'm gonna put on my strappy shoes
and my teeny dress, and I'm gonna try.

347
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:17,845
and by this time tomorrow,

348
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,368
we'll know whether I can do it or not.

349
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:40,684
Janos Vak has been found.

350
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:44,372
The details are in here.

351
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:48,619
A.P.O. is send in your former associate
Rachel Gibson.

352
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,308
She's going in solo
to get the weapons design.

353
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:52,514
Gibson?

354
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,658
- Alone?
- Once she acquires it I'll swap it out.

355
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:59,497
I'll get you the real program.

356
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,559
Did he just say they're sending Rachel?

357
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,245
I don't trust Sloane.

358
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,181
We're not gonna wait.

359
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,685
I want you to get the weapon yourself.

360
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,244
Is there a problem?

361
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:29,870
It'll just be strange
if Rachel and I cross paths.

362
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,430
She thought I was her best friend.

363
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:36,681
Look, if we could've convinced her
to play on our side, we would have.

364
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:38,557
But things didn't go that way.

365
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,769
So if I run into her?

366
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:47,872
Show her the professional courtesy
of putting a bullet in her head.

367
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,205
This is a mistake.

368
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,580
I've never done anything like this
with the wig and the dress and...

369
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:18,142
What am I gonna say to him?

370
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:20,391
Well, it isn't what you'd say.

371
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:24,267
Remember, you're playing a character.
It's what she would say.

372
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:26,541
Who was the sluttiest girl
in your high school?

373
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,594
Mandy Camarillo.

374
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:30,392
You didn't have to think very hard
on that one.

375
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:32,580
Tramp stole my date at junior prom.

376
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:35,540
She had red hair and a pierced tongue.

377
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,954
Okay, so you're Mandy Camarillo,

378
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,644
and Janos Vak is your prom date.

379
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:43,642
Just say what she'd say.

380
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,895
You're not gonna be alone, Rachel.
Not for a second.

381
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:50,896
I'll be on comms the whole time,

382
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,770
the way Vaughn was for me.

383
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:57,876
It helps a lot...

384
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:00,147
having you.

385
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:03,927
I can do this, right?

386
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,676
Absolutely.

387
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,269
Sydney?

388
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,895
Okay, I'm with you, Rachel,
just breathe.

389
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,272
You're so cute.
They didn't tell me you'd be so cute.

390
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,459
You do speak English, don't you?

391
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,585
I mean, they told me
you would speak english.

392
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,076
Of course, English. I love English.

393
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:33,897
Nice to meet you.

394
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:36,867
I am Janos.

395
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:39,792
Ray-- Mandy.

396
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,377
Raymandy?

397
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:45,710
A beautiful name.

398
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:50,453
So this is where you live, huh?
It's pretty sweet.

399
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,082
Only for a few more days.

400
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,083
My business here is almost done.

401
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,522
You must get very lonely.

402
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,648
Well, yes, which is why
I'm so happy to see you.

403
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:05,961
Perhaps you would be more comfortable
over here on the bed, Raymandy.

404
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,069
No, I'm, uh, I'm good.

405
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,084
Come on, Rachel. What would Mandy do?

406
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,771
Do you know how to make daiquiris?

407
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:15,899
- I have champagne.
- Even better.

408
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Idiot.

409
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:29,237
Uh-oh.

410
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:32,611
- What do you mean, "uh-oh?"
- I dropped my lipstick.

411
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:36,424
Not a problem,
your lips are absolutely perfect

412
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,251
just the way they are.

413
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,117
Don't let him kiss you.
You're the one in charge.

414
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:42,301
Let me show you.

415
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:51,526
Has baby been bad?

416
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,611
This is gonna be too easy, Rachel.

417
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:19,550
Raymandy, you're driving me crazy!

418
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:23,864
Did I say you could talk?

419
00:31:30,862 --> 00:31:32,549
You've been a very bad boy.

420
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:34,049
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:38,113
But you know what?
I'm gonna be honest with you.

422
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:43,672
This whole "baby talk" thing
kinda creeps me out.

423
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:46,235
So I'm just gonna cut to the chase,
okay?

424
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,674
I gotta go.

425
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:06,426
- Downloading now.
- You're doing great.

426
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:32,148
Phoenix, I've got the data.
I destroyed the original.

427
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:34,248
Copy that. Almost home.

428
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,520
Phoenix, I've got a small problem.

429
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,211
There's a dead soldier
and the boat's gone.

430
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:56,274
Copy that. I'm sending in
an emergency extraction. Outrigger?

431
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,899
We heard, Phoenix. We're on our way.

432
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,462
Rendezvous in approximately
five minutes.

433
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:07,042
Did you hear that, Rachel?
You're gonna be fine.

434
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,521
Just make your way to the helideck.

435
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:09,522
Copy that.

436
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:43,334
Surprise.

437
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,525
- My God, you're...
- Not dead?

438
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:48,148
I was gonna say evil.

439
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:50,858
Tell me I'm wrong.

440
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:54,835
Let's just say
we work for different teams.

441
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,025
You knew this whole time.
You were in on it with Dean!

442
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,338
I wanted to tell you.

443
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:02,459
You blew up that building
and you killed all those people.

444
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,960
It wasn't personal. I...

445
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,274
I always liked you.

446
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,664
It was a lie-- everything we did!

447
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:07,689
That's enough!

448
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:10,870
And now you're gonna kill me.

449
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:13,559
That's what Dean wants.

450
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:18,561
You've made it really hard for him
since you left.

451
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:21,496
Like I said--

452
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:24,558
I always liked you.

453
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:28,185
I don't want to kill you.

454
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,243
Just give me Vak's software program

455
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:33,204
and you walk away from this.

456
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,550
Rachel, we can always track Peyton
after she leaves the platform.

457
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:38,870
If you believe she'll let you live,
give her the data.

458
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,370
Your life is more important
than the mission.

459
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,371
Come on, Rachel.

460
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,872
You're in way over your head.

461
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,370
Don't make me shoot you.

462
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:50,433
Give me the disk.

463
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:56,498
Okay.

464
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,062
You've got two seconds. One...

465
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:06,934
Here.

466
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:12,059
You bitch!

467
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:22,874
You should've given me the disk.

468
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,750
You were gonna kill me anyway.

469
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:27,312
Yeah.

470
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:29,935
But I would've felt bad about it.

471
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:33,249
Now it's gonna be fun.

472
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:46,746
Still having fun?

473
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:05,688
You're late.

474
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:07,688
I told you none of my people
were to get hurt.

475
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:10,430
I do what I want, when I want.
Now where is it?

476
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:11,500
You didn't trust me

477
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,310
and you nearly ruined
the entire operation.

478
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,311
- I want the weapon.
- You don't get to have it.

479
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,810
That's my price for your mistake.

480
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:19,811
My mistake?

481
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:23,313
I'm not the one responsible for
100,000 deaths.

482
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:26,375
I'm not the one
dangling on the end of a fish hook.

483
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,238
I'm the one who decides
if the little fish

484
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,624
gets thrown back into the pond,

485
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,935
or if it gets flushed down the toilet.
Am I being clear?

486
00:37:32,936 --> 00:37:35,223
You don't get Vak's weapon.

487
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,189
How's your daughter?

488
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:43,189
Nadia has nothing to do with this.

489
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:44,873
Sure she does.

490
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:51,684
I want a copy of the lasso software
first thing in the morning.

491
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:24,562
Your father's kind of scary.

492
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:26,061
Tell me about it.

493
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,998
But he said we all did good so...

494
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,536
No, you did great.

495
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:33,896
Thanks...

496
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:35,787
for being in my head.

497
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,510
You're welcome.

498
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,382
I know how important that voice can be.

499
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:44,258
Vaughn talked me through
all my early missions with the C.I.A.

500
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:49,258
Sometimes his voice was the only thing
that kept me going.

501
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:51,884
I wish I could've met him.

502
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:56,758
I'll see you tomorrow.

503
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,701
You okay?

504
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,134
Just having some trouble
picking the lock.

505
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,760
My fingers are kinda numb.

506
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:42,885
Look, you're almost home.
Just get inside and plant the bug.

507
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:44,636
That's easy for you to say.

508
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:46,571
It's 20-below out here.
You're nice and warm.

509
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,325
I'll tell you what,
I'll talk to Langley,

510
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,884
see if we can send you
someplace warm next time.

511
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,322
It should have a beach.

512
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,238
Absolutely.

513
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,884
I'll find a bad guy who owns
a really nice beach resort,

514
00:40:56,885 --> 00:41:00,072
and you'll have to go undercover
for like, a month.

515
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,910
You know what?
That sounds pretty dangerous.

516
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:04,450
Maybe we both should go.

517
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:05,769
You'd do that for me?

518
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,918
Hey, we're in this together, right?
