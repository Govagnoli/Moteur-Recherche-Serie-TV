1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,405
  

2
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,951
  

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,537
I'm an officer.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,915
I swore an oath never to betray a state secret.

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,458
You said it was important.

6
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,710
Highest national security. What is it?

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,714
Russia's been developing Black Thorine.

8
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,883
Developing? Researching.

9
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,010
Producing. We've made some.

10
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,556
We've only been able to distill a small amount -- 10 milliliters.

11
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,347
Enough for a single vial.

12
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:01,641
This government will stop at nothing to contain this information.

13
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,235
So why tell me?

14
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,649
Because the vial was stolen.

15
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,485
By whom?

16
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,740
This is the routing number to my superior's bank account.

17
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,160
He's recently come into a great deal of money.

18
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,836
  

19
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,969
  

20
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,639
  

21
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,917
Let's go.

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,098
Sydney.

23
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,809
We didn't expect you back so soon.

24
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,198
- So, Russia was a success?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,621
There's a report waiting for you in the office.

26
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,000
Sydney, he just dropped by. I didn't realize --

27
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:47,835
Get out.

28
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,297
Very well.

29
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,426
I'll walk myself to the door.

30
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,349
I'll see you both tomorrow.

31
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,059
Okay.

32
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,528
He came by. Wanted to talk.

33
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,032
He says he wants a fresh start, to get to know me.

34
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,742
You think that's all he wants?

35
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,910
A little father-daughter bonding?

36
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:22,911
I know how you feel about him --

37
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,329
You can't possibly.

38
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,874
I don't understand.

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,208
You work with him at A.P.O.

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,794
I accepted the job so I could watch him.

41
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:35,132
Don't delude yourself, Nadia, into thinking you can trust that man.

42
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:35,966
Do that,

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,759
and you will end up hating yourself for it.

44
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,178
He's my father.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,471
If you knew what he's done.

46
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,348
Sydney, I know.

47
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,350
I know what he did...

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,311
to you.

49
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,022
What he took from you.

50
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,274
Your best friend.

51
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,276
Your fiancé.

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,491
And knowing that, you still let him into my home?

53
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,248
I'm not naive, Sydney. I'm not deluded.

54
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,629
It's not easy to reconcile the past.

55
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,548
I thought you had.

56
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:25,098
The development of Black Thorine -- that violates how many treaties?

57
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,975
Twelve, to be exact.

58
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,060
Well, there's a reason.

59
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,229
It's a mega-breakthrough in explosives.

60
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,231
It's odorless, undetectable.

61
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,399
I ran a simulation.

62
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,776
Check it out.

63
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,780
Huh?

64
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,532
It leveled an entire city block.

65
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,075
And that's just a little drop of Black Thorine.

66
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,953
Imagine if you had the whole... vi--

67
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,790
it's actually a real depressing take on progress.

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,416
Are we sure there's only one vial?

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,918
The russians are stonewalling.

70
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,212
They refuse to acknowledge the existence of a substance,

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,714
much less admit that they're developing one.

72
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,259
But my sources confirm that they're panicking.

73
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,593
Your sources?

74
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,306
If that vial is their only prototype, as intel appears to corroborate,

75
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,394
its theft has set their classified weapons program back decades.

76
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,646
Would you mind telling us where that intel comes from,

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,400
or are we all supposed to rely on your sources, no questions asked?

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,695
That's a fair question,

79
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,114
but one I'm not inclined to answer

80
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,826
unless you need me to explain the essential nature of confidentiality.

81
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,287
No, I'm all caught up on that, thanks.

82
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,749
What matters is that we recover the vial.

83
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,626
We were able to trace the routing number

84
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,420
the informant gave Vaughn.

85
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:41,383
2 million euros were deposited into the account of colonel Nikolai Voskov.

86
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,845
The money came from this man -- Boris Tambor.

87
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,346
The russian oil magnate?

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,764
Tambor might have made his money in oil,

89
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,225
but he's since diversified into mining, media outlets,

90
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,561
and his latest venture, arms dealing.

91
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,438
Seems Tambor's quite a player.

92
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,773
High-end real estate all over Europe.

93
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,902
He owns a fleet of sports cars -- Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys.

94
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,612
This guy's living my junior high fantasy.

95
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,030
Or my current one.

96
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,199
Tambor keeps his entire operation mobile.

97
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,992
Never stays in one place too long.

98
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,287
Right now he's booked into the San Devotee in Monte Carlo.

99
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,749
He takes a regular seat at the high-stakes poker table every night at 9:00.

100
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,083
That will be your window.

101
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,878
Your mission is to get into Tambor's suite,

102
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,422
find out where he keeps the Black Thorine,

103
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,840
how  he plans to move it.

104
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,718
You leave tonight. Wheels up, 2200.

105
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,208
You want to tell me about it?

106
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,754
Sloane.

107
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,924
He  was in my house.

108
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,844
Last night. To visit Nadia.

109
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,097
I came home. He was sitting in my living room.

110
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,808
Oh.

111
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,104
I thought I could do this --

112
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,439
work for Sloane again, but now...

113
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,902
I don't know, I think I might have been kidding myself.

114
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,075
I dream about Diane.

115
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,038
Which isn't unusual, I've been told,

116
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,416
except for me,

117
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,877
it's almost every night.

118
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,505
These dreams

119
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,632
are always the same.

120
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,012
At some point I get to her,

121
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,264
and I hold her face.

122
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,600
And I can see it in her eyes --

123
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,395
the disappointment in me.

124
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,983
That I couldn't prevent what happened.

125
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,652
Then...

126
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,323
she tells me that she loves me,

127
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,159
that she loves the kids,

128
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,704
and she asks me to do the right thing.

129
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,123
She doesn't ask me to, she tells me to.

130
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,964
And that's how I make peace with Sloane.

131
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,260
I don't put the past away or compartmentalize it.

132
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,970
I transmute it.

133
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,560
I make it the right decision today.

134
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,482
I hope I'm capable of that.

135
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,901
I know you are.

136
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,594
I'm sorry about last night.

137
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,262
It was my fault.

138
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,139
My father's one of the reasons --

139
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,975
You  don't have to explain. I get it.

140
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,563
When our mother came back, she --

141
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,774
she had done her share bad things.

142
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:08,650
I know.

143
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,905
But still, I needed to know her.

144
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,327
I just did.

145
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:17,781
Thanks.

146
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,745
Nice shot.

147
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,744
What's that, Gretchen?

148
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,829
I don't buy you as a Gretchen.

149
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,039
Nein?

150
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,002
Whoa. Uh, okay.

151
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,046
Okay, guys, we have one hour. You all know the drill.

152
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,049
Surveille the room, get in, get out with the intel and the Black Thorine.

153
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,604
Evergreen, maintain position. We're almost there.

154
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,653
Okay, I'm in.

155
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,280
Evergreen, you're clear.

156
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,330
Inserting camera now.

157
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,582
Ready for sound.

158
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,751
Patching audio-visual feeds now.

159
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,545
Copy that.

160
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,257
Okay, I've got a visual on Tambor.

161
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,474
Housekeeping.

162
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,530
Oh, I'm sorry. I ordered a french maid.

163
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,199
Here you go.

164
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,536
The laptop is our first priority. After that, we go for the PDA.

165
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,287
What the hell's going on?

166
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,872
I thought this guy hits the tables every night by 9:00.

167
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:27,789
That's what we know.

168
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,583
Yeah, well, it's 9:06.

169
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,668
Oh, here we go.

170
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,425
What's he doing?

171
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,681
Look at that room.

172
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,849
That's nice.

173
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,392
Check out those digs.

174
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,441
Marshall, what soccer match is that?

175
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,028
Uh, hold on. Let -- sorry, I'm not much of a sports fan.

176
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,446
More of a scrabble club type.

177
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,448
Boggle tournament if I'm feeling dangerous.

178
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,993
Guys, Tambor owns the team.

179
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,120
He's kidding, right?

180
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,413
So he's in for the night.

181
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,040
He checks out first thing tomorrow morning.

182
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,293
If we don't get in there tonight, get the data off that computer, we lose him.

183
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,586
Wait a minute.

184
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,089
I hate that perfume.

185
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,216
It was a weird patchouli smell.

186
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,760
See under the bed? The slingbacks?

187
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,178
Champagne bottles on the nightstand.

188
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,263
Check out the magazines.

189
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,472
Designer purse.

190
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:26,890
It's a shot.

191
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,141
What's a shot? What are you talking about?

192
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,518
I know where to get what we need.

193
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,019
Where's she going?

194
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,229
You mind filling us in?

195
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,690
Tambor's got a girlfriend. She's staying with him.

196
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,816
She's our way in.

197
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,402
We have no intel on that woman. You'll be going in blind, Sydney.

198
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,528
We know enough.

199
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,113
She has gossip rags all over the room,

200
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,531
which means she's fine making a mess,

201
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,949
so we know she's not a one-night stand.

202
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,993
Her shoes cost more than most people's monthly salary,

203
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,579
so she either has money of her own or access to Tambor's.

204
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,456
Either way, empty champagne bottles, her side of the bed.

205
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,708
This girl likes to party.

206
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,627
But her boyfriend would rather stay in and watch TV

207
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,838
their last night in Monaco than hang out with her,

208
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,632
so she's bored. Most likely pissed off.

209
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,134
How do you propose to find her?

210
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,511
Well, she left her handbag. She didn't go far.

211
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,347
In fact, I'm guessing she's hitting the hotel bar right now.

212
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,473
All Nadia and I need to do

213
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,517
is get to her and get her to take us to the room.

214
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,103
- Why are you smiling?
- I don't know.

215
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,608
Where'd you get this stuff?

216
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:17,983
I borrowed them.

217
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,526
You stole it, didn't you?

218
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,695
She stole the stuff.

219
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,864
Nadia, this could jeopardize the entire mission.

220
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,616
Tambor's security team saw you.

221
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,618
If they recognize you as the maid,

222
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,453
they will not hesitate to take action.

223
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,664
With all due respect, no one pays attention to the help.

224
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,125
I promise they won't recognize me.

225
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,394
Patchouli.

226
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,525
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean?

227
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,987
Well, guess what? I'm sick of your pathetic excuses.

228
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,074
He's not coming.

229
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,536
You still have his charge card, right?

230
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,454
Oh, my god.

231
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:13,830
Madame?

232
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,709
- Two. Please.
- D'accord.

233
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,505
Men suck, don't they?

234
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,467
Usually.

235
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:36,019
I  swear to god, I am so not that clumsy.

236
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,147
Don't listen to her. She's incapable of holding her liquor.

237
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,774
Shut up!

238
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,318
Need I remind you of Ibiza?

239
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,195
You and the DJ with the handcuffs?

240
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,739
I'm ignoring you now. Watch.

241
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,951
Just a warning. Just a warning.

242
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,871
My boyfriend? He's kind of a jerk.

243
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,955
Like mine isn't.

244
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,544
Are you just going to stand there?

245
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,171
I'm sorry, miss Bridget.

246
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,798
They call me miss Bridget.

247
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,310
Okay. They're doing it.

248
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,519
They're in the room.

249
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,271
Mr. Sloane, I know how against this you were,

250
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,815
but if Sydney chooses to say "I told you so"...

251
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,358
- She's not out yet.
- That's true,

252
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,778
but they're good. They're really good.

253
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:33,410
I need five minutes to change, and we are leaving.

254
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,330
Make yourselves at home, ladies.

255
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,252
What's the score?

256
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,964
Devils 1, Lautrec 3.

257
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,674
Slovak will come back.

258
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,677
Last year, second half against Madrid,

259
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,013
Roscoe's diving header in extra time?

260
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,890
The best goal ever.

261
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,060
Beckner  is a great midfielder.

262
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,062
Not too bad on the eyes, either.

263
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,271
For what I'm paying him...

264
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,023
What do you mean?

265
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,026
It's my team.

266
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,278
Shut up. Shut up!

267
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,447
You own the Slovak Devils?

268
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,074
Felicia, did you hear that?

269
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,076
She's cloning the hard drive, and he's in the room.

270
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,286
How the hell does she know about the Slovak Devils?

271
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:16,870
Was that in the file?

272
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,038
Maybe she's a soccer fan.

273
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,666
Oh, god, this is the greatest girl ever.

274
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,295
She got it.

275
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,089
I didn't know you liked soccer.

276
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,591
I do now. Oh, by the way, it's called futbol.

277
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,051
- I'm sorry.
- Futbol.

278
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,762
- Futbol.
- Fut. Right. Right.

279
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,639
If I can be honest,

280
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,267
the back four are solid, no question,

281
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,769
but watching defensive footie is a little bit boring.

282
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,312
- Not to me, huh.
- It's your money.

283
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,024
Donata, can you believe that hag is dating the prince of Greece?

284
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,778
Oh, god. Doesn't she have any friends who can tell her she looks like trash?

285
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,322
Did you see that? She just palmed the PDA from his jacket.

286
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,657
That's magic, man.

287
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,367
I showed her that with, like, a business card.

288
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,786
It's like, fazham! She's amazing.

289
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,371
- I get it.
- She's incredible.

290
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,165
- Fazham?
- Yeah, fazham.

291
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,418
Nice. They're doing it.

292
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,129
They're cloning tambor's PDA. She's good.

293
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,173
Oh, my god, those boots are horrific.

294
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,508
I own those, bitch.

295
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,012
Wouldn't be weird for you, would it, if we were dating sisters?

296
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,729
Reno's lost his step since the knee surgery. You should replace him.

297
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,356
Idiot!

298
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,820
Nadia's still got his PDA. Come on.

299
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,788
Extraordinary.

300
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,874
Oh, my god.

301
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,293
That dress is magnificent.

302
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,212
- My PDA.
- Oh, god.

303
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,923
Anton!

304
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,634
Search these two. Check their bags.

305
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,968
- You can't be serious.
- Where did you find them?

306
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,762
My god, this is insane.

307
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,061
Is this what you're freaking out about?

308
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,611
- You better go now.
- Yeah, you think?

309
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,906
You were right. Your boyfriend is a total drag. Come on.

310
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,169
You were given a direct order,

311
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,547
one you chose to disregard.

312
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,340
We gathered the necessary intelligence.

313
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,050
That is not the point, Nadia.

314
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,136
You report directly to me.

315
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,849
I assessed the risks and determined that they were too great,

316
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,143
and still you both chose to defy orders.

317
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,771
We did what we were tasked to do, end of story.

318
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,857
I should remind you.

319
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,150
You answer to me.

320
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,611
You're right.

321
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,990
We disregarded a direct order. It won't happen again.

322
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,118
Just so we don't have these misunderstandings again,

323
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,786
let me be clear

324
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,538
to both of you.

325
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,957
Questioning my authority,

326
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,501
whether it's in this office or in the field,

327
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,421
is unacceptable.

328
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,214
Unacceptable?

329
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,341
Coming from you, that's almost funny.

330
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,593
Sydney, please.

331
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,972
Do you really want to engage in a conversation about what is

332
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:26,310
and what is not acceptable?

333
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,479
Every day I work here,

334
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,691
I see your face in briefings, I hear your voice in my ear during missions,

335
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,612
and you want to know what it's like? It makes me sick to my stomach.

336
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,781
Having to pretend the past never happened,

337
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,950
that you're not the same

338
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,829
murderous criminal sociopath you were three years ago,

339
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,873
it makes me want to retch.

340
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,959
If you want to talk unacceptable,

341
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,378
that is unacceptable.

342
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,676
I assumed that you had accepted the fact that I made amends for my past.

343
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,055
Amends?

344
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,935
Francie and Danny are gone,

345
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,647
and yet here you are.

346
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,817
And everywhere I look,

347
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,278
I'm reminded of the man who killed them.

348
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,824
I see.

349
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,371
Hey, uh, Tambor's encryption program --

350
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,163
I broke it.

351
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,790
It was kind of brilliant on my part,

352
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,875
but then again the data itself was coded,

353
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,876
so I had to cross-reference it --

354
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,877
Marshall, what is it?

355
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,921
Well, it looks like the sale of Black Thorine --

356
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,923
it's going down in 16 hours.

357
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,717
- We'll be right there.
- Okay. You should hurry.

358
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,525
The situation is critical.

359
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,901
Tambor is selling the Black Thorine

360
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,736
aboard his yacht, the Argento.

361
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,572
We have less than 16 hours to get on that boat

362
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,115
and retrieve the stolen vial.

363
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,950
According to harbor master records,

364
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,662
the Argento is sailing in the black sea in protected waters off Turkey,

365
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,248
which  means we have no choice but to go in stealth

366
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,583
without the cover of night.

367
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,209
Do we know who the buyer is?

368
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,379
No, but we do have an idea where the Black Thorine is being stored.

369
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,090
Here, in a cabin below dark.

370
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,383
Marshall.

371
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:26,013
Okay, here is the schematic of the vault that you'll be dealing with.

372
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,473
It's secure, built into the bulkhead, old school.

373
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:33,604
So whoever is going in, you are going to need...

374
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:34,938
these.

375
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,733
Uh, your basic safecracking tools.

376
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,484
- Sounds simple.
- Not quite.

377
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,987
Now, I found some receipts on tambor's hard drive.

378
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:46,283
Turns out he bought a condor TL-60 free-standing safe last month.

379
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,618
I did some measurements,

380
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,037
and oddly enough, it fits perfectly within the vault,

381
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,249
so I think it's safe to assume Tambor has a safe within a safe.

382
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,918
He's certainly paranoid enough.

383
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:56,793
How do we crack it?

384
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,421
The condor uses a time-synchronized lock.

385
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,673
It randomizes a combination every 60 seconds.

386
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,593
Now, the combination appears on a key card with an LCD screen.

387
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,722
Now, we can assume that Tambor will have it on him, so...

388
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,390
you're gonna need this.

389
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,646
This is a handheld wireless monitor, and this right here --

390
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,940
Will you marry me, mr. Bristow?

391
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,695
It's a wave millimeter camera.

392
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,448
It will allow you to read the combination through his clothing,

393
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:29,743
assuming he's not wearing a lead girdle, which is doubtful.

394
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,453
But you understand my point.

395
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:32,663
There's a jet standing by.

396
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,665
This is a high-risk mission. No backup.

397
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,000
Vaughn, Dixon, this is your op.

398
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,919
I'm sending you to the ship.

399
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,421
If you don't mind, I'd like to finish what I started.

400
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,215
So would I.

401
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,552
They are the two best divers.

402
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,804
For me to send them after the way they behaved in Monte Carlo,

403
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,640
not to mention the way Sydney just behaved in my office,

404
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,935
would be tantamount to rewarding them for insubordination.

405
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,481
I thought I would have your support on this.

406
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,861
Arvin, the nuance of fatherhood may elude me,

407
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,280
but there's one thing I am sure of.

408
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,199
You are not going to forge any kind of bond with Nadia

409
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,870
if you attempt to keep her from working with her sister.

410
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,644
I told him, if you don't win us next game,

411
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,731
you're going to suffer a painful training injury, huh?

412
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,905
Is that why you doubled his salary?

413
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:52,743
Ha.

414
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,171
Phoenix to base, we're on deck.

415
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,547
Proceed with caution.

416
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,840
Copy that. We're moving in.

417
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,346
We're going below deck.

418
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,473
We'll be radio silent until we reach the safe.

419
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,557
Roger that.

420
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,864
Black label. But of course.

421
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,956
Phoenix, we have a visual.

422
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,041
Copy that. Switching to millimeter wave.

423
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,126
Freeze it there. Save it.

424
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,629
Stand by. Enhancing the image.

425
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:51,552
I always believe in pleasure before business.

426
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,805
But, that being said...

427
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,516
Marshall, rewind the feed.

428
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,893
Is there a problem?

429
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,522
Pull up everything we have on Leo Orissa.

430
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,234
Leo Orissa...

431
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,277
okay.

432
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,200
Anton, get the man what he came for, huh?

433
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,619
If you don't mind,

434
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:22,124
I would like first for my chemist to conduct a little test, uh...

435
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,584
a precaution.

436
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:32,801
- Ready.
- Copy that.

437
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,512
Scanning Tambor for the latest combination.

438
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:40,601
Code is 4-2-6-8-7.

439
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,188
Oh, my god.

440
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,064
We need a bigger case.

441
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,155
Close it up -- now.

442
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,841
So, you never told me --

443
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,302
what do you plan to do with your purchase?

444
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,971
It is interesting, actually.

445
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:24,102
We plan on taking control of your entire operation.

446
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,940
This guy...

447
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,984
You know this guy?

448
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,569
He's an old friend.

449
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,029
Bad-ass friend.

450
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,341
You don't treat a girlfriend like that.

451
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,985
Phoenix, Evergreen, do you copy?

452
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,821
I repeat, do you copy?

453
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,296
Phoenix to base.

454
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,090
Tambor and his men are dead.

455
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:18,675
Ambushed.

456
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:22,221
By Leo Orissa, head of a russian organized crime syndicate.

457
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:26,558
I used to work with him when I was head of SD-6.

458
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,354
He has a link on the inside.

459
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,147
The girlfriend fed him everything he needed.

460
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,524
They're in possession of the vial?

461
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,067
A lot more than a vial.

462
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,485
At least 10 canisters.

463
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,737
10 more -- must have reverse-engineered it.

464
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,323
Which means they're manufacturing it. Tambor has a lab somewhere.

465
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,824
Orissa must know where it is.

466
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:47,579
Orissa's associates are most likely securing the Black Thorine for transport.

467
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,331
Nadia, can you take them out alone?

468
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:50,832
I think so.

469
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,751
Given my history with Orissa,

470
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,670
I believe he'd be willing to talk.

471
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:55,921
How?

472
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,298
Sydney, in order for this to work,

473
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,175
you're going to have to listen to me.

474
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,511
You're going to have to trust me.

475
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,247
Hello again.

476
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,918
My employer won't be happy if you pull that trigger.

477
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:36,503
Your employer?

478
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,672
Who the hell do you work for?

479
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,174
Tell him.

480
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,302
I work for Arvin Sloane.

481
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,691
He's demanding 50%?

482
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,527
Including all future profits from this venture.

483
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,781
Arvin always had an odd sense of humor.

484
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:10,954
I came unarmed out of respect so that we could talk like gentlemen.

485
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,208
You are not seriously considering making a deal with this woman.

486
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,335
Do not let her derail this, Sydney.

487
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,420
I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you.

488
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,465
You're the one who made it easy.

489
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,967
You practically drew us a map.

490
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,179
You? You led Sloane to me?

491
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,223
I thought she was just some kind of --

492
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,442
Fine.

493
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,445
I agree to his terms.

494
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,739
Ask for insurance.

495
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,533
Mr. Sloane will be pleased.

496
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,453
Of course, he needs a sign of good faith.

497
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,039
What more does he want?

498
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,999
The location of the lab.

499
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,753
Don't move.

500
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,141
Mention my friend, dr. Chaleb.

501
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,561
What I did to him

502
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,564
after he betrayed me.

503
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,109
I assume you haven't forgotten dr. Chaleb.

504
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,527
What sloane did to him.

505
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,322
The sound of his own screaming woke him up.

506
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:31,660
He saw everything burning around him,

507
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,288
including his own flesh.

508
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:40,711
The fire, the smell of his own flesh burning, the screams.

509
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:45,007
I imagine he spends his days, nights

510
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,467
wishing that I had finished the job.

511
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,179
Wishing that he were dead.

512
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:55,392
His body doesn't work, but his mind does.

513
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,061
He's a living corpse.

514
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,483
Sloane didn't show enough mercy to kill him.

515
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,830
Let me tell you something I know.

516
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,541
Arvin Sloane is cruel.

517
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,669
He's inhuman.

518
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,380
If you make this difficult,

519
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,257
he will come after you.

520
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,384
And not just you.

521
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,678
Your friends will not be spared.

522
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,808
Your family will not be spared.

523
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,979
If he chooses to let you live,

524
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:48,195
you'll spend every waking minute of your life reminded of what he's caused you.

525
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:54,868
Word to the wise -- give him what he wants.

526
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:14,429
The lab -- it's in the ukraine. Khmel'nitsky.

527
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,223
You son of a bitch!

528
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,029
Phoenix to base. We're ready for pickup.

529
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,740
You have no idea how glad I am to hear that.

530
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:15,991
I'll call the chopper.

531
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,411
Arvin.

532
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,208
You did what you had to do.

533
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:25,918
Yes.

534
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,506
Although I imagine it's the last time I'll be working with your daughter.

535
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,539
You did a good job.

536
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:05,707
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

537
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,843
I never imagined this.

538
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:16,093
I didn't even know spies were real until I was recruited.

539
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,010
From school?

540
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:20,180
From our juvenile detention home.

541
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,933
When I was young, I was reckless...

542
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,226
angry.

543
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:28,480
I remember one judge said he thought I was lost.

544
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,607
He wasn't wrong.

545
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,988
My training agent used to tell me I was

546
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,866
good at getting in and out of situations without being noticed.

547
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,369
Not to mention I had no one -- no family, no ties.

548
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,916
I couldn't be compromised because I was alone.

549
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,591
I always thought that's what made me a good spy.

550
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,219
And now?

551
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,264
I might have been wrong.

552
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,126
- Just say stop anywhere.
- Stop.

553
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,711
Okay.

554
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,339
Is that your card?

555
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:36,673
No.

556
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,300
This wasn't your card?

557
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,384
It is not.

558
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:40,761
Are you sure?

559
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,721
It's not at all my card.

560
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:45,641
Okay, i think you're lying, but hold on to that.

561
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,434
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:48,769
Well, that's never happened.

563
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,187
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on one second.

564
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,523
- What was your card?
- Queen of spades.

565
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,567
The queen of spades? You said that wasn't your card.

566
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,277
It is not.

567
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,488
How did you do that?

568
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,572
This is incredible.

569
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,617
Well, it's not incredible. It's child's play. I've got a million of them.

570
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,037
Your smile is so unbelievable.

571
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,248
We going?

572
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,500
Uh, yeah, we're going. We're just flirting here if you mind.

573
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,459
Sorry.

574
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,012
Langley is pleased.

575
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:29,184
They located the production facility for Black Thorine.

576
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,645
The raid was successful.

577
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,106
I'm happy to hear it.

578
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,610
So, Sydney, I contacted Chase.

579
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:42,739
She's expecting a call from you regarding a transfer from this unit.

580
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,077
Given your sentiments, I assume that's what you want.

581
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,540
I want to make something clear.

582
00:38:57,045 --> 00:39:02,134
I will never forgive you for what you've done to me,

583
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,887
to the people I love.

584
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,226
No amount of time or distance will ever change that.

585
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,070
I'll see you tomorrow.

586
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:45,970
