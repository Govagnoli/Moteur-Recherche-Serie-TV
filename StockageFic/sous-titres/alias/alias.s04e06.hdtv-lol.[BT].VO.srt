1
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:13,725
All right, everyone settle. Notebooks out.

2
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,906
We're going to start with three sentences.

3
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,709
At least one noun and one verb in each one.

4
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:20,367
In English.

5
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,873
Uh, Martina, why don't you go first?

6
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,438
Three things you saw on your way to class today.

7
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,620
Uh, I saw...

8
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,176
a man...

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,357
ped-- peddling his bicycle.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,680
Peddling. Good. Good.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,672
And then I saw my friend Klaus

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,143
kiss Katrina Wolf.

13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:41,707
And then I saw Katrina slap Klaus' face.

14
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:44,989
It's true. Katrina hates Klaus.

15
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:54,738
Anna, please turn your phone off.

16
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:00,559
Your phone -- turn it off.

17
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,719
It wasn't ringing.

18
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,317
Martina, take over class.

19
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:39,187
Aah!

20
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,131
Mrs. Kohl?

21
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,422
Mrs. Kohl!

22
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,840
Vertel hen het is grappig!

23
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,230
Mrs. Kohl!

24
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,252
Bobby Orr moves in for the shot...

25
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:25,747
Don't laugh at me.

26
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:28,071
I wouldn't dream of it. Let me get your stick.

27
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,847
All right, let 'er rip.

28
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,570
Here. Move back here.

29
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:37,749
Use a little more wrist.

30
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,692
And just put a little more snap in it, like this.

31
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,028
- Lift it up.
- What position did you play?

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,064
I was defense.

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,380
High school coach moved me up to center.

34
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,301
You were a chick magnet, right?

35
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,341
Actually, my first face-off I ever took as a center,

36
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:53,712
I got knocked right on my ass.

37
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,708
The other team's center was like this 15ear-old, 6'2", bearded --

38
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:00,458
actually, probably on steroids, now that I think about it.

39
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,047
So finally there was 12 seconds left. We're down by a goal.

40
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:07,229
I had my teeth kicked in so many times, I said, "you know what? Screw it."

41
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,982
I just stopped caring. I won the draw.

42
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,992
Skated around him, moved in for the shot.

43
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,279
You tied the game.

44
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,744
Nah, I hit the post.

45
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,400
But I did learn something about

46
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,433
how we can let fear get in the way.

47
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,877
Syd, I know you want to take things slow, but

48
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,807
what are you afraid of?

49
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:35,061
Yeah?

50
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,259
Her name is Nancy Cahill,

51
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,633
an operative in Langley's narcotics task force

52
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:05,144
specializing in the development of new synthetics.

53
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:08,135
She's been stationed in Europe for the past three years.

54
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:12,129
Her cover -- associate professor at Amsterdam University.

55
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,120
She shot herself 36 hours ago.

56
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:16,827
Eyewitness report -- a student from Cahill's class.

57
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:20,345
Her last words -- "vertel hen het is grappig."

58
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:21,666
Tell them it's funny.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,087
Cahill's most recent psych eval reported nothing of note.

60
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,555
Her mental status reviews have been exemplary.

61
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,735
What's our assignment?

62
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:32,397
Cahill's husband -- Jason, also an agent -- has gone off the grid.

63
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,245
Hasn't been in touch with his handler in three weeks.

64
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:38,858
All attempts to contact him afr his wife's death have been unsuccessful.

65
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:42,375
Objective is quite simple. Locate Jason Cahill.

66
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,126
So, Dixon, you take Weiss.

67
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,213
Retrace Nancy Cahill's final days.

68
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:48,729
Vaughn, you and Nadia do the same for Jason Cahill.

69
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,241
Sydney, Jack, Cahill's Amsterdam apartment. Standard protocol.

70
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:56,903
Recover all files, classified computers, any evidence of CIA affiliation.

71
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,844
Any questions?

72
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,338
No bulbs.

73
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,422
Good news, agent Bristow.

74
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:02,794
Your blood work's negative, and your scans are clean.

75
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,113
May I?

76
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:05,576
Yeah.

77
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:11,520
Looks fine.

78
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,728
My little brother did the same thing to me once.

79
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:15,574
Bit me like this.

80
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,281
Perhaps you can tell us now what you were looking for in the cat scan.

81
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,702
The Cahills came in contact with a drug that affected the nervous system.

82
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:25,026
Pineal gland was about twice the normal size.

83
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,397
Nancy Cahill's autopsy revealed the same condition.

84
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,674
Which indicates what?

85
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:29,947
By itself, nothing.

86
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,318
The pineal converts melatonin,

87
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:33,738
which regulates sleep cycles and body temperature.

88
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:35,729
However, acute melatonin imbalance

89
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,105
has been known to induce uncharacteristic behavior,

90
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,810
even acts of extreme violence.

91
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:41,506
The writing in Cahill's closet --

92
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:45,214
it seemed like he was suffering from severe paranoia. Seeing demons.

93
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,011
I know.

94
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,429
I initially assumed we were dealing with a psychotropic,

95
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,279
but hallucinogens have particular biochemical markers,

96
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:52,697
none of which were present here.

97
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:55,497
No matter what drug Jason Cahill may have been exposed to,

98
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:58,442
he couldn't have transmitted it to Sydney by biting her.

99
00:09:58,627 --> 00:09:59,954
So why the cat scan?

100
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,563
The Cahills dealt with emerging drugs.

101
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,552
I wanted to take every precaution.

102
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:07,831
But  all of our diagnostics indicate that you're fine.

103
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:09,246
Do you feel okay?

104
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:10,661
Fine.

105
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:15,112
Langley wants to know what substance the Cahills came in contact with.

106
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:16,292
Who's manufacturing it?

107
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,565
What is it being used for?

108
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,044
So,  what do we know?

109
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:23,036
Neither Cahill traveled outside Amsterdam in the past month.

110
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:26,077
In her last days, Nancy placed twice her usual amount of phone calls.

111
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:27,591
They were routed through anonymous relays.

112
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,439
Standard deep-cover protocol.

113
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,095
Well, if you give me the routing numbers,

114
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:33,133
I'll see if I can hack a back-trace.

115
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,882
As far as Cahill's laptop,

116
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,298
the hard drive was erased,

117
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,719
but it's possible the files weren't completely rewritten.

118
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,132
I'll see if I can reconstruct them.

119
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,389
Okay, what do we know about these?

120
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:44,809
Jason Cahill was analyzing data --

121
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,324
names, dates, links between sources.

122
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,219
He was looking for something I don't know, maybe his mind.

123
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:50,334
This guy was a little crazy.

124
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,706
His wife actually locked him in his closet.

125
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,214
Sydney's fine.

126
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,631
Just exhausted.

127
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:59,387
She hasn't slept in 36 hours, so I'm sending her home.

128
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,613
Yes, of course.

129
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,167
Excuse me.

130
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:05,070
Hey.

131
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,806
Hey.

132
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,182
Oh, you think it's sexy, don't you?

133
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,409
Ha ha. Only if I had done it.

134
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,684
You need a ride home?

135
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,905
No, thanks.

136
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,422
I was freaked out, but now I'm just tired.

137
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,805
- Good night.
- Good night.

138
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,249
It's not that big of a deal.

139
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,868
You still think that's funny.

140
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:17,858
Great.

141
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,128
Oh, god, I hope we didn't wake you up.

142
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,214
How are you doing?

143
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,250
I'm fine.

144
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,142
I had a headache. I couldn't sleep, but I'm fine.

145
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,443
Have you learned anything new?

146
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,047
Uh, well, let me just say Cahill's papers --

147
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,609
just thinking about them makes my head hurt.

148
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:37,413
Marshall says he's making some progress with Cahill's hard disk.

149
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,690
He thinks he may be able to retrieve the data.

150
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,392
Yeah.

151
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,083
Oh.

152
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:44,246
What?

153
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,000
- Are you st--
- What, staying over?

154
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,221
No.

155
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,907
No. Unless I am. Am I?

156
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:53,232
- You're not.
- I'm not.

157
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:53,885
I'll walk you out.

158
00:13:54,027 --> 00:13:55,590
She's gonna walk me out. She almost said yes. You saw that, right?

159
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:56,295
Right now.

160
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,611
This close. I was --

161
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:58,456
Good night.

162
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,253
Good night.

163
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:44,967
Hey.

164
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:46,935
Sorry.

165
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:47,998
You're here early.

166
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,505
I couldn't sleep.

167
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:52,612
What do you think about this?

168
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:55,642
Was Jason Cahill just delusional?

169
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:58,431
We're assuming the Cahills realized they were affected --

170
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,614
something they came in contact with.

171
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,552
Probably a drug from one of their sources.

172
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:05,116
But which source, which drug, they didn't know.

173
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:08,103
Looks like they were retracing their steps trying to figure it out.

174
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:11,287
Maybe looking for an antidote.

175
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:16,291
I thought I was losing my mind.

176
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,570
The hard disk was wiped clean, remember?

177
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,369
But the data recovery wasn't the problem.

178
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,406
The files were fragmented.

179
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,613
What's on the disk?

180
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:24,637
The mother lode.

181
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,178
Cahill's travel itineraries,

182
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,693
dead-drop protocols, routing numbers for discretionary funds.

183
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,353
What's pressing for now --

184
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:33,678
according to their records, Jason Cahill has a meeting scheduled for Bucharest.

185
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,098
His contact is known to him as the Count.

186
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,042
The Count? You got to be kidding me.

187
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,793
The Count is mentioned several times in Cahill's papers.

188
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,212
He seems to be one of their sources.

189
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:44,727
He supplies them with samples of new drugs.

190
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,434
Now here is a photo.

191
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,424
I retrieved it from one of Cahill's disks.

192
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:53,832
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the Count.

193
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,964
The meeting is tomorrow night.

194
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:57,383
Obviously Cahill won't attend, but we will.

195
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:00,137
Sydney, you will identify yourself as an associate of Jason.

196
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:01,745
You will lead him into a conversation

197
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:04,260
and  find out what drugs he'd acquired for them.

198
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,440
It's a mistake.

199
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,161
I beg your pardon?

200
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,534
Sending Sydney back into the field so quickly. It's a tactical error.

201
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:12,333
No, it's --

202
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:13,990
Sydney, someone else can do this.

203
00:16:14,084 --> 00:16:15,122
I'm  fine.

204
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,682
That's it.

205
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:25,934
Well, based on my limited experience with mind-altering drugs,

206
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,259
this one must have been a doozy.

207
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,916
Theoretically, could the drug's effects have a delayed reaction?

208
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,051
Well, there is that half-hour or so for it to kick in.

209
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,660
That's not what I mean. I mean like a while,

210
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,794
like a day or two.

211
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:36,880
Uh, I'm not sure. Hold on a second. It's my wife.

212
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:37,632
Hey, honey.

213
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,049
I'll look into it, okay?

214
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,181
Yeah, sure, put him on.

215
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:43,938
Hey, boo-boo! Daddy loves you. Yes, he does.

216
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,105
Scans of Cahill's papers.

217
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,759
His references to the Count.

218
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,130
Thank you. Ahh.

219
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:51,247
Another headache?

220
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:52,328
Yeah.

221
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,462
I've got some aspirin. You want it?

222
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:56,783
No, thanks.

223
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:58,842
This is gonna sound crazy.

224
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,398
After you got home last night, I took my temperature.

225
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:02,103
Mm-hmm?

226
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,231
It was 111.

227
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,025
Syd, that's not possible.

228
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:09,017
I know. I must have been dreaming, right?

229
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,899
You told dr. Jain?

230
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,507
Everything was back to normal this morning.

231
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,926
All my tests came back negative.

232
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,487
You have to let them know.

233
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,383
You just said it yourself it's not possible.

234
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,422
It's not, but still, you have to.

235
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,699
If I tell them, they'll sideline me for who knows how long.

236
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,022
If you don't tell them, I will.

237
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,537
Nadia, I'm fine.

238
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,573
I shouldn't have said anything.

239
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:26,610
Hey.

240
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:29,207
- Plane's waiting.
- Okay.

241
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,073
Uh, what's going on here, girl stuff?

242
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:39,946
People stuff.

243
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:43,410
Be safe.

244
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,351
You wanted to see me?

245
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,198
Yes. Please.

246
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:01,023
You know, Marcus, I appreciate your friendship with Sydney.

247
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,406
Having said that,

248
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:08,188
whether or not an agent is fit for duty is my decision.

249
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,895
We both know Sydney has a history of putting her work

250
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,601
ahead of her own well-being.

251
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,566
I was just suggesting that someone --

252
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,461
Dixon,

253
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:20,389
in the 11 years that you worked for me at SD-6,

254
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:25,252
I came to recognize your brilliance as a field agent.

255
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:28,178
But during those 11 years,

256
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:32,603
not once did you suspect that you were working for a renegade organization.

257
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,795
What are you suggesting?

258
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,927
That somehow my loyalty is a liability?

259
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:44,386
I'm suggesting that you do your job,

260
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,268
and that I do mine.

261
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:14,359
11:30 we should move.

262
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,061
Sydney,

263
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,002
when  we find the Count,

264
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,469
you'll approach him and see what he knows.

265
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:20,794
If he gets suspicious, the abort code is "takedown."

266
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,882
Once we're inside the club, you'll take point. I'll cover the back.

267
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:36,782
Sydney!

268
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:45,167
Tea was hotter than I expected.

269
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,305
Give me a minute to change.

270
00:19:57,236 --> 00:20:00,184
I want one of us to have line of sight on her at all times.

271
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,203
You see him?

272
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:08,333
Negative.

273
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:22,760
Okay, he's at the front bar.

274
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,172
I'm on my way.

275
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,285
  

276
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,390
  

277
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,186
Jason Cahill.

278
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,444
  

279
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:46,406
Is good.

280
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:49,067
Is good you come, but, uh,

281
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,056
not safe to talk in the open.

282
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:55,396
At end of hall is balcony.

283
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,531
Count to 10, meet me there.

284
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:01,575
He could run. I'm not gonna wait.

285
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:02,946
I agree. Go.

286
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:47,610
Come.

287
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:53,363
Who are you?

288
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:54,830
Why did Jason not come?

289
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,253
He's sick. He sent me to talk to you for him.

290
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,387
He's sick? He's sick how?

291
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,377
Listen, he wanted me to tell you --

292
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,367
You're lying.

293
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,726
Who are you?

294
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,527
- I'm not lying.
- Turn around.

295
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:06,089
I just wanted --

296
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:07,891
I said turn around! Turn around!

297
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:11,522
Cahill is dead. His wife is, too.

298
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,864
Who are you?!

299
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,183
You're police?!

300
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,315
I don't know what they told you,

301
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,348
but they're dead because...

302
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:20,815
Oh, no, you lie again!

303
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,138
They were affected by a drug.

304
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,462
I'm trying to find out what that is.

305
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:24,403
Oh, my god.

306
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:26,237
You know what that drug is.

307
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,845
Tell me what it is.

308
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:33,971
We're under fire!

309
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:35,675
Takedown! Takedown!

310
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:49,982
You all right?

311
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:51,392
Your arm.

312
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:52,522
I'm okay.

313
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:53,700
Let's get him out of here.

314
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,938
We know who you are. Andre Sterescu.

315
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:13,096
Yes. It's a good pronunciation.

316
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,327
We know you're a romanian national, 32 years old,

317
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:18,366
charged twice with possession of black market electronics.

318
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:19,831
We know you were convicted three years ago

319
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,820
for fencing stolen pharmaceuticals.

320
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:23,649
Yes, I wanted to appeal this one.

321
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,926
Tell us what you know about this man.

322
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:37,328
I will only say if you choose not to cooperate with us,

323
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:40,845
you'll regret that decision for the rest of your life.

324
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,127
Who are you guys, huh?

325
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,642
Just answer the question.

326
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,364
He told me he was chemist.

327
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:56,010
Worked for pharmaceutical company.

328
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:59,429
He hired me to be his, uh, spy.

329
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,970
Keep eye on competition.

330
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:02,816
Well, in a sense that's true, but in fact,

331
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,283
you were spying on behalf of the U.S. Government.

332
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:06,783
Oh.

333
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,823
Who called the meet, you or Cahill?

334
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,270
- He did.
- Why?

335
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,640
I don't know.

336
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,483
You performed other jobs for him.

337
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:15,188
Y eah.

338
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:16,603
Start with the most recent.

339
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:18,975
Uh, I made this -- how do you say?

340
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,773
This, uh...pen.

341
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:22,802
Marshall.

342
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:29,929
Hey, Syd, guess what? Your idea?

343
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:30,871
Well, you were right.

344
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:31,573
What idea?

345
00:24:31,712 --> 00:24:33,898
The incubation period. Turns out I did some research.

346
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,794
The germans and the czechs -- well, not all of the germans --

347
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:37,860
just the chemists.

348
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,368
Anyway, they've been toying around with some designer analogs

349
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,551
that cross the blood/brain barrier via a pathogen.

350
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:44,875
So in other words, this drug works like a virus.

351
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:46,867
It gets in your blood it incubates for a few days,

352
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:49,237
it infects you, and then permanently alters your brain.

353
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,273
Weird, huh?

354
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,739
Anyway, I called dr. Jain.

355
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:53,255
He's gonna culture Cahill's blood

356
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,514
and make sure that's not what we're dealing with, okay?

357
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:58,125
Syd, this isn't about you?

358
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,542
You're feeling okay, right?

359
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:00,011
Yeah.

360
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:03,756
Thank you, Marshall.

361
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:06,195
No problem. That's what I'm here for.

362
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:18,967
Nocturne.

363
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,098
Two weeks ago, you deliver a sample to Cahill.

364
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:21,994
Tell me about it.

365
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:23,745
Comes in vial like this.

366
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:27,213
Cahill says is like speed, only better.

367
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,204
What do you mean, like speed?

368
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,717
You take, you don't sleep.

369
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:35,232
Except not just energy.

370
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:36,823
But no need to rest.

371
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,996
You failed to include where it came from.

372
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,700
Yes, because I don't know.

373
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:46,028
Cahill says Nocturne developed in eastern bloc.

374
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,986
But I find no evidence of this,

375
00:25:50,078 --> 00:25:52,408
so I ask an associate.

376
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,494
One week later, he bring me sample of Nocturne.

377
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,864
He didn't tell you where he got the nocturne?

378
00:25:56,958 --> 00:26:00,906
No. Is too bad for you.

379
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,774
Because you're dying, too.

380
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:11,591
You all right?

381
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:13,740
Yeah.

382
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:17,931
It seems that Nocturne incorporates a stimulant

383
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,444
which overrides the pineal gland.

384
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,771
There was intel a few years ago that the north koreans

385
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,000
were working on an experimental project just like this one

386
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,416
trying to create 24-hour soldiers.

387
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:26,548
And there have been others.

388
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:27,299
All failures,

389
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:30,434
because no one fully understood the true biochemical nature of dreaming.

390
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:33,378
So the Cahills' delusions were forms of dreams?

391
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,512
Nightmares, yes. In a matter of speaking.

392
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:37,405
Problem being with these dreams,

393
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:40,446
once triggered, there's no waking up.

394
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:43,575
Sydney, are you listening?

395
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,844
It's working, isn't it?

396
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,969
Bit by bit.

397
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,793
I'm wearing down your defenses.

398
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:53,164
I'm gaining your trust.

399
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,185
But we both know at some point I'll betray you.

400
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,783
And the people you care most deeply about --

401
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:02,530
they'll die.

402
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:08,960
Syd, you okay?

403
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,371
Ahh!

404
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,952
You weren't surprised when I told you Cahill had died from Nocturne.

405
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:22,036
You weren't surprised.

406
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:23,501
Why weren't you surprised?

407
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:25,349
What aren't you telling me?!

408
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,290
I'm telling you everything.

409
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:27,516
Do not lie to me!

410
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,847
I'm one of them.

411
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,527
Do you hear me, you son of a bitch?

412
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,279
Cahill bit me.

413
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:41,391
Okay.

414
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:43,275
I know is bad.

415
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:48,127
It is why I was to meet Cahill.

416
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:50,401
I contact him to tell him.

417
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,297
I don't find Nocturne.

418
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,046
At least not what they make today.

419
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:55,368
So what did you give Cahill?

420
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,404
Old sample.

421
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,678
It was meant to be destroyed.

422
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:01,194
This drug, it go right through skin.

423
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:02,418
And he didn't know this?

424
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:03,932
I need money.

425
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:05,912
I lied to him.

426
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,235
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:09,320
From where? Where did it come from?

428
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,311
I don't know. I don't know somewhere in Prague.

429
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,246
I don't know.

430
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,309
I'm sorry.

431
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,322
I'm very sorry.

432
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,586
What's the last thing Nancy Cahill said to that eyewitness?

433
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,481
"Vertel hen het is grappig"?

434
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:32,805
Tell them it's funny?

435
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,603
That's gotta mean something else.

436
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:37,044
The Grappig group.

437
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:37,746
Prague.

438
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,688
A loose affiliation of biochemical engineers.

439
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,528
Milan Latuza. Grappig senior chemist.

440
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:47,524
Specializes in the synthesis and isolation of nov therapeutics.

441
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:50,067
Nancy cahill had found where nocturne originated,

442
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,326
only she was too far gone to do anything about it.

443
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:53,886
Jack, I know this isn't what you want to hear,

444
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,925
but even if we could recover a sample of the drug,

445
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:57,962
we don't have enough time to engineer an antidote.

446
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:00,190
Sydney needs medical attention.

447
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:02,466
Unless Latuza's already taken that step for us.

448
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,507
If they realize they made a bad batch of Nocturne,

449
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,402
it's possible they manufactured a remedy.

450
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:07,342
Contact the jet.

451
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,093
We're going to Prague.

452
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:23,595
Once you've accessed Latuza's database,

453
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,255
any files that may be even remotely related to Nocturne --

454
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,676
research, test results, formulas...

455
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,553
I'll grab what I can.

456
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,496
What if I don't find anything?

457
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:34,151
Let's not discuss that here.

458
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,718
Sydney's not as trustworthy as her mother.

459
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,401
I know.

460
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:43,336
I'm going to kill her just like I did Irina.

461
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,136
Good.

462
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,507
Latuza's office is on the sixth floor. You'll need to get a key.

463
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:47,021
Yeah.

464
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:58,943
What is it?

465
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:02,617
Dad...

466
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,550
do we have any tranquilizers?

467
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,252
No.

468
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:22,545
Then I think you better tie me up.

469
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:01,905
All right, I'm in. Headed upstairs.

470
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,020
I'm gonna be all right, aren't I?

471
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,630
Of course you are.

472
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,358
What if we can't make it stop?

473
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:16,345
Shh.

474
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:17,738
Don't talk.

475
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,706
You can't imagine how much I hate it

476
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,942
when you talk.

477
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:24,589
What?

478
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,529
The reason I killed your mother --

479
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:29,282
I had a desperate need to make her voice

480
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:30,890
stop ringing in my ears.

481
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,579
What torments me now

482
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:35,523
is that every time I look at you,

483
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:38,283
I see your mother's face.

484
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,462
No.

485
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:41,158
That's --

486
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,329
that's not true.

487
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:44,697
That's not --

488
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,926
Sydney, listen to me.

489
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,534
This is all going to pass.

490
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:54,475
All right, I'm on the sixth floor. How is she?

491
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:57,086
We're okay. Just get to the lab and find the damn antidote.

492
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,114
Sydney, look at me. Breathe. In and out. That's right.

493
00:32:09,187 --> 00:32:11,753
That's right, just breathe. Good.

494
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:14,220
Now, look in my eyes.

495
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,047
They're the last thing you'll ever see.

496
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:17,874
No!

497
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:20,905
Sydney, I'm here with you.

498
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:27,843
Sydney, look at me breathe.

499
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,996
Your mother killed me...

500
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,249
just like I'm going to kill you.

501
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,121
I won't let you.

502
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,587
How are you going to stop me?

503
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,143
You're tied up.

504
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,287
Sydney, I'm here with you. No one is going to harm you.

505
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:48,035
I won't let anything happen to you.

506
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:53,528
Dad.

507
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:55,926
I'm here, Sydney.

508
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,077
Will you hug me?

509
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:02,586
Of course I will.

510
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:06,706
It's okay.

511
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:12,657
Sydney, no!

512
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:17,160
Jack, can you hear me?

513
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:18,899
Jack, what is it?

514
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,728
What's happening?

515
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:01,027
I've got the antidote. I'm on my way.

516
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,635
Help!

517
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,231
Help!

518
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,437
Anybody?

519
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:15,776
Help!

520
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,472
My father -- I think --

521
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,525
Sydney, what did you do?

522
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,761
I think I killed him!

523
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,578
What are you doing?

524
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,542
Get --

525
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,575
Get down.

526
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,754
On your knees.

527
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,837
Sydney, it's Michael.

528
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:50,114
I've got the antidote. It's right here in this bag.

529
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:51,196
Don't lie to me.

530
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,820
Sydney... Sydney, listen to me.

531
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:56,953
Put your hands up.

532
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:58,243
Now!

533
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,497
I know what this is.

534
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:07,314
This is a game to you.

535
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:10,008
A cruel joke at my expense.

536
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:11,464
What's a game?

537
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,541
You and me.

538
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,176
Admit it.

539
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:18,753
No, Sydney.

540
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,590
Sydney, listen to me.

541
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,049
What are you scared of?

542
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,414
I am scared!

543
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:29,313
I'm scared you're gonna betray me again,

544
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,103
like you did when you married Lauren.

545
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:35,169
Sydney, I would never,

546
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:36,586
ever hurt you.

547
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:37,717
Stop!

548
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:39,885
Stop right there.

549
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:41,960
You need to give me the gun, all right?

550
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,378
I said stop!

551
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:45,450
Just give me the gun.

552
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,917
Sydney, don't --

553
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:09,297
Sydney, don't do this.

554
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,166
Aah!

555
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,196
You took the bullets out.

556
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,136
It seemed a reasonable precaution.

557
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:03,272
Preliminary report from medical services -- Sydney will be fine.

558
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,016
For that I know we're all deeply grateful.

559
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:08,608
Furthermore, Interpol has raided

560
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:11,648
both the office and laboratory of dr. Milan Latuza.

561
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:16,671
The Nocturne program has been dismantled.

562
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,563
That threat is now over.

563
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,482
Okay. That's it.

564
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:26,631
Dixon?

565
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:30,471
Sending Sydney out...

566
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:34,591
a tactical error, indeed.

567
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,202
I'd have said this earlier, but when I get done,

568
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:47,527
it's likely you'll have me relieved of my position,

569
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:50,425
and I didn't want that to happen while Sydney was in the field.

570
00:37:51,592 --> 00:37:57,099
I've asked myself countless times why I never saw

571
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,090
the true nature of SD-6.

572
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:02,169
For a while, I punished myself over it.

573
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,733
Finally, I realized

574
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,811
my only failure was that of imagination.

575
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:15,013
Despite all the evil I'd encountered,

576
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:19,675
I had never imagined a person could exist --

577
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:25,980
someone as thoroughly toxic as yourself.

578
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,935
I won't make that mistake again.

579
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:35,547
You want us to believe you've reformed.

580
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,871
That for the love of your daughter you've decided to listen

581
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,006
to the better angels of your nature.

582
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,210
Arvin...

583
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:44,089
let's be honest.

584
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:47,280
You don't have any.

585
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:53,510
And on that inevitable day

586
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:57,118
when your true motive reveals itself,

587
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:58,903
I promise you

588
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,487
I'll be there.

589
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,151
I'll be waiting.

590
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:25,841
Hey.

591
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:26,357
Hey.

592
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:34,595
Vaughn, what I said to you,

593
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:36,372
what I did...

594
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,788
Syd, you weren't yourself.

595
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:43,828
No.

596
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:16,853
My father liked spiders.

597
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:17,984
He said they were good luck.

598
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:21,378
- I've never heard that.
- No?

599
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,113
Get some rest.

600
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:32,978
I'll see you tomorrow.

601
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:34,567
Okay.

602
00:40:52,504 --> 00:40:56,467
