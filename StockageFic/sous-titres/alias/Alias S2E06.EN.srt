1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,168
OK. I'm in.

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,257
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,216
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,382
Get down.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,842
I guess we'll just have to
learn to trust each other.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,090
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,176
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,812
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,350
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,483
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,691
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,911
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,540
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,462
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,464
recently turned herself in to the CIA.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,008
Mom?

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:56,513
Intel indicates she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,343
The true loyalty of Agent Bristow's mother
remains unknown.

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,512
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

20
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,857
Let's talk about last week,
the incident in Madagascar.

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,738
My mother informed us
the building was safe to enter.

22
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:23,905
In truth, it was a trap.
Derevko had rigged it with explosives.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,120
Washington has made a decision
regarding your mother.

24
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,663
What she did to you
invalidated her agreement with the CIA.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,750
The government is pressing charges.

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:37,303
I saw Desouza. He told me
that you hired him to rig those explosives.

27
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,888
Sydney will never know
about what I've done.

28
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,475
You betrayed her trust. I won't.

29
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,346
- You want me to hypnotise you?
- I need to know what happened to me.

30
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,274
Where are you, Sydney?

31
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,852
In my room, when I was little.

32
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,540
You took away my choices in life.

33
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,203
You programmed me to be a spy.

34
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:16,964
You weren't trying to protect me from her.
You were trying to protect your secret.

35
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:21,098
So the first opportunity you had,
you set her up.

36
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,634
I will never forgive you for this.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,144
Your mother's trial starts this morning.

38
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,650
- How long do you think it'll last?
- Could be a while.

39
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,611
With 86 counts of espionage against her,

40
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:42,617
the prosecution alone could take
months just to present their case.

41
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,165
I wanna see the opening arguments.

42
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,038
I'll arrange for a closed-circuit feed
into the ops centre.

43
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,956
Thanks.

44
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,887
You know any jokes?
Cos I could use one.

45
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,145
This grasshopper walks into a bar,
and the bartender says:

46
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,644
"Hey, we have a drink named after you."
And the grasshopper says...

47
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,564
- "You have a drink named Doug?"
- I was gonna use "Phil".

48
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,898
- Phil is certainly no funnier than Doug.
- I know. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,481
It's a non-humorous...

50
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,590
Mr Sark. As you know,
he's proven himself

51
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,375
to be a key player in the world
of international organised crime.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,463
Now he may be developing a bio-weapon,

53
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,423
synthesised from a virus
that we've never seen before.

54
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,472
This is Claus Richter,
a former employee of Sark's,

55
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,602
whom we've recently taken into custody.

56
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,394
A routine medical workup revealed

57
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,564
that Richter may have been exposed
to the virus before we picked him up.

58
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,529
- Marshall.
- Thank you, sir.

59
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,987
OK. Now, take a look
on your screen here.

60
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,484
These little squiggly things,
that's just normal flu antibodies,

61
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,782
something you might have if you got
a common cold... cough... something.

62
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,533
Now, let's take a look
at Richter's blood work.

63
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,287
Now, this shows antibodies
1,000% above normal levels.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,416
Very similar to the Ebola virus,
most notably massive haemorrhaging,

65
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,959
except that this virus works
by breaking down bonds between cells.

66
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,303
So, basically, Richter's body
in just a couple of days is gonna...

67
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,347
Like, did you ever see that movie <i>The Fly?</i>

68
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,266
D'you remember that little poor red-assed
baboon when he was turned inside out?

69
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,062
Thank you, Marshall.

70
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,105
We recently uncovered
a charter agreement

71
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,477
indicating that Sark rented
a medically-equipped 727

72
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,650
to transport three patients, presumably
suffering from the same virus as Richter,

73
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,733
to a private hospital in Geneva.

74
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,364
This hospital
is one of Sark's business fronts.

75
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,205
We believe he's assembled a team
to study the virus.

76
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,501
Your objective is to infiltrate the facility
and acquire the research.

77
00:04:54,586 --> 00:05:00,173
Jack, you'll be entering the hospital
as a patient in need of a kidney transplant.

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,544
You'll be accompanying him as the loving
daughter who's agreed to donate one.

79
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:08,345
I trust that this won't be too much
of a stretch for either of you.

80
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,891
- We should talk.
- We have nothing to talk about.

81
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,522
I know you have questions. You can
either be angry, or you can be informed.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,525
Please try to understand
what I'm about to tell you, Sydney.

83
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,236
After your mother left,
I tested Project Christmas on you

84
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,402
because I didn't want you to be a victim.

85
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,658
I thought it was my responsibility
to teach you how to think strategically,

86
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,501
to see through people's lies,
to be as strong as you could be

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,290
in an environment where one mistake
could cost you your life.

88
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,167
Then you should've told me the truth
before I ended up here.

89
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,835
Yes, you're right.

90
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,595
I never intended you to lead a double life.

91
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:55,600
I imagined recruiting you into the CIA
after you finished college,

92
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:02,106
but Sloane got to you first, and that
is a mistake I will never live down.

93
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,445
I'd like to believe you,

94
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,118
but I don't trust anything you say.

95
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,964
Closed-circuit's online.
The proceedings start in about a minute.

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,307
- And the feed'll be right over here.
- Thanks, Rick.

97
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,311
That's Senator Douglas.
Where's the judge?

98
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,555
I know you were expecting

99
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,729
opening arguments
for the prosecution of Irina Derevko,

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,271
but as of this morning, a plea agreement
has been reached with the defendant.

101
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,366
In regard to the 86 counts of espionage,

102
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,369
leading to the deaths
of 12 United States operatives,

103
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,037
Derevko has pled guilty on all counts.

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,375
A select penalty jury
was empanelled early this morning,

105
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,131
and the decision was predictably swift.

106
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,418
Derevko received the maximum sentence
under federal statute:

107
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,751
death by lethal injection.

108
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:14,184
Since she's opted to forgo all appeals,
her execution will be carried out

109
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,509
three days from today.

110
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,892
Session adjourned.

111
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,824
"Confidential to Deputy Director Devlin."

112
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,242
"I'm writing to inform you
that my father, Jack Bristow,

113
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,368
did wilfully deceive the CIA

114
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,165
into believing Irina Derevko
violated her immunity agreement."

115
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,333
"I'm committing this statement to paper
so it may be used in an official capacity

116
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,210
to halt my mother's execution."

117
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,346
"Despite her past crimes,

118
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,274
I can't in good conscience
allow her sentence to be carried out

119
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,932
when she kept her word
to cooperate with us."

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:11,405
"It is not Irina Derevko
who should be answering these charges."

121
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,567
"It is my father."

122
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,530
We have a dead drop. Request pickup.
It looks like a letter.

123
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,456
Copy that. Sending agent for retrieval.

124
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,163
When my mom first came back into my life,
I wanted her dead.

125
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,926
So how the hell did I become
the person who's trying to save her?

126
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,251
It doesn't mean that
you have to be her best friend.

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,548
It means that you did the right thing.

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,896
- How are you?
- I got my 30-day sobriety chip.

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,602
Even though I was never a drug addict,
I'm kinda proud.

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,530
By the way, you know anybody
who wants a car? I'm hocking mine.

131
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,274
- You're selling your car?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,904
It's either that
or I quit paying my student loans.

133
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,200
And I can't afford to have
bad credit and a criminal record.

134
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,826
I know you're gonna say no,
but I can lend you money.

135
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,241
Yes, I'm gonna say no.

136
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,623
But thank you.

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,588
- Hey.
- Seriously, my morning.

138
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,793
I got rear-ended by four frat guys
coming home from a party.

139
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,877
Two of them threw up while I was
getting their insurance information.

140
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,295
- At least they had insurance.
- Why are you cleaning like this?

141
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,504
You're acting like Howard Hughes.

142
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,765
The Zagat guy's coming to give his review
today. I want this place spotless.

143
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,975
There's a hamburger behind you.

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:27,107
Francie, I walked up
through Los Feliz and Atwater Village.

145
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,979
Cool, Cliff. Thanks.
Give me just a second, OK?

146
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,273
I told him I'd give him a couple of bucks
if he'd just hand out some fliers.

147
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,737
- Hamburgers are on the menu, right?
- Garden burger.

148
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,782
- How much are you paying that guy?
- 12 bucks an hour.

149
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:43,575
- Hamburger's making more than I am.
- Keep cleaning, sweetie.

150
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,418
- I gotta clean.
- I gotta catch a plane.

151
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,047
- Be safe.
- OK.

152
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,714
Sir, if you'll recall, Project Christmas
was developed by Jack Bristow

153
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,423
to train potential CIA recruits
at a young age.

154
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,264
Now, based on the research
Irina Derevko stole from him,

155
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,341
the KGB developed their own version
of the project.

156
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,806
- Yes, I recall.
- One of our assets in Moscow

157
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,389
just sent this over.

158
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,229
It's a test questionnaire administered to
a group of first-graders in the early '80s.

159
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,226
The test was designed to identify kids

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,857
who'd make good agents
in the Soviet secret service.

161
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,197
And reading over it, what really struck me
is how similar these questions are

162
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,691
to a standard IQ test
given to first-graders in this country.

163
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,364
Where are you going with this?

164
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,577
Remember the rumour going around
the Agency during the Cold War

165
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,990
about the Soviets
raising sleeper agents as Americans?

166
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,251
I know it sounds potentially paranoid,
but this is how you would do it.

167
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,124
If they managed to get their test
in circulation here,

168
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,172
they could have contacted
hundreds of kids.

169
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,592
Interesting, but unlikely.

170
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,252
I just think it would be interesting
to analyse tests from...

171
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,183
Stop. We can't spare
a single agent right now,

172
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,518
much less a team for a project
that at best has historical value.

173
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,139
The KGB doesn't even exist any more.

174
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,891
I see your mother's latest manoeuvre
had its intended effect on you.

175
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,513
- What manoeuvre would that be?
- Pleading guilty.

176
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,975
- Accepting the death penalty.
- Yup.

177
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:34,105
- She's got us right where she wants us.
- Not us. You.

178
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,230
Your mother's no fool.
She must have deduced I set her up.

179
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,106
So why do you imagine she pled guilty?

180
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,324
Because she was struck
by a crisis of conscience?

181
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,033
I think she knew
the verdict was a foregone conclusion.

182
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,705
She pled guilty to keep you
from witnessing her trial, Sydney.

183
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,126
From having you see photos
of the agents she savagely murdered,

184
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,289
including Vaughn's father.

185
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,924
She knew if you sat through that,

186
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:01,338
whatever sympathy she'd managed
to elicit from you would vanish.

187
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:08,262
So she cast herself as the victim,
to compel you to save her, and guess what.

188
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,522
You fell for it.

189
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,692
I thought you deserved
a second chance to think things over.

190
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,235
Here's your letter.

191
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,446
How'd you get that?

192
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,903
I spent a decade with this woman,

193
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:34,209
and another 20 years analysing how
she could have deceived me for so long.

194
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,830
Trust me when I tell you
I am protecting you.

195
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,876
No, you're not.

196
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,426
I think you loved Mom so much that
when she left you, you lost your soul.

197
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,142
You know what else I think?

198
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,014
I think the kind of man who'd use
his own daughter to frame her mother,

199
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,937
who'd test psych experiments on her
when she was six years old,

200
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:02,360
is the kind of man who looks at his
daughter and sees his greatest mistake.

201
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,235
You can't honestly believe that.

202
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,617
It's true, isn't it?

203
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:17,337
If Mom hadn't fooled you,
if you hadn't been so gullible,

204
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,913
I never would have been born.

205
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,349
I'm gonna finish
reviewing the mission now.

206
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,610
- Thanks. Thanks for coming.
- Of course. Everything all right?

207
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,240
Look, I don't...

208
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know how to say this
other than to just say it.

209
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,499
I need a job. With all the publicity,
no one will hire me.

210
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,833
I thought maybe you could help me out.
I don't mean to be an agent.

211
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,925
I know that the CIA
has a ton of front companies,

212
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,087
and you have defence contractors
and shipping companies.

213
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,133
- I'll work at a desk anywhere just to...
- I know this is going to drive you insane,

214
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,767
but we can't employ you
because you have a criminal record.

215
00:14:55,854 --> 00:15:01,809
I have a criminal record
because of a drug habit I never had.

216
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,829
Know anybody who wants to buy a car?

217
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,750
There might be something. I have
a discretionary fund I use for informants.

218
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,753
Totally off the books.
I could pay you to do research.

219
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,294
Seriously? I would so owe you.

220
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,844
This is a list of questions.
Please, keep them to yourself.

221
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,806
All I need you to do is find out
if any of these questions

222
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,593
ever appeared on a standardised test in
the United States over the last 20 years.

223
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,226
The more you tell me, the faster
I can get you what you want, so...

224
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,985
I pay by the hour. Take your time.

225
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,032
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

226
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:59,615
Mr Harrison, I'm Jan Spinnaker,
hospital administrator.

227
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,501
Welcome to St Alban's.

228
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,421
My daughter,
and the very twinkle in my eye, Mary.

229
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,831
Daddy, stop it.
It's so nice to meet you.

230
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,795
A pleasure to meet a daughter
who'd sacrifice so much for her father.

231
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,797
- I would do anything for my daddy.
- This way, please.

232
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:19,019
The computer in this satchel
provides me a secure link to my money.

233
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,971
The satchel cannot be removed
from my arm during the operation.

234
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,853
- All arrangements have been made...
- Now, I chose your hospital

235
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,901
for its high-security status.

236
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,439
We employ security with training
equivalent to the Secret Service.

237
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,984
- You won't be disappointed.
- Very good.

238
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,548
You're going to Geneva
to get a sample of a top-secret virus.

239
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,122
Now, your cover is,
you're going in for a kidney transplant,

240
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,467
so you're probably thinking "Hold on
a second, Marshall. We need our kidneys."

241
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:57,050
Don't worry. They're not going anywhere,
because of this.

242
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,306
Now, basically,
when you are positioned in the OR,

243
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,888
press this button lightly twice.

244
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,474
It will activate a tank of halothane.

245
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:14,944
Halothane is the same anaesthetic that
they'll be pumping through your masks.

246
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,912
Why don't you both try
counting backwards from ten?

247
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,201
Ten, nine,

248
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,704
eight...

249
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,036
Which leads us to question number two.

250
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,210
"If they're pumping anaesthesia in the
room, and you're also gulping it down..."

251
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,332
What'd I do with...?

252
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:37,385
".. by the maskful, then what's going to
prevent us from passing out ourselves?"

253
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:41,092
The solution is in this solution.
It's a mix of anti-anaesthetics,

254
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:45,018
and I also for good measure threw in
a time-release synthetic caffeine

255
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,313
that I use in my decaf every morning.

256
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,974
Just take it right before
you head into the hospital, and...

257
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,154
Trust me, you won't fall asleep.

258
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,730
.. seven, six...

259
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,397
They'll be out for 15 minutes.

260
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,521
They've all been sedated for the pain.

261
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:39,739
Patient Zero's in there. Get a blood sample.
I'll download the viral research.

262
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,394
Irina?

263
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,058
I need help.

264
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:18,190
Don't struggle. If you tear your glove off,
you could become infected.

265
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,026
I'll up his morphine.

266
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,072
Irina?

267
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,460
His vitals fell below
the preset warning levels.

268
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,126
The doctors will be alerted. Work fast.

269
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,342
Eagle Eye, this is Blackbird.
Requesting early extraction, LZ Bravo.

270
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,594
Copy that, Blackbird.
ETA LZ Bravo in three minutes.

271
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,238
Come on, come on, come on.

272
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,522
This is Dr Lazar. I need security teams
on the research level, now.

273
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:43,614
We need to get to the roof. Security
will flank us from both sides of the hall.

274
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,619
We can't reload the tranks fast enough
to take out more than four people.

275
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,991
Find some iodine.

276
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:57,214
Ammonia and iodine form an unstable
compound when they're mixed together.

277
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,292
Initiate level-three lockdown,
perimeter and elevators.

278
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,436
I got this.

279
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:15,019
Blackbird, we're on the roof.
We're waiting for you.

280
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,066
- Don't shoot.
- Against the wall.

281
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,840
Bypass the lockdown. I'll hold them off.

282
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,176
Buy me ten seconds. I need more time.

283
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,388
Ammo.

284
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,248
Sydney.

285
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:20,639
Blackbird has deployed forward
to extraction point.

286
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,352
You're wondering why that man
mistook you for your mother.

287
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,070
He worked for her.

288
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:30,901
I skimmed the research
as it was downloading.

289
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,449
Before she surrendered to the CIA,

290
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:39,244
Irina deliberately ordered Sark to expose
some of her own operatives to the virus

291
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,827
in order to study it.

292
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:47,551
Ask yourself if that's a person worth saving.

293
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,707
I had Toxicology analyse the glass of wine

294
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:22,038
that somehow made its way
into my house last week.

295
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,046
They found a compound called VTX,

296
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,592
which counteracts the effects
of sodium morphate.

297
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,765
Sodium morphate is the poison I used
to end Emily's suffering.

298
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:41,427
I see two possibilities here.

299
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,151
Either Emily predicted
your intention to euthanise her,

300
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:49,315
took the necessary countermeasures,
and is now playing a game with you,

301
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:54,151
or the more likely scenario - someone
wants you to believe Emily is alive.

302
00:24:54,244 --> 00:25:00,080
Or worse, they'll try
and make the Alliance believe it, too.

303
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,785
If they think that I failed to carry out
the one condition of my admittance,

304
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,204
that I've been betraying them
the whole time,

305
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:11,125
then they'll be forced to assume
that my entire division is rogue.

306
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,840
Then we'll all be in danger.

307
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,933
I don't think I can ever forgive my father
for the things he's done.

308
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,019
But maybe he's right
about what he's been saying all along.

309
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,189
Maybe her cooperation
is part of some elaborate strategy

310
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,267
he's more equipped to see than I am.

311
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,982
Your father's asking you to let her die
for something she might do.

312
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,274
I don't think you could live with that.

313
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,822
- Good work in Geneva.
- Thanks.

314
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:40,695
The CIA is analysing
the copy of the disk you brought back.

315
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,032
If SD-6 plans on
using the virus as a weapon,

316
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,080
we might get a jump on the antidote
thanks to the blood work you brought back.

317
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,006
- I hope so.
- There's something else you should know.

318
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,628
- Will came to me for a job.
- He did?

319
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,968
He didn't want to bother you, so I hired him
off the books to do some research.

320
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,928
- On what?
- Just background

321
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,054
on the old KGB version
of Project Christmas.

322
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,422
Of course, I didn't tell him that.

323
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,223
He thinks he's comparing an IQ test
against the public record.

324
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,764
I just figured it was your prerogative
to tell him more.

325
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:11,437
- That was really nice of you. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

326
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:16,690
There's nothing more boring
than a commerce bureau luncheon.

327
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,489
Thanks for joining me, Jack.

328
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,915
What is it?

329
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,754
- Did you see that?
- See what?

330
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,648
Can I help you?

331
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:38,232
Did you see someone
come in here just now? A woman?

332
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:45,371
- No, I've been alone all morning.
- Father, would you excuse us, please?

333
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,745
Sit down.

334
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,872
- You tell me you saw her.
- I saw a woman,

335
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,374
but it could have been anyone.

336
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,999
You may be suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder,

337
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,631
brought on by intense feelings of guilt.

338
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:05,012
Arvin, you have walked into a church,
a place to confess.

339
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,310
Or she's alive.

340
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,606
She knew the alarm code.

341
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,816
She could have come
into the house undetected.

342
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:22,027
There is a clear way to know for certain.

343
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,242
But I hesitate to suggest it.

344
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,795
Sir, there's something I have to report.

345
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,295
While it appears that my mother
sent me into a trap in Madagascar,

346
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,134
in truth, she was unaware
that there was any danger.

347
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,757
Yes, I know.
I have your father's statement right here.

348
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,096
- He told us himself this morning.
- What?

349
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,341
A hearing is scheduled
with the Joint Intelligence Committee.

350
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,222
My intention
wasn't to punish my father, sir.

351
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:53,184
It was to stop my mother's execution
from going forward.

352
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,184
Excuse me.

353
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,150
Yes?

354
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,489
I'll send her down right now.

355
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,406
They'd like to see you in Medical Services.

356
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,370
- You asked to see me?
- Agent Bristow, I'm Dr Nicholas.

357
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,086
What's going on?

358
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,457
Five weeks ago you infiltrated
one of your mother's laboratories in Taipei,

359
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,542
where you discovered a Rambaldi device.

360
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,680
How long were you
in proximity to the device?

361
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,886
It took me about a minute
to rig it with explosives.

362
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,643
I made it to the other side of the door,
but Vaughn was submerged...

363
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:38,025
I don't know,
maybe another minute or two.

364
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,780
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

365
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:45,775
We believe the device is the source of
the virus that infected the men in Geneva.

366
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:50,198
Unfortunately, you and Agent Vaughn
may have been exposed.

367
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,952
I'm sorry. We'd like to draw some blood
and keep you under observation.

368
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,251
If Sloane pages me,
that's gonna be a problem.

369
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:03,459
Your father's already been informed.
He's covering for you.

370
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,407
I know.

371
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:19,791
It's not hard to see
Anyone who looks at me...

372
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,168
- Hi.
- Hey.

373
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:26,171
- Did you close your eyes at all?
- On and off.

374
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,337
You talk in your sleep.

375
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,972
No.

376
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:34,135
- What'd I say?
- "Don't frost the pie."

377
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:36,718
It seemed really important.

378
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,641
No idea.

379
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,572
You think we're sick?

380
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,948
I don't know.

381
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,785
Vaughn, can I tell you something?

382
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:07,338
Agent Bristow, your tests came back
negative for antibodies. You're free to go.

383
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,463
Agent Vaughn, your tests at this point
are inconclusive.

384
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,805
We did find a heightened level
of antibodies in your bloodstream,

385
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,513
but you could simply be fighting off a cold.

386
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,351
We won't know for a few more hours.
You'll have to stay.

387
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,568
You said Sark tested Patient Zero's blood
at the first sign of infection.

388
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,689
What was the sign?

389
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:33,024
Haemorrhaging from the fingernails.

390
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:42,160
I'll be fine. Your dad's hearing
is in an hour. You should go.

391
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,207
And someday I'll go

392
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,299
Where there ain't no rain or snow

393
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:54,968
Till then I'll travel alone

394
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:58,178
And I'll make my bed

395
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,970
With the stars above my head

396
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:07,272
And dream of a place called home

397
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,396
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

398
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:21,039
And dream of a place called home

399
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,798
Agent Bristow,
this hearing's been convened

400
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:37,929
to determine an appropriate punishment
for the crimes depicted in your statement.

401
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:42,763
Before we begin our inquiry,
do you have anything you'd like to say?

402
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,521
Only that despite my admission of guilt,

403
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,732
I still firmly believe
Irina Derevko's a threat,

404
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,444
and will prove it
at her earliest possible convenience.

405
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:57,203
Is that how you justify
lying to your superiors?

406
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,157
- Endangering other agents?
- Yes.

407
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,708
Why this sudden change of heart?

408
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:08,163
Deferentially, Senator,
my reasons are my own.

409
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,332
I see.

410
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,879
Reviewing your file, I was shocked
to discover how many times

411
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:19,348
you've displayed behaviour that at best
can be characterised as "rogue".

412
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:23,681
You have lost the benefit of the doubt here,
sir, and your silence will not suffice.

413
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:27,520
So again I ask you,
why the change of heart?

414
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:34,404
My daughter convinced me
that I acted unethically.

415
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:38,619
Isn't it a fact that you knew
your daughter intended to turn you in,

416
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,740
and that you beat her to the punch,
only by an hour,

417
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,785
in order to secure
a degree of leniency from this body?

418
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,545
No, sir, that is not the case.

419
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,876
Sydney Bristow, my daughter,

420
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:03,223
has come to believe
that when I look at her,

421
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:06,431
I see the embodiment of all my flaws.

422
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:11,688
And this afternoon, when I learnt

423
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:15,194
that she may have been exposed
to a life-threatening disease,

424
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,737
I realised she might die believing that.

425
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:22,037
But nothing could be further from the truth.

426
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:28,243
When I look at her, when I look
at the little girl who raised herself

427
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:32,879
to become one of the most extraordinary
human beings

428
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:37,295
and one of the finest agents
I've ever had the privilege of knowing,

429
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:41,716
I see only the promise
of my own redemption.

430
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:47,147
Turning myself in was the only way
I could think of to make that clear to her,

431
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:54,312
to prove that despite
my limited abilities as a father,

432
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:00,031
I love her more than I could ever say.

433
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,924
- I didn't order this.
- It's from the gentleman at the bar.

434
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,229
- You OK?
- Yeah. Clean bill of health.

435
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,111
Apparently I am fighting a cold.

436
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:45,238
I came by to see you after the hearing,
but they were still running tests.

437
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,035
I know. They told me you came here.

438
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:51,873
This is ridiculous,
being in the same restaurant on the phone.

439
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:56,837
Listen, Syd, I actually came by
to tell you something.

440
00:36:56,925 --> 00:37:00,341
They're sending your father to prison.

441
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,717
You're kidding.

442
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,882
It gets worse.

443
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:09,103
Douglas decided your mother's
immunity agreement was never binding.

444
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:11,856
They're gonna carry out
her death sentence anyway.

445
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,688
Her execution goes ahead
tomorrow at 8am.

446
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,742
Welcome back to Washington, Senator.

447
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,503
Ed, you missed the exit.

448
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,806
Hello?

449
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,035
No. No. Hey.

450
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,256
You're making a big mistake.

451
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,337
Sorry about the detour, Senator, but I need
two minutes of your undivided attention.

452
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,172
I don't care what point you want to make.

453
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,965
I'd like you to drop charges against my
father and honour my mother's immunity.

454
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,188
I recognise how indecisive this sounds,
but I turned her in under false pretences,

455
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,312
and my father, I've come to believe,
was protecting me.

456
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:42,235
His intentions are irrelevant.
It's his decisions that matter.

457
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:45,406
I'm sorry, Agent Bristow.

458
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,365
But my colleagues and I
have a zero tolerance

459
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,361
for anyone who'd lie
to their own government,

460
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,114
especially in this day and age.

461
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:55,998
And your mother?
Well, she's had it coming for 20 years.

462
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,921
Now, given what you've been through,

463
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:03,335
I'm willing to forgive
your little misstep tonight.

464
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,546
Would you kindly drop me off at home?

465
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,443
Wait in the car.

466
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,556
How did you persuade Douglas
to reverse himself?

467
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:45,232
I told him I have a secret
only you and I know about.

468
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,781
A secret Sloane told you in confidence that
poses such a threat to national security

469
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:52,322
that we couldn't trust
even the CIA to contain it.

470
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,486
What secret is that?

471
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,533
One of your colleagues,
a United States senator,

472
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,700
is working for the Alliance.

473
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:04,205
We have evidence of wire transfers
totalling $6.3 million.

474
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,705
- To whom?
- That's what we're trying to find out,

475
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,342
but without my mother and father,

476
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:13,302
I'll be forced to
hand the investigation over to the FBI.

477
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,976
There's no senator in the Alliance's pocket.
You lied.

478
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,599
I'm not proud of what I did.

479
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:25,899
I may not agree with your decision
to interact with your mother, Sydney,

480
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:31,193
but I will, from now on,
respect that it is your decision to make.

481
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:38,620
They're bringing in your mother now.
I'm sure you'll wanna see her.
