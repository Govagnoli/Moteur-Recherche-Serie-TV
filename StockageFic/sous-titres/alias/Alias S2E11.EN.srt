Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,333
Jack Bristow, this is Ariana Kane.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,211
Ms Kane is the head
of Alliance Counterintelligence.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,677
She's here to investigate

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,928
the events leading up to
my wife Emily's disappearance

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,802
and the subsequent attempts
to blackmail me.

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,885
If Sloane gets ahold of
that Echelon terminal,

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,136
well, the Alliance will be able
to eavesdrop on corporations,

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,388
law enforcement, political campaigns.

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:28,527
The potential for blackmail
and insider trading would be unlimited.

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:33,108
Gerard Cuvee, former leader
of the People's Revolutionary Front.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,782
One of Cuvee's men placed a call
to a data-storage facility in London.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,787
It's likely Cuvee duplicated
the Echelon software

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,280
and had them stored
in a secure server there.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,127
- Sydney, you're going in with Marshall.
- Wait a minute. What?

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,161
You're the only one qualified to hack
the server without an electronic device.

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,582
Marshall has a photographic memory.

18
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,463
Once the files flash across the screen,
he'll remember them.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:01:00,474
- I can't just give SD-6 a fake Marshall.
- No. But we can pull him out of SD-6.

20
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,181
Mom, I'll be home in a little while.

21
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,272
I'm just getting back from
my big business trip in London.

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,984
What do you mean? We didn't pick up
Marshall at the intercept point? Who did?

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,315
Please don't hurt me.

24
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,084
Some people think there's a conspiracy,

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,709
that the government
eavesdrops on everyone.

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,542
It's no conspiracy.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,085
Right now, satellites and
ground-station antennas are listening in.

28
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,551
Faxes, Internet communications,
phone calls,

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,925
all routed to high-speed voice
and optical recognition computers.

30
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,177
They can analyse words,
spoken and written,

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,180
in every common language on Earth.

32
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,021
- The system's called Echelon.
- Yeah, I heard about Echelon.

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,945
I just don't understand how it's legal.

34
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,816
So what? It's just, like, a computer
that listens to and reads everything?

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,698
Yeah, looking for key words.

36
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,235
The system scans
two million conversations an hour.

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,116
Yeah. While shamelessly
violating the Constitution.

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,247
The National Security Agency argues

39
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,825
it's one of its most important weapons
against terrorists.

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,755
And they don't abuse the system.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,998
Somehow that's unreassuring.

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,583
Well, there's this man,
named Gerard Cuvee,

43
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,421
who figured out how to hack into Echelon.

44
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,929
He was able to pick up
secure military communications.

45
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:27,177
Because of that, he was able to locate
and destroy a US military lab in Dresden.

46
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,855
In London, we shut down
Cuvee's access to Echelon.

47
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,726
And, thank God, kept it away from SD-6.

48
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,646
So you get Echelon,
you become Big Brother.

49
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:44,277
The best thing about this mission - this guy
that I work with, this sweetheart Marshall,

50
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,785
was pulled out of SD-6
and taken into protective custody.

51
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,581
The CIA's gonna give him a life.

52
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,998
A real life.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,548
I can't tell you what a relief it is
knowing he's safe.

54
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,483
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

55
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,354
My employer would like it back.

56
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,896
Help me. Help, help, help, help.

57
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,624
No. Please. No. No. No.

58
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:46,301
Epoxy is a binary compound.
You have just ingested the resin.

59
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,927
Alone, it's not toxic.

60
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:57,483
But in combination with a hardener,
the epoxy cures,

61
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,233
passing from a liquid state,

62
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,318
through a gel state,

63
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,706
to a solid state.

64
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:20,082
This transformation
will puncture your vital organs,

65
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,388
block your windpipe,
causing you to suffocate.

66
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,012
So, let's start over.

67
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,514
The Echelon operating system -
where is it?

68
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,606
She was the only light I knew

69
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,700
She was the real

70
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,411
What?

71
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,120
I have a crush on a guy at work.

72
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,879
Really? Who is he?

73
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,174
Someone in my department. We've worked
together for about a year now.

74
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,093
You're kidding me.
What's his name?

75
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,798
Michael.

76
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,217
He's...

77
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,018
I don't know how to describe him.

78
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,226
He's smart and he's funny.

79
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,192
He's so cute.

80
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,770
- Hot cute, not goofy cute?
- Hot cute.

81
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,743
So why haven't I met this guy?

82
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,952
- He has a girlfriend.
- Of course he has.

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,949
Which is ultimately irrelevant anyway.

84
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,078
The bank has a policy
against co-workers dating.

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,542
- You know you could quit.
- Francie.

86
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,670
- I don't know what kind of hold...
- They don't have anything on me.

87
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,427
I just can't quit my job.

88
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,259
Thing is, I haven't heard you
talk like this in forever.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,755
No one in the free world
works as hard as you.

90
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,139
I know it seems that way.

91
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,522
Maybe you and Michael are destined.
Maybe he can quit.

92
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,476
I gotta go.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,739
- What's wrong?
- Marshall was abducted.

94
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,609
What?

95
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,779
Our plan was to intercept him
on his way home from LAX.

96
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,986
I know what our plan was.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,542
The extraction team was about to move in
when they saw this.

98
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,791
We ran the plates on one of the SUVs.
It was rented by Charles Williamson.

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,630
We put his photo ID
through a facial-recognition database.

100
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,551
It matched a known associate
of Gerard Cuvee.

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,431
What steps are being taken?

102
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,517
CIA has got one team radiating out from
the abduction point

103
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,595
and another in London retracing his steps.

104
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,564
Our steps. The mission in London
was my op. Marshall was my responsibility.

105
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,818
Before being captured,
Marshall emailed Cuvee's copy

106
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,146
of the Echelon access program to SD-6.

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,574
We took away Cuvee's access to Echelon
and gave it to SD-6?

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,452
Yes. But when SD-6 downloaded
the program they discovered a problem.

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,040
Marshall's email
was broken up into packets of data

110
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,789
and routed to SD-6 via Internet service
providers around the world.

111
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:09,552
However, there was a malfunction and
several data packets were not transmitted.

112
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,722
Without them, we cannot access Echelon.

113
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,179
Can we fill in the missing pieces?

114
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,222
I'm told it would take six months,
and even then there's no guarantee.

115
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,772
Do we know where did the error occur?

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,723
A government-operated facility
in Ho Chi Minh City.

117
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,570
I'm sending in Sydney and Dixon
to retrieve them.

118
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,320
Who's leading the team
to recover Marshall?

119
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,660
We've changed his access codes.

120
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,826
There is nothing that Marshall can tell
Cuvee that could possibly hurt us.

121
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,083
He will be tortured.
Most likely killed.

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,171
Oh, yes, I'm sure he will be.

123
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:50,761
I've already contacted SD-4. There'll be
a replacement in Op Tech by morning.

124
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,885
That was the extent of his concern.

125
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,224
It was as if someone
had overcooked his steak.

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,137
Well, you know what Cuvee's gonna do.

127
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,099
He's gonna try to get Marshall
to reverse-engineer the software,

128
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,139
get back online.

129
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,444
Yes. But you need two things to get on
Echelon: the software and an access point.

130
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,648
The software's like a map -
it leads you to the doorway of the system.

131
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,445
The access point is the door.
Most likely a satellite.

132
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,484
If we can find the door Cuvee went through
and lock it, he won't get on.

133
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,695
Not even with Marshall's help.

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,040
The problem is, Diagnostics has run
comprehensive systems analysis

135
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,407
and they can't find the breach.

136
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,872
Your mother thinks Cuvee may have used
a Russian network to make contact.

137
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,001
- Their version of Echelon, called SORM.
- She told you that?

138
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:35,549
I spoke with her. She thinks she can find
the back door. But she has terms.

139
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,475
If you wanna know where Cuvee
breached the system, it'll take time.

140
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:44,187
But I could do it - if I were given access
to Echelon. No restrictions.

141
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,025
Kendall will never give that to you.

142
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,728
Then I would simply ask you
to inform Mr Kendall

143
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:56,777
that the technicians he'll assign to do
the job will discover it is like quicksand.

144
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,740
Your father was correct.
I declined the offer.

145
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:04,125
Second only to Arvin Sloane, Irina Derevko
is the last person I want having access to

146
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,835
the US Government's secure network.

147
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,379
She'd be watched.

148
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,548
I mean, if she tried anything unusual,
we could just shut the system down.

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,338
Access to computers and
telecommunications equipment

150
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,215
is specifically prohibited by
your mother's immunity agreement.

151
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,464
- I think we might be wasting time.
- Agent Bristow,

152
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,057
we hire qualified technicians around here.
What do you say we give 'em a shot?

153
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,102
Your countermission is simple.

154
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,056
In Vietnam you'll download
the data packets SD-6 is looking for

155
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,903
and switch it with this.
It's corrupted data.

156
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,771
We'll have what SD-6 needs and
they'll never be able to access Echelon.

157
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,867
And, Syd, we'll find Marshall.

158
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,960
I will ask you one more time.

159
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,745
Where is the Echelon software
you took from us?

160
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,673
I swear on my mother's grave, I don't know.

161
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,555
And, though technically Mom's still alive,
she has picked out her grave site...

162
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,845
Refusal to cooperate has a price.

163
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,972
No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,231
We can find your mother.

165
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,278
OK. OK.

166
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,360
OK, OK.

167
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,993
I sent the Echelon software to SD-6.

168
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:31,038
There's nothing I can do about that,
I swear. But I saw the code. All of it.

169
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:36,208
And I have a photographic memory,
so I can re-create it, I can rewrite it.

170
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,881
Just don't hurt my mother. Please.

171
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,429
You leave my mother alone.

172
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,974
We're off to a very good start.

173
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,788
- What are you doing?
- Downgrading your network privileges.

174
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,954
Pending the outcome of my investigation,
your security clearance has been revoked.

175
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,669
Get out of my office.

176
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,542
When Emily was killed,
you claim you were in Taipei.

177
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,795
It is a fact, not a claim.

178
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,584
When a blackmailer stole $100 million
of the Alliance's money

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,506
in exchange for pictures of that murder,
you were...

180
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,926
On assignment in Istanbul.

181
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,310
Doing back-channel, unsupervised work
you conveniently arranged for yourself.

182
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,388
I am a senior officer with discretion

183
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,600
to arrange and carry out assignments
as I see fit.

184
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,153
- I will not be subject to a witch-hunt.
- You have no protections here.

185
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:42,280
No civil rights or civil liberties
or reasonable doubt.

186
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,738
- See that I'm not disturbed again.
- Yes, ma'am.

187
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,216
Get everyone you can from Op Tech, now.

188
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,144
Notify assets in Istanbul,
Taipei and Azerbaijan

189
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,898
we will need immediate assistance
in forging hard evidence

190
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,896
of my being in each of those locations
on specific days and times.

191
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,315
We have a situation. Ariana Kane -
the head of Alliance Counterintelligence -

192
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,324
she's investigating me in connection
with the murder of Emily Sloane.

193
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,280
She's checking your aliases, the places
you've been? You're covered for that.

194
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,740
Yes - passport stamps, plane tickets -
enough to withstand a cursory enquiry.

195
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,999
This is anything but cursory.

196
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,000
I did not kill Emily Sloane.
But I do have secrets.

197
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,961
And the last thing I can afford,
the last thing Sydney can afford,

198
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:45,887
is someone discovering
that my loyalty does not lie with SD-6.

199
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,664
We got the prints for Istanbul.
This goes with the car you rented in Taipei.

200
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,510
Have we backdated phoney charges
through my credit card for these locations?

201
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,552
Restaurants, rental car agencies, hotels...

202
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,805
Room charges, they'll be on file
with the respective concierges by morning.

203
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,849
Good.

204
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,471
- Bad time?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,019
What else is new?
You left word with Analysis

206
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,942
when Tippin's psych profile came back
you wanted to be informed.

207
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,443
- Anything I should know?
- Just run protocol and bring him in.

208
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,531
- You got it.
- What about surveillance?

209
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,404
I thought about rotoscoping you
out of some other surveillance feed,

210
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,487
but if they slow down the frame rate
they'd know it was altered.

211
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,205
That's why we went with the greenscreen.

212
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,706
This is the original surveillance feed
from the Istanbul Intercontinental.

213
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,542
This is the footage
that we filmed earlier.

214
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,916
Use some subpixel masking and we get...

215
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,469
Look, I even gave you a shadow.

216
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,555
We've got your fingerprints on
rental-car keys, on seat-belt buckles.

217
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,515
- Hair samples stitched into pillow cases.
- Good.

218
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,060
- I want to review everything.
- I think...

219
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,181
- Thinking isn't sufficient. I wanna know.
- You're right.

220
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,392
I wanna see the plane tickets.

221
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,995
Nina Bailes, from Tech-Sky Industries.
I'm here to see Mr Nguyen.

222
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:44,461
Accessing the system now.
I should be in mid-presentation.

223
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,009
Thank you for giving Tech-Sky
the opportunity

224
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,141
to talk with you about
our microsatellite technology.

225
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,394
At your direction, the projector will emit
a high-intensity pulsed strobe light

226
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,569
that flashes at the same frequency
as human brain waves,

227
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,145
effectively rendering targets unconscious.

228
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,574
I can get the data packets and return,
and they won't know I've been gone?

229
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,412
For three minutes
they'll experience it like a daydream.

230
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,197
Any longer, they'll regain consciousness
and you'll be found out.

231
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,957
Now, make sure
you put these glasses on first.

232
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,916
They're time-synchronised with the pulses,
so you'll be unaffected.

233
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,292
A small constellation of satellites
in low-Earth orbit

234
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,335
is cheaper to launch and maintain
than a traditional satellite network.

235
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,559
And if one microsat fails,
the entire system need not be replaced.

236
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:40,187
What you're looking at
is a typical Tech-Sky package.

237
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,725
OK, Syd, do your thing.
I'm almost in.

238
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,740
OK, Syd, I'm in.

239
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,080
- La'an Nguyen. Is that right?
- Right.

240
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,166
His ID will give you access
to any room in the ministry.

241
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,715
The data packets are in the hard drive,
which is located in the server room.

242
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:16,265
Two levels down, room 206.
You've got three minutes.

243
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,354
Syd, you've got two minutes
to find the right hard drive.

244
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,444
I'm not getting a positive signal.

245
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:38,201
Data packets aren't on drives one or two.
Drive three's missing.

246
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:43,414
- Is there a serial number in the third bay?
- 65733PY12.

247
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,457
- That hard drive is in for repairs.
- Where?

248
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,422
Level one, room 147.

249
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,300
- I'm on my way.
- No.

250
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,253
The repair room is just off the lobby.
I'll go. Meet me at the extraction point.

251
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,053
Dixon, no.
I'll make it.

252
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,265
Robert Milton.
I'm here for the Tech-Sky presentation.

253
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,816
One moment, please.

254
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,104
I'm so late already.
My boss is gonna kill me.

255
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:37,927
- I told you I could make it.
- Start over there. Work toward me.

256
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,027
Got it.

257
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,697
OK. Let's get out of here.

258
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,372
Sydney. The guards'll be here any minute.

259
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,551
This is a great victory.
You both should be very proud.

260
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:24,395
Thank you, sir.
But our thoughts are with Marshall.

261
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,848
- Has there been any word?
- No, I'm afraid not.

262
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:32,235
But our efforts continue.
As do our prayers.

263
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:41,193
So now SD-6 has everything it needs
to access Echelon.

264
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,363
Any idea on how long before
it's up and running?

265
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,126
Midnight tomorrow at the latest.

266
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,329
You should have seen the look on
Sloane's face when we got back.

267
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:54,213
I don't think I've ever seen him so happy
about a mission.

268
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,586
He said he was praying for Marshall.

269
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,086
Listen, about Marshall.

270
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,391
One of our teams traced Cuvee's unit
that abducted Marshall

271
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,103
to a safe house outside London.

272
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,773
By the time they got there
it was abandoned.

273
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,942
It was wired with four pounds of C-4.

274
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,246
They never had a chance.

275
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,245
It gets worse.

276
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,250
In light of the tragedy, the director
has ordered a halt in the search.

277
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,755
So for the moment Marshall's on his own.

278
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:44,599
You think maybe he could
point that somewhere else?

279
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,017
All right, never mind. It was dumb.

280
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,406
You know Sydney's sleeping off
another business trip?

281
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,612
- Yeah. To Dublin, I think.
- Glasgow.

282
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,369
- Two more, I set a world record.
- Will, I'm serious.

283
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,543
Last week it was Buenos Aires,
before it was Tokyo.

284
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,253
I mean, it never ends.

285
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,375
Fran, you know how much
that used to bug me, right?

286
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,792
I mean, I complained about it constantly.

287
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:24,844
But her job - you know, what she does -
it's important to her.

288
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,934
I don't care.
I'm still worried about her.

289
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:33,725
Ever since Danny died, all she does
is work. Oh, but now there's this new guy.

290
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:38,443
You should've heard her talking about him.
She sounded so happy.

291
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,736
- She told you about a guy?
- Yeah.

292
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:44,240
Somebody from work - Michael something.
You know him?

293
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,154
- Me? No.
- No, of course not.

294
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,412
Cos the jerks at the bank
where she slaves won't let them date,

295
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,910
cos it's against the rules.

296
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,167
- So they're not dating?
- No. He's actually dating somebody else.

297
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,460
She's just pining.

298
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,917
Oh, you know what?
The mailman left this for you.

299
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,346
Guess there's a package for you
at the post office.

300
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,969
Hey, Will.

301
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,476
Got your psych report back.
You did well.

302
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,567
- I'm not a sociopath?
- Well, I didn't say that.

303
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,274
- Do I have a job?
- Yes.

304
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,198
- A paying job?
- Yes. As an analyst.

305
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,533
You'll be asked to review classified
documents and file reports.

306
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,071
Think of it as writing articles,
only now your source material is classified.

307
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,490
In fact, your cover is as a journalist.

308
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,953
What does that mean?
Am I an agent? What?

309
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,165
Agents are field-trained. You're an analyst -
you're desk-trained. You sit at a desk.

310
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,288
That's cool.

311
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,384
The Agency operates a monthly travel
magazine called <i>Trade Roads. </i>

312
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,424
There's a small LA office.
Go there when we page you.

313
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,219
The materials we'll need analysed
will be there when you arrive.

314
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,179
But don't remove them from the building.

315
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,476
When you're done filling out
the paperwork, just give it to Bill.

316
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,482
He'll make sure it's processed.

317
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,521
I get health insurance?

318
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,019
Welcome to the CIA.

319
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,613
Thank you.

320
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,904
Listen, obviously you're a good guy.

321
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,412
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this job,

322
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,916
and what I'm gonna say is inappropriate.

323
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,709
But Sydney cares about you.

324
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,552
And what you guys have - or don't have -
means a great deal to her.

325
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,509
I wanna make sure you respect that.

326
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,785
I just got off the phone with the director -
again -

327
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,824
and he asked me again if I knew
we were in the intelligence business.

328
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,665
SD-6 is, by our best estimates, less than
12 hours away from accessing Echelon,

329
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:07,459
which would give them
all the intelligence capabilities of the CIA.

330
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:11,468
Our efforts to prevent Gerard Cuvee from
reaccessing Echelon ended in tragedy -

331
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,467
four agents killed.

332
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,807
As far as we know, your SD-6
Tech Ops officer Marshall Flinkman

333
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,942
could already have Cuvee
up and running again.

334
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,110
As for Derevko's intel on SORM,

335
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:31,531
Infosec has been unsuccessful in their
search for a back-door access point.

336
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,464
- What the hell just happened?
- I had to shut down the system.

337
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:47,297
SORM detected I was mapping its network
and spit out a virus.

338
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,294
My mother knew this would happen.

339
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,052
- That's the word she used - quicksand.
- She might've set up the virus.

340
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,058
Why keep her here
if you're not gonna use her?

341
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:00,189
You have said Derevko turned herself in
as part of a plan, something we can't see.

342
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,108
If you were right, then giving her access
to Echelon could only help that.

343
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:07,404
In this instance,
I think she could be an asset.

344
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,112
They found it - quicksand.

345
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:16,780
I told your father my terms.
Full access to the network, no restrictions.

346
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,918
Dad fought for you on this.
Don't make him regret it.

347
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,843
I'll need to send an access code.

348
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,013
How will we know you're not signalling
your organisation?

349
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,507
You won't.

350
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,557
Do it.

351
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:42,082
- Looks clean.
- Slow it down 200 per cent.

352
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:50,004
Still good. If this was faked,
it's the best job I've ever seen.

353
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:53,709
Is this the last of the surveillance feeds?

354
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,802
Karachi, Istanbul, Taipei.
Yeah, that's it.

355
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,223
I think you should see this.

356
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,728
Yes, yes, we should have full access
to Echelon in a matter of hours.

357
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,148
Forensic report.

358
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:19,360
OK, Alain. Yes, I'll let you know as soon as
we're fully operational. Yes, absolutely. OK.

359
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,829
Brain matter was found in the barrel
of one of Jack Bristow's service pistols.

360
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:30,754
According to the munitions log, he checked
out a Glock 19 compact for one day,

361
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,838
reporting a single accidental discharge
and no casualties.

362
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,137
I thought you were here to investigate
the events surrounding my wife's death.

363
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,057
The day Bristow checked out this weapon,
killed someone with it and covered it up

364
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,479
was the day your wife was murdered.

365
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,478
Do you have enough cells
to do a DNA profile?

366
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,945
- Already being done.
- Good.

367
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,367
Well, if it matches with Emily,
I want you to let me know immediately.

368
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,742
Of course.

369
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,499
You guys like cherry PEZ?
You know, those cherry PEZ -

370
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,588
the little candy that comes in
the little superhero thing?

371
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,845
Yeah. I collect the dispensers.

372
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,840
I thought I had
the largest collection in the world.

373
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,183
I actually wrote the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records</i> about it.

374
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,843
They said that there was a girl in Australia,
nine years old,

375
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,314
had a larger collection than me.

376
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,227
Which kinda sucked cos, well, she's
so much younger than me, you know,

377
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,365
and I'm so much older than her.

378
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:44,239
I'm kinda hungry. You guys
got some snacks or...? You probably...

379
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,503
I agree.

380
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,965
Something's wrong with my computer.
I can't get online. Can you check it?

381
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,378
Someone has launched
a "denial of service" attack on us.

382
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:05,549
We're getting pinged over and over.
It's slowing down the network.

383
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,226
That's odd.
They didn't spoof the origin IP.

384
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:15,020
How can someone be smart enough to
hack in and forget to cover their tracks?

385
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,700
Whoa, whoa.

386
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,493
What's going on? What?

387
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:28,074
We have a firewall. You broke through it.
I want to know why.

388
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:32,413
I was just trying to download an MP3
off Audiogalaxy.

389
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,255
An MP3?
You know, a music file?

390
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,298
This I am 75 per cent done with.

391
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:43,296
I just thought the rest of it
would go a lot faster with some tunes.

392
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,141
I'm just gonna show you the MP3.

393
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,389
You like Sammy Hagar?

394
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,866
I'll go back to the program.

395
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,831
Come with me.

396
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,837
Marshall's in Mexico City?

397
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:21,550
He signalled us through the computer. We
traced him through the IP address he used.

398
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:22,917
Uh-huh.

399
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:26,097
OK. I'll notify the extraction team at once.

400
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,966
We'd like your permission
to conduct the operation ourselves.

401
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,350
Yes, of course.

402
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:43,442
- Are you making any progress here?
- Like Echelon, SORM has access points.

403
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:47,697
If I can locate the directory,
we will know if there's any access points.

404
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,325
That we could keep SD-6 and Cuvee
off the system.

405
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,285
I'd like a coffee, please.

406
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,460
Cream or sugar?

407
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,086
- Black.
- Thank you.

408
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,888
- Kane called a meeting.
- Does she know anything?

409
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,565
Unclear, but I'm told she has two units from
security section prepared to take me in.

410
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,312
I have to be ready for anything.

411
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,277
I have to admit I'm impressed.

412
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,150
I've rarely found a record
as well-documented as yours.

413
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,329
You couldn't have been more thorough
if you tried.

414
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,084
If I may ask, what is it you're looking for?

415
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,663
There are only two pieces of evidence
I haven't been able to corroborate.

416
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,376
Help me with them,
and we're finished.

417
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,467
Damn, she's got the place wired.

418
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,257
Jack, we make six agents
from security section.

419
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,182
Every time you make a phone call
on your STU,

420
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:54,928
the SIM card on your cellphone
communicates with the local cell tower.

421
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:58,188
Those communications are recorded
on the card's memory chip.

422
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,026
It's kind of like a minitravelogue.

423
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:05,109
We need the cell tower signal codes
for Istanbul, Karachi and Taipei.

424
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,487
Jack, listen to me.
What pocket is your phone in?

425
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:11,869
If it's in the left jacket pocket, hold up
one finger. In the right pocket, hold up two.

426
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:16,284
- You two ready to order?
- Not yet. Thanks.

427
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,543
You have my phone records.

428
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:24,215
Which, we both know, could easily
be forged. So I'd like your phone.

429
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:30,012
You said there were two things.

430
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:34,015
Who is Stephen Haladki?

431
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:39,264
He was a CIA agent loyal to Irina Derevko.

432
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,017
Whom you murdered.

433
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:45,937
We found brain matter in a gun you fired
on the day Emily was murdered.

434
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,031
I admit I thought DNA tests
would prove you killed her,

435
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,450
but instead they prove you killed Haladki.

436
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:56,617
We had reliable intel that Derevko was
accessing information through the CIA.

437
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,993
Her source turned out to be Haladki.

438
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:03,253
He was crucial to her operation
and had to be removed.

439
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,009
I got the tower codes.

440
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,304
We can't wait for Bristow's phone.
Give me yours.

441
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,306
Vaughn, give me your phone.

442
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,677
The card's been reprogrammed.

443
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,054
I'll stamp Jack's serial number on your
SIM card. You'll have to switch them out.

444
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,807
Here you go.

445
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,943
If Haladki worked with Derevko,
why hide his death from Sloane?

446
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:29,524
The death of a CIA agent
draws unwanted attention and focus.

447
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:34,906
If that happens, the safest recourse
is to say nothing. Ever.

448
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:48,292
- Are we through?
- As soon as I get your SIM card.

449
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,461
Yes, of course.

450
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,215
I'll be in touch.

451
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,284
Move in on the package.

452
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:30,609
Are you ready to party?

453
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,277
- Syd, I'm ready to receive.
- "Are we ready to party?"

454
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,367
I speak nine languages.
Techno is not one of them.

455
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,257
I'll need cover

456
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,004
now.

457
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,095
Dixon, wish me luck.

458
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:28,119
I've piggybacked onto the surveillance
feed. Are you getting a signal?

459
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,828
One second.

460
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,625
OK, Syd, I'm in.

461
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:43,558
He's in a storage room on the 47th floor.
Take the eastern stairwell.

462
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,766
The room should be
the second door on your left.

463
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,605
- Guards?
- I make two.

464
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,225
I'll lock down the elevators,
secure all access doors.

465
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:56,482
That should keep everyone else away,
but, Syd, be careful.

466
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,951
Program's done. We'll be uplinked
to Echelon in two minutes.

467
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,151
Excellent.

468
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:16,918
Tell your boss, or whatever,
that I'm finished.

469
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,217
The program's written.

470
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:34,063
We estimated SD-6 would have Echelon
operational by midnight. It's ten after.

471
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:37,153
The blue are Echelon access points,
the red are SORM access points.

472
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,816
You said you would find
ones that overlapped.

473
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,864
I said I'd find out if one overlapped.

474
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,951
- And if they don't?
- Then I can't help you.

475
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,558
You know where you can go, you freak?

476
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,971
- Any idea?
- Kill him.

477
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:12,189
Straight to hell, my friend.
Straight to hell.

478
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,563
Kill his mother.

479
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,223
- Hi.
- Wow.

480
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:58,184
Let's go.

481
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,146
Syd, we've got a problem.

482
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:04,690
I've been locked out.
Their security system is operational.

483
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,110
Get out of there now.

484
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:20,467
Dixon, we're trapped.

485
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,884
- I'll get over to you now.
- There's no time.

486
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,726
Come on.

487
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,437
- We're on the 47th floor.
- Remember when we flew to London,

488
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,396
I said I compressed a high glide tactical
parachute in the lining of my jacket?

489
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,111
Well, as luck would have it,
this one's got it too,

490
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:45,945
along with a hyperextending tandem sling.
Come here.

491
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,742
I got it.

492
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:54,114
My name is Marshall J Flinkman
and I'm here to rescue you.

493
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,712
If this was some kind of manipulation...

494
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,480
The overlapping access point.

495
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,854
As promised.

496
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,903
Confirming a match with Echelon
right now.

497
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:28,532
Close the access point
and SD-6 will be shut out.

498
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,112
We have confirmation.

499
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:35,789
It's a match.

500
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:41,000
As promised, Alain,
we have Echelon at our disposal.

501
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,220
I'm afraid something's happened.

502
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:57,562
So Marshall saved our lives.

503
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:01,811
How did I return the favour?
By bringing him back to SD-6.

504
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,650
We had to, Syd. Bringing Marshall
into the CIA didn't make sense any more,

505
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,565
not after Sloane got the Echelon program.

506
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:10,326
I know. It's just...

507
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,197
Marshall has no idea
who he's really working for.

508
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,205
Here by my side

509
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,043
An angel

510
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,459
Here by my side

511
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,041
The devil

512
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,593
Never turn your back on me

513
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:41,729
It won't always be like this. Right?

514
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:46,270
It will end.

515
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,198
I should go.

516
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,334
Do not turn on the lights.

517
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:11,210
You shouldn't have run from her, Jack.

518
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:14,091
Kane needs someone to blame.

519
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:19,389
Since she can't find who really murdered
Emily, she's decided to blame me.

520
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,265
I did not murder your wife.

521
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:31,901
But if I don't find the person who did,
Kane will frame me for it.

522
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,775
I have some leads.
I need you to pursue them for me.

523
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:41,202
Can I trust you to do that?

524
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:42,751
Of course.

525
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,706
This will stay between us.

526
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,990
- Hello?
- Agent Kane, Arvin Sloane.

527
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:17,576
Jack Bristow just left my house.
