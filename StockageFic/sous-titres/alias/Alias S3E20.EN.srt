1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,295
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:05,007
Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn.

3
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:06,555
You Bill Vaughn's kid?

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,802
Yeah.
He was my father.

5
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,219
He was a good man.

6
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,052
Thank you.

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,595
The Passenger is...

8
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,982
your sister.

9
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,313
According to Rambaldi's
manuscript,

10
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,611
The Hourglass will only
reveal the location

11
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:26,023
of The Passenger to one man.

12
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:26,983
Her father.

13
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,156
Sloane.

14
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:30,154
And he's going to be dead
in six hours.

15
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:32,322
Jack, I want you
to meet Marlon Bell.

16
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,906
He runs legal policy at Justice.

17
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,750
I was telling the director how
pleased I am you caught Sloane.

18
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,630
And if you don't mind
my saying so,

19
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:44,131
Iooking forward to seeing
the son of a bitch die.

20
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:10,693
I orchestrated this because
and only because I need you.

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,626
What's going on? Your message
said it was important.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,790
You were right.

23
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,334
About what?

24
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,711
Lauren's the mole.
She works for The Covenant.

25
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,339
This was supposed to be over.

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,340
With Sloane executed,
we reached a dead end

27
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,591
in our pursuit of The Passenger.

28
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,559
Lauren is too valuable an asset.

29
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,219
We can feed disinformation
to The Covenant.

30
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,066
Keep them from impeding Sydney
and Jack's investigation.

31
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,060
As soon as The Passenger
is located,

32
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,861
Lauren will be taken
into custody.

33
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:47,271
Meanwhile, Weiss will
maintain surveillance.

34
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:49,109
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:01,085
I wasn't sure I should come.

36
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,504
I appreciate you
putting aside your anger.

37
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,426
Sydney, you were right.

38
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,428
I did find evidence that
Sloane was assisting The Trust

39
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:11,889
in their pursuit of Rambaldi.

40
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:14,096
Why are you telling me this now?

41
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,260
Sloane's dead.

42
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:19,306
Actually, that's why
I called you here.

43
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,780
I was about to give
Director Bell

44
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,493
the evidence to clear Sloane

45
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,947
when I realised he was
a member of The Trust.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,412
I was unclear as to
what their agenda was,

47
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:42,205
but I did know executing
Sloane was part of it.

48
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,004
The only sure way to save his
life was to allow him to die.

49
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:51,041
Your father was kind enough to
offer me a final glass of wine.

50
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,842
It was laced
with a tetrodotoxin compound.

51
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:56,601
It counteracted
the lethal injection

52
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,176
by reducing my cardiac
and respiratory functions.

53
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,848
Mimicking death?

54
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,062
That's right.

55
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,854
Whatever grief my apparent death
might have caused you,

56
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:07,735
I wish I could have
spared you the pain.

57
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,860
When I heard you were dead,
any grief

58
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:13,530
was over the possibility
of never knowing my sister.

59
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:16,028
I did not grieve for you.

60
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,160
I see.

61
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:25,793
Well, in the interest
of finding your sister,

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,288
may I have The Hourglass?

63
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:38,344
I know you've been withholding
something from the CIA.

64
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,641
Even from The Trust.

65
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:44,687
Why is The Passenger important?

66
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:48,143
What is your daughter's
real value?

67
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,446
While I was searching for her,
I made a discovery.

68
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,616
I came across
an old Rambaldi text.

69
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,738
In it, Rambaldi prophecied
that there would be a person,

70
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,072
a passenger,
who would be capable

71
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,167
of serving as
a direct conduit to him.

72
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:07,751
The text contained
a formula for an elixir.

73
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,960
So I followed
the instructions exactly.

74
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,292
According to Rambaldi,
this elixir, if injected,

75
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,924
would bring about an altered
state of consciousness,

76
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:20,806
allowing The Passenger
to channel a message.

77
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:28,225
This message is rumoured to be
the key to Rambaldi's endgame.

78
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,191
I sampled the elixir myself.

79
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:36,483
Hoping to make myself
the conduit.

80
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,237
It didn't work.

81
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,654
It's meant only for her.

82
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,501
If The Covenant finds her...

83
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:50,832
...they will expose her
to the elixir in massive doses.

84
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,506
It will lay waste to her psyche.

85
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,883
More likely, it will kill her.

86
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:03,178
All I want to do
is to protect my child.

87
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,515
How do we find her?

88
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,433
We use this.

89
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,168
I thought you were
working from home.

90
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:39,297
I just came past
to pick up these files.

91
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,809
I've been thinking
about that trip to Fiji.

92
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,894
Getting one of those bungalows
perched on the ocean.

93
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,602
Well, what about next month?

94
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,853
Be serious.

95
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:54,477
I am. We've been talking about
getting away for over a year.

96
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:57,441
And visiting your mom
in Virginia doesn't count.

97
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,823
I love you.

98
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,288
Hello?

99
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,167
- Agent Vaughn?
- Yeah. Who's this?

100
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,458
Thomas Brill.
Jack Bristow introduced us.

101
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,206
Right.
What can I do for you?

102
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:16,168
There are some things you need
to know about your father.

103
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,501
Meet me
at the Transatlantic Building.

104
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,793
By the freight elevator.

105
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:22,129
Okay, I'll be there.
Thanks.

106
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,512
- Who was that?
- Just the dry cleaners.

107
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,970
Apparently I've had a suit there
for over a month.

108
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,020
Would you like me to pick it up?

109
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,565
No.
You've got enough work.

110
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,856
- I'll see you at home then.
- Okay.

111
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,928
I told you that I worked
with your father.

112
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:12,099
But I didn't tell you I was
with him on his final mission.

113
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,776
I know how my father died.

114
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,612
You don't have a clue.

115
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,903
Yeah, he was working
on something.

116
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,197
An operation that wasn't
sanctioned by the CIA.

117
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:27,078
My father would never go
against the CIA.

118
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:28,871
He was a follower of Rambaldi.

119
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,949
That's impossible.

120
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:35,160
He died protecting
the little girl.

121
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,543
The followers knew
she was The Passenger.

122
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:39,790
He broke her out of KGB custody.

123
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,007
But he didn't trust
the CIA, either.

124
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,298
So he took her where she would
be safe with other followers.

125
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,225
The man you are describing
is not my father.

126
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,847
Your father was the best man
I've ever known.

127
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,353
He gave his life to make sure
that girl would be safe.

128
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,433
If you don't stop
what's happening,

129
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,693
his sacrifice
will be for nothing.

130
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:18,827
Ah, no, no!
Damn it!

131
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,877
You know what you've got to do.

132
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,803
Just make sure
that they don't get to her.

133
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,425
Why did you come to me?

134
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,267
Because it's what he would
want me to do.

135
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:55,416
You claim this is a battery
for one of Rambaldi's artefacts

136
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,162
which can locate The Passenger.

137
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,412
Before we risk exposure
to The Trust,

138
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:02,672
we need to be 100% certain
they have this artefact.

139
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,917
I know they have it.
I gave it to them.

140
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,505
According to my contact,

141
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,256
The Trust
has a cold-storage vault

142
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,432
concealed
in the Smithsonian here.

143
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,472
The vault is secured
by a 5-key retinal system.

144
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,389
It's safe to assume
it corresponds

145
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,940
with the five members.

146
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,187
Do we know who they are?

147
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,813
We know they're high-ranking
government officials,

148
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,860
but we've only been able
to confirm one.

149
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,402
Marlon Bell,
D.O.J. Division Director.

150
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:30,441
I imagine a visit from a ghost
will unearth the other four.

151
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,877
The Secretary of State
goes before committee tomorrow.

152
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,002
He wants that brief out
by the end of the day.

153
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,917
With all due respect,
Director Bell,

154
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,084
even with The Patriot Act,
the legal footing's shaky.

155
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,755
Find the precedents.

156
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:50,633
- We've already gone over that.
- Find them.

157
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,267
Sir?

158
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,012
Sir?

159
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,395
I've tapped
into Bell's phone line.

160
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:06,487
He should have made contact
with The Trust by now.

161
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:11,069
Sydney, there's something
you should know.

162
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:16,037
When I first learned of Sloane's
affair with your mother...

163
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,333
I was forced to consider
the possibility

164
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,373
that I wasn't in fact
your biological father.

165
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,789
- You don't even need to --
- It's not the case.

166
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,590
I had our medical files
examined.

167
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,469
Our relationship is clear.

168
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,923
I wanted you to know,
during that brief time

169
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,852
before I was reassured...

170
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,606
...my feelings for you
never changed.

171
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,069
Dad.

172
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,320
He's picking up.

173
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,164
We have a situation
that requires

174
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,909
our immediate attention.

175
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,495
We need to meet.

176
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:04,255
Arvin Sloane is alive.

177
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,754
Your friend Brill
managed to elude us.

178
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,680
You, however,
were not so fortunate.

179
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:15,886
We've known for a while

180
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,641
your father was a follower
of Rambaldi.

181
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:22,564
And we were hoping
they'd contact you.

182
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,354
But there are three things
you should understand.

183
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:29,488
The first involves this item
I hold in my hand.

184
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:36,035
It's capable of delivering
up to 500,000 volts.

185
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,409
Not enough to kill you.

186
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,203
Just enough to let you
wish it would.

187
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:43,918
Second, I believe
Mr. Brill disclosed

188
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,043
the location of The Passenger,

189
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:49,297
which means I won't stop
until you tell me.

190
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:53,215
And third, Mr. Vaughn,

191
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:56,673
is that I'm going to enjoy this
more than I should.

192
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,130
Lauren Reed evaded
our surveillance

193
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,716
sometime between 2.10
and 2.47 P.M.

194
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,128
Law enforcement officials
at every level

195
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,467
have been put on alert.

196
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,763
We've also lost contact
with Agent Vaughn.

197
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,140
He's not responding
to his calls.

198
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,470
We believe he may have
been compromised.

199
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,806
Agent Weiss will assemble
a search team.

200
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,307
Be ready to move
as soon as we get a lead.

201
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,275
Remember, your glasses
need a five-second lock

202
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:56,034
on each person
for the scan to register.

203
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,611
Wish me luck.

204
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,572
Sydney, Sloane's on his way
to the meeting

205
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,574
of The Trust
to obtain the retinal scans.

206
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,502
Make sure you get to the vault,
and we'll have the codes.

207
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,997
Copy that.

208
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,127
I'm in position.

209
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,673
Hello, Miss Gerard?

210
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,219
I'm Phillip Terrance.

211
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,255
We spoke earlier.

212
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,388
Call me Shannon.

213
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,312
Amazing, isn't it?

214
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:26,807
36 feet.

215
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,389
Longest neck
of any known dinosaur.

216
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:32,568
Not a lot of people know
that mamenchisaurus actually had

217
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:33,603
an extra brain.

218
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,941
In its spinal cord.

219
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,818
To control its hind legs
and tail.

220
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,118
You said you're writing
a research paper

221
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,618
on theropod dinosaurs?

222
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,077
Yeah, specifically
theropods and archaeopteryx

223
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,712
and the similarities.

224
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,833
Oh, so you think birds are
descended from dinosaurs?

225
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,630
Not that there's
conclusive proof.

226
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,759
It drives me crazy
when orthodox types

227
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,801
refuse to even examine
the evidence.

228
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:05,343
That thinking got Giordano Bruno
burned at the stake.

229
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,348
You know, we just received
the Hainan fossil from China.

230
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,605
I have to admit
I was hoping to see it.

231
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,062
Well, no,
it's still in analysis.

232
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,442
That area is restricted
to visitors.

233
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,282
But I could make an exception.

234
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:36,296
I must say, I'm impressed.

235
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:40,011
Of course, it's on
the lowest setting.

236
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,139
But I'm through
showing restraint.

237
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,562
I'll ask you again.

238
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,066
Where is The Passenger?

239
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:58,230
Holding that thing.

240
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:02,158
You almost look like
you've reached puberty.

241
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,706
You have great timing.

242
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,666
We only have it on loan
from China till Wednesday.

243
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:17,584
Have you already done
the C.T. scan?

244
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,755
Last week.

245
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:22,671
I would love
to take a look at it.

246
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,219
Well, they're in radiology.

247
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,589
I'll go get 'em.

248
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:29,804
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

249
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,686
I'm headed to the vault.

250
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:35,855
Copy that.

251
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,058
We're on schedule.

252
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,316
You can proceed.

253
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,819
Greetings from the dead,
gentlemen.

254
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:49,288
Standing by to receive.

255
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:50,323
Copy that.

256
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,789
We're retrieving
the retinal scans now.

257
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:54,585
I thought we had an agreement.

258
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,707
My Rambaldi artefacts
and expertise

259
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,174
in exchange for my freedom.

260
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,880
Of course, once I served
my purpose,

261
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,547
you saw fit to dispose of me.

262
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:06,425
First scan complete.
Move on.

263
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,804
The cover story that you
planned on releasing.

264
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:12,599
Arvin Sloane killed
in a boating accident

265
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,681
off the coast of Saint Lucia.

266
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:18,024
Tragic, with a slight taint
of overly extravagant lifestyle.

267
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,985
Complete.
Move on.

268
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,731
Actually, I would have thought

269
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:25,488
that an automobile accident
would be more to your taste.

270
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:28,115
Clearly, I underestimated
your creativity.

271
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:30,530
Got a lock.
Hold it just two more seconds.

272
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,248
I should have been
thinking more clearly.

273
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,828
We got it.

274
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,578
Gentlemen, the facts.

275
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,042
Sydney, I'm sending
the first three now.

276
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:41,372
Uplink complete.

277
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,045
I'm moving to authorise.

278
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,049
I am afraid it will
never see the light of day.

279
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,466
And let me tell you why.

280
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,723
We've got it.

281
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,598
I don't think the most
clandestine committee

282
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,768
in the U.S. government

283
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:58,265
would want such sordid details
made public,

284
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,479
which is why I'm going to
leave this room unharmed.

285
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,062
If I get so much
as a traffic ticket,

286
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,613
the next time you hear
this information will be on CNN.

287
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,694
That's enough.

288
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,406
I will not be blackmailed
by a petty criminal.

289
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,168
We didn't get it.
Don't let him leave.

290
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,209
I forgot to tell you something.

291
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:22,206
I know all about your son
and his unseemly predilections.

292
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,716
Try thinking of it
as mutually assured destruction.

293
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:28,092
We've got it.
Get out.

294
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:30,302
Thank you for your time, gents.

295
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,807
Final scan is on its way.

296
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,161
Shannon?

297
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,040
What are you doing?

298
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,084
I'm sorry.
You've been so nice.

299
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,430
I've got the package.

300
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:12,087
Meet me at the rendezvous
point as scheduled.

301
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,654
There it is.

302
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,494
What is it?

303
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,743
It looks like brainwaves.

304
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,411
We found her.

305
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,342
Don't touch me.

306
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,509
Michael, please.

307
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,302
Sark's going to give you
the Inferno Protocol.

308
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:00,346
You can't survive.

309
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,227
Not after everything
you've been through.

310
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,853
What do you care?

311
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:09,229
Not everything was a lie.

312
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,816
Get him down
and put him on the cot.

313
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,708
You can't do this procedure now.
He needs time to recover.

314
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,787
Why this sudden concern
for your husband's well-being?

315
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,549
If he dies, he'll take
the information with him.

316
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,171
Whatever feelings you have
for him don't concern me.

317
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,882
Please listen.

318
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,222
Please escort Miss Reed
out of here.

319
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:40,887
Now, where were we?

320
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,313
I don't understand. How can
a brain scan help us find her?

321
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,025
Each individual has a signature
brain-wave pattern

322
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,072
as unique as a fingerprint.

323
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,447
So to exploit this,
the D.O.D.'s developed

324
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,694
an experimental
satellite network

325
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,113
capable of remote
encephalography.

326
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,330
- Reading brainwaves from orbit.
- Right.

327
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,873
I just spoke with my contact
at D.O.D.

328
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:07,461
He uplinked the EEG readings to
the Defence Satellite Network.

329
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:08,580
We have a location.

330
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,706
Where is she?

331
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:10,631
Chechnya.

332
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,960
A labour camp
for female prisoners

333
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,596
on the outskirts of Kamyshev.

334
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,931
My contact was able to check
the prison's central database.

335
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,259
He found her under the alias
Talia Kozlov.

336
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,895
She's being held in sector C.

337
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,094
She's incarcerated.

338
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,431
We've been operating
under the assumption

339
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,648
that she's an innocent
in need of rescue.

340
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,360
Given that she's being detained,

341
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,779
I think those assumptions
need to be re-examined.

342
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:37,575
She's my daughter,
and we're going to find her.

343
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,656
Considering this
new information,

344
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,040
you may need to adjust
your expectations

345
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,584
regarding your sister as well.

346
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:53,633
After Mom died,
I used to have these daydreams.

347
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,627
I would imagine her
leading my Girl Scout troop

348
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,092
or taking me shopping
for new school clothes.

349
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:01,347
I thought if only she'd lived,

350
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:03,725
she would have been
my best friend.

351
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,190
When I learned the truth
about her

352
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:10,568
and saw Irina
for who she really was...

353
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,563
...I was devastated.

354
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:18,236
I won't make
the same mistake twice.

355
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:28,286
What's going on?

356
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,004
It's over.

357
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,505
The Protocol worked.
Somehow you survived.

358
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,334
- Michael, listen to me.
- Did I tell him?

359
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,588
You told Sark everything.
He'll be back any second.

360
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,591
You have to get out of here.

361
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:45,220
Why are you doing this?

362
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,848
For me, our marriage was real.

363
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:51,230
The only real thing in my life.

364
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,064
Go.

365
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,439
Hey, are you okay?

366
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,066
I need to get to a phone.

367
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,562
Here. Use mine.

368
00:24:00,657 --> 00:24:02,068
Thanks.

369
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,109
Dispatch.

370
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:08,529
This is Officer 2300708.

371
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:11,624
Patch me through
to Director Dixon immediately.

372
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,961
Vaughn, where are you?

373
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:17,454
The Covenant knows
the location of The Passenger.

374
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,541
Sark's moving on the lead.

375
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,303
How did they acquire the intel?

376
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:23,964
From me.

377
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:26,890
We'll put together a tactical
team and beat them to it.

378
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,967
Where is The Passenger now?

379
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:37,898
You cut out.

380
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,729
Bad reception.

381
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:45,440
Vaughn, what's wrong?

382
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:50,654
Is Sydney back from Hong Kong?

383
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,044
Don't move!

384
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,665
Get on the ground.

385
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:43,585
On the ground.

386
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:47,336
You're smarter than I thought.

387
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:22,433
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I'm your sister.

388
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:25,766
I know that sounds crazy.

389
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:30,817
I'm sorry it took me so long
to find you, but I'm here now,

390
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:34,028
and I am going
to get you out of here.

391
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:37,866
You will be safe now.
I promise you.

392
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,493
By the way, I almost forgot.

393
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,661
My name is Sydney.

394
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,043
This was taken
from the surveillance camera

395
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,753
at the Garland Industrial Plant.

396
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:51,464
I was able to enhance
the footage.

397
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:55,924
This was taken
from the surveillance feed

398
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:58,508
from the rear of the building.

399
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:02,189
Get the listing for every
business, ATM, traffic light

400
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,554
within a five-mile radius.

401
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,939
Have them pull
their surveillance feeds.

402
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:09,313
I want to know where they went
after they left the scene.

403
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,286
We're about to embark
onto a procedure

404
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:28,004
the CIA was more than willing
to use on me.

405
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:33,178
You have to admit
the reversal is a tad ironic.

406
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,679
This time, my friend,
it's for real.

407
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,327
You met with a man.

408
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:01,621
Who was he?

409
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,416
Brill.

410
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,042
He knew my father.

411
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,132
And did Brill tell you
where The Passenger is?

412
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:14,210
He told me.

413
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:16,927
Where is she?

414
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,302
No.

415
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,178
I'll ask you again.

416
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,687
Where is The Passenger?

417
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:31,520
Increase the dosage.

418
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:38,284
What is it?

419
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,111
Really?

420
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:45,744
And to who do I owe my thanks?

421
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,497
We're done here.

422
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,581
We have her location.

423
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:52,298
What about him?

424
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:54,091
Kill him.

425
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,391
Who are you?

426
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,147
Later.

427
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,013
Come on.
Come on.

428
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,014
We got to get to the tunnel.

429
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:32,518
Come on.

430
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,520
Come on.

431
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,447
We got the surveillance footage

432
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,739
from 74 cameras
around the dock yards.

433
00:31:41,826 --> 00:31:44,152
There's some major freakazoid
stuff going on.

434
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,571
Not a place you want to
go to after hours.

435
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:49,155
Unless you're into
that sort of thing.

436
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,035
Anyway, I was able to
piece together the feeds.

437
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:52,994
What did you find?

438
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,875
After they abducted Vaughn, they
were spotted two minutes later

439
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,503
on 5th and Grand.

440
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:02,968
A rooftop camera caught them
turning onto Frontage Road.

441
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:06,223
- Marshall, where are they now?
- I'm getting to that.

442
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,265
Final destination.
4384 Alfano Street.

443
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,597
- Abandoned packaging warehouse.
- Thank you.

444
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,889
Yes.

445
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:30,823
Come on, buddy.

446
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:31,948
I'm right here.

447
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,917
You're gonna be okay.

448
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:39,002
Get a medivac down here now!

449
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:43,878
Go.
I'll catch up.

450
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:46,427
No, I'm not leaving you.

451
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,390
I feel faint.

452
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:51,561
Here, you just need to sit down
just for a minute.

453
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,722
Here you go.
Here you go.

454
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,563
Take some deep breaths.

455
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,566
Yeah.

456
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,373
So who are you?

457
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,337
You can call me Talia.

458
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:22,045
I know that's not
your real name.

459
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,255
Well, what were you doing
back there?

460
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:29,135
Why were you pretending
to be catatonic?

461
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:31,386
I can't tell you.

462
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,773
You're an agent.

463
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:40,813
Argentine Intelligence.

464
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:47,949
What you said back there...

465
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:49,945
...is true.

466
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:53,031
We're sisters.

467
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:11,007
How did you find me?

468
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:14,593
It wasn't just me.

469
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:18,062
It was your father.

470
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:22,058
My father?

471
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:24,107
Yeah.

472
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,608
He's waiting for you.

473
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:47,969
Nadia.

474
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,760
My name is Nadia.

475
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,449
When Will used to talk
about his sister Amy,

476
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:21,414
he was always so exasperated.

477
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:24,544
He said she was a flake.

478
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,674
He told me I was lucky
to be an only child.

479
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:32,424
But I knew he was lying.

480
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:34,389
He loved her.

481
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:39,348
I always wanted what they had.

482
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:47,645
I have a sister.

483
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:52,741
I believe you assured me

484
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:56,410
you weren't going to make
the same mistake twice.

485
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,757
I know who you are.

486
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:24,183
Well, then you know
about my criminal past.

487
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:27,402
You also know that I've changed.

488
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,652
But you need to know why.

489
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:35,031
I never knew I had a daughter.

490
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:40,410
I didn't know until two years
ago that you even existed.

491
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:45,087
When I found out,
I felt total and complete joy.

492
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,836
I just wanted to go out
and find you immediately.

493
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:51,711
But then...

494
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,091
...it struck me.

495
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,008
The shame.

496
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:01,055
I was ashamed of the man I was.

497
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:03,684
I knew I wasn't worthy of you.

498
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:11,941
I wasn't worthy of your love.
I wasn't worthy of your respect.

499
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:16,611
From that moment on,
I vowed to change.

500
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:21,615
I didn't want to meet
my daughter face-to-face...

501
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,790
...and have her despise me.

502
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:35,004
Stay here.

503
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:43,307
We want The Passenger unharmed.

504
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:45,980
Move. Move!

505
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:11,172
Where are they?

506
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,385
They cannot have escaped.

507
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:32,521
What is this?

508
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:38,820
Sloane set us up.

509
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,535
He betrayed us.

510
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,660
Agents, move out!

511
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,248
This was a Chechen safe house.

512
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:55,004
It was Sloane's suggestion
we seek refuge here.

513
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,169
Sloane was the only person
who knew where we were.

514
00:38:57,262 --> 00:38:59,634
He tipped The Covenant,
lured them here,

515
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:02,392
giving him a chance
to escape with Nadia.

516
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,960
Are you alright?

517
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:36,166
I'm fine.

518
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,093
The Passenger.

519
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:40,051
Did you find her?

520
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,757
Yes.

521
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:44,173
But she's gone.

522
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,058
She's missing.

523
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:48,513
You can't go after her.

524
00:39:49,773 --> 00:39:50,971
What?

525
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:52,773
Your sister.

526
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:55,732
You have to let her go.

527
00:39:56,613 --> 00:39:58,605
You're tired.
I should let you sleep.

528
00:39:58,698 --> 00:40:02,862
My father was killed because
he took her from the KGB.

529
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:05,278
He hid her from your mother.

530
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,613
That's why she murdered him.

531
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:12,288
I met someone
who told me the prophecy.

532
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:15,130
The Passenger and The Chosen One
shall battle.

533
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,338
Neither will survive.

534
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:20,095
You can't see her again.

535
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:45,868
Please.

536
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:49,327
Don't do this.

537
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,501
Please don't.

538
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,008
I only wish
there could be another way.

539
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,821
I'm so sorry.

540
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,694
I'm so sorry.
