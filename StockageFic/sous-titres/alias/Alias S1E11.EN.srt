1
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,564
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:10,736
Seven years ago I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,406
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,952
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:23,040
That's when I learned the truth,
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:26,335
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,588
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:34,927
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,350
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,936
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,688
My father.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,109
Ineni Hassan
has broken an agreement with SD-6.

13
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,777
He has stolen from us.

14
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,946
Any intel on where in Havana he is?

15
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:58,200
No, we don't know.
That's why I'm sending you to Cuba.

16
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,286
I want Hassan...

17
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,997
...dead.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,625
- What's the countermission?
- Sloane might want Hassan dead

19
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,627
but the CIA needs him alive.

20
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,714
They're making a huge mistake,
trusting Hassan.

21
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:17,470
They will learn what happens
when they send someone after me.

22
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:18,971
Hassan has your father.

23
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:24,268
Then you'll understand that I'm going
to need your help... to get to Cuba.

24
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:39,366
Prove to me that
you are willing to go against SD-6.

25
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:41,577
Anything.

26
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,803
Aim the gun at this woman
if you are who you say you are.

27
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,055
And kill her.

28
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,009
Shooting this agent proves nothing.

29
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:43,097
To me it proves everything. You come
to me and you make me an offer.

30
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:47,143
You tell me that you are willing
to work against SD-6,

31
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:50,479
and you're working alone.
Then she shows up.

32
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:53,524
Obviously, SD-6 sent her
without my knowledge.

33
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,777
Then you should have no problem
proving your loyalty.

34
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:02,783
Kill this agent, I'll believe you,
and I'll accept your offer.

35
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:07,288
And if you choose not to, I'll just
have to say goodbye to both of you.

36
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,341
Don't do it! Hands in the air! Now!

37
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:28,017
- Took a while to get what you meant.
- I was blinking as fast as I could.

38
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,979
- I was, like, "Hard on your light"?
- Guard on your right.

39
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:35,357
I figured it out.
I was never very good at Morse code.

40
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:39,445
- Dad, you were shot.
- It's nothing.

41
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,700
Call your guards out back.
We're going out the front.

42
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:47,203
We're fluent in Arabic,
so do as I say.

43
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:31,831
So, now what? Take me
to the mountains and kill me?

44
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,875
Plan doesn't change.
You give me your client list

45
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,253
and I make sure
SD-6 thinks you're dead.

46
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:46,303
I don't care who you work for.
As long as you let me go.

47
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,816
OK. Get up.

48
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:08,659
- You know how much this suit cost?
- Give me your client list.

49
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,501
There you are.

50
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:21,881
You said you had a way
for me to get out of Cuba.

51
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,301
Yes. I do.

52
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:36,270
Two years ago, of course,
I knew you were working for SD-6,

53
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:41,567
I heard you were sent to Memphis,
Egypt, to meet this jackass.

54
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,863
It turned my stomach
that you were in this business.

55
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:46,989
Come here.

56
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:02,338
- You have a lacerated blood vessel.
- I'm alright.

57
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:07,551
Dad, can I ask you something?

58
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:11,722
When you started with SD-6,
you knew...

59
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:17,144
...that they were a mercenary group,
they had no connection with the CIA.

60
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,147
But I didn't.

61
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:24,235
When I joined, I thought
I was gonna be saving the world,

62
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:27,238
not making it more dangerous.

63
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,699
What's the question?

64
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,122
Why didn't you say something?

65
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:42,294
You could have told me
what I was really doing,

66
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,672
damage instead of good.

67
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,008
But you kept quiet.

68
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,015
Revealing the truth
about what you were doing

69
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,269
would have revealed the truth
about what I was doing.

70
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:44,023
I'll see you.

71
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,025
OK.

72
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,832
As Hassan and I headed to the
mainland, my dad contacted SD-6

73
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,628
and told them Hassan was dead.
That his mission was a success.

74
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,756
So it all worked.

75
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,593
SD-6 has no idea I was gone,
the CIA has Hassan,

76
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,261
and my dad's OK.

77
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:17,681
So thank you.

78
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,309
- I did nothing.
- You got me into Cuba.

79
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:27,108
- And you know what? You were right.
- What about?

80
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,696
What happens when someone
you care about is in trouble.

81
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,118
You said nothing else matters.
It all just goes away.

82
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:43,290
Last week, when I learned what my
dad did for me, sacrificing Russek,

83
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,042
it made me sick.

84
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,671
But now I know.

85
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,091
I would have done
exactly the same thing.

86
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,931
- You should have seen him.
- Your father?

87
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,935
Yeah. He was like a pro.
He was good.

88
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:06,063
The way you talked about him once,
his reputation,

89
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,274
I could see it in action.

90
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,444
He was... impressive.

91
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,657
I got those codes deciphered.

92
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,662
Those books
your father bought your mother,

93
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,206
the ones he had imported
25 years ago.

94
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:30,379
Those Cyrillic codes you found and
gave to me. I had NSA look at them.

95
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,050
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,611
- What is this?
- Directives.

97
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,654
Confirmed KGB orders.

98
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,740
What orders? What do they mean?

99
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:03,537
It's a list of aliases of handles.
People.

100
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,290
Who?

101
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,001
Those are official code names
given by the CIA

102
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:12,338
to over a dozen of our officers,
all of whom were killed.

103
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,467
- What?
- 25 years ago.

104
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,430
Killed by an unknown foreign agent.
Who the CIA suspected was KGB.

105
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,935
Your suspicions about your father

106
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:29,730
having once worked for the KGB,
they're accurate.

107
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,023
We don't know that.

108
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,609
He was tracked
by counterintelligence.

109
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,904
- That was routine.
- Nothing's routine about that list.

110
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,532
There's something very specific
about it.

111
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:45,329
It's been a mystery for two decades,
who murdered those CIA officers.

112
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,374
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,543
But we have our answer now.

114
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:52,586
It was your father.

115
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,259
I'm gonna report him.

116
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,588
I'm glad you're back safely.
To tell you the truth,

117
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,590
I was a little nervous.

118
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:41,427
I've been through worse than Havana.
We both have.

119
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,763
Yeah. When I didn't hear from you,

120
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:48,309
I thought maybe Hassan had a lead.
Maybe he knew you were coming.

121
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:51,854
I was unsure of that myself,
but it all worked out.

122
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,316
Not for Hassan.

123
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:57,902
No, not for him.

124
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,698
- Thank you.
- It's my job.

125
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,242
A vicious murder.

126
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,745
Ineni Hassan has been executed.

127
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:11,040
We may never know
who's responsible for this killing

128
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:15,002
but what we do know is that
after word of Hassan's death spread,

129
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,631
this man was unusually busy.
This is Minos Sakkoulas.

130
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:23,552
He worked very closely with Hassan.
Some thought him Hassan's second.

131
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:27,723
For the past two days, Sakkoulas has
been scrambling to make contact

132
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:31,894
with Hassan's clients. Seems he aims
to take over Hassan's work.

133
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:36,273
- Do you think he had Hassan killed?
- Perhaps.

134
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,071
Or maybe he's just taking advantage.
We intercepted this call last night.

135
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:45,658
I know that before his death
you were in talks with Mr Hassan.

136
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:49,120
Yes, there was discussion
of a certain package.

137
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,832
I am in possession of the package.
I'm taking bids right now.

138
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:55,876
- The package?
- Yes, the package.

139
00:12:56,502 --> 00:13:00,381
For months we've heard rumours
of a device Hassan commissioned.

140
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:01,757
We don't know what it is,

141
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:05,970
but Hassan was an arms dealer
with access to nuclear weapons.

142
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,472
This is Club Panthera.

143
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:11,642
It's Sakkoulas's cover.
He keeps an office there.

144
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:15,396
Sakkoulas has set up a meeting
with potential clients,

145
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:19,400
Thursday night at this club.
Your job is to go to Greece,

146
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:22,903
break into Sakkoulas's office,
and retrieve the specs

147
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:25,823
on this mysterious package.
Marshall?

148
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,201
Thank you. Actually, before...

149
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:34,248
Did anyone see that documentary
on monkeys last night? It was great.

150
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,542
They did this sign...

151
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:42,798
No-one... saw that.
OK... What we've learned so far

152
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:46,510
is that Sakkoulas has a biometric
access panel on his office

153
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:51,015
which requires a retinal scan
in order to open,

154
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,810
so we have
high-resolution retina scanners.

155
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:58,230
They work from up to about 30 feet.
Now, Miss Bristow,

156
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:02,318
you put these on, find the person
whose retina you want,

157
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:06,572
in this case Sakkoulas, make direct,
solid eye contact with him.

158
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:09,784
Look him right in the... eye,
and then, Mr Dixon,

159
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:13,662
you log on, and hit the scan key.

160
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:18,584
That should take ten seconds,
which I know is kind of a long time,

161
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,920
but check this out...

162
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:26,091
This is a silicone
and fluoropolymer compound,

163
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:30,721
creates a set of contact lenses
that the retina reader will accept.

164
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:36,602
And you guys really gotta check out
that documentary on monkeys.

165
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,729
I got a copy at home if...

166
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,707
Not so bad here, is it?

167
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,210
This is not the deal I agreed to.

168
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,386
So, what can you tell me
about the package?

169
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,347
You're gonna have to
help me out here.

170
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,184
Under the Patriot Act of 2001,
you're not going anywhere.

171
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:20,729
So let's work together
and I'll make your stay comfortable.

172
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:23,983
There are some incredibly nice
prisons in this country.

173
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:27,528
Either that, or you don't cooperate,

174
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,406
in which case
you won't like your cell mates.

175
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:34,577
You don't have to trust me,
but it might save you some misery.

176
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,454
What's the package?

177
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:41,000
Listen.

178
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,295
I have a wife and a son.

179
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,882
They are targets. Not just SD-6.

180
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,634
I have made
many enemies in the past.

181
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:54,597
You bring them to the United States,
give them protection.

182
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,810
You do that, and I'll tell you
what you want to know. Everything.

183
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,565
Let me make one thing clear.

184
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:08,778
The extent to which I am willing to
service you is to offer you a soda.

185
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:13,032
No negotiations. No perks.
You have nothing to gain here.

186
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,659
- Then neither do you.
- Think about that.

187
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,996
- I don't have to.
- I'll give you some time on it.

188
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,794
Sydney.

189
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,971
In Cuba,

190
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,933
I should have said that...

191
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:44,438
I wanted to say thank you...

192
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:48,818
...for coming. I know
that was something that you...

193
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,488
That you
certainly didn't have to do.

194
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:54,240
It's OK, Dad.

195
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,992
Wait. There's something else.

196
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,084
There are...

197
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:12,591
There are so many things...
that I should probably do.

198
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,261
I mean, as a father.

199
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,391
Things I should ask.

200
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,810
And say.

201
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,938
Dad.

202
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,441
It's alright.

203
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:31,986
Really.

204
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:50,171
Hassan's not talking,
so here's the plan.

205
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:54,133
You use the lenses, get into
Sakkoulas's office, record the specs.

206
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:57,094
You, not Dixon.

207
00:17:57,178 --> 00:18:00,890
The compact's a camera,
the lipstick's a voice recorder,

208
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,684
and the lighter's
a USB flash RAM drive.

209
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:07,021
Whatever info you can get,
get it for us.

210
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:14,111
These are some unclassified designs
for various weapons.

211
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:17,239
Photograph these
with the camera SD-6 gives you.

212
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,742
You give them those
when you get back.

213
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:20,993
Thanks.

214
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,120
Listen. About your father.

215
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,749
I know you're reluctant
to do anything.

216
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:31,128
- I've thought a lot about it.
- We have to report him to Langley.

217
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:36,008
I could do it myself, but they'll
need your testimony to make a case.

218
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:40,596
He may have been KGB, but we don't
know if he had a part in the murders.

219
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,226
- You're kidding yourself.
- The directives are 25 years old.

220
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,521
There's no statute of limitation
on murder.

221
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:55,319
We need him right now. We will never
destroy SD-6 without my father.

222
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,336
Those code names
in your father's books were people.

223
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,965
And they risked their lives,
all of them, for this country.

224
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:18,551
And, yes, it might have been
25 years ago,

225
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:22,888
but for each of those lives lost,
others were destroyed.

226
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:25,766
- I know.
- No. You're not thinking of them.

227
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,935
You're only thinking of yourself.

228
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:30,688
You connected with your father
for the first time.

229
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,566
Turning him in
means sacrificing that.

230
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:37,319
I understand, but we have proof.
We know who the victims are.

231
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:41,490
You're holding them in your hands,
and we know who the killer was.

232
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:43,826
We both know the right thing to do.

233
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:46,912
Yeah.

234
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:53,085
Yes, my father probably got
his KGB orders from the books,

235
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:55,880
and yes,

236
00:19:55,963 --> 00:20:01,051
it looks like... my father
was responsible for those deaths.

237
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,221
But what you're asking me to do...

238
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:06,682
I just need some time.

239
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:10,060
Not a lot of time,
not forever, just...

240
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:14,565
Please.

241
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,905
You won't do
anything about this without me?

242
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:59,068
Yes, my father probably got
his KGB orders from the books,

243
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,987
and yes,

244
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:06,784
it looks like... my father
was responsible for those deaths.

245
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:36,397
I'm gonna need another set of eyes.

246
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,482
I'm working on it.

247
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,752
I'm in. Give me a second
to locate Sakkoulas.

248
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:05,384
OK, found him. He's through
the glass door to your left.

249
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:00,564
He's looking right at me.
Have you got anything yet?

250
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,358
I can't lock on the retinas.

251
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:05,569
The lights are disrupting
the signal. Get closer.

252
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:10,366
- How much closer?
- In this lighting? How's two inches?

253
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:11,492
Great.

254
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,342
I understand
you're the owner of the club.

255
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:29,885
You are American.

256
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,595
God bless America.

257
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,181
I'm getting it.
Hold him for 10 seconds.

258
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:40,271
Your dancers... suck.

259
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,607
Suck!

260
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:46,861
You think
you could do a better job?

261
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:49,864
Sir.

262
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:51,699
Your 11 o'clock just arrived.

263
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:54,535
- He's waiting by the pool-side bar.
- No good.

264
00:23:54,618 --> 00:23:58,831
- We didn't get a reading yet.
- I have a very important meeting.

265
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,544
But follow me.

266
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:26,066
I'll be back in ten minutes.

267
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:30,154
I can't wait.

268
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,032
Got it.

269
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,669
I have the contacts.
Meet me by the rest rooms.

270
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:48,047
Excuse me, I have to go.

271
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,592
- Mr Sakkoulas invites you to stay.
- I need a drink.

272
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:54,220
We'll be happy
to have it brought here.

273
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,763
I'd rather get it myself.

274
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:58,891
I think you will be
more comfortable if you stay.

275
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,601
Really? Do you?

276
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,564
- You OK?
- Yeah.

277
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:08,275
Except I'm locked
in this pervert's room.

278
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,115
I'm closer to the office,
and I have the contacts.

279
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,075
No, Dixon, I wanna do this.

280
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:20,788
I'll download the package blueprints
from Sakkoulas's computer.

281
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,499
- No, Dixon!
- Just get out in one piece!

282
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:27,044
- Meet you outside when I'm done.
- Damn it!

283
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:29,732
Are you auditioning to be a dancer?

284
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,692
Or a bouncer?

285
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,953
I can't quite decide
if you're my... taste.

286
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,751
Sydney!

287
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,509
Syd, let's go.

288
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,074
How's the food?

289
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,082
So, Mr Hassan, you've had
some time to think about it.

290
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:30,584
- Do you wanna help me out?
- Screw you.

291
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:32,670
- Screw me.
- Screw you.

292
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:35,714
I don't talk to you
unless you show me respect.

293
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:40,678
In 20 minutes, you'll be shipped
to a top-security prison outside LA.

294
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:44,056
By 5pm, you're gonna be
someone's after-dinner mint.

295
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,268
So unless you start
cooperating with me real fast,

296
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:50,271
respect is gonna be
the least of your problems.

297
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,820
Wait.

298
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:02,491
You still refuse to help get
my family out of Argentina.

299
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:06,912
I told you. That's not part of
the deal. But, if you help me out,

300
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:09,915
I'll make sure you stay comfortable.

301
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,792
OK.

302
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:15,963
I have a stockpile of weapons,
not in Egypt.

303
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:19,091
I knew that's where
my enemies would look.

304
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:22,511
The package
and other weapons are in a silo

305
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:26,056
in Greece, on the isle of Crete.

306
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,145
- He licked my face.
- I understand.

307
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:35,524
No, he licked my face! And you wanna
know the worst part? Because of him,

308
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:39,236
I didn't succeed. Because of him,
Dixon accessed the information.

309
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,115
The CIA got nothing,
and SD-6 got what they wanted.

310
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:49,497
I wanna go to Crete myself, find the
stockpile and bring back the package.

311
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,335
It's not the right time to send you
anywhere without SD-6's knowledge.

312
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:56,504
We did that with Cuba.
It's dangerous.

313
00:28:56,587 --> 00:29:01,634
My father can give Sloane the intel,
and we'll make it an SD-6 mission.

314
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:04,136
OK.

315
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,724
That's not why I called you.

316
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,018
I know.

317
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:14,814
Listen, if...

318
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:20,194
If we turn in my father, that'll
jeopardise what you and I are doing.

319
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:24,156
Yes, my father probably
got his KGB orders from the books,

320
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:26,450
and yes,

321
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:30,913
It looks like my father was
responsible for those deaths.

322
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:41,674
I knew turning in your father
would be too difficult,

323
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:44,510
so I made this tape
last time we were together.

324
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:47,596
I was gonna play it for Devlin,
maybe use it in court.

325
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:50,099
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

326
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:58,566
I'm only telling you this

327
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,778
because... I thought I owed you that
for some reason.

328
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:08,701
I know this is
a personal thing for you.

329
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:11,912
The idea
of reporting your father is...

330
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:14,206
a horrible position to be in.

331
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:20,254
But it's a personal thing
for me too, Sydney.

332
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:25,885
Those files I showed you
of the CIA officers who were killed?

333
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,975
I left one out.

334
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:57,458
I made an appointment to meet Devlin
on Monday, to report your father.

335
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:02,546
Are you with me?

336
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,416
What's up?

337
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:42,419
- Is Jenny here?
- What?

338
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:44,755
No, no.

339
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:48,050
Come on. Come on in.

340
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,188
What's wrong?

341
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,658
Come here.

342
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,596
Tell me what's wrong.

343
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,939
I just wanna stay here for a while.

344
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:45,816
If that's OK.

345
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:52,072
Of course.

346
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:16,889
Dad, I know you've made mistakes.
We both have.

347
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:21,811
And I know, given the chance, you'd
go back and take a different path.

348
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:24,605
That you'd right
the things you did wrong.

349
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:30,152
My point is,
something went wrong last week,

350
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:33,572
and I have the chance to correct it,
but I need your help.

351
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:36,700
Please.
You have to make Sloane believe

352
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:40,871
that you've received intel
about Hassan's weapons stockpile.

353
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,502
Arvin, I just received some intel.

354
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:50,548
I think we've found
Hassan's weapons stockpile.

355
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,717
This is an EM refractor,
used to cloak missiles.

356
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:56,637
It's being stored on
the island of Crete.

357
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,599
Through your father's Middle-Eastern
contacts we know where to go.

358
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:02,601
Good work.

359
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:07,898
Go to Marshall.
Get him to review the op tech.

360
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,192
- You leave in the morning.
- OK.

361
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:44,560
- Sakkoulas is leaving the bunker.
- We have him on satellite relay.

362
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:47,563
- See any guards?
- Hassan says there won't be any.

363
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:52,818
That place is made to look abandoned.
The refractor is secured underground.

364
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:54,695
Copy that.

365
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:06,999
Go infrared.

366
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:12,963
- It's clear.
- Syd, you're clear.

367
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:25,976
OK, I'm in. Where to?

368
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:30,147
There's a stairwell on your left.
Go down to the lower level.

369
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:38,864
It's a dead end.

370
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:44,161
There is a valve up on the left.
She needs to turn it clockwise.

371
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:48,165
Syd, turn to your left.
There's a valve. Turn it clockwise.

372
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,959
Copy.

373
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:52,878
A panel will open.
There's a keypad behind it.

374
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:55,172
You should find a keypad.

375
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:03,722
- What's the code?
- Code?

376
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,268
Pi to six digits.

377
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,230
The code is
three-one-four, one-five-nine.

378
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:36,255
Where do I look?

379
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,884
Hassan says to look for
black shipping cases.

380
00:36:58,778 --> 00:37:00,529
I found the refractor.

381
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,456
Vaughn, I think this is a setup!

382
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,544
Vaughn, the room
just went into lockdown.

383
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:20,257
- What the hell did you just do?
- I gave you the wrong code.

384
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:24,220
Your agent has activated
an anti-intruder device.

385
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:37,775
In a few seconds, the room
will be filled with gasoline.

386
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:41,946
Exactly one minute after that,
a flame will ignite.

387
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:48,369
- Vaughn, talk to me.
- Give me the deactivation code.

388
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:52,748
Vaughn!

389
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:57,795
Not until I have an agreement, in
writing, signed by your superiors,

390
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:01,465
guaranteeing that my family
will be allowed entrance

391
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,884
into your
witness protection programme.

392
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:08,431
Give me the code, you sonovabitch,
or I pull the trigger.

393
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:10,724
I have no doubt that's true.

394
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,149
- Start typing.
- Me?

395
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:40,171
- You misspelt Ineni.
- Shut up.

396
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:44,049
- Mr Devlin.
- What is this?

397
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,761
I need your signature
on a protection order

398
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:50,431
for Ineni Hassan's family
or Sydney Bristow will die.

399
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:20,377
Give me the code.

400
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,800
Seven, six, six,

401
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:28,511
one, five, three.

402
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,347
The code is seven, six, six,

403
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,099
one, five, three.

404
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:45,861
Vaughn, thank you.

405
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,953
Don't shoot.
The room is full of gasoline.

406
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,917
What the hell are you doing here?

407
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:50,176
- You're amazing.
- I am not.

408
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,179
You did a great job.

409
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:03,355
- Sure you're ready to meet Devlin?
- Yeah.

410
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:08,027
OK.
Taxi will pick you up at 3 o'clock,

411
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,488
corner of Westward and Wiltshire,

412
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:14,241
and get you into the agency
through the underground garage.

413
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:16,702
OK.

414
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:34,678
You sure you're alright?

415
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:49,902
- It's a big meeting.
- I know. I don't get it.

416
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:18,639
This is CIA Director Devlin,
Deputy Director Tucker,

417
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:20,558
Executive Director Kirstner,

418
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:23,686
and senior officers
Hayley, Stafford, and Colin.

419
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:30,901
I knew weeks ago
that my file had been pulled,

420
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,280
and that you were suspicious
of my activities

421
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:36,240
25 years ago regarding the KGB.

422
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:40,244
When I learned
that you had scheduled a meeting

423
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,914
with Mr Devlin
regarding... my history,

424
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,583
I knew that it was time.

425
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:50,463
Let me say in advance, I'm sorry
to make this such a public display.

426
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,382
But it's important to do this

427
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:57,261
in front of these people
because they already know the truth.

428
00:42:57,344 --> 00:43:01,223
And because I didn't think
that you would believe me otherwise.

429
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:06,645
Those Cyrillic codes
you found in those books?

430
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:11,233
Yes, they were orders
from the KGB, and, yes...

431
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:14,278
...they were orders to kill.

432
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,823
An agent received those orders
and carried them out.

433
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:21,660
Murdered officers of the CIA.

434
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,789
Including your father, Mr Vaughn.

435
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,585
All this is true.

436
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,923
But, Sydney, I was not that agent.

437
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:40,221
Your mother was.
