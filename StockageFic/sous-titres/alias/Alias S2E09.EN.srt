1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,373
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:10,548
Someone now has the ability to detonate
six nuclear weapons, and I am responsible.

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:16,258
So I am going to be part of the team
that finds and disarms those warheads.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,556
I need your help.

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,932
There are two things you need to know
about this necklace.

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,431
One, it's layered with C-4.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,187
If you remove it while it's armed,
you'll break the circuit and it'll detonate.

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:31,981
And two, if at any moment I believe you're
attempting to escape or sabotage us,

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:37,031
I'll activate this remote trigger
and blow your head off myself.

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,454
Back up now.

11
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:59,714
- Is there something you'd like to tell us?
- We'd like the warheads you've acquired.

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,944
Thank you for the supplies.

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,542
- Of course, of course. Absolutely.
- Mr Vaughn...

14
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,880
- Yes, sir.
- Mr Vaughn.

15
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,639
- Yes, sir. As soon as we find out.
- The necklace has been deactivated.

16
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,130
- I'll have to call you back. When?
- Just now.

17
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,387
- You've confirmed this?
- Yes.

18
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,848
- Satellite imagery detects combat.
- Combat?

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,686
- What just happened?
- It's over.

20
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,400
- Can we tell if there's any survivors?
- Not with this bird.

21
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,953
We need new satellites.

22
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,445
Even if they survive,
sending in a team is out of the question.

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,489
- Why? They're on an authorised mission.
- A clandestine mission.

24
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,789
If we start scouring the countryside,
the Indian government is gonna figure out

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,210
that Pakistani-supported rebels in Azad
Kashmir have acquired nuclear weapons.

26
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,971
They're gonna launch pre-emptive strikes,
the Pakistanis are gonna retaliate,

27
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,545
and I'm gonna get called in front of
a half a dozen congressional committees

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,847
demanding to know why we screwed up.

29
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,678
So the only thing
we're interested in right now

30
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,723
is how to make this problem disappear.

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,230
I want an options paper from you
in two hours.

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,022
And after that I'd like to look quietly
for the Bristows myself.

33
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,736
- Nuclear weapons.
- I understand.

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,942
- I shouldn't have to define your priorities.
- I don't think we should cut them loose.

35
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,485
Listen, alive or dead, the mission failed.

36
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,490
So if the Bristows are out there,
they're on their own.

37
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,075
Hey, man. Check this out.

38
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,212
Nothing like more bad news, huh?

39
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,806
- Maybe they were just a roving patrol.
- No.

40
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:11,058
PRF rebels would never be this deep into
Indian territory without being dispatched.

41
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:16,440
Your father's right. We had
one advantage - surprise. Now that's gone.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,858
- Just a second.
- Can't stop.

43
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,865
More patrols could be in the area.

44
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,199
Oh, God.

45
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,785
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just scraped my leg.

46
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,298
- Dad, I can do it.
- I got it. You need to stop the bleeding.

47
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,461
Where are you going?

48
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,182
These bushes,
they have <i>Myrtus communis</i> berries.

49
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,885
Their juice soothes the skin, helps healing.
You should put this on first.

50
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,434
- Seriously, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

51
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,227
No, you're not fine.

52
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,772
Jack, I know you're determined
to get to Srinagar,

53
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,858
but my contact in Jaipur is much closer.

54
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,406
He's completely reliable,
he has good equipment...

55
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,409
This is a CIA mission. I have
operational control. You're a prisoner.

56
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,950
Your only function, sole reason
you're momentarily breathing fresh air,

57
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,918
is to use your knowledge
of the rebels' base

58
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,705
to help us steal
the suitcase nukes and leave.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,003
That's why we're using
people I know and trust.

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,594
I'm not having this conversation again.

61
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,552
- You OK?
- Yeah. Thanks.

62
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,850
This is not a power play.

63
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,609
The facility we're headed for,
security's tighter than the NSA.

64
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:46,276
If I don't have the right equipment,
it's pointless.

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,580
We should move.

66
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,033
OK.

67
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,142
- I know what you're thinking.
- Do you?

68
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,438
Toaster.

69
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,815
What are you guys talking about?

70
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,161
We used to have this toaster at home.

71
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:18,669
It was broken, and using it one night,
I started a small fire.

72
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:23,166
We had something like this to drink
and we both had a little too much.

73
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:27,006
I forgot about the toast I was making.

74
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,171
When was this?

75
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,220
You were four years old.

76
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,103
There was so much smoke,
we had to move out for a week.

77
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,896
- We stayed in that hotel.
- The Summit.

78
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,062
The Summit.

79
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,736
- Was that the hotel with the sundaes?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,581
I think you had one every night.

81
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,379
You should get some sleep.

82
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,554
- Jack?
- I would have called. I need your help.

83
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,972
Yes, yes, of course.
No one can see you dressed like this.

84
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,550
That's one of the reasons we're here.

85
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,941
- It is good to see you again.
- You, too. You look well.

86
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,808
Well, imagine how bad I looked before.

87
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,188
Are you who I think?

88
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,406
- Is she yours?
- Yes.

89
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,030
He always brags about you.
He showed me a picture once...

90
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,290
We need to penetrate a class-A target
outside Muzaffarabad.

91
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:27,371
We'll need aliases, papers, transpo,
ammo, sat phone, and security penetration.

92
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,297
- Yes. Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

93
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,885
We also need tactical gear and
high-resolution night-vision goggles.

94
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:40,311
Yes. Except no.
My main supplier died two months ago.

95
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:45,436
- Suresh was killed?
- Heart attack. We are old men, Jack.

96
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,312
We don't live for ever,
especially in Kashmir.

97
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,650
Of course, I can provide aliases,
basic weapons,

98
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,323
access to satellite phone
and transportation.

99
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,984
- What kind of security?
- Biometric sensors.

100
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,532
Dual infrared passive and microwave
sensors, fibre optics on the fence.

101
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,295
- What's your timeframe?
- We're already behind schedule.

102
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,079
Well, I can do what I can do,
but it might not be enough for you.

103
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,961
We'll take whatever you've got. Thank you.

104
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:18,469
Yes. First thing,
you need to be looking not like you.

105
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,473
- Hello?
- Hi. I'm on a secure line.

106
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,275
Sydney, we saw the blast.
What happened?

107
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,567
I'll fill you in later,
but we were compromised.

108
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,647
I'm so glad you're OK.
What about your parents?

109
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,697
Some people go miniature golfing
with their parents.

110
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,860
We go to India and look for nukes.

111
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,867
Listen, Sydney,
we intercepted a communication.

112
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,242
The rebels say they're planning on
activating the nukes tomorrow at 1 700.

113
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,995
- Activate how?
- We don't know.

114
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,756
- Deploy? Detonate?
- Activate, that's the word they used.

115
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,173
Now, it might mean delivery,
maybe detonation, we don't know.

116
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,510
But we have to assume the worst, since
they got the control codes through SD-6.

117
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,095
And I got the control codes for SD-6
which means I can deactivate the nukes.

118
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,552
If you get there in time.

119
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,190
Perfect. Here. My truck is parked
on the other side of the market.

120
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,531
- I owe you.
- What kind of air filter does it have?

121
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,989
- A foam filter.
- That won't work.

122
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,162
- It'll clog up in the desert conditions.
- We'll return the truck as soon as we can.

123
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,956
We cannot use this truck.
It'll never get us there.

124
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,248
I know you think
I'm always second-guessing you.

125
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,328
This is my decision.
It is not negotiable.

126
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,338
Listen to me, both of you.
We have a job to do.

127
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:38,794
Your issues are going to have to be
dealt with later. Please excuse us.

128
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,890
Right now we have six suitcase nukes
that are going to be activated tomorrow.

129
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,104
- Is that confirmed?
- CIA doesn't have any details.

130
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,101
They want us to deactivate the nukes
and steal them.

131
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,601
CIA needs to get authorisation
for a pre-emptive strike now.

132
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,487
They need confirmation
that the nukes are there.

133
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,028
- It'll be too late by then.
- Not if we work together.

134
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:04,194
This is the way it's gonna be. Dad will
decide how we get to the base. It's his call.

135
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,163
Once we arrive, Mom takes over.

136
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,076
You were an officer there.
You know your way around.

137
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,955
You'll lead us into the facility,
to the nukes and back out.

138
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,837
Then you will resume control
and get us home.

139
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,631
There will be no objections to
and no deviations from this plan.

140
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,053
Three of these bins are filled with grain.
Irina, you'll be in the fourth.

141
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,558
- You can't be serious.
- She's the most likely to be recognised.

142
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,223
The rebels are looking
for a three-person team,

143
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:41,068
so we have a better chance of avoiding
detection if we alter our configuration.

144
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,419
Are you sure she can breathe in there?

145
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,537
- Dad, we need to get moving.
- I know.

146
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,300
I'm just preparing myself to let Irina out.

147
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,923
It'll be fine.

148
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,387
Sydney, I've been doing this job
a long time,

149
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:52,184
so when you lectured me about continuing
the mission and laying down protocol...

150
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,348
- Dad, my point was...
- I know what your point was.

151
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:59,601
And the truth is, I needed to hear it.

152
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,614
I'm proud of you, that's all.

153
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,015
Thank you.

154
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,981
What are we doing here?
This is not the drop.

155
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,401
The filter got clogged, didn't it?

156
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,911
We're still ten miles away from the base.

157
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,339
We need to hike to the field
where we'll access a sewage tunnel.

158
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,963
That'll lead us into the facility.

159
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,885
- I thought you said security was heavy.
- It is on the other side of the facility.

160
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,932
At the entry point we're using, the rebels
rely on land mines to keep intruders away.

161
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,690
We don't have the equipment
to detect land mines.

162
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:21,980
We don't have the equipment
because your contact didn't come through.

163
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,730
I know where the mines are planted.

164
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,395
You wanna walk through a minefield
you haven't seen in 19 years?

165
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,484
- Is there another way?
- And assume no new mines?

166
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,740
I just spent five hours in a grain bin.
It's my turn now.

167
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,414
Let's get to it.

168
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,871
I just spoke with Gerard Cuvee,
leader of the PRF.

169
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,906
He's quite charming, really.
More like a banker than a rebel leader.

170
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,916
But, then, you're a money man too,
aren't you?

171
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,204
Is everything in place?

172
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,004
The nuclear cores will be activated
at 1 700 hours.

173
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:32,550
As soon as it's done,
they'll upload the results to our server.

174
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,257
Yeah?

175
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,134
Sir, I have someone calling regarding
your wife. They won't identify themselves.

176
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,517
Record the call. I need some privacy.

177
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,694
- Yeah?
- Romantic touch, don't you think?

178
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,029
Your wife's ring finger. By now your lab's
confirmed that despite your best efforts,

179
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,990
you didn't kill Emily, and now I have her.

180
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,541
- What do you want?
- One hundred million in bearer bonds.

181
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,960
- This is about money?
- Everything is about money.

182
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,799
Instructions for the drop
have been electronically mailed to you.

183
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:11,177
You've got 24 hours.
Fail to deliver the bonds,

184
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,212
and the next delivery will go to the Alliance.

185
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,032
Where did the PRF get all these mines?

186
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:45,463
You Americans have the worst
inventory controls in the world.

187
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,756
So, Sydney, how's school?

188
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,637
I'm writing my dissertation, supposedly.

189
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,055
Quiet.

190
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,739
Behind the tree. To your left, Jack.

191
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,164
Jack, I need a gun.

192
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,928
Don't move.

193
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,515
You're on a mine.

194
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,987
Sydney, don't move.

195
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,484
Five steps forward.

196
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,832
Three to your left and straight towards us.

197
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,252
- Are you hurt?
- No. The bullet hit my vest.

198
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,551
It's an M26 antipersonnel mine.

199
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:29,640
We'll need to pry off the panel
and remove the blasting cap.

200
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,578
You need to cut the detonator core
that leads to the blasting cap.

201
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,165
Her knife's not coated.

202
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:55,123
If she cuts the wires with metal,
she'll complete the circuit and set it off.

203
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,005
I can do it.

204
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,892
It's OK.

205
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:18,941
Over that hill is the entrance
to the sewer tunnel. We should hurry.

206
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,275
Follow closely.

207
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,574
Contact the Bristows.
Tell them to pull out immediately.

208
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,744
I have no way of initiating. Why?

209
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,328
The Indians found out
the Pakistani rebels have acquired nukes.

210
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,210
- They're launching air strikes in 24 hours.
- What? We have to get 'em to back off.

211
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,922
We're trying, but they're angry we knew
about the nukes and kept it from them.

212
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:43,757
- They're insisting on going forward.
- Then let me make a personal appeal.

213
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,053
Vaughn, everybody is working
on this already - State, NSC, DOD.

214
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:51,095
Look, you're probably gonna say no to this,
but I wanna go to India.

215
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,729
I was stationed there for two years.
I have relationships...

216
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,060
Go.

217
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,727
- Go?
- I'll have a military aircraft waiting.

218
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,112
This is totally back channel.

219
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:06,028
You're just gonna...
Are you trying to get rid of me?

220
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,455
Clear.

221
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,052
We're here.

222
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:31,227
The nukes will either be in a sealed R&D
lab or a vault located in the subbasement.

223
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,232
The lab's the better bet because
its security system is more sophisticated.

224
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,104
- So we check the vault first.
- Not if we only get one shot.

225
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:41,145
The lab has thermal sensors
to detect intruders through their body heat.

226
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,657
If we raise the room to body temperature -
98.6 degrees -

227
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,318
the sensors won't be able
to distinguish between us

228
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,240
and the thermostat level of the lab.

229
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,452
Sydney, you'll get to the central heating
control panel here.

230
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,960
It's located in a room near the stairwell
in the subbasement.

231
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,585
- Find the panel for zone three.
- Got it.

232
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,592
Jack, the lab door is controlled
by a voice-recognition system.

233
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,251
Only Cuvee's voice
is programmed to open it.

234
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,890
We need to break into the main
computer system here to access his file.

235
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,764
You'll erase his voice
and substitute your own.

236
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:18,308
- I'll be in Cuvee's private office.
- You and I are not separating. Not in here.

237
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,190
Jack, listen to me.

238
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:26,073
Unless I deactivate the facility's
surveillance system from Cuvee's office,

239
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,619
we won't get anywhere near the nukes.

240
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:32,117
No. You've done good work
getting us here. I'm not blind to that.

241
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,782
But I'm also far from trusting you.

242
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:38,128
If you want those nukes for yourself,
this is a perfect setup.

243
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:44,419
You were an officer in this facility. You've
got friends here willing to work with you.

244
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,588
Friends?

245
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,558
Know what this place was
when I was here, Jack?

246
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:57,101
A prison, where the KGB
interrogated suspected traitors.

247
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:01,320
And no, I wasn't an officer here.
I was a prisoner.

248
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,404
Why do you think I learned the sewage
tunnels or memorised the mine locations?

249
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,538
So I could escape, you idiot.
We're out of time.

250
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,703
We either split up and meet at the lab
in five minutes or we're going back.

251
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:20,669
- It's your choice.
- She's right. We don't have any more time.

252
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,295
I'll be in the lab in five minutes. I promise.

253
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,467
You better be.

254
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,180
Thank you for agreeing
to this emergency meeting.

255
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,434
Despite my best efforts
to comply with your orders to kill my wife

256
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:07,479
after she learned the truth about SD-6,
someone interfered.

257
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:12,364
And this person
is now extorting me for her return.

258
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:18,905
Last week the blackmailer sent me
Emily's finger, her ring finger.

259
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,918
Lab tests confirmed that Emily was alive
when they severed the finger.

260
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,339
Blood coagulation tests
are not 100 per cent accurate.

261
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,212
Yes, but they are reliable.

262
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,253
Then two days ago
security section obtained those.

263
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,475
Those are photographs of airport security
in Santiago and London.

264
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,855
We have confirmed that Emily
was on flight manifests last week.

265
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,310
- Any ID on the man with her?
- No.

266
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:52,357
But the blackmailer wants a hundred
million in bearer bonds for her return.

267
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,700
Who else knew about
your instructions to kill Emily?

268
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,907
Only the people in this room.

269
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,117
You believe one of us may be behind this?

270
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:10,582
No. But someone has infiltrated
our secure communications.

271
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:17,681
- Well, whoever it is will get nothing.
- No, it's not quite that simple.

272
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,641
We have to eliminate this leak

273
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,856
before more damaging information
about the Alliance gets out.

274
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,519
So I propose that we put
a tracking device on the bonds,

275
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:32,395
that we make this exchange,

276
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,733
that we follow the blackmailer,
and we assassinate him.

277
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,406
You understand, Arvin, after all this,

278
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,539
if you get your wife back,
she will still have to be eliminated.

279
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,877
I understand.

280
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,888
- The thermal sensors are neutralised.
- Where's your mother?

281
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,550
I haven't seen her. We got this far.

282
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:06,061
She must have gotten to Cuvee's office
and disabled the surveillance system.

283
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,225
She'll be here.

284
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,152
We're not waiting.

285
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:32,371
Use the control codes
to begin deactivation.

286
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,060
The plutonium core is gone.

287
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,082
Hi, Mr Sloane. It's me, Marshall.

288
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:56,584
Sorry. You probably already know that.
You planned this.

289
00:27:56,676 --> 00:28:00,888
Anyway, the tracer on the bonds
is working perfectly.

290
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,048
Good. I'm turning off my comm.

291
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,907
- Yeah?
- I see you.

292
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:27,323
Leave the briefcase on the bench
and keep walking.

293
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:38,130
Proceed toward the corner while
we verify the authenticity of the bonds.

294
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:43,714
Yeah, I got you, baby.
Right into my wheelhouse. Come on.

295
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,013
Go to the row of vending machines.

296
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,888
Take the <i>City View,</i> fifth from the top.

297
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,928
I told you. Ain't nobody gettin' by
Magic Marshall's invisible liquid tracer.

298
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,060
I say, come on. Come on.

299
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,627
Wait a minute.

300
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,470
Wait, no. Where'd...
Oh, God, no. No!

301
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,241
Not to brag, but I'm kind of responsible
for matchmaking you and Irina.

302
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,997
Didn't she tell you?

303
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,159
I was her supervisor at the KGB.

304
00:29:54,252 --> 00:30:01,548
I was the one who gave her the assignment
to go to the US and marry a CIA officer.

305
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,964
Now, you weren't the only prospect,
of course, but you had the most potential.

306
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,343
I actually thought it would dawn on you

307
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:16,940
that a woman like this
would never go for someone like you.

308
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:23,353
Luckily for me,
your ego was too big for that.

309
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,827
- You're a dead man.
- Wait, wait. I want what we came for.

310
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:40,164
Sark's made a deal with us.
What kind of double-cross is he planning?

311
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,170
Maybe you didn't hear me.

312
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:53,091
We know Sark has a new partner.
Who is it?

313
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:13,121
Get the information
and meet me in my office.

314
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:38,850
I was caught.
I had to do this or we'd all be killed.

315
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,519
They're not detonating the nukes.
Here's what you have to do.

316
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,649
Is everything on target?

317
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:53,954
- We ran into a few problems but...
- What kind of problems?

318
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,739
We've got it under control.
We'll proceed as planned.

319
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:03,955
Then I'll expect your report
on the Rambaldi artefact within the hour.

320
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,291
Trust me on this.

321
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,886
If you don't make it out,
I'm sorry this happened.

322
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,045
Mr Vaughn, good to see you again.

323
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,044
But I'm afraid
you came a long way for nothing.

324
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:53,386
General, we have people at the PRF base
right now stealing the nukes.

325
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,466
And if they fail,
we'll be the Pakistani's first target.

326
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,096
- They won't fail.
- You can't guarantee that.

327
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:01,057
If you launch those strikes now,
you will be killing some of our best assets.

328
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:05,015
Mr Vaughn, your government knew
the rebels acquired the suitcase nukes

329
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,983
and still they said nothing.

330
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,445
They placed our whole country at risk.

331
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,400
At least delay a few hours
until we get our people out.

332
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:15,323
I'm sorry. The air strike goes as planned.

333
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:22,492
You look more like your father
every time I see you, you know that?

334
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:30,837
My father wrote about you in his journal.

335
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:36,218
He wrote that he trusted you and respected
you. That is why I came such a long way.

336
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:43,772
I cannot call off the strike,
but I will give you a head start.

337
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,941
- Meaning what?
- Meaning a chopper and a pilot.

338
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:54,025
But if you are going to try to rescue your
friends, you are doing so at your own risk.

339
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,043
- Dad. How'd you get free?
- Sydney, your mother was helping us.

340
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,413
What? What about Cuvee?
She was torturing you.

341
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:12,002
She was putting on a show for Cuvee.
Before she left, she put these in my hand.

342
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,462
She told me they're using the cores
to activate a Rambaldi artefact.

343
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,464
They're not detonating the nukes?

344
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:21,222
Among the things Rambaldi experimented
with was self-sustaining cell regeneration.

345
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,770
This artefact they're opening today

346
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,808
is reported to be
Rambaldi's proof of endless life.

347
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:26,930
Endless life?

348
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,480
We have no time
to make any meaningful assessment.

349
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,274
All I know is that your mother claims
to have provided us with the opportunity

350
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:36,942
to contact the CIA for extraction,
and we should act on it.

351
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:49,500
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- This is it. We're going against the wind.

352
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,880
- Operations.
- Boot Camp, this is Mountaineer.

353
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:56,835
Voice ID number Alpha, Charlie, 710.
I need to speak with Agent Vaughn.

354
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,465
Vaughn's not available.
Let me give you Kendall.

355
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,143
- Agent Bristow, do you have the package?
- We're in process.

356
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,816
We'll need extraction within the hour.

357
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,363
Abort. The Indians have launched
air strikes against the base.

358
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:21,322
Air strikes? We're not finished.
You have to get them to hold off.

359
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,370
Listen to me. Fighter planes are in the sky.

360
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:26,576
- You have to leave now.
- Not until we get my mother.

361
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,744
Agent Bristow, I am ordering you to pull out

362
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,710
and head for
the extraction point immediately.

363
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,332
This is Jack. You'll either hear
from us again, or you won't.

364
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:39,551
Our assignment from the CIA
is to bring her back. That's our job.

365
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,662
A flower? That's what this is all about?

366
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,877
We need to get the cores
and get outta here.

367
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,750
It's Vaughn.

368
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,475
We got the cores.
Tell them to call off the air strikes.

369
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:22,650
This is Agent Vaughn. Abort the air strikes.
Repeat, abort the air strikes.

370
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:20,200
- You must have a lot of questions.
- Yeah.

371
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:26,706
One thing that should not wait any longer
is why I shot you in Taipei.

372
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:32,388
The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee,
when you were in Taipei,

373
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:38,179
he was in the next room watching
to see if I would betray him or you.

374
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:47,401
Shooting you in the shoulder,
giving you time to escape,

375
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:54,442
it was the only way
I could think to maintain his trust

376
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,242
and keep him from killing both of us.

377
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:08,498
We're both tired.
You should get some rest.

378
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,128
You, too.

379
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,675
Mom.

380
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:40,991
- Hi.
- Hey.

381
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,539
Any word on the flower?

382
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,924
Preliminary analysis indicates that
it's anywhere from 400 to 600 years old.

383
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,295
Like I said, preliminary.

384
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,267
What's this?

385
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:22,290
s there nothing I can say,
nothing I can do

386
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,119
To change your mind?

387
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,618
I'm so in love with you

388
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:30,129
We're too deep in, you can't get out

389
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:35,008
You're just a poor girl
in a rich man's house

390
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:50,688
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you

391
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:56,986
Don't you know promises
were never made to keep?

392
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,701
Just like the night...
