1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,503
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,995
I had Toxicology analyse the glass of wine

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,174
that somehow made its way
into my house last week.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,171
They found a compound which counteracts
the effects of sodium morphate.

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:21,182
Sodium morphate is the poison I used
to end Emily's suffering.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:27,190
I see two possibilities here. Either Emily
predicted your intention to euthanise her,

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,353
took the necessary countermeasures,

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:35,069
or - the more likely scenario - someone
wants you to believe Emily is alive.

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,449
Sydney.

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,614
You know Mr Sark.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,625
I don't think
we've ever been officially introduced.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,036
Mr Sark is now cooperating with us

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,543
in our ongoing search for Derevko
and the remains of her company.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,683
I see the bad moon rising

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,428
I see trouble on the way

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,566
I see earthquakes and lightning

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,397
I see bad times today

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,986
Don't go round tonight

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,915
Well, it's bound to take your life

20
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,748
There's a bad moon on the rise

21
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,292
Are you here to wish me luck
before my first day on the job?

22
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,884
Or are you concerned that I might reveal
to Sloane that you conspired to kill him?

23
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,056
I'm here to remind you
what I hope is obvious,

24
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,976
but I don't wanna overestimate
your intelligence.

25
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,011
If you burn me, I burn you.

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,772
Sydney, I couldn't reveal to Sloane
that you conspired to kill him

27
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,897
without also revealing my involvement.

28
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,740
Of course, I never had any intention
of going through with it.

29
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:01,285
- I simply needed to gain his trust.
- You know what I think?

30
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,740
You're just a dog looking for a new master.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,331
No need to worry, Sydney.

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,708
We're colleagues now.

33
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,922
I'll see you at the office.

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,805
Sloane wouldn't agree to partner with him
unless Sark made it worth his while.

35
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,521
Do you have any idea what they're after?

36
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,228
Given the scope of Sark's
previous contacts and operations,

37
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,191
he could be offering almost anything.

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,195
What concerns me more is that your
mother knew we were double agents

39
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,905
before she turned herself in.

40
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,407
She may have told Sark.

41
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,246
- I'll find out.
- Before you do, consider this.

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,162
Two months ago
she surrendered to the CIA.

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,872
Yesterday Sark made
a back-door agreement with Sloane

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,711
that places him inside SD-6.

45
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,133
Do you believe that's just a coincidence?

46
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,754
As you know,
Mr Sark surrendered to us last week.

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,968
After an extensive debriefing
with McCullough,

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,014
we've concluded that he can provide us
with credible intel.

49
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:12,897
Enough, in fact, to warrant an immunity
deal in exchange for his cooperation.

50
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,982
Sir, I believe this decision
is a critical mistake.

51
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,645
This man has murdered
hundreds of people for profit.

52
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,324
We should not set the precedent
of granting immunity to a terrorist,

53
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,203
no matter what he says he has to offer.

54
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,704
Yes, well, I understand your frustration,
Agent Dixon,

55
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,121
but I believe that Sark's cooperation
will save more lives than he's taken.

56
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,704
I'm with Dixon on this.

57
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,962
We have developed a strategy
to address your concerns. Jack.

58
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,886
In order to maintain
Sark's value as an informant,

59
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,467
his contacts must not be aware
that he's turned himself in.

60
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,393
Beginning today,
whenever Sark leaves this office,

61
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,017
a security section team
will double as his private detail

62
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,898
to ensure that he doesn't
violate his agreement with us.

63
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,898
I'm sorry I'm late.

64
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,908
Marshall Flinkman,
technical operations officer.

65
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,829
Hi. Welcome. Don't kill me.

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,744
Look, I understand that none of you
are inclined to believe a word I say,

67
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:18,084
but I assure you
it's not in my best interest to betray you.

68
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,386
You've given me the opportunity of
a lifetime and I don't intend to squander it.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,637
So that's how Sloane and Sark
have presented their new partnership.

70
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,760
No one at SD-6 likes it
but they all believe it.

71
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,353
I need to know if you ever told Sark
that I'm a double agent.

72
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,604
Sydney, no.

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,866
You saved Vaughn's life.
I'm grateful to you for that.

74
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:54,240
But I haven't made up my mind yet
if I should trust you.

75
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,957
And yet here you are.

76
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,340
I never told Sark about your status
as a double agent, Sydney.

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,131
That doesn't mean you're safe.

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,554
Tell me, what intelligence
has he provided Sloane?

79
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:15,309
Zoran Sokolov. A freelance mercenary
who's had extensive dealings with Mr Sark.

80
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,806
Yes, he frequently offers me the chance
to purchase intelligence

81
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,024
before he brings it to the black market.

82
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:24,654
Recently he asked me if I'd be interested
in obtaining a set of communication codes

83
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,825
used by Uzbekistan's ground forces
along the border.

84
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,619
If we don't obtain those codes,

85
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,951
Sokolov will sell them to extremist rebels
hiding in neighbouring Tadzhikistan.

86
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:39,498
With those codes, they can track Uzbek
troop movements and plan terrorist attacks.

87
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,625
This would gravely destabilise
our allies in Asia.

88
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,588
Sydney, you and Dixon
will make contact with this Sokolov.

89
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:51,135
Posing as Sark's associates, you will
purchase the codes and bring them here.

90
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,677
We both know Sloane doesn't care
about preserving stability in Asia,

91
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,555
so my question is, why does he want
those communication codes so badly?

92
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,434
I'm going to ask you to give me something
you have no reason to give.

93
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,313
I'm going to ask for your faith.

94
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,868
You have to convince your superiors
to let me leave this place.

95
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,234
- What?
- For 48 hours.

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,157
- I'll agree to a special forces escort.
- Why?

97
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,499
- I cannot tell you that.
- Go where? What are those codes for?

98
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,503
I'm trying to help you,
but I must be allowed to do it my way.

99
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,296
It's asking too much.

100
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,754
I cannot give you details
because I don't trust the CIA.

101
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,678
They almost had me executed
two weeks ago.

102
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,712
The only way for me to maintain my value
is to tell you only what you need to know

103
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,966
in order to stay ahead of Sloane.

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,268
And all you need to know now
is that if I'm not allowed to leave,

105
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:44,862
everything you've worked
to accomplish will be lost.

106
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,942
Agent Bristow, you're asking me
to get Irina Derevko a 48-hour...

107
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,778
- I'm asking you to consider it.
- You can't tell me why.

108
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,901
She won't say why.

109
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,946
Sloane tasked you to acquire Uzbekistan's
ground-force communication codes.

110
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,619
And how does success or failure risk...

111
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,667
My mother is clearly worried
about something else.

112
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,541
Some unintended consequence
that we can't predict.

113
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,585
Sir, thus far, Derevko's intel
has been right 100 per cent of the time.

114
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,298
We didn't catch this woman.
She turned herself in.

115
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:14,014
She's agreed to be escorted by a special
forces team and wear a tracking device.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,643
- She will not get away.
- Jack, you've been awfully quiet.

117
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,519
I'm sorry. When it comes to Irina Derevko,
my judgement's proven to be... impaired.

118
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,357
Well, I would like your opinion.

119
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:35,119
Perhaps they're right. Perhaps releasing
her is worth the risk to satisfy our curiosity.

120
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,992
Well, hell, when you put it that way,
the answer is definitely no.

121
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,787
If Irina Derevko wants out of here,
she's gonna have to tell us more.

122
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,953
Otherwise, you're to proceed as planned.

123
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:47,293
Agent Vaughn will give you
your countermission.

124
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,633
Thanks. You told Kendall
your judgement wasn't to be trusted

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,641
and then agreed with me
to reinforce his doubt.

126
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:04,354
Kendall's ego predisposes him to favour
decisions in which he's overruling others.

127
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,147
You argue your way, I'll argue mine.

128
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,492
Your countermission's simple.

129
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,249
You'll dead drop a copy of the codes
when you get back from Uzbekistan

130
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,164
so we can figure out what they're really for.

131
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,126
I have to go pack.

132
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,145
I must admit, this is one of
the most impressive operations I've seen.

133
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,559
Though it is a touch pathetic

134
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,686
how so many of them believe
they actually work for the CIA.

135
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,482
Look at me.

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,615
You've offered me a substantial prize
to make our partnership worthwhile,

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,654
but do not think for a second
that gives you the right to insult my people.

138
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,742
I apologise.

139
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,173
I had a run-in
with Sydney Bristow this morning.

140
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,557
She may be the only one who suspects
I haven't in fact turned myself in.

141
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,639
I've been a presence in Sydney's life
since she was born.

142
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:27,605
- Sydney will believe whatever I tell her to.
- And her father?

143
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:32,069
He must often battle the temptation
to tell her the truth about SD-6.

144
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,322
I'd hate to see Jack's paternal instincts
compromise our objectives.

145
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:41,862
So, for the time being, I wouldn't tell him
what those codes are really for.

146
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,542
Yeah?

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,292
Sir, a call's been routed to you
through Credit Dauphine.

148
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,845
- Take a message.
- He says it's regarding your wife.

149
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,386
That'll be all.

150
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,404
Put him through.
I want you to record this call.

151
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,902
Hello?

152
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,611
We have your wife and, yes, she's alive.

153
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:26,034
You will provide us with the account
numbers for all SD-6 investments

154
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:31,001
or the Alliance will be informed
that you failed to carry out her execution.

155
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,707
Offer me proof that she's alive.

156
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:41,219
Until then, know this:
as soon as I hang up the phone,

157
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,100
I will use every available resource
to find out who I'm talking to.

158
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:52,439
And when I do, it will be my sincere
pleasure to make your acquaintance.

159
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,930
So, you work for Sark.

160
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,763
Tell him I'm insulted
he didn't come here personally.

161
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,351
We'll make sure he gets the message.

162
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,693
Mr Sokolov, we're on a schedule.

163
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,486
Do you have the codes?

164
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,533
Do you have the money?

165
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,383
Wait.

166
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,054
The codes are on a computer in this case.

167
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:18,981
The case, before I stole it,
belonged to a colonel in the Uzbek army.

168
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,607
What I didn't realise
when I made the offer to Sark

169
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:29,740
is that without the colonel's fingerprint
the case cannot be opened

170
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:35,373
without detonating
a self-destruct mechanism inside.

171
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,871
Boom.

172
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,880
Are you telling us you cannot deliver
what you've promised us?

173
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,391
Please. I wouldn't have asked you
to come all this way

174
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,224
without a solution to this little problem.

175
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,893
I have arranged for colonel
to be someplace tonight

176
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,106
where you can take his prints.

177
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,945
How exactly did you do that?

178
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,662
I had him assassinated.

179
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,101
Are you in yet?

180
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,521
That microchip you gave me
isn't exactly state of the art.

181
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,320
It's still reading morgue records
off the central server.

182
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,792
OK, Dixon, I'm in.

183
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,960
Me, too, Sydney. Stand by.

184
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,220
- What was colonel's name?
- Vasili Kabilov.

185
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,387
Sydney, you're looking for Vasili Kabilov.
ID tag C-16.

186
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,580
- Dixon, don't shoot. It's me.
- Get in.

187
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,939
I know. Sydney told me
about Project Christmas,

188
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,692
and how it was developed
to identify future spies,

189
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,982
and now you're worried because
you think the Russians might have used it

190
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,612
to recruit American children
back in the '80s.

191
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,562
About that...

192
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,609
The thing is, I think there might be
something to your theory.

193
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,482
Really?

194
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,951
Remember those weird test questions
you gave me,

195
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,278
the ones the KGB developed?
I found them.

196
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,697
I found them integrated
into a series of standardised tests

197
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,539
that were administered here in 1982.

198
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:10,875
- How many kids took that test?
- Five million.

199
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,298
Well, look,
I didn't think Devlin, my superior,

200
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:23,055
would mind me having you research this,
but he did and he ordered me to let you go.

201
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,766
Wait a...

202
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,144
There's something here.

203
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,938
OK, look, I'll narrow the test score
down to a small group of kids.

204
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,352
Now, Devlin won't be able
to deny the value of that.

205
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,561
He thinks since you're a journalist,

206
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:41,537
since you've been trained to report
what you know, that you're a security risk.

207
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,448
- Well, don't sweat it.
- Here's what I owe you.

208
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,998
- There's 700.
- I didn't work that many hours.

209
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:53,001
Seriously, I don't know how you did it
so fast. I told you to take your time.

210
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,919
Thanks, but my time's
all I expect to get paid for.

211
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,641
Hey.

212
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,560
Hey.

213
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,488
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

214
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,574
Nothing? Nothing's wrong?

215
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,953
Syd, if we'd just met,
I would know something's wrong.

216
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,715
Do you remember Mr Sark?

217
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,138
Do I remember the guy
who shot me with a tranquilliser?

218
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:48,100
- The guy who had me tortured in Taipei?
- He's working with SD-6.

219
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,521
I can't tell you any more than that.

220
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,850
You've seen him?

221
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,944
- You're working with him?
- I have to make him think I am.

222
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,355
That little British
cocky son of a bitch is in LA?

223
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,236
Hey, Syd.
Syd, I'm on the line with the spa.

224
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:06,574
Did you want to get a Swedish
or a shiatsu massage?

225
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,867
You have to reschedule.

226
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:15,036
Believe me, there is nothing I would rather
do than spend a day with you at the spa.

227
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,002
- How about next week?
- Next week's great.

228
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,758
But I am still gonna go tomorrow.

229
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,922
- OK, I wanna kill that Sark guy.
- I know.

230
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,850
- No, this is gonna drive me insane.
- You asked me to tell you.

231
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,263
I didn't know it was gonna be a nightmare.

232
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,022
- He's almost killed me, too.
- But you get to do something about it.

233
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:36,480
I mean, yeah, you get to go off and be
sneaky and ultimately destroy the guy.

234
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,440
What about your work with Vaughn?

235
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,111
Vaughn sort of fired me.

236
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,660
The CIA's just gonna ignore
everything Will found out?

237
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,621
Actually, when Devlin heard
five million American first graders

238
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,547
took a standardised test
that may have been doctored by the KGB,

239
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,505
he sent Will's research to the FBI.

240
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,261
- And?
- We're still waiting for the results.

241
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,131
That's the second time
Will's come through for us.

242
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:09,513
I wish there were more I could do for him,
I really do. He's a good guy.

243
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,560
- Thanks.
- Syd...

244
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,321
This watch belonged to my father.

245
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,656
It's broken now,
but it used to keep perfect time.

246
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:35,455
And when he gave it to me, he said
"You could set your heart by this watch."

247
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,212
It stopped October 1st, the day we met.

248
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,024
Kendall.

249
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,989
Me too.

250
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,752
What's going on?

251
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,713
We just heard from Analysis about
the codes you acquired in Uzbekistan.

252
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,713
Sloane and Sark gave us a half-truth.

253
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,641
The codes are Uzbek but they have
nothing to do with troop communications.

254
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,888
What are they for?

255
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,096
They're the control codes
for six portable nuclear warheads

256
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,975
that the Uzbeks have admitted
and defence intelligence has confirmed

257
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,020
went missing six months ago.

258
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,904
SD-6 is in possession
of six nuclear weapons?

259
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,481
No. This morning Sark
electronically messengered the codes

260
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,615
to an unknown third party.

261
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:50,817
We couldn't trace the link.

262
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,533
And all we know about them is that
they're working with Sloane and Sark?

263
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,244
Why did Sloane
keep you in the dark on this?

264
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,834
- I don't know.
- This is what my mother was talking about.

265
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,166
We should have listened to her.

266
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,126
Well, if she was so concerned
about helping us stay ahead of SD-6,

267
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,506
she could have told us what was at stake.

268
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,089
And what would you have done?

269
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,011
Given Sydney false control codes
to hand over to SD-6?

270
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,298
Sark may have known the difference

271
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,718
and she would have been exposed
as a double agent.

272
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,940
I wasn't willing to risk her life that way.

273
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,642
- Do you know where the nukes are?
- Yes, I do.

274
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,564
Where?

275
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,817
I've spent the last 36 nights
lying on a steel mattress.

276
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,618
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

277
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:36,369
It means I would appreciate
a pillow and blanket.

278
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,127
Done. Tell us about the warheads.

279
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,789
They're in Kashmir, under what used to be
a maximum-security prison camp.

280
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:48,294
It's now the stronghold for a mercenary
group, the People's Revolutionary Front.

281
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,423
So Sloane and Sark have in fact
partnered with this organisation?

282
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,795
It would appear.

283
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,263
Can you give us
the prison camp's exact coordinates?

284
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:55,767
Yes.

285
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,260
I'm gonna recommend to the Defence
Department an immediate air strike.

286
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,561
When the smoke clears
we can dig the warheads out of the rubble.

287
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,688
I wouldn't do that.

288
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:06,145
Now that the PRF has the control codes,
they may have set the warheads

289
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,523
to detonate in the event of sabotage
or a pre-emptive strike.

290
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,443
What about sending in a commando unit?

291
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,579
If they were familiar with the facility,
I'd say it was a good idea.

292
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,415
That's what you were planning on doing.

293
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,741
- Yes.
- That's impossible to verify.

294
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,622
All right, Ms Derevko.
You're gonna lead us into that prison.

295
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:28,921
No, I'm not. My offer expired the moment
the detonation codes were acquired.

296
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,584
Do I have to remind you
that your immunity deal

297
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,756
is contingent upon
your continued cooperation?

298
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:38,973
I have cooperated, Agent Kendall.
You didn't listen.

299
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,138
Now, if you'd bring me
my pillow and blanket...

300
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,307
You listen to me.
I'm authorised to put you in solitary.

301
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,728
You're lucky
you have a view of this hallway.

302
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:49,230
Agent Kendall,
may I speak to my mother alone, please?

303
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:05,495
Sydney, I'm sorry.

304
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:09,004
You said you didn't tell us the truth
because you were trying to protect me,

305
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:14,431
because you didn't wanna risk Sark
finding out that I was a double agent.

306
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:19,853
The thing is, someone now has the ability
to detonate six nuclear weapons,

307
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,641
and I am responsible.

308
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:28,436
So I am going to be part of the team
that finds and disarms those warheads,

309
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,648
no matter what you do.

310
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,651
But if you were telling the truth
when you said you wanted to protect me,

311
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:40,279
then, Mom, I need your help.

312
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,846
You convinced your mother
to go to Kashmir.

313
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,101
I told her if she didn't lead the team
to the warheads, I would.

314
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:14,647
- I handed those codes to SD-6.
- Your guilt is unfounded.

315
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,944
You were doing your job.

316
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,405
I'm going, Dad. Defence approved it.

317
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:29,663
I am not about to let Irina Derevko near six
nuclear weapons supervised only by you.

318
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,914
Plane leaves in an hour.

319
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:53,773
Obviously you can't maintain your cover
if you're shackled.

320
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:57,528
So there are two things
you need to know about this necklace.

321
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:58,946
One, it's layered with C-4.

322
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:03,531
If you remove it while it's armed,
you'll break the circuit and it'll detonate.

323
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,948
And two,

324
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:11,000
if at any moment I believe you're
attempting to escape or sabotage us,

325
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:15,751
I'll activate this remote trigger
and blow your head off myself.

326
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,270
All right, here's how this works.

327
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:40,279
Derevko will detail your infiltration
into the facility once you reach it.

328
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,740
Until then, you have operational control.

329
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,949
The unrest in Kashmir has caused both
Pakistan and India to seal their borders,

330
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,163
so you'll board a train in New Delhi.

331
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,585
There's a three-mile stretch of track that
passes through the eastern tip of Kashmir.

332
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:55,503
That's where you'll get off. Your gear
will be planted in the baggage car.

333
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,261
Once you're off the train,
you'll rendezvous with the CIA contact

334
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,049
who will provide you the op tech
you'll need to infiltrate the facility.

335
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,179
- How did you clear this with Sloane?
- I took care of Sloane.

336
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:09,387
There's a C-5 prepped and waiting
at the Van Nuys airport. They'll escort you.

337
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,272
Good luck.

338
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,274
I'll talk to you when you reach the contact.

339
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,726
Agent Vaughn has trouble sleeping
when you're in the field.

340
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,899
- I doubt he told you that.
- He didn't have to tell me.

341
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:02,151
I could see it in his eyes.
And I see it in yours.

342
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,077
Agent Vaughn is my colleague.

343
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,281
You're so willing
to take risks for your country.

344
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,662
Why aren't you willing
to do the same for your own happiness?

345
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,119
I hardly think you've earned the right
to give anyone relationship advice.

346
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,166
Jack, Sydney's smart and she's strong,
but she's not happy.

347
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,878
- OK, wait a second.
- And after a 20-year absence,

348
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,969
you've gleaned that from the cumulative
half-hour you've spent in her presence?

349
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,130
I knew it the moment I saw her.
I'm her mother.

350
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:28,888
Your motherhood is a biological fact
with no substantive value in Sydney's life.

351
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,601
Hey.

352
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,976
Stop baiting him.

353
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,140
Stop being such an easy target.

354
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,558
We're gonna be travelling together
for the next two days.

355
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:42,148
You can't jump down her throat
every time she opens her mouth.

356
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,626
Hope I didn't pull you away
from something too important.

357
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,419
It's all right. What's up?

358
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,089
Look, except for you, Sydney and Jack,
everybody I know,

359
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:11,306
and a lot of people I don't,
they think I'm a lying junkie, OK?

360
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,601
And helping you,
doing something for the CIA,

361
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:17,306
it felt like a chance to do something
that mattered again, you know?

362
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,987
Like, I don't know, maybe
I went through all this crap for a reason.

363
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:27,699
- What is this?
- I know you can't pay me. It doesn't matter.

364
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:33,371
You're looking at 40 names.
Those are 40 kids that got a perfect score

365
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:37,290
on the standardised test that included
the Project Christmas questions.

366
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,541
How did you get this?

367
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,465
Between '80 and '85, Carnegie Mellon
conducted a cultural-bias study

368
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,838
on standardised testing.

369
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,386
Not only did they have the results,

370
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,795
but they cross-referenced them
by name and ethnicity.

371
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,760
The FBI has been trying to narrow down
a list of kids for as long as you have

372
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,223
and so far they haven't come up
with a single name.

373
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:55,767
That's probably because they didn't know
that the test records from '82 were missing

374
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,398
from the testing service archives.

375
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:01,231
What do you mean, they're missing?
Who took them?

376
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,024
I don't know yet.

377
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,383
- What is the purpose of your visit to India?
- Family vacation.

378
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,008
We're touring
the Kaziranga National Park by train.

379
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:33,597
Not exactly a vacation when you're forced
to go. No offence. Cute country.

380
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,258
Honey, we agreed
we'd spend Thanksgiving together.

381
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,679
Before I found out
all my friends were gonna be in Miami.

382
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:43,435
We're not going to talk about this now.
I do apologise.

383
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,647
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

384
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,195
That is a lovely necklace you're wearing.

385
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,487
An anniversary gift from my husband.

386
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,032
Thanks.

387
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,929
I'm sorry, I was trying to call information.

388
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:18,978
Perhaps I can help.

389
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,103
They'll be at the rendezvous point
at 2200 hours.

390
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,267
I understand.

391
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,706
You, miss, are in Sleeper G.

392
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,583
Mr and Mrs Godson,
you are right next to her in Sleeper H.

393
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:55,094
The rest of your luggage
will be in the cargo hold.

394
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,259
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

395
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,923
That bridge is the point of no return.

396
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,801
If you're lying about this,
none of us will survive.

397
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,727
I'd offer to go first but I don't wanna be
accused of trying to escape.

398
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,183
We go at the same time.
Sydney, you follow.

399
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,893
That's not safe.
These winds are too strong.

400
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,439
Our chutes could get tangled.
You go first.

401
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,734
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
You go first.

402
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,648
- You'll have to trust me sometime.
- Trust is the last thing you're getting.

403
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,824
The only reason you know about the nukes
is because of me. I want some respect.

404
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,994
- We'll miss our window unless you jump.
- Shut up.

405
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,727
- I told you to follow us once we jumped.
- We were gonna miss our window.

406
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:11,600
Sydney, I need to know I can count on you
whether you agree with me or not.

407
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,771
OK.

408
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:18,654
There.

409
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,583
Agent Bristow, so good to see you again.

410
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,245
It's been a long time, Saeed.
My daughter, Sydney.

411
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,915
Your reputation is beginning
to rival your father's.

412
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,881
Nice to meet you.

413
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,427
Saeed Akhtar, Irina Derevko.

414
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,268
She's assisting us,
on loan from FBI custody.

415
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,473
Your last name's Akhtar,
but your accent has a trace of Hindi.

416
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,270
My mother is from Jammu.

417
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,645
Your parents were brave to marry,
knowing the prejudice they'd face.

418
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,777
Let's get moving.

419
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:02,779
I have everything you need
to infiltrate the prison camp undetected.

420
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,196
NVGs, Kevlar BDUs,

421
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:09,411
encrypted Satcoms,
three pounds of C-4 satchel charges,

422
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,880
and a Cryo3 radiation detector
to help you locate the nukes.

423
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,879
- How far away is the PRF stronghold?
- Nine hours. Outside of Muzaffarabad.

424
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,543
Not for her.

425
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,693
Sir, this was sent to the mail room.

426
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:42,151
We scanned it for biological contaminates.

427
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,319
It's clean.

428
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:46,760
- Back up.
- Jack?

429
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,308
Back up now.

430
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:17,035
International aid workers.

431
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:27,130
International aid workers, sahib.

432
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:41,070
I am disgusted one of my own countrymen
would assist the CIA.

433
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:44,274
- I assume you speak for your unit?
- Yes.

434
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:47,320
We know you're looking for
the People's Revolutionary Front.

435
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,660
We thought we'd make it easy for you.
Here we are.

436
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,581
- Is there something you'd like to tell us?
- We'd like the warheads you've acquired.

437
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,795
I'm sure.

438
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:26,230
Thank you for the supplies.

439
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:06,779
And love, it's not the easy thing

440
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:10,909
The only baggage that you can bring

441
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,781
Not the easy thing

442
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:19,910
The only baggage you can bring
is all that you can't leave behind

443
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:27,883
- Are you OK?
- It's just a scratch.

444
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:30,638
- Drop it.
- Dad.

445
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,798
Quiet.

446
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:43,609
Jack, we're in enemy territory
and the PRF knows we're here.

447
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:52,654
We need to start
trusting each other right now.

448
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,870
You will not carry a weapon.

449
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,201
OK.

450
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:07,711
Looks like we're about 20 miles
southwest of Azad.

451
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,967
We can contact
the CIA station chief in Pakistan.

452
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,545
He'll patch us through to Langley
on a secure line.

453
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,345
We should make it by dawn.

454
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,636
Walk on

455
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,096
Walk on

456
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,977
What you got, they can't steal it

457
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,977
No, they can't even feel it

458
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,276
Walk on

459
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,565
Walk on

460
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:35,781
Stay safe tonight

461
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:43,077
You're packing a suitcase for a place

462
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:46,834
None of us has been

463
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:52,628
A place that has to be believed

464
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,844
To be seen
