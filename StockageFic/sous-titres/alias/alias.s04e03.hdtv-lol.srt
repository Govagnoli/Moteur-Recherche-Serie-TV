1
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:25,404
Mrs. Demarco, it's a pleasure.

2
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:28,008
I'm the bank manager. We spoke on the phone.

3
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:28,853
Yeah.

4
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:30,969
My jet got bouncy out of Newark.

5
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:34,004
Not to be a pain in the shaker, but can we cut to the dessert?

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,469
By all means, please.

7
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:36,564
This is Leon.

8
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,935
Hey, how you doing? Leon Frost. CPA of V.I.P. That's a nice suit.

9
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:41,999
- Thanks, Leon.
- So, can we do business?

10
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,274
Yes, I'm sure this is the right bank.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,304
Please check it again.

12
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:47,965
Roger Fonseca. Have you never heard of the Fonseca vineyards?

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,460
No.

14
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:53,072
Please, check it again. F-O-N-S-E-C-A, like it says on the passport.

15
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:56,442
You guarantee my name can't be traced to my account number?

16
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:59,050
Not that I have anything to hide or anything.

17
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,326
The names of all the account holders are stored exclusively

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,312
in my personal safe right here.

19
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:09,208
It's a Manheim. Protected biometrically.

20
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,709
It's good enough for three ex-presidents,

21
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,866
I guess it's good enough for a plumber's wife.

22
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:19,468
Now, the minimum deposit that I mentioned.

23
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:20,646
Leon.

24
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,562
That would be my department.

25
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:26,923
And...

26
00:01:29,144 --> 00:01:30,230
Excellent.

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,263
All right, uh, your full name.

28
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:38,001
Claudia Maria Vasquez Demarco.

29
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:41,274
- That's a lovely name.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

30
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:44,163
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna start getting upset

31
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:46,628
if you don't find my account information now.

32
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:49,317
Your manager will not be happy to lose my business.

33
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:50,182
Excuse me, please, miss.

34
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:52,149
You can tell me where I can go to cash this check.

35
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,709
I'm doing business here, Brady. Go bother someone else.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,535
Is it me you are talking to like that, mon?

37
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,123
Yes, mon, it is.

38
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,109
And I'm not in a good mood, so just walk away.

39
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:03,146
Boy, you need more peace in your life, brother.

40
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:06,210
Maybe you need a hearing aid, and I'm not your brother, so shove off.

41
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,527
Break it off.

42
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:09,490
Guard!

43
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,045
This is your account number, and that's your name -- in code, of course.

44
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,488
Yes?

45
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,613
Excuse me. I'll be right back in one minute.

46
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,457
No problem. We'll hold down the fort.

47
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:24,113
Anybody tries to steal anything from you --

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,223
- Leon!
- Oh. Sorry.

49
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,762
Scanning the database records.

50
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,059
Break it up!

51
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:42,139
Break it up!

52
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:42,935
Break it up!

53
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,559
What's the account number?

54
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,215
1-4-2-0-5-4-3-0-2-0-2-0-2-

55
00:02:57,307 --> 00:03:00,537
0-2-0-2-2-2-0-6-9-6-3-5.

56
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,897
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,121
Pardon me for that.

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,775
Sorry. I apologize.

59
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:17,474
Got it.

60
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,130
What were you doing?

61
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:33,448
Just...

62
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,085
breaking into your safe.

63
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,928
You almost fooled me.

64
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:58,927
Thanks for coming. Come on in.

65
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:04,843
Right here, please.

66
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:10,108
Hungry.

67
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,662
What? I'm starving. You're taking three.

68
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,268
- These are for my kids.
- Well, these are for Mitchell.

69
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,637
Your son is 14 months old.

70
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:20,291
Is that too young to have pizza? Hey, thanks for inviting us.

71
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,308
So, I think something's going on between

72
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:28,771
my sister and the birthday boy.

73
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:31,188
Yeah, I've been watching, and I can tell you, that's not a great thing.

74
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:31,657
Why not?

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,693
Well, 'cause the same thing happens every time.

76
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,663
He gets way too eager, the girl breaks his heart,

77
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,079
and I have to clean it up.

78
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,640
Don't be a cynic.

79
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,411
- Pizza and vegetables?
- I know.

80
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,103
We should go some time.

81
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,188
No woman ever wants to go to the magic castle.

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,603
I like magic.

83
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,103
And I like your smile, too.

84
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,731
This one right here?

85
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:55,338
- This smile?
- Yeah, that one.

86
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:56,751
How red is my face right now?

87
00:04:56,874 --> 00:04:58,053
- Very red.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:58,146 --> 00:04:59,977
Hey, guys. How's it going?

89
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,375
- Hey. Very well.
- Easy, Tiger.

90
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,774
Oh, no, I'm on fire, my friend. She loves magic.

91
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,095
Do you think people are having fun?

92
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:07,607
- Hey!
- Whoa!

93
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:08,828
You're so old.

94
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:11,006
Dude, you're so bald. What's up, man?

95
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:11,755
I'm so glad you're here.

96
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,316
These are friends of mine. This is Sydney. And Nadia.

97
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,732
- How you doing?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

98
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:16,338
And, uh...

99
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,500
- Michael?
- Right.

100
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:18,916
- How you doing, man?
- Nice to meet you.

101
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,380
I used to work with these guys until they went private sector on me.

102
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,557
What do you do now?

103
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,784
I work in a bank -- in the loan department.

104
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,689
Looks  like the party just got started.

105
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:35,715
Hey, mr. Bristow. Want some pizza or a cocktail?

106
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,138
D ad.

107
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,844
It must have been lost in the mail.

108
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,628
Your invitation?

109
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,281
Unless it was an e-vite.

110
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,008
I don't read e-vites.

111
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,420
Your mission last week in the Bahamas paid off.

112
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:02,456
We know who has the Valta.

113
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,822
That's what you came here to tell me? There's a briefing in the morning.

114
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,239
I know.

115
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:10,442
I've learned that you invited your sister to live here.

116
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,047
I'm letting her stay here, yes.

117
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,225
Are you aware that Sloane has Langley's approval

118
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,337
to make her a permanent member of our team at A.P.O.?

119
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:21,182
If you're wondering whether I've told Nadia that you killed our mother,

120
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,451
no, I haven't.

121
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:24,943
But I plan to.

122
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,816
- Out of spite?
- Out of respect.

123
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,709
Sydney, consider the ramifications.

124
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,268
She's my sister. I need to tell her the truth.

125
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,734
This isn't about what you need, Sydney.

126
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,340
No, apparently it's about what you need.

127
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,899
You don't know how Nadia may react to that information.

128
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:40,698
Which will be especially true if she finds out from another source.

129
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,065
I needn't remind you that your sister

130
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,835
has sworn to kill the man responsible for your mother's death.

131
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,331
- Hey.
- Hi.

132
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,128
Syd, where are the candles? These guys want to do the cake.

133
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,971
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

134
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,858
Trust me, dad, I don't look forward to telling Nadia what you did

135
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,540
or why you did it.

136
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,184
But she will learn the truth somehow,

137
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,933
and I would rather it be from me.

138
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:44,278
10 days ago, the Valta computer was stolen in broad daylight

139
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,650
as it was being transferred to NSA headquarters.

140
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,286
Now, the Valta represents cutting-edge technology.

141
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:55,466
It will revolutionize information gathering from satellite networks.

142
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:58,359
- If it falls in the wrong hands --
- It would be like monster bad.

143
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,395
Simply put, we cannot let the Valta be delivered.

144
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,384
Delivered to whom?

145
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:06,805
A new terrorist network out of Germany -- the Badenliga.

146
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,830
The theft was financed by transferring 3 million euros

147
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,111
into an untraceable account in the Bahamas.

148
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:17,386
Your work has given us the name of that account -- Martin Bishop.

149
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,945
Intel indicates that Bishop is still waiting to receive final payment

150
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,216
before he delivers the Valta.

151
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,274
Then we need to get to Bishop right away.

152
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:26,403
What do we know about him?

153
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:28,344
He's a British ex-pat living in Spain.

154
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:32,428
He has a reputation as a ladykiller -- literally.

155
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:33,918
His wife disappeared three years ago.

156
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,718
Rumor has it that he killed her to spend more time with his mistress.

157
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:37,590
Charming.

158
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:40,912
Professionally, Bishop specializes in acquiring high-risk,

159
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,469
high-reward military targets.

160
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:48,029
The Valta must be recovered or destroyed.

161
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,010
I want you to find it.

162
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,568
That'll be all.

163
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,845
Sydney.

164
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,200
Thank you.

165
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,776
For  what?

166
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:08,280
For letting my daughter stay with you.

167
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,869
As Nadia acclimates to this life,

168
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,305
to her new family,

169
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:16,189
she needs support,

170
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,779
and you have put my mind at ease.

171
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,098
The thought that I did something

172
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,086
that might have given you a warm and fuzzy feeling

173
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,313
makes me want to kick my own sister out of my house.

174
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:27,950
Yeah.

175
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,313
Well, Nadia won't be assisting you on the Bishop case.

176
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:33,301
Now that she's joining our team,

177
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,668
your father has offered to run her through her psych evaluation.

178
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:40,733
Really?

179
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,863
The Yakahoshi review can predict how an individual

180
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:47,041
will react to highly stressful situations and the discovery of delicate intel.

181
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,297
Delicate intel?

182
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,380
Sydney, I'm resigned to the fact

183
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,272
that you're going to tell Nadia what happened,

184
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,737
but when are you going to do that?

185
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,773
Now? Two hours before you leave for an operation?

186
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,190
Not until I get back.

187
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:58,881
Understood.

188
00:09:59,301 --> 00:10:01,004
And I agree. It's for the best.

189
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,525
What are you up to, dad?

190
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:09,119
They're waiting for you, Sydney.

191
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:23,589
Nadia.

192
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,040
Is he always so cold?

193
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:30,096
Jack?

194
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:33,286
I'm afraid so.

195
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:35,588
So, I was wondering,

196
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,659
are you free tonight?

197
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,981
There's this restaurant on Melrose. It serves Argentinean food.

198
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,718
We can go any place you'd like.

199
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,494
I'd like that.

200
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,990
Good.

201
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,187
I'll see you when you're through.

202
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:52,610
Okay.

203
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:58,885
Great. I'll check that out with the NSA.

204
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,282
Intel indicates Bishop owns a dozen industrial properties in Spain.

205
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,748
Any one of them could be a safe hiding place for the Valta.

206
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,308
Bishop also recently purchased an MK-1200 from Cheline Tech.

207
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:13,787
Well, you don't buy a server like that to look at online porn.

208
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,872
No, you buy it to coordinate international business operations.

209
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:17,955
At least that's what it's made for.

210
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:18,990
Logistics, essentially.

211
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,217
So let's assume the location of the Valta is on that server.

212
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,633
And the server's on his estate.

213
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,762
An hour out of Malaga. A couple hundreds acres.

214
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:29,324
And you can't hack into an MK-1200 from the outside, FYI.

215
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,931
Okay, so what if you're on the inside?

216
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,394
Multiple electric fences,

217
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:35,286
cameras on high sweep, armed guards, comm jammers.

218
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,275
Well, if you can get past all that,

219
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,072
I've got this really cool laser lock pick

220
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,584
that will help you hack into the server.

221
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:44,620
It's housed in this watch that's awesomely designed by me, Marshall J. Flinkman.

222
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,845
Except I'm still working on that overheating problem --

223
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:48,166
So we need to get into that house,

224
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:51,059
get into the server, and that will tell us where he's hiding the Valta.

225
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:53,761
How do you break into the house of a master thief?

226
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,130
I don't think you do.

227
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,347
I think you have to be invited.

228
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,323
   

229
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,823
   

230
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,246
  

231
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,095
Ok, they're approaching.

232
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,891
I've locked onto the cell phone frequencies.

233
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:39,925
All set.

234
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:42,863
Pull over.

235
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,652
Marshall,  can you flip that?

236
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:01,736
Oh sorry.

237
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,300
Okay. Cell phones are jammed.

238
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,283
- Hey, it's not igniting.
- What?

239
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:07,792
All right, hold on a sec.

240
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:10,014
Sometimes you just need a little magic touch.

241
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:11,840
And...

242
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,575
Fire!

243
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,623
Help! Help!

244
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,374
I can't get my seatbelt off!

245
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:20,570
Are you all right?

246
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,700
No, my seat belt's stuck.

247
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,022
Please, sir, please hurry.

248
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,485
- Can you move?
- Please, my seatbelt right here!

249
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,264
Please!

250
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:26,995
Call for help!

251
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,509
I can't get my seatbelt off! Please, sir, please!

252
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,191
It's stuck!

253
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,939
- Please, please, please...
- It's stuck.

254
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:37,029
Trigger the belt.

255
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:38,495
What, you don't want to milk this a little bit?

256
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,529
Marshall, do it.

257
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,037
Sorry. You don't have to get so snappy.

258
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,902
And now for the big finish --

259
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,461
Rock 'n roll Cleveland!

260
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:05,094
Ahh!

261
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,618
- Sir, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

262
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,064
- What about you?
- Yeah.

263
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,378
Sir, I can't get a signal. I don't know what's wrong.

264
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:15,725
Please don't call anybody.

265
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:17,046
Please.

266
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,353
You just rolled your car.

267
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,896
You must have been going at 200 kilometers an hour.

268
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,597
Sometimes you need to drive fast.

269
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,680
So why are you in such a rush?

270
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,536
Long story.

271
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,681
This guy scares me.

272
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,377
I mean, he killed his wife.

273
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,936
He's a wife-killer.

274
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,638
Beat her to death, stuffed her in a dumpster, who kowns what else?

275
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,007
Marshall, shut up.

276
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,450
Where you headed?

277
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:51,760
You just saved my life.

278
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,874
Perhaps I did.

279
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,979
I'm quite something, aren't I?

280
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,762
To me you are.

281
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,717
You know, a doctor should really look at --

282
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,944
No. I'm fine.

283
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:10,234
Look, I just need a place to rest.

284
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,528
I haven't slept much the past few days, that's all. I'm fine.

285
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,594
I live near here.

286
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,850
I'm taking you back to my house.

287
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,350
Okay.

288
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:45,303
Outrigger to Base.

289
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,576
Phoenix is in.

290
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:47,991
She's on her own.

291
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:53,346
Shotgun to Base. We're on position.

292
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,573
We're still on schedule.

293
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,409
Outrigger's patching us into the grid.

294
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,666
We'll have laser mike operational in five minutes.

295
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,941
Affirmative, Shotgun.

296
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,734
We're standing by for your information

297
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:02,675
Roger that.

298
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,233
Are you sure we can't use standard comms?

299
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:07,269
No, Bishop is using at least four high-impedance jammers.

300
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,498
Okay,  to burrow a hole through that kind of noise,

301
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,819
Sydney would have to wear a generator the size of a baby hippopotamus.

302
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:15,332
You know, and that's certainly no way to sneak around somebody's house,

303
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:18,895
with a baby hippopotamus strapped to your... back.

304
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:19,979
Good luck.

305
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,368
It's a nice shower.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,752
Yeah?

307
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:22,852
Good.

308
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,712
I'm glad you liked it.

309
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:27,962
How are you feeling?

310
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:30,862
Fine.

311
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,019
Grateful.

312
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,224
No more thanks.

313
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:39,704
You're a good excuse to get to know my house.

314
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:43,633
I haven't been in this room in three years.

315
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,095
Three years?

316
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,160
Not since my wife left me.

317
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,659
I'm sorry to hear about it.

318
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:54,957
It's in the past.

319
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:56,639
Yeah?

320
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,488
    

321
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,671
    

322
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:07,926
    

323
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:11,244
Your shoulder.

324
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,791
It's nothing.

325
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,959
All of this didn't come from the accident.

326
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,675
It's fine.

327
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,697
Who are you running from?

328
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:32,207
Your wife left you.

329
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,482
I left someone.

330
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,123
Only he didn't want me to go.

331
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:37,914
Who is he?

332
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:39,903
I can have someone talk to him.

333
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,462
I'm all right.

334
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:45,259
Now I'm all right.

335
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,729
I'll just have to remember not to wear something strapless.

336
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,452
I have some business in town.

337
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,224
Stay here, Charlene,

338
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,097
and rest.

339
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,163
When I get back, we'll have dinner.

340
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,944
My car's totaled.

341
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:07,978
I'm not going anywhere.

342
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,381
Thank you, Martin.

343
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,837
Oh stay inside.

344
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,109
Don't wander the grounds.

345
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,575
There's... security.

346
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,984
I'll stay put.

347
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,456
You might need to wake me when you get back.

348
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:35,791
I look forward to it.

349
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,660
You've been sent to Paris to extract a deep-cover operative.

350
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:52,889
You've successfully transferred him to a safe house on Ile st. Louis

351
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:56,401
when a secure communication comes in that you've been exposed.

352
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,603
Do you abort?

353
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:01,929
Well, that depends if he's --

354
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:04,585
What's your impulse? That's what this is about.

355
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,092
- Is the operative one of us?
- Yes or no?

356
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,460
No.

357
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:17,102
While tapping a phone line of a target in New Delhi,

358
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:19,470
you're spotted by the enemy.

359
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,315
Your partner tells you to continue with the mission objective

360
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,065
while he neutralizes the target.

361
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,996
Do you obey him or fight back?

362
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,271
Is the phone system the new PBX matrix?

363
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,974
Just answer the question, please.

364
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,899
Why is my partner a man?

365
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,443
The sex of your partner is irrelevant.

366
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,240
Oh.

367
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,923
No, I would not obey.

368
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:50,010
I'd help her fight him off.

369
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,024
Then she and I could finish the job together.

370
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,396
Jack?

371
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,397
How's she doing?

372
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:04,503
I don't quite know yet.

373
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:07,917
Oh, come on, Jack. It's been two hours. You must have formed an opinion.

374
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,001
I have, but I need to be certain.

375
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,441
Of course.

376
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:34,129
Shotgun to Phoenix.

377
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,196
How do you read?

378
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,225
This is so weird.

379
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:41,284
It sounds like you're right next to me.

380
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,596
- You can hear me?
- No.

381
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:49,228
Good. It's like talking to my conscience.

382
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:51,115
It is a little bit, isn't it?

383
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,169
Merlin, what's your status?

384
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:55,295
Give me a sec.

385
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,231
Okay, uh...

386
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,872
Okay, let me see.

387
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:03,811
Okay, we've got a huge power drain in the basement.

388
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,371
It's the room at the far southern end.

389
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:06,436
Copy that.

390
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,783
Phoenix, your target is in the basement.

391
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:11,962
Southernmost room.

392
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:13,428
It looks like an office.

393
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,844
Rendezvous at the far window on the first floor.

394
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,576
Move on my mark.

395
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:19,659
I see two visible bogeys,

396
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:21,170
one on the third floor,

397
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:22,994
one below.

398
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,345
Okay, you're clear. Go.

399
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:07,963
I was upside down, and the seatbelt wouldn't come undone.

400
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:09,760
And the car was blazing.

401
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,556
Joss -- Joss, calm down. I'll tell you.

402
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,193
He pulled me out.

403
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:17,654
And we just got free, and the thing blew up.

404
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:18,736
Huge.

405
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,788
- We're good.
- Good. Move fast.

406
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:05,846
Come on, come on, come on.

407
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,221
I found the Valta.

408
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:22,921
It's located at Alameda yards.

409
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,767
I.D. Number is Charlie-0717.

410
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,232
Okay, the coast is clear.

411
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,411
Get out of there. I'll see you at the extraction point.

412
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,178
- Sydney's on her way.
- On our way for pickup.

413
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,500
This is Arvin Sloane.

414
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,719
Requested intel has been acquired.

415
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:52,377
Valta is located in container I.D. Charlie-0717 in Alameda yards.

416
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:00,042
Wait. Stand down.

417
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,315
- What?
- What is it?

418
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,123
I saw you pull in.

419
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,242
You seem out of breath.

420
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:20,017
I'm just glad you're back.

421
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:22,259
Really?

422
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:25,018
This way.

423
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:31,104
We've got a problem.

424
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:34,305
You're one of a three-man team --

425
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:38,278
three-woman team, if you prefer.

426
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,208
A tactical mission.

427
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:44,226
You suspect that one of your team members may be a mole.

428
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,294
Do you tell the third?

429
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:49,128
Hmm. No.

430
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:54,623
You return from an operation overseas.

431
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:56,182
While the mission was successful,

432
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:58,770
certain information may reflect negatively

433
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:01,041
on one of your team members.

434
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:04,103
Do you include said information in your op report?

435
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:05,138
No.

436
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:07,763
Mr. Bristow?

437
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:10,613
Yes?

438
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:12,875
I don't mean to seem impatient,

439
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:18,198
but I've never done anything that's lasted as long as this.

440
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,660
How sad for you.

441
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,885
Jack Bristow.

442
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:27,998
We're through.

443
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:32,412
I gave Langley the location of the Valta.

444
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:33,209
Are they acting on it?

445
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,674
They have a team standing by in Malaga.

446
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,568
They're about to raid one of Bishop's truck yards.

447
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,317
What about Sydney?

448
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,972
She's still in the house with Bishop.

449
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:40,293
Is her cover blown?

450
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:42,455
I don't know.

451
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,441
Can we extract her?

452
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:45,746
Not yet. Langley considers the raid top priority.

453
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,497
We have the authority to seize Bishop

454
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,915
only after the Valta is secured or destroyed.

455
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,666
I'm sorry, Jack, but I just thought that you should know.

456
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:55,892
Then I'm going to Spain myself, and I'd like to take Nadia with me.

457
00:26:56,358 --> 00:27:00,636
Uh, about that -- have you learned anything helpful?

458
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,150
Enough.

459
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,043
Enough to deal with the problem at hand.

460
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:17,266
It occurred to me

461
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:18,633
that this night

462
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:23,541
represents things I've been considering for some time.

463
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,797
How's that?

464
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:28,990
The choices I make.

465
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:32,723
People with whom I choose to keep company.

466
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,021
Work versus...

467
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:37,885
everything else.

468
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,589
If you can hear me, tuck your hair behind your ear.

469
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,556
Sounds like a mid-existential crisis.

470
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,785
Yes. That's it.

471
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,821
Okay, Langley's ordered a raid on the Alameda yard.

472
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,572
You have got to get out of there.

473
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,805
It's easy to doubt yourself,

474
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:59,680
but sometimes you need to stick with it and stay the course.

475
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:01,477
Damn it, no. You've got to get out of there.

476
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,037
When Bishop hears about the raid, he'll suspect you.

477
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:07,409
But I think in my case, it might be time to make a

478
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,252
mid-course correction.

479
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:10,616
The fact is,

480
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,281
I don't believe in coincidence.

481
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,984
Meaning what?

482
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:20,424
You and I were destined to meet?

483
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:22,745
Possibly.

484
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,282
But I'm more interested to know why we met.

485
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,000
I told you,

486
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,053
I was involved with the wrong man.

487
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:38,031
I don't believe that.

488
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,591
Let's move! Move, move!

489
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:48,043
Go.

490
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,174
Call one in position.

491
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:54,219
Fan out.

492
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:12,753
Everyone get back, right now!

493
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:14,646
Fall back!

494
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:17,084
Cover me!

495
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:22,778
I don't get it. Why doesn't she just kick his ass, you know, and then run?

496
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,575
She doesn't want to blow her cover.

497
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,660
Wants to get out clean in case the raid goes South.

498
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:29,600
Shotgun, team's down.

499
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,861
Weiss was team leader.

500
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:34,592
We believe he's been captured.

501
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:36,705
Take that son of a bitch out.

502
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:39,408
The CIA team's under attack. They've got Weiss.

503
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,296
You're trembling.

504
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:52,482
I want to be honest, but everything has happened so fast.

505
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,988
I promised myself I wouldn't see someone again.

506
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:01,710
- I really need more details.
- About me?

507
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,985
We don't have more details.

508
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,732
Weiss took out the Valta with the grenade,

509
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:07,341
and then he went radio-silent. You've got to move now.

510
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:09,379
I have nothing to hide.

511
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,452
Excuse me.

512
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,113
Yeah?

513
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,797
Sir, we've just had an incident at Alameda yard.

514
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,569
How bad?

515
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,463
The Valta was destroyed. It was CIA.

516
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:28,823
I double-checked our signal's traffic.

517
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:32,622
Somebody was on your server, in your house, an hour ago.

518
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,276
Interesting.

519
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,088
Thank you, Pierre.

520
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,553
You all right?

521
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,200
Your expression -- reminds me of my uncle.

522
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,309
Shotgun to Outrigger,

523
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,728
Phoenix just gave the call sign. I'm going in. Request backup.

524
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,525
I'm on my way. Blow the alarm system.

525
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:56,994
Got it.

526
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:16,752
Outrigger, anything?

527
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:19,567
Negative.

528
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,932
Where is she?

529
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,222
Where is anyone?

530
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,855
The escape tunnel only gave them a 10-minute lead.

531
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:30,776
I know. I know. Okay, I know.

532
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,745
They've got to be somewhere.

533
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:32,213
So find them.

534
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,679
You're getting very impatient. I'm doing the best I can.

535
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,287
You've been doing it for an hour.

536
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,515
Well, to trace a guy on a cellular network using the frequency of his phone

537
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,503
is like trying to find a needle in a county full of haystacks.

538
00:31:38,642 --> 00:31:39,253
You have to find --

539
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,146
Yeah, I know what I'm supposed to be doing, all right? Just shut up!

540
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:48,035
- Sorry about that.
- No. That was good.

541
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:50,943
Hey, we got a hit.

542
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:51,414
Found them?

543
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:52,686
Well, the cell phone signal's weak.

544
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,723
- Can you locate them?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

545
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,045
Okay.

546
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:01,795
They were tracking Bishop.

547
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:04,304
We'll coordinate with Vaughn on the ground.

548
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:08,482
I know it must be hard for you...

549
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:12,106
having me at A.P.O.

550
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,035
Not at all.

551
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,061
I can't defend the choices my mother made.

552
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:21,000
Nadia, I would never blame you for your mother's infidelity.

553
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,745
But there is something I need to share with you.

554
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,947
I only do this because of your test results.

555
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:35,929
- Did I fail horribly?
- Hardly.

556
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:40,289
Not surprisingly, your ability to adapt to sudden changes in protocol,

557
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:44,136
to handle adverse situations is exceptional.

558
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:47,640
The results were very much like your sister's.

559
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,049
Sydney doesn't know this yet.

560
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,514
The result of an ongoing investigation.

561
00:32:56,452 --> 00:33:01,017
Ironically, this intel came in to me just this morning.

562
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,093
- This is Sloane.
- It's Vaughn.

563
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:18,366
We've got Jack and Nadia.

564
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,211
We're tracking Bishop, and we're en route.

565
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,751
Let me explain something to you.

566
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:39,577
I have been paid -- handsomely paid --

567
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:42,514
by the Badenliga to deliver the Valta computer,

568
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,532
which you decided to destroy with the toss of a hand grenade.

569
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,472
You're welcome.

570
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:49,080
As you can imagine, they won't be very happy.

571
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,242
And when they get here,

572
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:52,608
which they will shortly,

573
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,256
they'll kill me.

574
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:58,626
Unless I can provide them with information of an equal or greater value.

575
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,494
You're both CIA,

576
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:04,561
so you've obviously infiltrated my friends' network.

577
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,710
I want to know how.

578
00:34:10,002 --> 00:34:10,959
So...

579
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:13,822
what's your real name, Charlene?

580
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:20,236
I'm, uh...

581
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,457
"I'm, uh..." what?

582
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:27,981
I'm a-gonna kick your ass.

583
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:29,350
You son of a bitch!

584
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,243
The next one goes between your eyes.

585
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:42,890
Now --

586
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:48,267
Yeah?

587
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,934
The Badenliga.

588
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:07,354
If they move, shoot them in the kneecaps.

589
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,198
God, my heart!

590
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,011
What the hell is going on? You said you weren't agency anymore.

591
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:49,762
I'll tell you later. Thanks for the distraction.

592
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:51,702
Yeah, thanks for saving my life.

593
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:54,292
Wait a minute, this is black ops, isn't it?

594
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,803
Huh? Vaughn part of this, too?

595
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:56,552
We got to go.

596
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,000
- Am I right?
- We got to go.

597
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:10,796
   

598
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,403
   

599
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:15,441
   

600
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:18,661
   

601
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,567
Go for Bishop.

602
00:36:58,371 --> 00:36:59,981
Dude, I knew it!

603
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,278
I liked you...

604
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:49,304
much better...

605
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,141
as Charlene.

606
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:20,393
Is that how you normally deal with bad guys?

607
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:23,068
He was the one.

608
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:25,642
Bishop.

609
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:31,398
He killed our mother.

610
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:53,716
Dad, why does Nadia think that Bishop killed our mother?

611
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:56,276
I adjusted some details in Bishop's file.

612
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,830
You set her up.

613
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,986
I'd hardly call Martin Bishop an ally.

614
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:05,483
I solved two problems with one answer.

615
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,043
You manipulated Nadia.

616
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,123
I gave your sister closure.

617
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:11,283
But not the truth.

618
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,453
Sometimes a satisfying lie, Sydney,

619
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:17,357
can do more good than the awful truth.

620
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,457
