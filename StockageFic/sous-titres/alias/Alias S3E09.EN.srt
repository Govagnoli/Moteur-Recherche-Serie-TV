1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,046
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,468
Ms. Bristow, we know you know
how to read this code.

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,631
Decipher the text,
and we won't have to...

4
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:10,725
Don't bother negotiating
with me!

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,479
- Sydney.
- Dad.

6
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:25,613
You're alright, sweetheart.

7
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:33,281
He's with us.
Get in.

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,616
You made it, Sydney.

9
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:40,671
You made it.

10
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:26,041
At least we'll be able to get
to Sydney's coordinates.

11
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,464
Where's the...

12
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,092
That was the other map.

13
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:35,342
Okay, according to the
geosynchronous orbital position,

14
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:37,678
our entrance is here and here.

15
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,516
We've got to secure this...

16
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,275
Sweetheart, you're okay.

17
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,877
How do you feel?

18
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,752
Better, thanks.

19
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,091
- What's going on?
- You should know.

20
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,014
Sloane was instrumental
in orchestrating your escape.

21
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,055
I suppose I owe you a thank you.

22
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:18,092
Sydney, as long as you're alive,
you'll never owe me a thing.

23
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,097
Not just you.

24
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:25,146
Breaking me out of that facility
was dangerous and selfless.

25
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,772
Thank you.

26
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,647
All of you.

27
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,783
At the moment, we're fugitives,
but we're working on a plan

28
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,414
to frame The Covenant
for your extraction.

29
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:40,500
Have you mapped the coordinates
that Lindsey found in Rome?

30
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:42,625
They point to a desert
near the San Andreas Fault

31
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,417
Iess than an hour from here.

32
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,626
If there's something waiting
for us, it's most likely buried.

33
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,507
I'm gonna check it out.
In the meantime, we have a lead.

34
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:55,214
Something that might help us
retrieve your lost memories.

35
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,973
Sydney, my foundation gives
grants to various researchers.

36
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,469
One of these men
has in development

37
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,224
a non-invasive therapy

38
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,068
for treating
long-term severe amnesia.

39
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,319
If this therapy works, why
didn't you mention it before?

40
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:12,157
Well, Sydney, up until now,

41
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,776
I didn't think that you'd
be willing to accept my help.

42
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,415
Dad, I want to go with you.

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,205
- You should rest.
- I've rested enough.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,757
So I was an idiot.

45
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,721
Michael tried to warn me about
Lindsey, but I didn't listen.

46
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:38,512
I couldn't believe
what he was telling me,

47
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,594
so I did what I always do.

48
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,644
I followed the rules.

49
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,845
We should go.

50
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,733
You said when Lindsey forced you
to break the code,

51
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,282
you gave him false coordinates.

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,275
Where did you send them?

53
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,361
I don't know.

54
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,871
I think somewhere
in Simi Valley.

55
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,543
Yeah?

56
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,258
We've checked the location.
It's clean. It's a liquor store.

57
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,257
I want you to check it again.

58
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,141
I think we've been played.

59
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,258
Check it again!

60
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,450
What if what we're
looking for isn't metal?

61
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:47,576
Then we're screwed.

62
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,043
Not an unfamiliar situation.

63
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,587
Listen, Sydney,
while I remain sceptical

64
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,751
of Sloane's alleged
rehabilitation,

65
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:58,296
the man jumped in front
of a bullet to save my life.

66
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,225
I've been through too much.
I don't trust that man.

67
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:03,017
I can't believe
you don't feel the same.

68
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,391
What I'm feeling is irrelevant.

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,600
In conspiring to save you
from the NSC,

70
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,898
Sloane's given us all
the ammunition we'd ever need

71
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,108
to invalidate
his pardon agreement.

72
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,652
He's put his life in our hands.

73
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,410
And as far as breaking you out,
yours was in his.

74
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:34,461
Nice catch, Steven.

75
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,582
Hey, Robin.

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,843
Sweetie, come here.
Steven, come here!

77
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,190
Special Agent Reims, FBI.

78
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,314
You're under arrest
on suspicion of conspiracy

79
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,276
to impede
a federal investigation.

80
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,643
Your children
will be looked after

81
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,446
through the duration
of your custody,

82
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,074
unless you find a family member.

83
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,198
You're gonna have to come
with us.

84
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,035
Is this familiar to you?

85
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,706
No.

86
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,276
I don't know
if I buried it myself,

87
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,319
or if it was left
for me to find.

88
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:38,781
And that symbol?

89
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,901
It symbolises membership in
the Magnific Order of Rambaldi.

90
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,318
Whoever that person was,
he made a vow

91
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,571
to safeguard
Rambaldi's prophecies.

92
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:49,369
When you get back, you'll ask
Marshall to run a DNA test.

93
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,202
- Right.
- What's your alibi?

94
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,497
I'll return to Lindsey, tell him
I was abducted by The Covenant,

95
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,167
and that you're
being held hostage.

96
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:57,716
What are we saying they want?

97
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,292
How about the Rambaldi device?

98
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,170
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- I know what you're thinking.

99
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:06,935
If the device was so valuable
to me, why did I let it go?

100
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,892
For your freedom.

101
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,307
You traded it for your pardon,

102
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,021
and here's your chance
to get it back.

103
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:13,731
It is something the CIA
might believe

104
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,486
The Covenant would take
in exchange for you.

105
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,404
Once we make the exchange,
the device will be destroyed.

106
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,232
No one will have it.

107
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,783
I'll contact Bob Lindsey

108
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,907
and tell him my sources
have confirmed

109
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,283
The Covenant is responsible
for your breakout.

110
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,041
As soon as I hear from
Dr. Brazzel, I'll let you know.

111
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,667
He's the neuro-researcher.

112
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,376
Works out of Yale.

113
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:34,708
What about you?

114
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:36,171
We're saying your father and I

115
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,584
were investigating
your disappearance.

116
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,666
We're setting up
a paper trail, rent-a-cars.

117
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,001
There's something else
that just occurred to me.

118
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,716
If Lindsey's to believe
I was held by The Covenant,

119
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:47,262
there needs to be evidence
of mistreatment.

120
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,343
- No.
- She's right.

121
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,843
I was gonna bring that up
at the last moment.

122
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,017
I am not
gonna let you be beaten.

123
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,182
I'm the only one
Lindsey will listen to.

124
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,184
If I don't go, he's gonna think
I'm party to this.

125
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,231
- This is insane.
- This situation's a problem.

126
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,859
We need physical evidence
to help sell the idea

127
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,321
that The Covenant
was responsible.

128
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,656
You should do it.

129
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,038
Whenever you're ready.

130
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,630
Just get it over with.

131
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,469
I know how difficult
this must be.

132
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:34,805
That was for turning me in
to Lindsey.

133
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,389
This is for helping me
break out.

134
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,274
Now let's get this over with.

135
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,496
Where's Sydney Bristow?

136
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,158
You covered for her once,
and it cost you your job.

137
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:03,878
Do it again, this cell will be
your home for the next 10 years.

138
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,720
My lawyer's name is Shelly Byrd.

139
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,180
Your only play is to tell me

140
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:11,930
where Sydney Bristow is
and who broke her out.

141
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,516
Was it her father?

142
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,973
What I know here is that sending
agents to arrest me

143
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,272
in front of my children
is the last mistake

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,144
you'll ever make
as Senior Director of the NSC.

145
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,819
I've known men like you.

146
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:31,280
Men who pretend to be patriots.

147
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:34,451
You are always revealed.

148
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:38,078
What?

149
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,707
Sir, it's Lauren Reed.
She's here.

150
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,050
She was thrown from a van
in front of the building.

151
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,762
- Drove by and dumped her.
- When?

152
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:52,173
Five minutes ago.
She refused medical services.

153
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,555
Said she needed
to speak with you.

154
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,318
That was The Covenant's
only demand?

155
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,815
Yes.

156
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,281
"You want Sydney Bristow.

157
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,109
We want the Rambaldi device."

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,157
That's what the man said.

159
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,869
The voice?

160
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:13,985
Yes.

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,912
You don't find
the timing curious?

162
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:21,334
That Sydney Bristow was taken
from a Black Ops U.S. facility,

163
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,541
that they took you as well,
that you've since been released,

164
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:29,129
and meanwhile, your husband
and Sydney Bristow's father

165
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,794
are M.I.A. searching
for a Covenant cell?

166
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,681
Curious?

167
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,142
No.

168
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:39,687
Logical, appropriate,
lucky as hell for me, yes.

169
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,939
I don't know why The Covenant is
willing to make this exchange,

170
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:46,110
but Sydney is depending
on your making this happen.

171
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:49,529
Since when did you and Bristow
become so close?

172
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,736
Or is that about sharing
the same man?

173
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,235
This is a woman's life.

174
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,791
Protect it, or I will report

175
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,746
everything you've done
to your superiors.

176
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:04,327
Need I remind you your husband
helped her flee the country

177
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:06,047
when she was wanted by the NSC?

178
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,632
In the wrong hands, that
information could be damaging.

179
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,802
One more thing.

180
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,766
At 6.30 this evening,
you are to press redial.

181
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,640
The person who answers will give
you the details of the exchange.

182
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:22,431
Hello?

183
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:26,023
The Rambaldi device
for Sydney Bristow.

184
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:27,569
Do we have a deal?

185
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes.

186
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,564
Keep this phone with you
at all times.

187
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:34,405
You will be notified
as to time and place.

188
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:46,081
Lauren did well.

189
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,385
I never thanked you
for helping extract Sydney.

190
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,397
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yes, I do.

191
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,694
Especially given your history.

192
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:12,153
I used to think you didn't
have much of a spine.

193
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,732
And has that assessment
changed at all?

194
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:16,404
No.

195
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:52,614
Dr. Brazzel's expecting us.

196
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,813
This is where he works?

197
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,154
Wow.

198
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,283
Say something else.

199
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,280
May we come in?

200
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,118
Professor!

201
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:11,296
There are some beautiful
people here.

202
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,465
You know,
I was thinking just now,

203
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,593
I wasn't expecting you
until Tuesday.

204
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:22,633
Hi.

205
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,435
And then I realised that it is.

206
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,762
It's Tuesday.

207
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:31,391
You know, you've come to me
at a really awkward time.

208
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:35,947
I'm not nearly finished,
so I can't promise you anything.

209
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:40,279
Still, your research in memory
retrieval sounds promising.

210
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,908
Oh, well, that's...
Well, it's really a trip.

211
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,667
Can I...
Do you mind if I...

212
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:52,295
Oh, she likes to hug people.

213
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:53,924
This is Kaya.

214
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,800
She's one of my students.

215
00:13:55,885 --> 00:14:00,298
Capable, but she's
all about hugging.

216
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,596
All about hugging.

217
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,139
You know, I'm starving.

218
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,971
Anyone else?

219
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:12,896
- You have to be kidding.
- I can't do this.

220
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,106
We're not here because
we have other options.

221
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,244
Facon?

222
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,076
Oh, no, thanks.

223
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,745
- Facon?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

224
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,414
You? No?

225
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,130
Facon.

226
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:38,333
Processed soy protein
shaped and coloured to resemble

227
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,678
the essence of smoked pig flesh.

228
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:45,679
We live in an age
of simulations.

229
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,556
But facon is only one
of many illusions

230
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,022
of the postmodern world.

231
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,562
I don't know anything about you.

232
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,102
Except that I'm not supposed
to know anything about you.

233
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:02,067
Suffice to say there are people
who are under the impression

234
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,738
my daughter
has committed a crime.

235
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:07,577
Her memories are the only things
that can exonerate her.

236
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:10,287
I see.
So there's pressure.

237
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,543
Pressure that the therapy
should work.

238
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,792
Real stakes.

239
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,790
And how does the therapy work?

240
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:21,462
Tell them how you got the idea,
but not the long version.

241
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,128
I began in the neurosciences.

242
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,801
Background in philosophy.

243
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,928
Treated head-trauma patients
for 12 years

244
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,525
until one night on l-95,
I became one of them.

245
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:35,854
A head-trauma patient.

246
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:38,649
I drove into the highway median.

247
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,067
Totalled my pickup truck.

248
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:45,151
So I spent the next 18 months
in various forms of traction.

249
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,246
Now, that's not the torture
you'd expect,

250
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,573
not moving
for a year and a half.

251
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:54,250
It's liberating, oddly.

252
00:15:54,337 --> 00:16:01,918
Well, in any event, one night,
month 11 of my motionlessness,

253
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:04,716
something obvious
occurred to me.

254
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:11,010
Our dreams are both <i>a priori</i>
and <i>a posteriori.</i>

255
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,389
Which means that our dreams
contain our memories.

256
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,353
Which means that there's
a shared reservoir.

257
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:21,109
So, I began to consider ways

258
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,981
to consciously enter
the subconscious.

259
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:30,782
Ways to convince the brain
that it was truly experiencing

260
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,199
the dream/memory state.

261
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:38,535
So, I turned to the one thing
that I really knew.

262
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,627
Drugs.

263
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:43,049
Ergo, I totalled
my pickup truck.

264
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,173
What are the drugs?

265
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:49,348
Oh, well, the cocktail's
a happy combo

266
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,554
of synthetics and organics.

267
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,939
I mean, it won't kill you,
but depending on what they are,

268
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,733
your dreams just might.

269
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:04,021
I say we get this party started.

270
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,065
Kaya will show you
where to change.

271
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,655
Come with me.

272
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,423
When most people are asleep,

273
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,081
they don't realise they're
dreaming until they're awake.

274
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,506
But you, you're going
to have to become lucid

275
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,009
in the dream state itself.

276
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,594
How do I do that?

277
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,136
The drugs I'm gonna give you
will do most of the work.

278
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,981
But I will be monitoring
your neural activity.

279
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,975
And when I know you're in REM,

280
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:43,188
I will give you a verbal cue
over the headphones.

281
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,399
Tell me, what was
the last thing you remember

282
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:49,408
before your missing time?

283
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:52,945
Being knocked unconscious
in my apartment.

284
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,076
I see.

285
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:01,044
Well, once you're aware
that you're in the dream state,

286
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:04,167
your objective will be to
pick up the thread

287
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,588
of your last memory
in as much detail as you can.

288
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,840
How?

289
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:15,144
Well, you're just gonna have to
feel your way back.

290
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:20,768
It's like using a muscle
that you never used before.

291
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,568
If you can get to that point,
just stay with it,

292
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:28,858
because, ultimately,
you will become aware

293
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,821
of what happened next.

294
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,785
I don't really understand.

295
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:36,493
I know.
You will.

296
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:41,161
Just be aware that if you
encounter a new memory,

297
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,914
it might be traumatic.

298
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,579
But it won't
necessarily be real.

299
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,383
Oh, it will be to you.

300
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:49,841
Here are your headphones.
I'm putting them on you.

301
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,717
And good luck.

302
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,797
Sydney, I'm going to count
down from 10.

303
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:32,178
By the time I reach one,
you will be asleep.

304
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,552
10...

305
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,100
9...

306
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:37,762
8...

307
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:39,477
7...

308
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,140
6...

309
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:42,310
5...

310
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,272
4...

311
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,019
3...

312
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,735
2...

313
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,564
1.

314
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,205
- Yeah, it's me.
- Don't move.

315
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,781
You suffered
a severe head trauma.

316
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,121
Any nausea or dizziness?

317
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,417
- No. Where am I?
- On the way to the hospital.

318
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,083
You have a mild concussion.
You'll be okay.

319
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,747
We'll run a C.T. scan
to check for bleeding.

320
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,966
- Listen, Will's gonna be okay.
- What? Will?

321
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,962
He lost a lot of blood,
but we got him in time.

322
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,847
Will's in Witness Protection.

323
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,174
This is normal, gaps in memory
leading to the injury.

324
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:20,426
The woman you were living with
was not Francie.

325
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,311
We found a file
Will was compiling.

326
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,808
Her name is Allison Doren.

327
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,271
I know.
She was the second double.

328
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,435
- It's coming back to you.
- You need to lie down!

329
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,808
Wait.

330
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,193
The Covenant. Have you
ever heard of The Covenant?

331
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,737
Yeah, they were listed on S.I.T.
report as an emerging threat.

332
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:36,569
Why?
Are they involved in this?

333
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,570
Has Sloane been pardoned
by the State Department?

334
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,620
Pardoned?

335
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,247
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

336
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:47,085
I thought we'd go
to Santa Barbara first

337
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:48,963
and see how that went.

338
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,877
You're not married.

339
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,592
You really did
hit your head, huh?

340
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,765
I thought you gave up on us.

341
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,139
When I walked in your apartment
and saw you lying there,

342
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,769
I thought, "God,
don't let me miss a chance

343
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,267
to tell her
how much I love her."

344
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,188
I love you.

345
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,276
Get away from me.

346
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,363
Sydney, you're dreaming.

347
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:24,741
If you can hear me,
then you're in a dream state.

348
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:28,832
You need to use it
to get back to where you were.

349
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:32,041
To get to the last memory
you have.

350
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:35,668
Now, remember, you said it was
in your apartment.

351
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,877
You were knocked out.

352
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:40,590
You must try to go back
to that place.

353
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,972
You must try to find that place.

354
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:47,272
Sydney, you are in control
of your environment.

355
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,433
Go now.

356
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:57,082
She's out of REM, and she exists
now in actual memory.

357
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,253
She was unconscious
after the fight.

358
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,718
How can she remember anything
that happened after that?

359
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:03,799
Because unconsciously,

360
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:07,510
the mind can still establish
transhistorical accounts

361
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:08,635
of the real world.

362
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,307
Meaning even
with her eyes closed,

363
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,940
her other senses were alert.

364
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:14,183
Yes.
Thank you.

365
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:18,939
And based on those senses,
her brain will construct

366
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:21,523
an accurate
but incomplete memory

367
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,073
of the events that followed.

368
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,704
The barbecue chips.

369
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,327
Please, could you pass me those?

370
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,290
Thank you.

371
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,236
I see them.

372
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:04,733
They're taking me away, but...

373
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:05,859
Who, Sydney?

374
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:08,112
I can't see their faces.

375
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,451
What did she say?

376
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,707
Someone without a face.
It's not that uncommon.

377
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:49,532
Don't.

378
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:35,031
Happy birthday!

379
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:41,882
Happy birthday, Sydney.

380
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,931
She's extrapolating.

381
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,807
Meaning what?

382
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:54,427
Brain activity indicates her
memory centres aren't active.

383
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,478
She's in a tangent.

384
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:59,186
I was in a tangent once.

385
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:01,775
How nice for you.

386
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,187
Happy birthday, honey.

387
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:09,816
Make a wish, Sydney.

388
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,794
Time to cut the cake.

389
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,173
It's alright.

390
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:52,577
Sydney, listen to me.

391
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:54,240
You have to concentrate.

392
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,204
It's the only way
you're gonna get back on track.

393
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,533
I don't know how.

394
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,879
Focus on the last detail
you remember.

395
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:08,002
There I am.

396
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,550
Excuse me.

397
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,965
I have to go.

398
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,916
This is very, very unusual.

399
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:07,379
Very unusual.

400
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,088
What?

401
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:12,459
Well, she's still in Beta.
But she's dreaming.

402
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,295
That just doesn't happen.

403
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:39,360
You know better.

404
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:41,945
You were part of this.

405
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,679
- Kill the power feed!
- What the hell's happening?

406
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,149
She's in V-tach!

407
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:11,226
Get the epinephrine.
It's on the tray.

408
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,564
Get these off her.

409
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:17,241
- She's flatlining!
- We need to resuscitate her now.

410
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,531
Get the defibrillator paddles.

411
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:22,866
200 joules, charging.

412
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:23,952
Clear!

413
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,780
We need 300.

414
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,039
Sydney, wake up.

415
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:29,123
Clear!

416
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,152
Help me up.

417
00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:13,754
I can't help it.
I just miss you.

418
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,583
I do.

419
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,553
You know we can't do this.

420
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:22,880
Oh, give me a break.

421
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:25,892
It's a dream.
We can do whatever we want.

422
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,851
At least I can.

423
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:33,768
Your vitals are normal.
You're gonna be fine.

424
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,316
I assume he's told you.

425
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,320
God, I...

426
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,452
It's okay.

427
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,410
Ms. Vaughn!
Lauren!

428
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,249
Ms. Reed!

429
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,132
Whoa. I had too many
jelly doughnuts.

430
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,462
Are those the DNA results?

431
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:04,505
Not exactly.

432
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,172
I checked the sample against
all available data banks.

433
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:08,679
I wasn't able to find a match.

434
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,597
But I did run
some other forensic tests,

435
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:13,725
and, well, hope this helps.

436
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,482
Yes, I understand.

437
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:22,986
That was Lauren.
No match on the DNA.

438
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:26,077
We still don't know
who the hand belongs to.

439
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:29,037
In my dream, it was my birthday.

440
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:30,203
I was 7.

441
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,999
When I cut the cake,
I looked down,

442
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:35,370
and I was cutting off this hand.

443
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:37,420
Whose hand?
Did you see his face?

444
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:38,882
Yes, I did.

445
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,627
Who was it?

446
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,511
Lazarey.

447
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:48,056
Why would I dream I was cutting
the hand of a man I murdered?

448
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:50,100
Forensic analysis leads Marshall

449
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:53,851
to believe that whoever
this hand belonged to was alive

450
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,561
as recently as four months ago.

451
00:32:57,318 --> 00:32:58,943
It couldn't have been Lazarey.

452
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,191
I killed him last year.

453
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,229
Unless you didn't.

454
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,813
What? I was on the videotape.
It was me.

455
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:05,616
I slashed his throat.

456
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:07,279
Unless you didn't.

457
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,992
It could have been
a performance.

458
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:12,240
Lazarey was a Russian diplomat.

459
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,789
The Russians
must have typed his DNA.

460
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:15,909
Lauren's worked with them.

461
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:19,622
I'll call her, have her get
a sample, see if it's a match.

462
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:24,129
You know,
this really was something.

463
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,928
Whatever you experienced

464
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:27,805
elevated your heart rate
to the point

465
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:30,927
of ventricular tachycardia,

466
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,177
which sent you
into cardiac arrest,

467
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:36,307
which almost sent me
into cardiac arrest.

468
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,558
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

469
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,359
I mean, I feel great, actually.

470
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,687
What other details
do you remember?

471
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:46,992
After my fight with Allison,
these men came into the room.

472
00:33:47,077 --> 00:33:50,327
I couldn't see their faces.
They were wearing black.

473
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,497
They took me to a building.

474
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,740
I was on a gurney.

475
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,617
They wheeled me
through the door,

476
00:33:57,712 --> 00:34:02,339
and I lost them before I could
see where they took me next.

477
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,714
Lauren strangled me.

478
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,514
Well, that was a dream.

479
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,020
It must have been
a dream, right?

480
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,055
It's unclear.

481
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,687
You know, this
is not an exact science.

482
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:24,110
At that point in your life,
you had never met Lauren.

483
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,533
You know, this would probably be
a representational figure.

484
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:32,157
Which is also not uncommon,
by the way.

485
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:34,820
Masked figures, shapeshifters.

486
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,668
They first appear
as one character.

487
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:40,041
Your mother, an old classmate.

488
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,336
In my case, a parrot.

489
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:44,416
A parrot.

490
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:48,093
But they're really just physical
manifestations of someone else.

491
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,255
I want to go back.

492
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:53,053
Sydney, that's a mistake.

493
00:34:53,143 --> 00:34:54,851
They were taking me
towards a room.

494
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:56,561
It was room 47.

495
00:34:57,272 --> 00:35:00,972
That's where I was.
That's where I was being held.

496
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,602
I have to go back and see
what happened to me in there.

497
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,365
You're the greatest.

498
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:18,000
Once you're under, you'll most
likely begin in a dream cycle.

499
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:20,541
Again, no matter where you are,

500
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,997
try to pick up the thread
of your last memory by focusing

501
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:28,337
on a detail you remember,
something vivid.

502
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,879
There was hanging plastic in
the building where I was taken.

503
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:34,725
Well, whatever it is,
you're looking for a link.

504
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:38,178
A portal back
to your memory state.

505
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,976
Back to the door you described.

506
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:42,608
Good luck.

507
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,317
Thanks.

508
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:47,394
Okay.

509
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,565
Here's the headphones.

510
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,983
I am gonna put them on you.

511
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,362
Good luck.

512
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,683
When I received
the call for this meeting,

513
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,224
I assumed it would be
with a low-level agent.

514
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:23,608
You have confirmation
of The Covenant's demands.

515
00:36:23,691 --> 00:36:27,025
My sources have confirmed
they are holding Sydney Bristow.

516
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:28,654
They're asking
for the Rambaldi device

517
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:31,490
in exchange for her release.

518
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:34,235
This is an awkward conversation.

519
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,201
How so?

520
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:39,112
Because of what I'm asking
of you.

521
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:41,532
To use your contacts.

522
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,502
Why come to me?

523
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:45,745
Because you can give me
untraceability.

524
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:49,288
I'm looking for someone
trained in wet work.

525
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:52,967
In particular, dead shot
with a long-range rifle.

526
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,722
I plan on making the trade.

527
00:36:55,807 --> 00:37:00,552
During the exchange,
I want Sydney Bristow taken out.

528
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:05,348
Why make the trade?

529
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:09,729
It's very simple.
Have The Covenant end her life.

530
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:14,657
Because I want assurance that
Sydney Bristow is eliminated.

531
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:18,692
Ah, I see.

532
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:21,530
She has something on you,
does she?

533
00:37:24,753 --> 00:37:26,745
If she's hit by a sniper,

534
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:30,289
it'll appear as if
it's a Covenant double-cross.

535
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:34,048
Well, with all due respect,
Mr. Director,

536
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,168
what guarantee do I have

537
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:38,466
that this isn't some form
of entrapment?

538
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:45,147
Because I know
what you're up to, Mr. Sloane.

539
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,687
I can see your big picture.

540
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:49,934
I know your endgame.

541
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:54,405
I even have proof.

542
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:11,671
Once I arrange the trade,
I'll call you with the details.

543
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,680
The DNA you got
from the Kremlin.

544
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:27,555
I matched it.

545
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,143
The hand belongs to Lazarey?

546
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,064
Yeah.

547
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,603
I mean, it belonged
to Lazarey before the...

548
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:34,610
Thank you.

549
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:36,357
Sure.

550
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:39,025
You're sure
the DNA matched Lazarey?

551
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,574
Yes, which means
Sydney didn't kill him.

552
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:43,157
Lindsey has nothing on her.

553
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:44,623
She can come home.

554
00:38:44,707 --> 00:38:46,285
Thank you.

555
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,015
You still asleep?

556
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:09,729
I think so.

557
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:18,447
I've never heard of a St. Aidan.

558
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,027
They're hard to find.

559
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,833
Don't forget the case.

560
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,097
Syd, you made it.

561
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,768
Hope you're ready for
an expensive lesson in gambling.

562
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:54,769
- I'm looking for that building.
- Check the kitchen.

563
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,272
Kitchen.

564
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,572
Thanks.

565
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:13,168
Okay.

566
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:15,453
She's in.

567
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,882
Is she alright?

568
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:18,749
She's Alpha.

569
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:21,299
Her serotonin levels
are still increasing.

570
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:22,301
And see?

571
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,511
Her heart rate's up.

572
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,220
She's on track
for another vivid one.

573
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:38,559
You shouldn't have come back.

574
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:39,853
Who the hell are you?

575
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:42,236
I'm telling you,
you don't want to be here.

576
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:44,234
You're not Lauren.

577
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,735
- I know you're not Lauren.
- It doesn't matter who I am.

578
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,906
All that matters
is that you leave.

579
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,074
You get the hell out of my way.

580
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,160
I can't do that.

581
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,878
You are so stubborn!

582
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,598
You idiot.
We want to stay away.

583
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:11,219
We know The Covenant had us.
We suspected it all along.

584
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:12,855
It was The Covenant.

585
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,940
We think it's an accident
we don't remember anything?

586
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:19,525
- Then what happened to me?
- Trust Lazarey.

587
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:21,321
What does he have to do with it?

588
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:22,485
That's enough questions.

589
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:24,032
What's in room 47?

590
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:27,319
Pull her out.
I'm not gonna risk her life.

591
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:29,072
Her heart rate's alright.

592
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:31,203
Let's give her a chance.

593
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,785
Leave, you idiot!

594
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,554
Oh, my God.
