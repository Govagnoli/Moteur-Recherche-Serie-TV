1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,057
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:03,943
- Who are you?
- Your mother's sister.

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,653
Katya.

4
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,651
- What about him?
- Kill him.

5
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:12,694
No one wants Lauren in custody
more than I do.

6
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:14,745
That's not the kind of closure
I'm referring to.

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,325
This is the key
to my storage facility.

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:21,043
In it you'll find disposal facilities
capable of dealing with her remains.

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,702
According to Sloane,
Nadia will be injected with a fluid

10
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:26,289
that will enable her
to deliver a message.

11
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:29,255
Sloane believes that his daughter
will serve as a direct conduit

12
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:31,837
to the consciousness
of Milo Rambaldi.

13
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,008
- Get away from her.
- Sydney, please.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,808
Now.

15
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,560
Sloane, we gotta go.
Now. Go.

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,897
You're safe.
I promise you he'll never hurt you again.

17
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:50,945
She drew an equation,
coordinates that would lead to a place.

18
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:53,572
What place?
What are we supposed to find there?

19
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:55,204
Rambaldi.

20
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,958
Good evening, Miss Bristow.

21
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,052
Hey, Syd.

22
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,775
Where do we stand
with Rambaldi's equation?

23
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,729
- How close are you to solving it?
- Uh, I only recovered about 92 percent.

24
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:17,569
I've designed a program to extrapolate the
rest, but these permutations are, like, vast.

25
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,533
It seems to be written
in some sort of pre-Galilean algebra,

26
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:24,456
which, you know, kinda makes you think
these guys were, you know...

27
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,336
you know, back in the...

28
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,798
- Should be about eight hours.
- Let me know the moment it's done.

29
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:37,633
Absolutely. Actually, sir, do you mind
if I ask, what exactly are we looking for?

30
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,769
Our only intel came from the interrogation
of Dr Lee in Havana.

31
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:45,518
Crazy as it sounds,
he says we're looking for Rambaldi.

32
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:47,900
Rambaldi.

33
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,859
As in Mr R...
from the...

34
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:55,565
You know, I don't even wanna know. I don't
even wanna... I got too much on my...

35
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,984
With the baby.
Well, he's, like, a toddler.

36
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,289
- And Carrie's constantly... even when I'm...
- I understand.

37
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm gonna...

38
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,678
I'm in.
Patching into the feed now.

39
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:29,727
I must say, your disguise,
it addresses a certain proclivity of mine.

40
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,483
If this works, I'll happily make
your sick little fantasy come true.

41
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,988
Uploading Rambaldi's equation now.

42
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,001
Oh. Hey, Syd.

43
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:51,794
Uh, listen, have you seen
a USB key with a <i>Speed Racer</i> logo on it?

44
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,500
It just happens to have every single picture
we've ever taken of Mitchell on it.

45
00:03:55,594 --> 00:04:00,932
Well, I brought it in here
to make duplicates, and, of course,

46
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,507
genius that I am,
I forgot to make a backup copy.

47
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:06,805
I'll tell you something,
Carrie's gonna kill me if I don't find it.

48
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:11,274
Ah, found it. It was in the...
when I was doing the keyboard earlier.

49
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,024
It's a good thing I found it,
cos Carrie'd probably divorce me if I...

50
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:20,024
Thing is, I'd probably divorce myself
in the process, you know.

51
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:25,160
Is that a new perfume you're wearing,
cos it's nice. I like it.

52
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,374
Why are you downloading
the equation?

53
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,970
I have it.
Corrupting the database now.

54
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:00,858
- Activate countermeasures now.
- Head down, love.

55
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,369
Sydney.

56
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,533
Call 911, Mr Vaughn.

57
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,590
We have a level-five...

58
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,397
The evacuation protocol
is overriding the lockdown.

59
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,491
Marshall. We need a medic. Call St John's.
Tell them we have incoming.

60
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,734
God. Marshall?

61
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,203
They hacked into an off-site relay

62
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,660
in a parking structure
on the northeast corner of 6th.

63
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,453
This is Jack Bristow.
We have a location on one of the intruders.

64
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,334
Keep moving.
You have a clear path for the exit.

65
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:00,709
Syd, wait.

66
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,047
You all right?

67
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:51,654
The name's Hank Foster,
Counterterrorist Threat Analysis.

68
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,739
What am I doing here, Mr Foster?

69
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,405
At 7.22 this evening,
you were logged in at the safe house

70
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,410
where Nadia Santos is being held.

71
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,496
Is that accurate?

72
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:05,958
It was around dinner.
I brought her a sandwich.

73
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,430
- Where were you before that?
- Buying her the sandwich.

74
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,342
What is this?

75
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:18,594
At 6.12 tonight,
the rotunda was compromised.

76
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,311
What?
How is that...?

77
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,479
You tell me.

78
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,329
Oh, my God.

79
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,634
Is he OK?

80
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:49,635
Was any...
Was anyone killed?

81
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:54,172
It would do you good
if you had an alibi.

82
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:15,994
I used the key you gave me. I took
the suitcase. I'm prepared to use it.

83
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,663
When the agency concludes,
as they will, that Lauren was responsible,

84
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:23,250
the pressure to capture her
will rise exponentially.

85
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:27,336
The disposal project we discussed
must be anonymous.

86
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:31,968
Once her status changes,
that will be more difficult.

87
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,344
Sark isn't talking.

88
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:37,801
He hasn't requested counsel,
not even so much as a glass of water.

89
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,686
May I suggest you have
Vaughn talk with him?

90
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:42,309
Given their personal history,
I'm not sure that's advisable.

91
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,274
Sark undoubtedly will be more afraid
to face a man he so recently tortured.

92
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,402
Given his pattern
for caving out of fear,

93
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:55,444
I believe Vaughn's presence will more
likely yield the results we're looking for.

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,789
As the director, I can't sanction
the beating of someone in our custody.

95
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,424
Understood. I'll apprise you of any intel
that comes from his interrogation.

96
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:35,448
Last time we were together,
our roles were reversed.

97
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:40,577
- Funny how things happen.
- I'm afraid the irony is lost on me.

98
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:48,164
You like the electric batons
and the injections.

99
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,926
I'm not into accessories.

100
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,796
I'm more than willing to cooperate,
Mr Vaughn.

101
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:58,798
I will tell you everything you want,
but I will need something in return.

102
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,391
- No deals.
- Well, then, it seems we're at an impasse.

103
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:08,482
I assure you, it won't take Lauren long
to solve Rambaldi's equation.

104
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,976
Well, better get started, then.

105
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,528
Where is Lauren Reed?

106
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:22,158
I understand your suspicion.

107
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,671
But we both know that whatever was taken,
I probably had access to it,

108
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:32,124
and if Marshall had it,
I could have just asked him.

109
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:39,219
It was a Covenant raid.
They got the Rambaldi equation.

110
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,300
We apprehended Julian Sark.

111
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:47,265
- I think I broke it.
- Clearly.

112
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,813
You ready to talk?

113
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,980
Yes.

114
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:04,996
When I first learned of your wife's
true allegiance, I almost felt pity for you.

115
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,123
How embarrassing it must have been

116
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,128
to learn that the woman you shared
your bed with was only using you

117
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:12,918
as an unfortunate means to an end.

118
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,206
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

119
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,752
But, then, she wasn't sharing
your bed lately, was she?

120
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,515
She was in mine.

121
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,383
Or in my car.

122
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:28,973
Or an elevator.
Or a garage.

123
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,520
There was this one time,
this is my favourite,

124
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:36,529
when we were engaged
in an alley,

125
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:40,280
and she called you
to tell you she loved you.

126
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:44,245
That woman was
deliciously filthy.

127
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,616
Do you feel that?

128
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,044
It feels like a knife
slicing through you, doesn't it?

129
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,288
Now, where is she?

130
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:58,760
Lauren was working for the Covenant
the entire time she was NSC liaison.

131
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:03,092
Her codes have been revoked but
she would still know our security protocols.

132
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,552
This is the person
you're looking for.

133
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,641
Let's talk about your sister.

134
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,854
The equation,

135
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,033
the part taken from the rotunda,

136
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:25,079
was implanted
in your sister's subconscious?

137
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:30,288
Not literally.
It's more of a genetic inheritance.

138
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:34,505
- An inheritance from Rambaldi?
- My sister is innocent.

139
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,629
Rambaldi refers to you
as the Chosen One,

140
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,299
he implants in your sister's head
the whereabouts of his greatest invention,

141
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,471
and you expect me to believe
that neither one of you is involved in this?

142
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,676
I don't care what you believe.

143
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,935
This is a waste of time.

144
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:58,237
Last week Ms Santos
was in the custody of the Covenant.

145
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,065
As a prisoner they nearly killed.

146
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,983
If Lauren Reed broke in
using your identity,

147
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,444
she would need to be sure
you were out of the office.

148
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,242
Did your sister call you
to come see her?

149
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,419
If you wanna arrest me,

150
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:17,417
hold me under the Patriot Act.

151
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,047
We're through talking.

152
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:28,435
The DCI will have my preliminary findings
on his desk in 48 hours.

153
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:34,023
Until that time, you will be reassigned
as a desk officer. You may go.

154
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:45,315
I'm not gonna kill you.
That would be too easy.

155
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,818
But I'll leave you so disfigured
that when you walk down the street,

156
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,905
people will pity you.

157
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:54,292
Lauren is gonna pay for the damage
she's done to the people I care about,

158
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,370
not for having had
an affair with you.

159
00:14:56,463 --> 00:15:00,081
I don't give a rat's ass
who she's sleeping with.

160
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:03,211
So, for the last time,
where is she?

161
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,740
- How is Marshall?
- He's still in the OR.

162
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,415
18 agents taken to St John's.
12 treated and released.

163
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,417
Four being held overnight
for observation.

164
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:40,251
And Brandon's not gonna make it
out of the ICU.

165
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,582
It just makes me sick.

166
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,467
Where's Vaughn?

167
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,260
I haven't seen him
since he finished interrogating Sark,

168
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,098
but, uh, word is
he worked him over pretty good.

169
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:53,595
Didn't get any information out of him,
but it had to feel pretty good trying.

170
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,522
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Probably needed to walk it off.

171
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:59,311
Eric said you took off.
Need some company?

172
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,393
No, I'm good.

173
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,526
- Where are you?
- It doesn't matter.

174
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,904
What does that mean?

175
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,573
Vaughn, what's going on?

176
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:20,750
Sark talked, didn't he?
And you know where Lauren is.

177
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,164
I'm taking care of it.

178
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:26,543
I don't know what you're thinking,
but you cannot do this, Michael.

179
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:32,425
If you kill her, you will be arrested
and charged with her murder.

180
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,848
And if you're not, if you get away with it,
it'll haunt you, Michael.

181
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,860
God, after everything we've been through,
I'll lose you all over again.

182
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,484
I have to go.

183
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,105
Are you sure
the computation is exact?

184
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,769
It's all good.

185
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:44,542
Someone went through a lot of hoo-ha
to encrypt a longitude and a latitude.

186
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,253
What the hell is in Palermo?

187
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:56,138
You're paid to be discreet,
not curious.

188
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,513
It's OK, beautiful.
This will keep my mouth shut.

189
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:03,606
So will this.

190
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,841
Hi, honey.

191
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:48,727
I need the tape from
the Sark interrogation.

192
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:54,188
- Actually, that's been classified.
- By who?

193
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:56,277
Jack Bristow.

194
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,293
- I want that tape.
- No, you don't.

195
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,212
Not if you want
what's best for Vaughn.

196
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:16,047
You know what he's gonna do
if we don't stop him.

197
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,215
Yes, he'll get closure.

198
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,559
You want him to kill Lauren.

199
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:25,642
If he doesn't,
it will eat at him like a cancer.

200
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,353
The only cure is to end it now.

201
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:33,650
- She destroyed Vaughn's life.
- Vaughn's life, not yours.

202
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,738
This is about what Lauren did to Vaughn,
not what Mom did to you.

203
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:42,157
I don't know what you've told him or
how much of all this you've orchestrated,

204
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:47,325
but in some twisted way
you've got Vaughn carrying your burden,

205
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,960
trying to get you closure, by doing the one
thing you never had the chance to do:

206
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,542
kill the person who betrayed you.

207
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:59,931
I did have the chance,
and I didn't take it.

208
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:07,061
And not a day went by
that I didn't regret letting her go.

209
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:13,653
Vaughn will feel the same way.
He will end up like me.

210
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:19,525
And I love you too much
to let that happen.

211
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,432
Michael.

212
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:45,684
Please, I need you to understand.

213
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,890
When the Covenant
tasked me to marry you,

214
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,647
I knew eventually they wanted me
to coax you back into the CIA.

215
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:57,528
But two years went by
and I hadn't heard from them.

216
00:20:57,616 --> 00:21:01,909
And by then I'd convinced myself
I never would.

217
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:07,951
I prayed I wouldn't.
Because I'd fallen in love with you.

218
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,035
Shut up.

219
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:17,378
I am gonna erase you. I'm gonna remove
any evidence you ever existed.

220
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:21,680
You used me.
You used my grief, my work, who I am.

221
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:25,050
You took that from me.
I'm taking it back.

222
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:32,686
This is hydrochloric acid.
You'll be unrecognizable.

223
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:36,643
Michael, I swear
I was gonna tell you everything.

224
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,815
You remember that night
we went downtown and had dinner?

225
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:42,985
- Instead you told me Sydney was back.
- Don't say her name.

226
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:46,162
She came back
and you didn't need me any more.

227
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:49,699
I could see it in your eyes.
Sydney came back and...

228
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:52,462
- I said don't say her name.
- Sydney came back and I lost you.

229
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,007
I hate you.

230
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:11,095
But I love Sydney more. That's the only
reason you're not dying tonight.

231
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:28,115
Thank God.

232
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:45,593
Quiet. Listen to me.

233
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:48,766
This device I'm wearing on my wrist
is masking my heat signature.

234
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:52,636
I have three minutes before
the thermal imagers detect a malfunction.

235
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:57,938
I trust that you will allow me that time
before you alert the guards.

236
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,772
What are you doing here?

237
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:05,316
You received your last dose
of the Rambaldi fluid.

238
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,155
I saw you begin to draw, which means
you know where the Rambaldi artefact is.

239
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:15,290
Now, I gather you never told the CIA. That
is wise, Nadia. They cannot be trusted.

240
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,664
You expect me to trust you
after what you put me through?

241
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:21,627
It was all in an effort
to pave the way for us.

242
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:25,419
Rambaldi wrote about this vessel in which
he was able to house his consciousness,

243
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:27,672
his essence, his soul.

244
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:32,973
He referred to it as the Sphere of Life.
Now you and I can claim it together.

245
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,351
Your beliefs are your own.

246
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,438
I understand your scepticism,
but tell me this.

247
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:43,572
When you were under the influence
of the Rambaldi fluid, what you saw,

248
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,696
was it not transcendent?

249
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:48,357
Was it not divine?

250
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:54,289
Yes, it was.

251
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,867
I can see it in your eyes.

252
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,125
You have 20 seconds before the guards
detect you. You should go, now.

253
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:08,596
I'm leaving you instructions
on how to find me. I pray you use it.

254
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,815
- Vaughn.
- What have we got?

255
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,474
- 35-year-old, stab wound to the back.
- Vaughn.

256
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,820
The respiration's at 18
and tachycardia at 125.

257
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:27,444
You are gonna be OK.
Vaughn.

258
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,504
I heard.
Is he still in surgery?

259
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,963
You were right.
Lauren has to pay.

260
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:54,180
Vaughn is gonna be OK.
And when he is, he has to end it, not you.

261
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:56,807
If it's OK for Vaughn,
it's OK for me.

262
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:02,313
I need your help.
Expedited credentials, transportation...

263
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:05,771
My advice was specific
to her betrayal of him.

264
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:09,399
- Lauren betrayed all of us.
- Not in the same way.

265
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,651
She was his wife.

266
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,914
I don't care about
any of that now.

267
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:19,701
I want her to die.

268
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:24,912
And that's gonna happen
whether you help me or not.

269
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:07,837
When I went to meet your contact,
Vaughn was there.

270
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:13,216
He was your contact.
You set the meeting.

271
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:16,595
Did you give me up?

272
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,054
It's OK.

273
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,606
I would have told them, too.

274
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,993
Let me see what
they've done to you.

275
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:48,335
My mother's hired a lawyer.
He'll be here soon.

276
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:53,095
The only way
we can get the location

277
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:57,426
is if I tell him how to access
your contact's information.

278
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:00,684
He backs up everything
on an off-site server.

279
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,895
- Tell me you know the pass phrase.
- I do. It's a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche.

280
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:08,901
- "God is dead."
- No, the other one.

281
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,449
"Woman was God's second mistake."

282
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:17,945
Thank you.

283
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,253
Voice modulator courtesy of
CIA Technical Services.

284
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,923
This little trick of yours
means Vaughn failed.

285
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:35,549
Tell me, is he dead?

286
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:41,764
No, he's not. But, thanks to you,
Lauren won't be so lucky.

287
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:09,583
- The equation leads to Palermo.
- False ID, passport, driver's license.

288
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:11,914
Plane from Orci Aerospace
is standing by with instructions

289
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:14,084
to take you wherever you wanna go.

290
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:16,549
If this is the location
of the Rambaldi artefact,

291
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,631
there will be
a strong Covenant presence.

292
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:21,214
I'll be careful.

293
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,260
Let me go instead.

294
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,765
I can't.

295
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,275
I'll cover for you with Foster.

296
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,655
What is it?

297
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:44,031
Nothing.
We'll talk when you get back.

298
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:02,232
How you doing?

299
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:17,089
- Where's Sydney?
- Take it easy, take it easy. Easy. Sit back.

300
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:19,796
Tell me where she is.

301
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,508
- She went after Lauren.
- Oh, no. I have to get her.

302
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:24,886
No, no, no, no, no.
Mike, you got a punctured lung.

303
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,967
You even breathe wrong,
that thing could collapse again.

304
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,554
- I have to warn her.
- No chance.

305
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:30,472
There's a guard outside the door.

306
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,686
Foster's got the building
locked down.

307
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:35,858
He revoked your clearance
pending an investigation of your rogue op.

308
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,936
- You're not going anywhere.
- I have to get to Syd.

309
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,105
- She's walking into a trap.
- What?

310
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,155
What are you talking about?

311
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:45,196
Lauren didn't stab me.

312
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:47,445
Katya Derevko did.

313
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:53,162
Vaughn's flatlining.
I need help in here now.

314
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:56,334
Pull the covers
so I can clear him.

315
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,336
Let's go.

316
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,015
- Freeze.
- You freeze.

317
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,677
- Get down.
- Hope you know what you're doing here.

318
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,594
Put down your weapon.
Put it in the trash can.

319
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,058
Put it down, guys.
Put it down.

320
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,186
Now get in the elevator.

321
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,730
- Get in.
- What?

322
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:21,901
Get in.

323
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,112
We're trapped in the elevator.

324
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:30,577
Locking the building down.
On our way up.

325
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:45,089
Vaughn's going out the front.
All units to the main entrance now.

326
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,972
He's going out the front entrance.
Let's go. Go. Go. Move.

327
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,862
- Katya.
- Sydney.

328
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:14,325
I could have killed you.
I thought you were a Covenant guard.

329
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:18,747
- What are you doing here?
- I'm infiltrating the camp, the same as you.

330
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:23,750
My informant told me the Covenant had
been transporting excavation equipment.

331
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:28,007
I thought they might have a lead
on the Rambaldi artefact.

332
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:30,221
Have you seen Lauren?
Is she here?

333
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:33,309
She was.
She drove away an hour ago.

334
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:40,140
Then we'll wait till she gets back
before we make our move.

335
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:43,770
Covenant agents have been patrolling
up here. We'd better take cover.

336
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:46,189
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

337
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,118
How did you know?

338
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:02,830
I didn't.
And now I do.

339
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:33,746
We have already hit subsoil,
hard clay.

340
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,163
If the artefact is any deeper,

341
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:39,416
we will need ground-penetrating radar
to narrow the search grid.

342
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:44,248
Then do it.
If the artefact is here, I want it found.

343
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:55,177
Hey, Nadia.
We're ordering Chinese. Game?

344
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,651
Nadia?

345
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,530
Nadia.

346
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,610
Nadia.

347
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,695
Coming in.

348
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:36,339
The Covenant solved the equation.

349
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:40,514
The Rambaldi sphere
may already be compromised.

350
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:47,981
When I was drawing,
there were moments, as the fluid wore off,

351
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,025
I altered the equation.

352
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:54,651
I didn't want to give you
what you were looking for.

353
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:59,490
Which means the Covenant
has the wrong coordinates.

354
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,414
They're looking for the sphere
in the wrong place.

355
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:08,331
We should go.
We have a long journey ahead of us.

356
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:12,294
Come.

357
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:41,410
Guess who.

358
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,568
If you kill me,
you'll never know the truth.

359
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:21,698
This is the truth.
Sucks, doesn't it?

360
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,161
Do you think the CIA couldn't find you
when you went missing?

361
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:32,422
Or that you learned
what happened to you by chance?

362
00:36:37,013 --> 00:36:39,172
And if your mother's really been helping
you since she left,

363
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,511
why haven't you ever spoken to her?

364
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,925
You're trying to buy time.

365
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:49,149
You can't believe that you and your sister
just happen to both be agents.

366
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,392
This isn't gonna work.

367
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:57,278
There's a bank in Wittenberg,
a numbered vault. Proof.

368
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,492
We're both pawns
in the same game.

369
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:11,837
The difference between us
is I know who controls me.

370
00:37:11,923 --> 00:37:15,292
- Who controls me?
- I guess you'll never know.

371
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:19,380
Stop.

372
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:22,556
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down.

373
00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:25,892
- Do it now.
- Put the gun down.

374
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:28,684
If you love her,
you'll put the gun down.

375
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:38,154
You really are a boy scout.

376
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,704
Vaughn.

377
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:58,051
What are you doing?
How did you get here?

378
00:37:58,136 --> 00:38:00,627
I came for you.

379
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,699
One, zero, six, two.

380
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:33,329
What was that?

381
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:37,086
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

382
00:39:34,316 --> 00:39:36,308
If you have further questions
about your account,

383
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,228
please feel free to come to my office
when you're finished.

384
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,312
Thank you.

385
00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:26,969
Sydney.

386
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,924
You were never supposed
to have found this.
