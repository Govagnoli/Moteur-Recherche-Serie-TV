1
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:05,523
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:10,694
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,365
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,910
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:22,998
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:26,293
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:29,547
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,885
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:41,308
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,894
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,646
My father.

12
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:50,067
Security has made us aware

13
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,904
of the concern that you may have
a mole in your department.

14
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,448
It would appear so.

15
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,994
There are some in the Alliance who
believe you may have more than one.

16
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:04,206
It is our intention
to make an example of them.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,043
I know. I'm taking care of it.

18
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,258
What can you tell me
about this woman, Anna Espinosa?

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,512
She's with K-Directorate. I don't
like her, if that's what you mean.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,857
I'm leaving for England tonight.

21
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,777
SD-6 has traced a Rambaldi Artefact

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,780
to the Engineering Science
Department at Oxford.

23
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,532
K- Directorate is on this.

24
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:42,912
I need to act fast so that Anna
doesn't get there first.

25
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:57,551
FTL found the Rambaldi Artefact
in Tunisia. Why'd they send it here?

26
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:01,180
Analysis. Our department
is among the best in the world.

27
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:04,767
The lens has to be within two feet
of the keycard to get a reading.

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,311
Got it. How do I look?

29
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,898
For the record, that's a question
you never have to ask.

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,570
FTL agents are here posing as
campus security. Watch your back.

31
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,114
You, too.

32
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,999
For a journalist,

33
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:33,379
you have a remarkable grasp
of engineering principles.

34
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:35,464
What is your background?

35
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:39,009
- My family was in demolition.
- Really?

36
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,720
- So, is it true?
- What?

37
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,766
Your department's just received
ancient technology from Tunisia?

38
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,310
Who told you that?

39
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:50,312
Well, you just did.

40
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:54,108
- What?
- I'd love to see your lab.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,862
See anybody, Syd?

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,074
Professor Hoyt. Do you see anything?

43
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,952
No. Get closer,
I can't tell if the card's on him.

44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,586
- Anything?
- The keycard's in his pocket.

45
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:16,672
You're too far away.
Get him to turn towards you.

46
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:20,468
- Excuse me, Professor Hoyt?
- Yes.

47
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:24,430
Hold... that for 30 seconds.

48
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:27,141
I'm Molly Zerdin
with the Marisa Foundation.

49
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,101
We're interested in your study.

50
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:32,104
Really? Which one?

51
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:36,233
He's studying the crashworthiness
of transportation vehicles.

52
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,695
Your study on crashworthiness
of transportation vehicles.

53
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:44,325
Wonderful. Well, of course,
getting funding is very difficult

54
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,535
in today's economic climate.

55
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,330
The duplicate keycard's printing.

56
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,583
- That is so true.
- Got it, Syd. I'm on my way.

57
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,335
Excuse me a moment.

58
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:03,761
Tell security someone's trying to
break into the engineering lab.

59
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,640
- Then the FTL guards will know.
- Anna's here.

60
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:12,103
Copy that.
Calling the guards right now.

61
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,868
- Freeze, right there!
- Thank God.

62
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:31,122
Someone's done something
terrible to Professor Bloom.

63
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,653
I'm in the lab.
I don't see anything.

64
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,323
OK, I got it.

65
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,579
Got a minute?

66
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,581
Of course.

67
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:04,799
Eloise Kurtz. She was found dead
two days ago in Echo Park.

68
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:09,553
- She was a new promotion at SD-6.
- Yes, I know.

69
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,809
- You retired her, didn't you?
- I think the pressing question is,

70
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:18,229
why you let her talk to a reporter
without running it by me?

71
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:22,108
- I wasn't hiding it. The reporter...
- Will Tippin.

72
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:26,320
Yes. He's a friend of Sydney's.

73
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:30,282
He was looking into the name
Kate Jones, one of her aliases.

74
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:34,787
I tasked Eloise Kurtz to lead him
down a dead end so he'd drop it.

75
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,248
You underestimated Tippin.

76
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:41,877
And Agent Kurtz's lack of
field experience put us all at risk.

77
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:45,297
What were you doing
using a junior agent, Jack?

78
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:49,969
Ask McCullough. I used Kurtz based
on his assessment of her ability.

79
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,179
He gave her his highest rating.

80
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:55,850
In any case, I had contingencies.

81
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,145
All of which are now irrelevant.

82
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,901
Tell me something.

83
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:10,281
How did Tippin get a lead on
Kate Jones' alias in the first place?

84
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,575
I don't know yet.
I'm looking into it.

85
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,203
Your efforts not withstanding,

86
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:20,916
that reporter may well be
a casualty of his own curiosity.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,502
I'd consider that a last resort.

88
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:25,921
I know you want
what's best for Sydney.

89
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,967
If possible, we should spare her
the pain of losing someone else.

90
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,511
How do you suggest we proceed?

91
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:35,264
Leave it to me.
I'll get Tippin off the story.

92
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,227
And if you can't?

93
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,730
Then I'll kill him myself.

94
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,900
You've missed class.

95
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,860
- I know.
- Turned in papers late.

96
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:33,280
- Listen, my job's...
- Enough about your job.

97
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:37,701
It's worse since we last spoke.
If you want to be a banker, be one.

98
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,703
I understand. It's probably not

99
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,498
the best analysis of Fitzgerald
you've read,

100
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:45,459
but, come on, this is not a D paper.

101
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:49,380
There's no spirit in this paper,
no soul. You fix it by Friday,

102
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,134
or I'll have to re-evaluate
your place in this programme.

103
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,317
Dr Wilkenson.

104
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,028
Yes, I'll hold.

105
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:18,951
Hello, Dr Peterson, Dr Wilkenson.

106
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:29,628
Of course.
Yes, I'd like to discuss that.

107
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:41,974
Yes.

108
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,204
Yes.
Yes, let's talk about the meeting.

109
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,790
Yes.

110
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,919
That's what we talked about, yeah.

111
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,421
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,216
Hold on a second.

113
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,104
Who are you?

114
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,816
Who are you?

115
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,487
Security said
you assaulted an officer.

116
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,323
This wasn't security
nor standard procedure.

117
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,492
This was a constant tracker.

118
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:47,414
I've seen him three times in two
days, and I found this under my car.

119
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:51,043
If there's something you want
to know about me, you ask.

120
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:56,215
This agency requires the sacrifice
of some personal freedoms.

121
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:57,967
SD-6 is stepping up security.

122
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,470
McCullough assigned the tracker,
it's his province.

123
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:05,141
Now, we have a briefing.
Do you think you could focus?

124
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,810
- Yeah, I think I can.
- Good.

125
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:14,775
The clock you retrieved was designed
by Giovanni Donato.

126
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,654
He died in 1503. His initials
are engraved on the bottom.

127
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:21,699
Donato was a master clockmaker.

128
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:26,203
More importantly, he was the only
man that Rambaldi collaborated with.

129
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:30,166
There's a reference to Donato
in our Rambaldi archive.

130
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:33,127
Rambaldi commissioned
the clock himself.

131
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,882
And because of his involvement, you
think it's more than just a clock.

132
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,800
That was Rambaldi's style.

133
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:43,012
Hiding codes in designs
within his artwork. Marshall.

134
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,348
Alright.
I know we're all hungry for lunch,

135
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,560
so I'll use the maximum amount
of brevity possible.

136
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,439
OK. Now, as a clock,
it was far ahead of its time.

137
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:56,609
A margin of error of less than
one second per decade.

138
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,361
The weirdest part
is the gear assembly.

139
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:02,990
It's a part that doesn't seem
to serve any purpose.

140
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,618
This number on the back,
is it a date?

141
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:08,621
We're analysing that.
Know what we found?

142
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:14,335
Nothing happened that day. It's one
day in history that zero occurred.

143
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:18,589
We believe this clock will reveal
another piece of the Rambaldi puzzle.

144
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,966
The problem is, it doesn't work.

145
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,011
Without instructions,
we can't risk damaging it.

146
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:28,099
We've located a descendant of Donato
in Positano.

147
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,768
Luckily,
he went into the family business.

148
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,937
Your mission, Bristow, is simple.

149
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,982
Take the clock to Donato,
get him to fix it, and bring it back.

150
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,487
- That's it?
- That's it.

151
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,908
Dad, do you have a few minutes?

152
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:50,246
- Yes, of course, could you just...
- Somewhere quiet. Somewhere else.

153
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,252
In here.

154
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:08,222
Signal jammer.
We have 60 seconds, talk quickly.

155
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:11,058
Sloane's having me followed.
I confronted the guy.

156
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:14,395
I thought it may be K-Directorate
looking for revenge.

157
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:18,149
Sloane insists it's all routine.
Should I be worried?

158
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,360
Only five agents here
know the truth about SD-6.

159
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:25,281
I've had Sloane's trust, but lately
I haven't been informed of much.

160
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,283
- What's it mean?
- I'm concerned.

161
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:31,579
While you were in Romania, Marshall
noticed computer abnormalities.

162
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:35,040
He may realise the SD-6 network
has been compromised.

163
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,793
- Could Sloane trace it to CIA?
- I don't know.

164
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:42,298
Also, Karl Dreyer's coming in
to upgrade the biometric scanners.

165
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:45,551
If Sloane suspects a mole,
Dreyer's the one he'll turn to.

166
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:49,305
If so, Dreyer will give each of us
a functional imaging test.

167
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:51,307
- What's that?
- Lie detector.

168
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,852
I studied the CIA instructions
on how to take an LDT.

169
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:59,356
No, this monitors variations
in blood flow inside the brain.

170
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,486
It's difficult to deceive.
Tell Vaughn he needs to prepare you.

171
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,071
If he can't,
he'll get someone who can.

172
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,823
Dad, you seem nervous.

173
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:11,202
Well, I think...
that should be fine.

174
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,205
- Thanks for coming to me.
- Of course.

175
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,756
No, I think that's nice. Of course.
I think he's gonna love it.

176
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,258
Yeah, I'm sure.

177
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:30,805
OK, Mom, I gotta go.

178
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,224
I gotta go,
my boss is standing right here.

179
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,936
I love you, too. I'm sorry.

180
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,355
Still no quote from Hecht's fiancé.

181
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:40,731
I didn't get one.

182
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,150
- We can't have this.
- It's difficult.

183
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:46,487
- We've quotes from relatives.
- Just stop for a second.

184
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,699
- No, I'm not gonna do this story.
- Excuse me?

185
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,452
I won't run the story,
I won't do the piece.

186
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,496
You pushed me to pursue this,

187
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,582
convinced me of a connection
between the deaths.

188
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:02,253
Something terrible happened,
I told you this before.

189
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,131
If this story will hurt my friend,
I won't do it.

190
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:08,717
You haven't told her that you're
working on this, have you?

191
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:15,641
Like I said, you finish this,
or I will put another writer on it.

192
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,060
You tell her and get the quote.

193
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:20,980
This goes to bed tomorrow,
three o'clock.

194
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,736
- It's me.
- It's open.

195
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,911
What's the paper on?

196
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:38,956
It's a redo.
The professor said it had no soul.

197
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,792
So I'm writing a paper with soul.
Lots of soul.

198
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,254
"Laura, all my love forever
and a day. Jack."

199
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,631
- Not your dad, Jack, is it?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,260
That's uncharacteristically
sweet of him.

201
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,388
I know. He has a heart,
which I'm learning little by little.

202
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:56,557
He bought all of these for my mom.

203
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:02,730
I got your message.
You're going on another trip?

204
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,692
That's like...
Is it seven this month?

205
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:08,861
Is the bank ever gonna let up?

206
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:18,913
What's up?

207
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,628
There's this... situation at work.

208
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:29,089
Just... some money is missing
from petty cash.

209
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,467
There might be a formal inquiry.

210
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,345
- They don't suspect you, do they?
- No.

211
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:38,557
But they're gonna give us all
lie detector tests, which is just...

212
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,894
Can I make a suggestion
for the millionth time?

213
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:45,523
Why don't you just quit?
You can get a job anywhere.

214
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:51,195
- I just think it's weird.
- I know.

215
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:01,914
I still wear this.

216
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,460
I know.

217
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,632
- Hello?
- Joey's Pizza?

218
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,425
Wrong number.

219
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,099
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,604
I just came by to say hi.

221
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:28,941
Hi.

222
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,736
Hi.

223
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:36,907
Have you had unauthorised contact

224
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:40,161
with members of any
intelligence agency besides SD-6?

225
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,704
No.

226
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,876
OK, again. You have to stay under 30.

227
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:50,254
It measures blood flow
to the emotional part of your brain.

228
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,048
To divert it, you engage
the reasoning centre.

229
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,176
- I'm trying!
- You're emoting.

230
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,052
There's no switch you can flick.

231
00:17:57,136 --> 00:18:00,765
- Just split your focus.
- Maybe I've split my focus already!

232
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,977
- CIA, SD-6, school, my friends.
- Sydney, you can do this.

233
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,855
You have to.

234
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,109
Have you had
unauthorised contact

235
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:15,696
with members of any
intelligence agency besides SD-6?

236
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,739
No.

237
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,534
Better.

238
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,414
Are you romantically
interested in anyone?

239
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,420
It could be a question.

240
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:33,672
No, I'm not.

241
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,717
- Interesting.
- Ask again.

242
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:40,179
I don't have to, we've got our
answer. Very good, moving on.

243
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:51,732
If this were for real,
I'd be dead by now.

244
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,443
Wouldn't I?

245
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:59,740
No, I'm just
getting started here.

246
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,620
Milo Rambaldi.

247
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:47,681
Enter.

248
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,645
- You are American?
- Yes.

249
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:58,150
Only an American would come
to my door without telephoning.

250
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,075
Seth, get in touch
with my airlines contact.

251
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:10,871
I need a back trace on a passenger
manifest. I'll be in my office.

252
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,918
Seen the passenger manifest
for flight 816?

253
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,714
No. My guy at the airport told me
he was gonna fax it to me.

254
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,634
Seat 11 A. Daniel Hecht.

255
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,304
- Look up seat 11 B.
- Kate Jones, I know.

256
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:29,932
- Look at it.
- Zachary Collin.

257
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,643
- There was no Kate Jones.
- I don't understand.

258
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:36,480
Me neither, but there's no longer
one fact to support your theory

259
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:39,108
that someone is covering up
Hecht's murder.

260
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,568
What about Eloise Kurtz?

261
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:43,612
A woman hired to tell you
she's Kate Jones,

262
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,031
so you stop looking for the real one.

263
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:47,283
That's right.

264
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:50,494
- But she's dead.
- I've notes from my interview.

265
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:53,914
- You have no recording.
- What about the video blackout?

266
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:57,209
You wanna build a case
on lack of photographic evidence?

267
00:21:57,293 --> 00:22:01,964
You've got Jenny as your checker
and she didn't make a single call.

268
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:06,135
Right, she didn't. It was a favour.
She does a lot of work for me,

269
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,054
I was giving her research credit.
Like a gift.

270
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:12,600
- It was like a lie.
- Yes, it was. A kind lie.

271
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:16,729
On the eve of your first
front-page story, you get cold feet.

272
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,939
What are you saying? I made this up?

273
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:26,572
I swear to God, the only reason
I didn't want this story to run

274
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:30,409
is cos I don't want to hurt
Sydney Bristow. That's it.

275
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:32,828
You're a talented writer, Will.

276
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:35,623
But I promise you,
if this happens again,

277
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:38,959
the only thing you'll invent
are facts on your résumé.

278
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:49,136
The first Giovanni Donato,

279
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,599
his timepieces
were miracles of precision.

280
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:57,103
Kings and queens offered him

281
00:22:57,186 --> 00:23:01,273
vast riches if only he would
design clocks for them.

282
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:03,734
He refused.

283
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:08,239
But he did make... one exception.

284
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:10,449
For Rambaldi.

285
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,494
Why?

286
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,746
Rambaldi made him a promise.

287
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,414
What did he promise?

288
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:23,712
Rambaldi promised him he would live
an impossibly long life.

289
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:27,299
He even revealed to him
when he would die.

290
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,885
Was he right?

291
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,596
Of course.

292
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,395
This symbol on the front,
what does it mean?

293
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:42,273
The Magnific Order of Rambaldi.

294
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:44,692
Rambaldi's most loyal followers,

295
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:48,988
entrusted with safeguarding
his creations.

296
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:54,243
Sadly, like most things
that once were pure,

297
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:59,999
criminals now use the symbol
to infiltrate the order.

298
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,849
What about this date?

299
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:20,227
It must have meant
something to Rambaldi.

300
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:24,482
The clock was built
from one of his designs.

301
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:26,484
He never did tell me what it meant.

302
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:30,905
What did you say?

303
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:37,495
My mother... never told me.
I don't think she knew.

304
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:43,793
There's still one piece missing,
I don't have.

305
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:46,003
So, it won't work?

306
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:50,716
It will tell time...
if that's what you mean.

307
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:01,393
The clock is finished.

308
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:04,647
I've got Bristow in my sight.

309
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,857
Take the shot whenever you have it.

310
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,484
Mr Donato.

311
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:12,738
What was Rambaldi working on?

312
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:15,950
The clock is fixed.

313
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:18,452
Now...

314
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:21,413
...it's over.

315
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,529
Welcome back.

316
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:18,072
Thanks.

317
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:24,161
The good news is
I went by your professor's office

318
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,539
to drop off the paper,
but he wasn't in.

319
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:28,958
The secretary
wanted me to leave it,

320
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,753
so I waited around
and handed it to him personally.

321
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:35,881
Thank you, Francie.
What's the bad news?

322
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,844
I was making lemonade and I spilled
it all over your mom's book.

323
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:44,849
- I am so sorry, and I think it's...
- Don't worry, it doesn't matter.

324
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:49,854
- Thank you for handing in the paper.
- You're welcome.

325
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:40,070
Have you leaked information about
SD-6 to other intelligence agencies?

326
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,280
No.

327
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:47,578
- Are you a double agent?
- No.

328
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,040
But my father is.

329
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:54,001
I'm sure he'd be thrilled
if you gave Dreyer that.

330
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:59,006
Not now for the CIA,
20 years ago for the KGB.

331
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,633
My mother was a teacher.

332
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:03,302
My father bought her books,
one a month,

333
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:06,097
shipped from a store
they discovered in Prague.

334
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,933
- We really need to...
- Listen to me!

335
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:12,436
I thought it was sweet,
a side of him that died with her,

336
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,815
but last night I discovered codes
inside those books.

337
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:19,360
It's obviously how the KGB
were sending him messages.

338
00:29:19,443 --> 00:29:21,320
No. What kind of codes?

339
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:25,324
One-time pads. Blocks of ciphertext
in sets of five Cyrillic letters.

340
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:28,452
- Staple of the KGB.
- Yeah.

341
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,374
We'll deal with that.
I wanna see those books,

342
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,126
but you have this test coming,

343
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,503
and your life
depends on how well you do.

344
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:54,520
Hello, this is Will.

345
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:57,231
- Will, it's Mike.
- Mike, how you doing?

346
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:59,525
Your friend Eloise
brought her car in.

347
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:00,651
Eloise Kurtz?

348
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,571
She never picked it up
and she needed it right away.

349
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:06,782
- She did?
- Yeah. You know where she is?

350
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:09,076
Do you mind
if I come down and take a look?

351
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,495
No problem, you know where we are.

352
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,680
- Will Tippin.
- How kiss-ass of you.

353
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:33,434
- What?
- Stargazer Lilies and the card.

354
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,686
I didn't make up a single fact.

355
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,689
I thought you knew me
well enough to know that.

356
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,443
I am calling to clarify
you're on the soil erosion story

357
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:45,821
and not wasting
another minute on Kate Jones.

358
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:46,822
Are we clear?

359
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:52,453
Yeah, we're clear.

360
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,624
As you know, for some time now,

361
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:59,627
we have been operating
under the assumption

362
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,090
that the sum of Rambaldi's inventions
are greater than the parts.

363
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:07,176
This clock is evidence of that.

364
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:14,350
Thank you. Hi.
Now, who here remembers this?

365
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:16,852
The golden sun
from the church in Malaga.

366
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,020
The polymer.

367
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:22,191
If you look closely, hundreds of
tiny imperfections, nothing unusual.

368
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:25,736
But what is unusual is... this.

369
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,866
I realised that if you set
this to exactly 12.22...

370
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,829
21... 22.

371
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,331
And then this happens.

372
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,506
Miss Bristow, ladies first.

373
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,222
- What is that?
- It's a star chart.

374
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:56,684
A snapshot of the sky
at a specific place on earth

375
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,769
at a specific moment in time.

376
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:00,938
Sorry I'm late.

377
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,526
Sort of like an ancient GPS system?

378
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:09,864
Yeah, if you have the date and time
it was taken. That's the genius.

379
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:15,035
These two separately, nothing at all,
but put them together and...

380
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:19,457
That sound, that boom,
that's my mind blowing.

381
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,252
If we assume that star chart
refers to the date on the clock,

382
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:27,423
August 16th, 1523, at 2.22am GMT,

383
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:31,969
then the only spot on Earth
with that exact view of the stars

384
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,638
is the southern slope
of Mount Aconcagua

385
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:37,266
on the Chile-Argentina border.

386
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:41,937
X marks the spot. So, we think
Rambaldi has stored something there?

387
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:45,524
Possibly.
Your mission is to find out.

388
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:48,611
Marshall will fill you in
on the Op Tech.

389
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,698
And Sydney, before you head off,

390
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:56,160
I want you to go down to Psych
and see Karl Dreyer.

391
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,423
- What is your name?
- Sydney Bristow.

392
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,592
What colour are your eyes?

393
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:13,844
Brown.

394
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:17,598
Are you sitting down?

395
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:18,724
Yes.

396
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,144
Are you an agent of SD-6?

397
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:24,480
Yes.

398
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,359
Are you a double agent?

399
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,781
No.

400
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:56,971
This is a camera with a digital
signal, uplinked to a satellite,

401
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:59,932
so whatever's in Argentina,
we'll see right away.

402
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,393
Is there a transmission window?

403
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:06,439
No, it's geosynchronous orbit,
just point and click.

404
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,732
Yeah.

405
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:12,153
You seem a little distracted.
Was it the test?

406
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:15,239
I'm not sure I passed.
They're still watching me.

407
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:18,242
It took me 20 minutes
to shake their tail.

408
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:21,579
They wouldn't be sending you
on a mission if you failed.

409
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,956
I don't think they know
the results yet.

410
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:32,047
Look, I know how much you want
to do this, take down SD-6,

411
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:35,926
but your life is more important,
so if you think you failed the test,

412
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,472
we have a plan in place to take
you out, a protection programme.

413
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,933
No. I can't do it.

414
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,561
Live in hiding? Not a chance.

415
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,149
Good luck in Argentina.

416
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,504
Six-mile trek
and we should be there.

417
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,672
There are easier jobs than this.

418
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,341
God, no kidding.

419
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:20,679
You know... I've been meaning
to tell you something.

420
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,935
- I'm proud of ya.
- What? Of me?

421
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:29,230
- Yeah.
- Why?

422
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:31,982
Well, I've worked
with a lot of people.

423
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,151
You make it look easy.

424
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,615
The thing I admire most...

425
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:42,660
...is your courage.

426
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,453
My courage?

427
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:49,333
After what happened with Danny.

428
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:54,672
The way you came back.
Your commitment to the job.

429
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:59,885
And I know what we do
isn't for ourselves,

430
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:02,471
it's for the good of the country.

431
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:07,268
Still...

432
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:13,065
...thanks.

433
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:26,078
- You're saying it's a bug?
- No, it's a tarantula.

434
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:30,124
It hops channels so fast.
You can't intercept the transmission.

435
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:32,793
My guess is it's encrypted, too.

436
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:36,881
- Where can you buy this?
- You can't, it's government issue.

437
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:41,427
My sister's man is Secret Service.
His transmitter couldn't touch this.

438
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,681
I'd say it's intelligence.
What's the frequency, Kenneth?

439
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,855
What do you think
Rambaldi's all about?

440
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:57,735
I wish we knew. There's a thousand
places I'd rather be right now.

441
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:03,282
I think we're almost at
our way point. 22.42 by 70.01.

442
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:08,329
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Feels like a wild goose chase.

443
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:13,292
Ah, damn it. I can't get
a line of sight to the satellite.

444
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,962
It's a low earth orbit.
We're blocked by the mountains.

445
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,187
Give me a hand here.

446
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,855
- I'm going in.
- Alright.

447
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:19,692
I'll hike out, acquire the satellite
and call for support.

448
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:23,028
Syd... be careful.

449
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:42,918
Dixon, I've found it.
Rambaldi's journal, I've found it.

450
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:54,847
Sydney, they've found us.
K- Directorate.

451
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,141
- Dixon?
- They're here, Anna's here!

452
00:40:57,975 --> 00:41:03,272
- Sydney, get out of there!
- Dixon, do you copy me?

453
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,449
Have you Sydney's results?

454
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:19,413
I think we've found our mole.

455
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:38,849
What did you do to Dixon?

456
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,603
Put the book down.
