1
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:05,748
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:10,920
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:14,548
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:18,135
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,224
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:26,518
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:29,772
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:35,069
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:41,534
Only one other person knows what I
do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,119
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:45,871
My father.

12
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,251
We still don't know
who was behind the SD-6 invasion.

13
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:54,547
Learning that information and getting
a visual ID is our top priority.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,509
The meeting with K-Directorate is
scheduled to take place in Moscow.

15
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:02,221
You'll be surveilling this meeting
from outside the building.

16
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:05,975
We're on. They're heading
toward the building now.

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,190
Gentlemen, welcome. I am Mr Sark,
director of operations.

18
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,067
My employer's offer is simple.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,280
You will give us the Rambaldi
manuscript you recently acquired.

20
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:23,868
Sydney, that is llyich lvankov,
the head of K-Directorate.

21
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:28,247
Tell your employer if he
ever wastes my time like this again,

22
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:31,083
our next meeting
will not be so cordial.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,757
Congratulations, Comrade Kessar.

24
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,970
You have just inherited control
of the indestructible K-Directorate.

25
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,645
Sydney!

26
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,991
Wait!

27
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,043
- Thanks.
- Any time.

28
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,564
- Do you want some?
- No, thanks.

29
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,400
I gotta go interview David McNeil.

30
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,986
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,157
I better go. I gotta go.

32
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:11,243
- I don't wanna be late.
- OK.

33
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,123
So what are you gonna wear?

34
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,710
Just this, I think. I'm just going
to a prison. Who cares?

35
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:21,503
No, next week?

36
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,505
- Next week?
- To the dinner?

37
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,174
- Dinner?
- Did you get my letter?

38
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,635
- What letter?
- The one I left on your desk.

39
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:31,180
- What are you talking about?
- OK, you know what?

40
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:36,602
You really have to start reading
the things I give to you, Will.

41
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:37,853
What's this?

42
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:40,814
You're getting an award
for the Luis Maroma article.

43
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,233
- What?
- Yes.

44
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:46,487
The readers voted it one of most
inspirational stories of the year.

45
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,656
I can't believe anyone read that.

46
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,617
It says black tie, which means tux,
do you have one?

47
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,745
I have an old one.
I can't believe I won a Caplan Award!

48
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:56,789
You want to celebrate on Friday?

49
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,045
I can't.
I gotta do something on Friday.

50
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,005
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:08,467
OK.

52
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:16,308
Yeah. Well, thanks.
I just wanted to tell ya.

53
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,935
Will, that is so amazing.

54
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:22,064
North By Northwest is playing
at the Fairfax on Friday night.

55
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:25,025
I thought we could get some dinner
and celebrate.

56
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,653
Definitely. I'm so proud of you.

57
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:31,907
- It's not that big a deal.
- So, Friday night, it's a date?

58
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,450
It's a date.

59
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,751
Lompoc Prison, about two hours ago.

60
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:46,338
The man talking to Tippin
is David McNeil, software designer.

61
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:49,341
Eight years ago,
he created an encryption system

62
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:52,386
that we wanted to acquire,
but he wouldn't sell.

63
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,556
We don't have audio,
but we got hold of the prison log.

64
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,269
This is Tippin's third visit
to McNeil in the last two weeks.

65
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,106
You and I talked about Tippin
some time ago.

66
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,944
You convinced me that he was
just a harmless Metro reporter,

67
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:11,488
far from a credible threat.

68
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,451
But now he's found McNeil.

69
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:21,957
- What are you suggesting?
- You know what I'm suggesting.

70
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,835
Eliminating Tippin is premature.

71
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,505
He's a friend of Sydney's, who
as far as we know, knows nothing.

72
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,758
I told you this first as a courtesy.

73
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:34,845
Jack, I understand your reluctance,
what this would mean to Sydney,

74
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,389
but McNeil is not a benign element.

75
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:41,518
He knows about SD-6. The division
was mentioned in Koenig's testimony.

76
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:45,272
- Just the name, nothing else.
- A name is all Tippin needs.

77
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:47,942
What concerns me
is this doesn't concern you.

78
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,695
There's a difference
between concern and assassination.

79
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:55,074
What are you suggesting?

80
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:59,495
That we get audio, that we find out
what those conversations are.

81
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,251
Jack?

82
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:09,922
We should take care of this
immediately. I'm sure you agree.

83
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,133
There are some truths
Sydney must never learn.

84
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,892
- How's it going?
- Fine.

85
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:09,982
I went to the stationery store. Same
place I got the wedding invitations.

86
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:14,194
I thought I'd buy thank you cards
to send gifts back to people.

87
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:20,159
The woman in the store
asked if I wanted

88
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,162
the card stock
to match the invitations.

89
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:27,791
I burst into tears in the store.

90
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:34,215
Francie.

91
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,885
I don't know how to do this!

92
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,722
I haven't been able to take this off.

93
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:53,025
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

94
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,074
Truth is, I should have taken it off
a long time ago.

95
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,083
Here's an idea.

96
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,834
What?

97
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,952
Wilshire Court, 7:30.

98
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,538
I got my ball in my car. Call Mitch.

99
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,415
You got it.

100
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,585
- Well, look who it is.
- Abby, what is this?

101
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:54,879
False modesty doesn't suit you.

102
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,339
This isn't for
the inspirational article?

103
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,009
Pretty dense for the man
who wrote it.

104
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,553
- You don't deserve to win an award.
- I know.

105
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,264
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,058
- You make me sick.
- I make myself sick.

107
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,270
In ten years, I win tickets
to The Lion King, on the radio.

108
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:14,940
- You never invited me to that.
- Imagine that.

109
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:19,612
- Thanks. I'll get us some plates.
- I expect a piece. It's chocolate.

110
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:24,241
Maybe you can write an article
about this cake, win something else.

111
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:33,125
- Do you know Litvack's office?
- The next floor up. Huge office.

112
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:34,668
Thanks.

113
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,227
If I didn't have to go,
I'd eat the whole cake.

114
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,730
- Where are you going?
- Lompoc. I got an interview.

115
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:58,025
Your surveillance footage
in Moscow was remarkable.

116
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,528
We won't know the full implications
of lvankov's murder,

117
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,322
but here's what we do know.

118
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:07,868
Ivankov's body was delivered
to K-Directorate HQ in St Petersburg.

119
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:10,037
- Delivered how?
- Freight carrier.

120
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,624
Packed inside a crate
of frozen Atlantic cod fish.

121
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:17,044
Lavro Kessar, K-Directorate's
second in command.

122
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,421
He hasn't been seen since that night.

123
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:22,883
We believe he's being held
by Mr Sark as a captive.

124
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,720
Unless K-Directorate delivers
Rambaldi's manuscript

125
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:29,181
to Sark's employer, The Man,

126
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:32,142
they should expect more fish
in St Petersburg.

127
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,562
Have we learned any more
about The Man?

128
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,691
- We have to get a name for this guy.
- Nothing concrete. Not yet.

129
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:41,860
We have learned something
about Sark. Marshall.

130
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:47,283
Yes. Actually, I'm sure we've all
seen the classic movie, My Fair Lady.

131
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:51,787
"Professor Henry Higgins educating
Eliza Doolittle, you talk proper."

132
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,999
My favourite Rex Harrison film
is Dr Dolittle,

133
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,752
which always threw me,
because Eliza Doolittle, Dr Dolittle,

134
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,005
was that on purpose? Conspiracy?

135
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,965
- Marshall.
- Right.

136
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,429
We've analysed Sark's speech pattern,
stress, rhythm, and he's very clever.

137
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:13,183
His grammar and syntax give away
nothing, but his lengthened vowels

138
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:17,396
indicate he spends considerable time
in Ireland, most likely Galway.

139
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:21,358
Our Tunis assets saw a K-Directorate
boat in the Golfe de Gabes.

140
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,527
It's now moored off Es-Sekhira.

141
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:27,281
Tomorrow at 10am local time
a plane is scheduled to leave

142
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:31,535
from nearby Gafsa Airport
to fly to Galway, Ireland.

143
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,163
They're handing over the manuscript
in Tunisia?

144
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:37,541
Your mission is to intercept
the book and bring it home.

145
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,128
Review the mission details,
go over Op Tech with Marshall.

146
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,548
You'll leave tonight.

147
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,971
This look familiar?

148
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:54,266
The same kind of camera
I left behind in Argentina.

149
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,937
It is that camera. The CIA sent
a team to retrieve it last week.

150
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,440
- You only took a few Rambaldi shots.
- I know.

151
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:04,652
- But we did learn a lot from them.
- Like what?

152
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:11,158
I've got this aunt, Aunt Trish,

153
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,827
she's insane,
she speaks to the dead,

154
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:17,456
she goes to readings,
she's a crop circle worshipper.

155
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,916
- Aunt Trish?
- Yeah.

156
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:23,754
This Rambaldi story reminds me of
something she would tell me about.

157
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,091
Anyway, we know Rambaldi
was a 16th-century inventor

158
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,594
who seems to have had an almost
psychic vision of technology.

159
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,222
This book,
based on the images you took,

160
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:36,600
seems to be an instruction manual.
To what, we don't know.

161
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,770
This was written in Italian,

162
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,605
on the second page.

163
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,944
In there Rambaldi refers to
the "One Hundred Segments".

164
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,406
- Meaning what?
- That's on a page we don't have.

165
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,284
Your counter-mission
is the same as in Argentina.

166
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,828
When you get the book,
photograph the pages,

167
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,206
deliver the originals to SD-6
and the photos to us.

168
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,084
Just don't screw it up this time.
Got it.

169
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,920
Your father says Sloane's
spent a lot of time at home.

170
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,590
Yeah, his wife, Emily, she's sick.

171
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:10,384
- You two used to be close?
- We still are.

172
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,762
Less so since she was diagnosed,
she's been reclusive.

173
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:19,101
I haven't seen her since I learned
the truth about her husband.

174
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:23,856
This is a real opportunity. Call
Emily, say you'd like to see her,

175
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,025
and get invited to their house.

176
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:30,571
You want me to plant a bug?
Vaughn, she's dying of cancer.

177
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:32,990
- I know.
- You want me to use this woman?

178
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,783
- She won't know.
- I will.

179
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,036
We tried to bug SD-6. It's pointless.

180
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:40,247
That office uses every
counter-surveillance technique.

181
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:43,334
- Sloane's house is vulnerable.
- This is a moral question.

182
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,544
You're a spy. It's not the darkest...

183
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:52,301
Emily is my friend who is dying.
Does this not seem wrong to you?

184
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:55,638
- Why does it seem wrong to you?
- She's innocent, a good person.

185
00:14:55,721 --> 00:15:00,768
This is one of the last opportunities
she has to do something good.

186
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:08,400
Emily, hi. It's Sydney... Bristow.

187
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,196
Hi. I know, it has.

188
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,284
Are you busy or sleeping? Good, OK.

189
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,413
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

190
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,583
How are you?
That's why I called. I just...

191
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,295
I miss you.

192
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,591
Have you heard from your daughter?

193
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:35,553
No. My lawyer said she's safe.

194
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,097
That's all I really want to know.

195
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,642
- Alright, so what've you got?
- OK.

196
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,894
Based on the file at OT Technologies,

197
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:47,147
42 companies currently
use your encryption software.

198
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,483
- 42?
- Yeah.

199
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,195
So far, I've had time to look
into about 18 of these companies.

200
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,033
Listen to this. Six of them
have a common board member,

201
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:01,412
a guy by the name
of Alain Christophe.

202
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:07,501
This is the best part. 12 years ago,
Alain decides to retire...

203
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:10,588
...from the CIA.

204
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:17,303
And before that, from '82 to '89, he
ran counterintelligence at Langley.

205
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:22,808
Why are you smiling?

206
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:28,480
Because for the first time in eight
years, SD-6 should be afraid of me.

207
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:37,615
Do a Lexis-Nexis for everything
on Alain Christophe and call the IRS,

208
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:41,785
see if the Freedom of Information Act
covers access to his holdings.

209
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:46,624
North By Northwest tickets, Friday.
See if you can get a reservation.

210
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,094
Resist and you die.

211
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:00,638
Get out!

212
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:54,400
OK, so tell me the truth. Who do you
like better? Maryann or Ginger?

213
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,988
Listen, while you're grabbing
Rambaldi's manuscript,

214
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,699
if you happen to see a sandwich...

215
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:05,661
- You got it.
- OK. I'll radio if Sark arrives.

216
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:06,871
Good luck.

217
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,028
- Gasoline?
- Gasoline!

218
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,821
Yeah.

219
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,414
Dixon, the boat's secure.

220
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:35,543
I'm opening the case here.
The guy's handcuffed to it.

221
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:39,922
I'm picking the lock.
Looks like it's electromagnetic.

222
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,925
OK. Still no sign of Sark.

223
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,889
Yuri?

224
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:57,249
OK, I've got the book.

225
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,085
Sydney, Sark's here.

226
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,671
I'm taking the boat.

227
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:11,305
OK. Meet you at the airport dock.
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

228
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,964
OK, look, guys...

229
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:56,642
Six have a common board member,

230
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:59,353
a guy by the name
of Alain Christophe.

231
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:01,981
This is the best part.

232
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:07,194
About 12 years ago, Alain decides
to retire... from the CIA.

233
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:15,703
Do you value your life, Mr Tippin?

234
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:19,790
- Of course I value my life.
- Do you?

235
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:22,710
Your actions
would indicate otherwise,

236
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:26,547
so I'm gonna tell you what it is
you are apparently dying to know.

237
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,845
Your friend, Daniel Hecht, David
McNeil's wife Susan, Eloise Kurtz,

238
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,556
they were all innocent victims.

239
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:39,810
Their deaths were unfortunate,
a matter of circumstance.

240
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,984
Now the only remaining question
is whether the story ends there,

241
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,945
or whether it includes
other innocent victims.

242
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:57,203
Amy Tippin,
3723 East Conestoga Way.

243
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:04,460
Robert and Patsy Tippin,
63064 Schulman Way.

244
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:13,510
- Sydney Bristow, 4250 Cochran St.
- Stop! I understand.

245
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,807
This will be your only warning.

246
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,963
- Mr Sloane.
- Yes?

247
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:51,799
I've questioned everyone
from the boat.

248
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:55,135
The captain is a civilian.
He doesn't know anything.

249
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:00,599
- Kill him.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:09,900
- Hello?
- Sydney, it's Emily.

251
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,151
Hi.

252
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:14,071
Listen,
I wanted to thank you for calling.

253
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:17,491
- You've no idea how much it meant.
- You don't have to thank me.

254
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:22,162
I do. I woke up this morning
feeling... strong.

255
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:25,583
- Are you free for dinner?
- Tonight?

256
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,793
Bring a friend. Please.

257
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:33,465
- And you accepted?
- Not at first.

258
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:36,385
But Emily's sick. I couldn't say no.

259
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,055
I knew you wanted me to, anyway.

260
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,393
Here.

261
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:50,149
- This is a bug?
- It's good, huh?

262
00:24:50,232 --> 00:24:53,068
I think the guys who made it
have never seen sunlight.

263
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:55,237
You should meet Marshall.

264
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:58,908
- Where do you want it?
- Sloane has an office at home.

265
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:03,078
That's where we want it. Especially
now SD-6 has the Rambaldi book.

266
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:06,081
- The CIA studied your photos.
- They turned out OK?

267
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,167
There's one blank page.

268
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,712
Sci/Tech says of the few Rambaldi
documents they've recovered

269
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:14,048
the 47th page is always significant.

270
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:17,468
This blank page was number 47.
Your father's strategising

271
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:21,138
how to get it out of SD-6 Analysis,
replace it with a counterfeit.

272
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:24,808
Meantime, we're just hoping
to learn something with that bug.

273
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:27,061
OK.

274
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,482
You said
Emily invited you and a friend?

275
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:35,861
You taking anyone?

276
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,711
Hello?

277
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:55,506
- What are you doing?
- Syd?

278
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:58,884
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

279
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,513
I'm... working.

280
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,390
Are you OK? You sound like hell.

281
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:09,979
Yeah, I'm fine.
How... How are you doing?

282
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:13,858
- You're gonna kill me.
- Why?

283
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,735
I know we talked about
"North By Northwest",

284
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:20,030
but there's a dinner at my boss's.
I can't get out of it.

285
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:29,123
- You're mad.
- No.

286
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,836
I gotta go to a meeting.

287
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:40,009
Will you come with me? They said
bring a guest. Will you be my guest?

288
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:06,285
- Will you tell me what happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

289
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,873
Your bruise looks pretty bad.

290
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:16,837
Well, you're just gonna have to
come over to my place

291
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:19,882
and I'll make you
a big bowl of ash-e reshteh.

292
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:22,509
It's a noodle soup
my grandma used to make.

293
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,430
You have to meet her.
You're gonna love her.

294
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,892
Jenny, listen, I think you're great.

295
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:34,188
You're smart and you're beautiful
and I think we've had a lot of fun,

296
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,023
but you and I...

297
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:40,611
...I just don't think that we...

298
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:48,202
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Jenny...

299
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:52,081
I drive all this way, with a broken
radio, for you to break up with me?

300
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:54,083
- That's not fair.
- Call Sydney.

301
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,502
Sydney's not my assistant.
You work for me.

302
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,128
Not any more. Get out.

303
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:01,257
- Get out?
- I am not kidding.

304
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,300
Where are we? We're nowhere.

305
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,761
No, you're nowhere. Get out.

306
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
Fine.

307
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:20,317
"Dear Aunt Stephanie,

308
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,988
unfortunately, as my mom has
informed you, the wedding is off."

309
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:28,450
"So I am returning your kind gift of
a coffee maker, cos as it turns out,

310
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:33,455
the man to whom I was engaged
is a deceitful, sex-crazed jackass."

311
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:37,209
- "All my love, Francie."
- It's not too harsh.

312
00:28:37,293 --> 00:28:39,962
I'll read one more.
This is the restrained one.

313
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,134
- Hello?
- Joey's Pizza?

314
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,720
Yes. You wanna hear our specials?

315
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:49,805
Hello?

316
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:54,393
- We need to change our number.
- I know.

317
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,147
Thank you.

318
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:03,152
I'm getting some wine for tonight.
You need anything?

319
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,904
No, thanks.

320
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,545
Sloane brought
the Rambaldi book home.

321
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:26,050
He was so taken by what he'd seen,
he wanted to show it to you himself.

322
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,761
- He took it home?
- Yes. It'll be there tonight.

323
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:31,639
Why didn't he wait
until I was at SD-6 on Monday?

324
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:35,809
An Alliance courier's en route
to Los Angeles, then on to Germany.

325
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:39,605
They have labs in Munich
for advanced analysis.

326
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:43,400
Wait a minute. The blank page,
you want me to make a switch?

327
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:47,738
If we don't, the courier will arrive
and we'll lose our shot.

328
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,657
Doesn't this seem risky?

329
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,827
Making a move at Sloane's house,
while he's there, without backup?

330
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:56,580
You will have backup.
Your father's going.

331
00:29:56,664 --> 00:30:00,584
I can help you. Emily believes
her husband is COO of the bank.

332
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:04,088
If he wants to show you the book,
he'll do it in his office.

333
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,048
- Where I plant the bug.
- Right.

334
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:09,552
If that's where the book is kept,
it could be an ideal scenario.

335
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,388
Vaughn will call
posing as a friend in need.

336
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:16,433
Excuse yourself, go to
Sloane's office and make the switch.

337
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:19,103
Sloane's vault
is an advanced Cushing model.

338
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,690
The guys who made the paperclip bug
came up with this.

339
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:28,696
It tricks the safe into believing you
entered the correct combination.

340
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,116
They say its bitching,
so I'm assuming it's... bitching.

341
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,577
I don't know about this plan.

342
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,373
Not only does it put me in danger,
and you, but I'm taking Will tonight.

343
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,627
- You're doing what?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,297
Emily told me
to bring someone. Why?

345
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,549
Nothing.

346
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,343
I should leave. I'll see you there.

347
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:59,560
If you feel you can make the switch,
do it.

348
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,604
Just use your discretion.

349
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:06,650
- So, you're taking Will?
- Yeah.

350
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:14,783
- Well, you look really pretty.
- Thank you.

351
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:31,258
- Sydney, I'm so glad you're here.
- Hi.

352
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,637
These are for you.
You look beautiful.

353
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,181
Thank you. You look fantastic.

354
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:40,851
I want you to meet my friend,
Will Tippin. And this is Emily.

355
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,438
How do you do?
I'm pleased to meet you. Come in.

356
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:52,905
- I believe you know each other.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

357
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,158
- You, too.
- Sydney says you work for the bank.

358
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:58,410
Strategy. Investment strategy.

359
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:02,206
- I couldn't refuse Arvin's offer.
- That sounds like my husband.

360
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,916
Sydney.

361
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:08,087
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me, too.

362
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,006
This is my friend, Will Tippin.
Arvin Sloane.

363
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:17,304
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

364
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,848
Sydney,
I want to show you something.

365
00:32:19,932 --> 00:32:22,810
Emily, this is
the only business we'll do.

366
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:31,151
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- Yes. Anything would be great.

367
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,695
Good. Come in.

368
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:39,034
I didn't get a chance to tell you
how proud I am of your Tunisia work.

369
00:32:39,118 --> 00:32:44,707
- I was just doing my job.
- Well, you'll find as you get older,

370
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,544
how difficult it is to find people
who just do their job.

371
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:52,381
A courier picks this up tomorrow
for analysis.

372
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:54,842
- Taking it where?
- England.

373
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:59,054
I just wanted you to see it.

374
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:02,600
I didn't know if you had a chance
to look at it.

375
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,395
To really examine it.

376
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:07,897
No, I didn't open it.

377
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,358
Some of the text is Italian...

378
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,612
...but most of it is in code.

379
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:17,364
A code we haven't
been able to break.

380
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:21,452
Who was this man, Sydney?

381
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:26,332
What did he see?
What did Rambaldi see?

382
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:28,209
For those who know about him,

383
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:32,004
various agencies,
a few in the private sector,

384
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:36,508
they're spending millions
to answer these questions, millions.

385
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,553
Men would die for this book.

386
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,098
Men have died.

387
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:47,978
You know, Sydney,
the work we're doing here,

388
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:51,941
trying to figure out who Rambaldi
was, what he was working on...

389
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:56,111
...it is becoming an obsession for me.

390
00:33:57,196 --> 00:34:02,159
- I'm still not sure I'm a believer.
- Neither was I.

391
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:07,122
Neither was I.

392
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:11,585
Wait a minute. You wrote the article
about the fruit picker from La Venta?

393
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:16,131
Yeah, I did.
I can't believe you read that.

394
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:18,384
This is so funny.
I told you about this.

395
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:22,012
There was a poll in the newspaper.
I voted for you.

396
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:25,391
- You're kidding me. I just won that.
- You did?

397
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:29,228
Well, you deserved it.
That story made me cry.

398
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:32,648
- It just stayed with me.
- Well, that guy was amazing.

399
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:35,776
The story was about this man,
Luis Maroma.

400
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,987
He was a fruit picker from Mexico,

401
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,825
an illegal immigrant living in
Los Angeles and he worked for a man

402
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:45,786
who was basically a slave driver.

403
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,122
No, he was a slave driver.

404
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:50,374
The conditions these people lived in,

405
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:53,711
18 sleeping in every room,
one bathroom.

406
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:57,840
All undernourished, and if they
got sick there was no health care.

407
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:02,469
Anyway, Maroma was one of these
workers smuggled in from Mexico.

408
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:06,056
- Their boss was a monster.
- He was the devil.

409
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:10,352
- He was literally the devil.
- How's that?

410
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:15,149
If you spoke out against him, if you
tried to leave, he'd have you killed.

411
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,820
The other workers
didn't know what they could do,

412
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:24,158
but Luis Maroma could read.
He started to teach the others to.

413
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:27,870
He'd find articles in the papers
they wrapped the fruit in,

414
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:32,291
articles that taught them about
their rights, about right and wrong.

415
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:35,920
Eventually,
he led a revolt against this guy.

416
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,841
I'm gonna cry again
just talking about it.

417
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:45,054
What's amazing was he had no future,
he was in a horrible position,

418
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:50,851
working for the worst person, but
he was resourceful and smart and...

419
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,437
And today he's going to college.

420
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:58,275
And the monster he worked for is
in prison rotting where he belongs.

421
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:02,988
Well, that's an incredible story.

422
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,492
Emily?

423
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:10,996
Emily, are you alright?

424
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:16,293
I'm fine.

425
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:19,088
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

426
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:26,136
I'm... still adjusting
to this new medication. It's nothing.

427
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,555
It's OK.

428
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,599
Excuse me. Sorry.

429
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:34,478
Hello?

430
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:38,816
- Hi, it's Francie.
- Francie.

431
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:46,073
Excuse me, I have to take this call.
I'm sorry. Hey, sweetie.

432
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:57,084
OK, I'm in.
I'll see you at the dead drop.

433
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:07,303
So, Will...
what story are you working on?

434
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:13,100
- I have a few irons in the fire.
- What kind of irons?

435
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:23,110
- Can I get you more wine?
- Let me get it.

436
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:26,197
Stay. I'll get it.
I know where the wine cellar is.

437
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,575
This lamb's fantastic.

438
00:37:56,894 --> 00:38:00,064
- I got hit playing basketball.
- How's this?

439
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:04,276
That's a nice wine, but I have
something special, a '78 Lynch Bages.

440
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,279
- I'll get it.
- No, I know where it is.

441
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:09,865
You sit down this time. Please.

442
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,553
You look pale.

443
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:34,056
My friend,
she's really having a rough time.

444
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:38,477
I see. Is there anything I can do?

445
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:41,480
No. But thanks.

446
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,872
I should have told you about Tippin.

447
00:38:57,955 --> 00:39:00,666
He and McNeil
traced the use of McNeil's program

448
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:02,418
to some Alliance companies,

449
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,087
but I've dealt with Tippin.

450
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,673
He won't be a problem
for us any more.

451
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:10,134
Security Section
told me what you did.

452
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:12,678
You had me followed
by Security Section?

453
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:17,641
They intercepted a call that Tippin
made to McNeil this morning.

454
00:39:18,392 --> 00:39:21,270
They have scheduled
a meeting for this afternoon.

455
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:26,734
I'm sure he's just going
to tell McNeil he's off the story.

456
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:29,486
I'm not convinced of that,
so I sent someone.

457
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,700
If it becomes clear that Tippin
is giving up this investigation,

458
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:37,369
then, yes,
I think we should let him live.

459
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:42,041
Lf, on the other hand, you haven't
done the job this time...

460
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,835
... then no one can.

461
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:47,046
And I'm sure you'll agree

462
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:50,049
that Tippin
will need to be taken care of.

463
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:03,270
Stoller's gonna check
on those companies.

464
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:06,690
- What happened to your face?
- We have to talk.

465
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:10,903
When I first came here,
and I asked you about SD-6,

466
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:13,239
you told me not to pursue it.

467
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:19,578
You said it was too dangerous.
David, I think you were right.

468
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:24,458
Why are you telling me now? Did you
talk to Christophe? What's he say?

469
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:27,378
- I didn't talk to him.
- What the hell's going on?

470
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:30,130
I was kidnapped. Yesterday.

471
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,467
I don't know who they were, but...

472
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:37,805
... I'm assuming they work for SD-6.

473
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,768
David, they threatened me.
They told me to drop the story.

474
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:45,813
What makes you think
they' won't kill you anyway?

475
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:48,774
- What choice do I have?
- You see it through!

476
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:54,989
Understand, the only way you can
be safe is to publish this story.

477
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:59,493
Expose them in print.
That's your life insurance policy.

478
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:02,413
Come on, Will, we're close.

479
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:06,792
Give it a week and we'll have
something for you to write about.

480
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:10,880
One more week
and they can't touch you.

481
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,561
I can't. I'm sorry.

482
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:36,155
Kelly went away because of you.

483
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:38,574
You convinced her
you would get me out.

484
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:41,493
You don't have the choice
to back out on me.

485
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:46,081
David... I hate myself
for letting you down, OK?

486
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,419
But now, I'm you.
I'm exactly where you were...

487
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:53,923
...before your wife was killed.

488
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:59,803
Now, if I do what you suggest...
David, they're gonna kill my family.

489
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:03,474
My friends.

490
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:06,393
If you could go back,
if you could change it,

491
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,771
you wouldn't hesitate, would you?

492
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,193
I'm sorry.

493
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,836
Call Driscoll, tell him that
we have the rink for tomorrow night.

494
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,422
- Mr Vaughn?
- Yeah. I'm late for a meeting.

495
00:42:35,506 --> 00:42:39,218
Cancel that meeting.
I'm Officer Cohen with Sci/Tech.

496
00:42:39,301 --> 00:42:42,346
We figured out how to read
the Rambaldi document.

497
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:45,015
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

498
00:42:57,903 --> 00:43:00,364
Cancel my meeting.

499
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:10,416
I came as fast as I could.
Vaughn, what's up?

500
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:14,920
Remember that vial of liquid
Cole wanted in the SD-6 vault?

501
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:16,338
Yeah, of course.

502
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:19,967
We used it on the blank page
to get the ink to show up.

503
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,512
- So, it worked?
- Yeah.

504
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:26,932
So, what is it?

505
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:29,852
Look, we're not sure.

506
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:35,441
We don't know what it means.
That's sort of the problem.

507
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:38,027
OK, so you're acting really freaky.

508
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:43,240
I have the page with me
and I'd like you to see it.

509
00:43:45,117 --> 00:43:46,785
OK.
