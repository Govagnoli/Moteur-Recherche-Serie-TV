1
00:00:00,254 --> 00:00:02,450
I'm offering you the chance
to destroy Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,293
The moment this assignment is over,

3
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:06,428
we'll give you back your daughter.

4
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:08,469
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,416
You locked her in a train car

6
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:12,726
and you sprayed her
with a chemical agent.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,290
It's all there...

8
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:16,828
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.

9
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:20,535
We loaded the Bristow D.N.A. template
into the sequence.

10
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:22,755
Her genetic fluid is primed and ready.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,052
Synchro : Anyone Sixe Guilamu

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,053
Spécial thanks : Lemonhead

13
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,597
Honey, that's not good enough.

14
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:42,516
What am I, a dog whistle? I said no.

15
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,253
"N-O." that's right.

16
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,627
That's better. Thank you.

17
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:49,384
- Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,752
- Hi!
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.

19
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,032
My trip was fine.
It's these marketing people.

20
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,384
B.A.S, M.B.A.S

21
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,689
and not a lick
of common sense among 'em!

22
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,656
They almost didn't launch my new perfume
L'Eau De Passion.

23
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,845
They said the name was tacky.
Can you believe that?!

24
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,835
- It's a lovely name.
- I know.

25
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:06,627
That's why I always trust my instincts,

26
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:08,699
and now it is flying off the shelves,
flying!

27
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:11,910
I assure you, we can take care
of all your customer service needs.

28
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,631
I don't want my people suffering through

29
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,592
no ten minutes
of pan flute to place an order.

30
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:18,226
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.

31
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:23,882
I think I came to the right place.

32
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,840
We just got a lead on Anna.

33
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:27,793
She's routing her calls

34
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:29,697
through a call center in Jaipur;
using what?

35
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:31,738
Encrypted router.

36
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,589
She must have put something
on a line outside.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,353
So they have no idea
she's piggybacking

38
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:37,135
on their system.
She's totally anonymous.

39
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,590
So we locate the router
and remove the encryption key.

40
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,528
Next time Anna makes a call,
we listen in.

41
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:43,403
Right, maybe even trace her location.

42
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,340
What's the approach?

43
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,185
All you need to do
is get this perfume bottle

44
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:50,105
within 5 feet of...
a Wi-Fi access, point.

45
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:52,238
And then you can just map
the phone system.

46
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:54,061
We can figure out
which line she's using.

47
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,769
- "L'Eau De Passion"?
- What, you think it's...

48
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,309
too tacky?

49
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,539
I'll work with it.

50
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:02,530
Soon, we'll be doubling
our call volume capacity.

51
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,784
You're gonna need to triple it

52
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:05,646
when you start getting calls
about this baby.

53
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:07,291
<i>...the Mandarin Stripe
is on back order,</i>

54
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:08,752
but the Heather Sprig is available.

55
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:11,022
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?

56
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,181
It's called L'Eau De Passion.

57
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,565
Nice.

58
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:17,259
Well, you keep it.

59
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,232
Sorry, my computer's working
a little slow today.

60
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,114
Signal's good.

61
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:26,638
<i>I'm mapping the system now.</i>

62
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,599
If you outsource,

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,653
you can cut your customer service budget
by at least 30%.

64
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:31,654
- Interesting.
<i>- Syd...</i>

65
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,801
We've got a problem.
Their router is not out here.

66
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:35,943
It's in the building.

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,569
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.

68
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:41,506
No, don't go. Just follow my lead.

69
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,368
Nobody move!

70
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,699
Drop it!

71
00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:58,394
You get on the ground.

72
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,145
You in the pink, come here.

73
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:02,764
Get down!

74
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:10,685
Get on the ground!

75
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,356
Watches, jewelry, wallets in the bag!

76
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:20,639
Hurry up!

77
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,678
No reason not to be nice!

78
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,639
Come on!

79
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:34,077
All right now. That's enough for today.

80
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,378
Get up.

81
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:41,186
If anyone does anything
in the next three minutes, she dies.

82
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,701
Let me see this.

83
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,718
Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
It's probably a Knockoff.

84
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:54,427
Renée, what you did back there...

85
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,303
- You don't approve.
- No, it was brilliant.

86
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,117
You should think
about joining A.P.O.

87
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,960
In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.

88
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,742
We could try for a pardon.
You should think about it.

89
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,292
I was surprised to hear from you.

90
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,261
You made it very clear
that your dealings with us were over.

91
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,585
I read the instructions.

92
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:36,792
In order for the serum to work,
Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.

93
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:41,284
Only briefly,
as I recall, 30 seconds or so.

94
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,315
You're asking me to kill my daughter.

95
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,714
I'm asking you to have faith

96
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:47,593
in Rambaldi.

97
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,178
You're saying
Rambaldi designed the cure?

98
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:53,426
Well, given that Nadia's illness
stems from his invention,

99
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:55,380
doesn't that make sense?

100
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:59,928
Surely, I don't have to convince you
of the genius behind his designs.

101
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,876
You spent decades pursuing his works.

102
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:05,955
If things had gone differently,
you'd be working with us right now.

103
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,517
You'd be there.

104
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,578
When we realized
his greatest achievement.

105
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:11,867
You still could be.

106
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,375
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.

107
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,379
I won't allow it to consume me again.

108
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,694
I'm only here for Nadia.

109
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:24,117
That's unfortunate,

110
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,304
but we upheld our end of the bargain.

111
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,035
We gave you the cure.

112
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,070
Whether or not
you choose to administer it,

113
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:34,768
that's up to you.

114
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,581
Anna's line just went active.

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,258
Marshall and Rachel
are standing by to intercept.

116
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,298
Initiating the back-trace.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,116
Bringing the optical sats online.

118
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:56,805
<i>- Hello?
- Did you bring your umbrella?</i>

119
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,431
<i>The weather report
calls for rain.</i>

120
00:05:58,432 --> 00:05:59,869
That's not Anna but Kelly Peyton.

121
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,616
- Can you locate them?
- Already on it.

122
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,617
<i>- Who are you?
- That's not important.</i>

123
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,555
<i>Anna Espinosa works for me now.
That's all you need to know.</i>

124
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:09,244
<i>- I don't do business with strangers.
- Check your account.</i>

125
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,805
<i>You've already been compensated.</i>

126
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:14,837
I got him. He's in Zurich.
47-22 north, 8-32 east.

127
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,348
The kh-12 feed is up.
I'm zooming in now.

128
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,876
<i>I suppose given your generosity,</i>

129
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,055
<i>- I could make an exception.
- I figured.</i>

130
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,582
<i>Check under the bench
at the base of the stairs.</i>

131
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,213
- We need Peyton's location!
- I know,

132
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:31,510
but she's routing it
through too many hubs.

133
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,950
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:38,038
<i>I've got it in front of me.</i>

135
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,680
<i>What exactly
do you want me to do?</i>

136
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,501
<i>There's a message hidden
in the text.</i>

137
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,449
Page 47.

138
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,600
<i>What sort of message?</i>

139
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,916
<i>A code, a transfer, microdot?</i>

140
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,306
<i>If I knew that,
I wouldn't have to pay you, would I?</i>

141
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:50,359
Got it... Barcelona.

142
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,117
- Where?
- I don't know, just give me a sec.

143
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:54,740
Keep talking. 1 more minute, please.

144
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,490
<i>Use the protocol
you had with Anna</i>

145
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,563
<i>to contact me
when you unveil the message</i>

146
00:06:58,563 --> 00:06:59,707
<i>hidden on the page.</i>

147
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,205
Barcelona.

148
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:03,364
That's all we have.

149
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,503
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.

150
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,932
He's the best.

151
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,709
If it exists, he'll find it.

152
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,118
It doesn't make any sense.

153
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,880
If this guy in Zurich
was Anna's contact,

154
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:21,407
- why is Peyton the one calling?
- It's unclear.

155
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,350
But now I want you and Marshall

156
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:25,083
to work together.
See if you can I.D. him.

157
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:28,215
If we can bring him into custody,
we can use him to get to Anna.

158
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,066
Tom, Dixon, reach out
to all our contacts in Barcelona.

159
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,655
If Prophet Five has established
a new outpost there,

160
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,316
perhaps someone's heard about it.

161
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:36,256
What about the message?

162
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,628
You mean the one buried
in a 500-year-old piece of paper?

163
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,155
Are we taking that seriously?

164
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,116
We've seen too much not to.

165
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,703
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.

166
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,452
- I could take it and analyze it and...
- I'm taking it with me.

167
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,692
You have your assignments.

168
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:52,407
If anything develops, notify me at once.

169
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,535
Wait, where are you going?

170
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,316
Not that you have to tell me,
unless you want to.

171
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm going to see Sloane.

172
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,545
He had page 47 in his possession

173
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,935
long before it was turned over
to the D.S.R.

174
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,580
Given his obsession with it,

175
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,317
maybe he knows something we don't.

176
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,303
I can't just let you lie here like this,

177
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,914
not if there's a way to get you back.

178
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,593
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,414
God, I'm sorry. It's the only way.

www.forom.com

182
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,695
- Move away from her.
- You don't understand.

183
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,447
- We don't have time.
- Stop!

184
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,324
This is not your decision to make,

185
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:50,272
- no matter how much she's suffering.
- I have to do it now!

186
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,506
Oh, my God. It's too late.

187
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:10,863
It was a cure, Jack,

188
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:12,977
A cure.

189
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,059
It's okay.

190
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:29,859
It's okay. We're here.

191
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:42,734
So she's working with Prophet Five?

192
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,819
Well, that explains how Anna escaped
from prison, but why?

193
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,306
I mean, why would they want her?

194
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,494
- She's good.
- Yeah, I know.

195
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:50,616
But Prophet Five
has always been low profile.

196
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,926
Anna is on everybody's radar.

197
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:57,569
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's only something she can do.

198
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:01,230
We've identified the man from Zurich:
Mortiz Koller.

199
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,053
He used to be an art historian,
was kind of a big shot.

200
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:06,243
Supposedly discovered
Da Vinci's lost drawings.

201
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,144
Supposedly?

202
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:09,916
He forged them.
He was completely discredited.

203
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:12,430
It looks like he went freelance.

204
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,983
And plenty of criminal organizations

205
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,224
are more than happy
to put his talent to good use,

206
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,233
including Le Corbeau.

207
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,376
- He worked with Renée?
- More than once.

208
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,656
Well, that means
she'll know how to find him.

209
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,665
Syd, your father's on line two.

210
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:27,609
Nadia's awake.

211
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,190
Looking at her like this,

212
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,467
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.

213
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,822
It must be an overwhelming relief.

214
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,230
Yeah.

215
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,228
I know you have questions, Jack.

216
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,893
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to,

217
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,831
but I was afraid for people to know.

218
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,693
Conventional medicine
gave up on my daughter.

219
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,727
I couldn't.

220
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:02,106
I've been funding dozens
of back-channel research projects,

221
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,768
phase-one studies using class "A" drugs,

222
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,618
methods that no country would condone.

223
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,963
And then one of them paid off...

224
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:10,839
A study out of Barcelona.

225
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:13,521
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.

226
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,909
My options had run out.

227
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,102
- Sydney.
- Is she okay?

228
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,313
She's with the doctor now.

229
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,456
She's doing wonderfully.

230
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,047
You need me for anything,
you call the nurse, OK?

231
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,069
Hi.

232
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,181
Hi.

233
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,836
Everything seems normal.

234
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,649
I need to run some tests,

235
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,290
see if we can determine how...

236
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:52,799
- Nadia's condition reversed itself.
- No.

237
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,183
My daughter has been poked
and prodded enough.

238
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,321
If her health is no longer in jeopardy,

239
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:59,285
I want to make arrangements
to take her home.

240
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,089
She deserves her life back.

241
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:02,547
I understand.

242
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,767
I'll update her file now and...

243
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:06,929
see if we can get her out
of here as soon as possible.

244
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:07,886
Thank you.

245
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,144
You want to go in?

246
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:12,848
In a minute. I have a call to return.

247
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,814
<i>Hello?</i>

248
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,470
It's me.
I need you to look into something,

249
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:23,383
off the record.

250
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,832
Sure. What is it?

251
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,460
<i>Sloane's recent activities.</i>

252
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:29,797
That is travel itineraries,
call logs, meeting reports.

253
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,155
Anything you want me to focus on?

254
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,617
Barcelona.

255
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:40,935
Did you find Koller?

256
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,963
Tom's en route to meet Renée in Paris.

257
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:44,508
But you called me away from Nadia.

258
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,607
Sydney, how much do you know

259
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:48,909
about Nadia's cure?

260
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,034
- Why?
- Sloane's travel records indicate

261
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,144
he's made several trips to Barcelona.

262
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,199
He was there shortly
before we intercepted Peyton's call.

263
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:58,389
Sloane told me he acquired
the cure in Barcelona

264
00:14:58,452 --> 00:14:59,956
where Prophet Five is based.

265
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:03,176
We know they've used Nadia's condition
to blackmail him in the past.

266
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,909
Perhaps Sloane's association
with them...

267
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,068
...didn't end there.

268
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:10,351
You think he's working with them,
that Prophet Five gave him the cure?

269
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,957
Perhaps in exchange for information.

270
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,109
Sloane's been breaking protocol,

271
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,930
incorrectly logging phone calls
made from A.P.O. for months,

272
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:20,241
dozens of calls, Syd, all of them made
to numbers that no longer exist.

273
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:23,216
He's already admitted
to using illegal research channels.

274
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,049
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.

275
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,786
Or the back-channel research
could be a cover for something else.

276
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,252
I know what Sloane is capable of.

277
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,108
You don't have to remind me,

278
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,217
but Nadia has her life back
because of him.

279
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,956
Which is why
I hope I'm wrong about this.

280
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:38,958
Well, do what you have to do.

281
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,517
But until you have something concrete,

282
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,403
I'll be with my sister.

283
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,713
You cold? Want me to get you a blanket?

284
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,106
- No, the air feels good.
- Okay.

285
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,269
Sydney should be here soon.

286
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,037
I can't wait to spend
some time with Isabelle.

287
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,272
I'm even looking forward
to changing diapers

288
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,388
in the middle of the night.

289
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,663
So you're going to stay at Sydney's?

290
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah, I assumed so.

291
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,097
Oh my God.

292
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,334
Let me see her.

293
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:25,582
Come here, baby.

294
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:28,905
She's dying to meet her aunt Nadia.

295
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,753
Yeah, there you...

296
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,061
Hi, beautiful.

297
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,841
Well, I'll leave the three of you
to enjoy each other's company.

298
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,047
- Where are you going?
- A.P.O.

299
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,933
Jack wants to see me. I'll be back.

300
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:51,690
We'll be fine.

301
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:52,691
Won't we?

302
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,418
Okay, enjoy the sun.

303
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:56,652
What's happening?

304
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,136
Hi.

305
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,011
What is it?

306
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,513
You wanted to see me?

307
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,880
I arranged for the leave of absence
you requested.

308
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,667
The forms are all here
for you to sign.

309
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,194
Thank you.

310
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:18,633
Look Jack, I realize the timing
on this might be less than ideal,

311
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:19,603
but if you need me...

312
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:21,549
You should be spending this time
with Nadia.

313
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:24,559
Well, unfortunately,
I'm not sure if she feels the same.

314
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,019
Give it time, Arvin.

315
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,175
I know.

316
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,324
You're right.

317
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:32,443
One last thing.

318
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,900
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.

319
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,049
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.

320
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,347
They're looking for a hidden message
encoded in the text.

321
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,308
Were you...

322
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,494
...aware of this?

323
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,799
Apparently, the message is hidden

324
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,961
in a substitution cipher.

325
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,704
Marshall believes
he's close to decoding it.

326
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,021
I could let you know when we find out.

327
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:55,959
No.

328
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,874
No, I think it's better
I not be involved.

329
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,774
I understand.

330
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,771
I talked to Marshall.

331
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:12,123
He'll confirm he's working on page 47
if Sloane goes to him.

332
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,646
And the taps are in place?

333
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,247
If Sloane alerts Prophet Five,
we'll know.

334
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,309
Thank you.

335
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,611
- Any words from Tom?
- He's connected with Renée.

336
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,729
They should be making contact
with Koller soon.

337
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,475
We should get this going.

338
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,593
We're following Koller's protocol.

339
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,015
It's 10:00.

340
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,207
It's 9:59.

341
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,547
I didn't realize
the French were so punctual.

342
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:38,693
We're not.

343
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,957
It's you Americans
who are always in a hurry.

344
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,423
And we get fat, too.

345
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:44,860
Is there anything else?

346
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,110
Now it's 10:00.

347
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:53,573
We're on.

348
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:21,722
We need to meet...

349
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,596
Tonight.

350
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,398
- How's Isabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.

351
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,560
I'm all yours.

352
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,055
You shouldn't stay up.
You must be exhausted.

353
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,381
Well, what about you?

354
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,948
It's strange.

355
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:53,762
I've already missed so much time.

356
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,855
I wish I had been here for you,

357
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,061
- with everything that's happened.
- I know.

358
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,926
And I know what it's like to have
a part of your life taken from you.

359
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,877
For what it's worth, it gets easier.

360
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,886
My father wanted me to stay with him,
but I couldn't.

361
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:14,237
Ever since he came into my life,
it's always the same.

362
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,154
I just don't want to get hurt anymore.

363
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,633
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.

364
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,435
But...

365
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:23,959
You should know

366
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:26,948
that while you were sick,
he was completely devoted to you.

367
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,254
I mean, I've never seen him
so dedicated to anything.

368
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,895
Even Rambaldi?

369
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,941
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.

370
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,638
You can stay here as long as you want,

371
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,728
as long as you don't mind a crying baby.

372
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:41,996
Are you crazy?

373
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:44,157
I love having so much life around me.

374
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:48,958
It's my dad.

375
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,141
- Hey, dad.
<i>- Sloane set a meet.</i>

376
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:53,949
- When?
<i>- Tonight.</i>

377
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:55,719
<i>I'm going to surveil it.</i>

378
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,362
I thought you should know.

379
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,016
I'll wait for your call.

380
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:03,935
What is it?

381
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,851
There's something you should know.

382
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:23,188
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.

383
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:25,542
- I want to go with you.
- You sure that's wise?

384
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,864
Whatever you're about to find out
about my father...

385
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,541
I need to know.

386
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,326
All right, let's go.

387
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,070
Security is armed.

388
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:07,823
Aren't they always?

389
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,713
Just try to buy me
a couple more minutes.

390
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:26,329
<i>Renée...</i>

391
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,609
Almost there.

392
00:24:58,749 --> 00:24:59,923
<i>Three, two...</i>

393
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,266
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.

394
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,662
You finally got the Ford hybrid.

395
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:27,693
Electric.

396
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:30,170
It comes in handy
when you have to be quiet.

397
00:25:36,812 --> 00:25:38,400
Regardless of what we find,

398
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:42,398
I believe your father's feelings
for you are genuine.

399
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:44,285
I wish that was enough for him.

400
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:51,446
Sloane's not the only family
you have, you know.

401
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,090
Thank you.

402
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:06,879
What are you doing?

403
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,894
We can't see anything from here.

404
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:22,878
All right.

405
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:07,893
What were they saying?

406
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:09,666
I couldn't make it out.

407
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:14,228
We're in.

408
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,091
Sloane took something from in here.

409
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,652
- Clothes?
- Mine.

410
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,427
These are my things.

411
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,024
He was getting them for you.

412
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:54,271
I don't know what the rest of this is.

413
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,264
Findings from clinical trials.

414
00:27:58,403 --> 00:27:59,403
Trials for what?

415
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:02,128
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.

416
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:08,341
It appears that
I've misjudged your father.

417
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,373
Help!

418
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,899
Dear God, someone!

419
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,023
Anyone!

420
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Help!

421
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,032
Are you done yet?

422
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:25,926
Please, I don't know
what you want from me.

423
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:28,495
We want information about Anna Espinosa.

424
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:31,163
I-I... I can't help you.

425
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:32,403
Yes, you can.

426
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:35,761
We know she hired you
to decode a message in this.

427
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,919
I don't have the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

428
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,072
Anna who?

429
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,588
I know you're trying
to do right by your client.

430
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,703
But you and I both know
you are not cut out

431
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,597
to withstand extended interrogation.

432
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,601
You're just some unlucky bookworm

433
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,392
who's in way over his head.

434
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,899
Please, don't hurt me!

435
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,815
Then stop screaming and talk!

436
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,705
I have a meet set
with Anna tomorrow... in Ghana.

437
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:01,893
She knows what the message was?

438
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,690
No.

439
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,207
I want to get paid.

440
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,602
Why wouldn't she pay you?

441
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,806
Anna doesn't like bad news.

442
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,607
The document... it's a fake.

443
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,247
Very well done, but...

444
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,460
but a fake.

445
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:21,175
And you believe him?

446
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,621
<i>He has no reason to lie.</i>

447
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,219
He found a small amount
of titanium dioxide in the pigment.

448
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,871
Well, that means the document
can't be older than 80 years.

449
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:30,166
Give or take a decade.

450
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,702
- How do you want to proceed?
- We keep the meet.

451
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,936
We can still use Moritz
and the counterfeit page

452
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,489
- to bait Anna.
- Guess I'll see you in Ghana.

453
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,014
And the real one-- where is it?

454
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:38,829
- Nadia...
- I'm sorry. I should have called.

455
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:40,280
No, of course not. I...

456
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:43,426
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.

457
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,886
Sydney went to Ghana.
They're going after Anna.

458
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:47,780
That's not the reason I'm here.

459
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:50,547
I was hoping I could stay with you.

460
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,667
Maybe we can take some time,
get to know each other again,

461
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:54,668
if it's okay.

462
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,365
How could you even ask that?

463
00:30:58,137 --> 00:30:59,313
Come in, sweetheart.

464
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:11,004
This is my favorite sweater.

465
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:13,064
I remembered.

466
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,167
Thank you.

467
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,314
Chamomile. You remembered that, too.

468
00:31:27,597 --> 00:31:29,538
I need to admit something to you.

469
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:37,520
I didn't think you'd want
to be with me at all.

470
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:42,776
Especially not after
what my actions caused for you.

471
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,062
I've been quite angry.

472
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,242
Well, you have every right to be angry.

473
00:31:53,957 --> 00:31:56,259
Nadia, when I first met you,

474
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,248
I didn't know how to be a father.

475
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,389
I assumed it meant being needed.

476
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:08,525
And then I saw you lying
in the hospital in that bed,

477
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:11,319
and I realized something.

478
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:14,426
I realized that I need you

479
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,309
more than you will ever need me.

480
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,268
I'm sorry. I...

481
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:27,454
I promised myself
I wouldn't put any pressure on you.

482
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,988
It's no pressure.

483
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,505
Dinner's almost ready.

484
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,657
- You need some help?
- No.

485
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,701
Let me explain.

486
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:29,920
Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.

487
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:31,059
You said it was over.

488
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,030
- No, it's not what it looks like.
- You've been lying all along.

489
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,061
Look,
I handed everything over to the D.S.R.

490
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:37,224
except for that page.

491
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:40,238
I couldn't part with it.
I-I'd spent so much time...

492
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:41,768
I don't want more excuses.

493
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,597
Just talking about Rambaldi,

494
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:45,892
your face, your voice-- it all changes.

495
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:49,493
- This obsession you have--
- No, it's not an obsession.

496
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:51,256
It's faith.

497
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:54,982
Do you have any idea
what your faith cost me?

498
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:58,957
What did you think,
that I was sleeping peacefully?

499
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,669
The last 12 months were an extended nap?

500
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,437
I heard people talking.

501
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,588
I felt tubes
being shoved down my throat.

502
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,226
I couldn't open my eyes.

503
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:12,158
I couldn't move. I couldn't scream.

504
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,453
But I felt everything,

505
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,523
so forgive me

506
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:19,322
if I don't have much tolerance
for your faith.

507
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,085
Nadia, please!

508
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:24,976
You have to understand--

509
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,977
I'm done trying to understand you!

510
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,161
You have to make a choice.

511
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:33,242
Either me or this.

512
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,134
Please, don't make me choose

513
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,522
between the two most important
things in my life.

514
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,061
I suppose then you'll lose us both.

515
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,361
My god, the message!

516
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:55,190
- I see it.
- You're not getting it!

517
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:57,232
- Get out of my way!
- No, you can't have it!

518
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:58,606
I won't let you! Stop, please!

519
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,949
- Stop it!
- Nadia, move!

520
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,217
Okay, now this place-- crazy crowded.

521
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,790
I'm not talking about mall crowded,

522
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,304
I'm saying like people, cars, goats.

523
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,253
That's why Anna chose it--
hard to surveil.

524
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,395
What's the plan?
How are we apprehending her?

525
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,418
Visual aids here.

00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,890
Okay, uh, well, we have Anna,

528
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:12,773
who will be arriving
on the main road right here.

529
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:14,375
Now, uh, let's see.

530
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:17,764
Dixon and Rachel
will be stationed right here.

531
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,744
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.

532
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,369
Tom will be cutting off the back,

533
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:26,403
and... Sydney will... sorry, Syd...

534
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,724
will be at the entrance.

535
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:30,938
- So here comes Anna--
- Okay, thank you.

536
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,705
Notify me when they have her in custody.

537
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,019
Well, I wasn't done with the--

538
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:35,980
- It's fine. Thank you.
- The car was...

539
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:37,047
I get it.

540
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,333
Everybody's getting set up.

541
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:54,529
When you see Anna,
you'll take her out with this.

542
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:56,995
Government issue.
I never thought I'd have one of these.

543
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,325
Don't get too excited.
It's only a tranq gun.

544
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,816
That's too bad.

545
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,071
Have you give any more thought
to my offer about A.P.O.?

546
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:08,167
Yeah, I work better on my own schedule.

547
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:10,430
When are you going to start trusting me?

548
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:13,278
I trust you.
It's everyone else that's the problem.

549
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:16,765
Okay, go.

550
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:36,502
Beautiful jewelry for a beautiful lady.

551
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:39,062
No cash, sorry. I'm a starving student.

552
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,457
Is everything all right?

553
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:56,042
Wonderful,
considering I might get killed today.

554
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,880
Relax. We've got you covered.

555
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,017
This will be fine. Thank you.

556
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:50,928
Target approaching.

557
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:52,216
Copy.

558
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:55,085
Copy that.

559
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,599
What's going on? She's not getting out.

560
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,409
Something's not right.

561
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:15,252
<i>Hold your positions.</i>

562
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,342
They're retreating.

563
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,535
<i>I've lost visual.</i>

564
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:30,155
Don't let her escape!

565
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,562
Repeat, Anna's car
is headed toward the entrance!

566
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:34,323
<i>- Rachel, follow the car.</i>
- Copy that.

567
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,106
Renée, block off the back alleys.

568
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,184
She knows it's an ambush!

569
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:41,966
Someone tipped her off.

570
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,908
She's not here. Repeat--

571
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:03,448
<i>- Anna is not in the car.</i>
- Copy.

572
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:07,865
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.

573
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:27,345
<i>A few days ago,
I was absolutely horrified</i>

574
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:30,563
<i>that you would suggest
I would turn against A.P.O.,</i>

575
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,202
<i>that I would kill my own daughter.</i>

576
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:36,515
<i>I realize now that both were inevitable,</i>

577
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,779
<i>that death is a necessary sacrifice,</i>

578
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:44,280
<i>necessary to complete
the final leg of this journey.</i>

579
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:57,438
<i>I have been preparing
for this my whole life.</i>

580
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,079
<i>I knew it was coming.</i>

581
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:10,385
<i>I have betrayed everyone I ever loved,</i>

582
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,629
<i>but I was chosen...</i>

583
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:22,233
We appreciate what you've done.

584
00:41:22,507 --> 00:41:24,434
And this is my road to follow.

585
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:28,605
Welcome back.
