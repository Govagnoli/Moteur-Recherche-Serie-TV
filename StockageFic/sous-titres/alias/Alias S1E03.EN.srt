1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:03,913
Seven years ago,
I was recruited to work for SD-6,

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:06,749
which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.

3
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:10,461
I was trained as a spy,
warned not to tell anyone what I did.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,922
I thought I was working
for the good guys

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,508
until I told my fiancé about SD-6,
and they had him killed.

6
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:18,552
That's when I learned the truth,

7
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:21,805
that SD-6 is part of the enemy
I thought I was fighting.

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,976
Now, I'm a double agent, working
with the real CIA to bring down SD-6.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,981
My only ally is another double agent,
a man I hardly know. My father.

10
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:37,029
It seems that during the Cold War,
six nuclear weapons

11
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,531
were smuggled into
the United States.

12
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:43,160
When SD-6 picked up our nuke,
it went on a plane bound for Egypt.

13
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,288
- What?
- They sold the thing to Hassan.

14
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:49,875
- You're going to Cairo.
- Yeah. I need your help.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,545
SD-6 can't know I'm there.

16
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,682
I'm holding the core.

17
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,073
I'm holding enough plutonium
to liquefy our insides in 48 hours.

18
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:23,450
Put it down.

19
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,412
- I put it down, you'll kill me.
- Now.

20
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,622
I'm going to count to one.

21
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,084
OK.

22
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,143
You're falling behind, Sydney.

23
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,647
And I don't accept late papers.

24
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,650
OK, you know what?
Good point, you shouldn't,

25
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,445
but I do have a really good excuse.

26
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:03,616
OK. I was on a business trip
and my flight was delayed.

27
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,412
I have the ball
and I'm ready for instruction!

28
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,207
- ETA two minutes.
- I might not have two minutes!

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,918
If you recall,
I made it clear in my syllabus

30
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,086
I would receive papers via email

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,255
if you can't get them to me directly.

32
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,884
- You have email, don't you?
- Yes. You're not gonna believe this,

33
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,679
but there was a blackout
where I was staying.

34
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,056
Honestly.

35
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:38,609
OK, stop.
I can appreciate the complexities

36
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,528
of pursuing a degree
with a full-time job,

37
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:45,491
but it seems your work is taking
precedence over your education.

38
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:48,953
Now, admit it, Sydney.
You're dropping the ball.

39
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:07,805
My job is a means to an end.

40
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,100
And your class makes me feel like

41
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:14,853
maybe, someday, I'll be able
to do something more with my life.

42
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,863
Alright.

43
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,992
Next paper's due Thursday.
That won't be a problem?

44
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,953
No, not at all. Thank you so much.

45
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:40,546
Are you sure about that?

46
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,343
How's Friday?

47
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,833
It's confusing.
Charlie has an amazing offer

48
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,418
from Flemming-Letterman.

49
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,213
It's the most prestigious law firm
in LA.

50
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,798
- But Charlie's not excited?
- He's gone weird.

51
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:27,760
He never wants to talk about it,
he doesn't brag.

52
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,011
Wouldn't you brag?

53
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:32,389
I would be non-stop talking
about myself if they wanted me.

54
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,976
You and Charlie
come from different places.

55
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,813
In his whole family,
he's first-generation college.

56
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,024
- True.
- Not to mention law school.

57
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,985
He's probably nervous.
He's probably terrified.

58
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,572
I called my dad last night
to ask him what he thought

59
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,658
and he said, "Give it a rest."

60
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,369
"Charlie is one of the good ones."

61
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:56,205
- He's right.
- It's weird having the feeling

62
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:59,124
that someone you love
isn't telling you everything.

63
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:05,548
I can't believe you call your dad
for advice. I just can't imagine.

64
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:08,384
The worst
is having a dad who is always right.

65
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,178
No, it's not the worst thing.

66
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:17,518
I ran into my father... last week.

67
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,812
- Where?
- Just...

68
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,897
Just out shopping.

69
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,732
It was... It was so empty.

70
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,110
It wasn't empty.
It was full, actually.

71
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,321
Full of awkwardness
and lame pauses and...

72
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,823
I don't know.

73
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,284
Your dad, you know, he's just...

74
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,204
He's just your dad.

75
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,625
I don't want it to be like that
any more. I'm sick of it.

76
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:46,547
I mean, I always had this feeling
that maybe, someday,

77
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,634
I don't know,
my dad and I would connect,

78
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,430
and that things
could start to get better.

79
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,515
You know my opinion of your dad.

80
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,893
I know.

81
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,312
But if you can find it in your heart

82
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,398
to forgive him for being
who he's been all your life,

83
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,359
which I would find impossible
and could never do,

84
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,695
then you should make a real effort.

85
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,864
How do you start something that?

86
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,158
I have so many questions, I just...

87
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,618
You can call the man.

88
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,204
I won't reconnect with him
on the phone.

89
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:22,791
Go to his work. Go to the aeroplane
factory and just start talking.

90
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,003
You're really good at talking.

91
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,680
Dad?

92
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,516
Sydney, what are you doing here?

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,769
I would've called.
I didn't know if...

94
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:43,646
You shouldn't be here.

95
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,607
I told you
I have a thousand questions.

96
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,692
They're keeping me awake at night.

97
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,903
Then take something.

98
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:54,156
Did you know SD-6
was gonna recruit me? Did you help?

99
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,076
- This isn't the time.
- I need to ask about Mom.

100
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,912
- Sydney...
- Was it just an accident,

101
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:04,250
or did you tell her about what
you were doing, like I told Danny?

102
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,961
Look where you are. You're exposed.

103
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,587
Dad, please.

104
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,131
Don't come here again. Not again.

105
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:21,141
The device that you withdrew
from Taipei last month

106
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,768
remains in Analysis.

107
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,397
We're trying to figure out
what it does and how it does it.

108
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,109
At the time, I told you
that Oskar Müller was the designer.

109
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,362
The truth,
Müller was just an academic,

110
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:36,407
a scientist
who took another man's sketches,

111
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,244
translated them into construction
plans and put it together.

112
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,789
- So, who designed it?
- A man named Milo Rambaldi.

113
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:47,167
- Never heard of him.
- That doesn't surprise me.

114
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,253
He died in 1496.

115
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,840
Rambaldi was Pope Alexander VI's
chief architect.

116
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:56,427
Excommunicated for heresy,
sentenced to death

117
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,056
for suggesting that someday science
would allow us to know God.

118
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,977
After his death,
his workshop was torn apart.

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,106
His plans and sketches were traded
and sold for next to nothing.

120
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,527
In the next five centuries, his work
was scattered throughout the world.

121
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,362
No one is sure what's left.

122
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:18,032
Which is unfortunate
because, last March,

123
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:22,119
a Russian historian happened upon
one of Rambaldi's early designs.

124
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:28,250
She recognised something
that looked a lot like a transistor.

125
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,420
I don't understand.
Do you understand?

126
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,256
It seems that Rambaldi
was a prophet.

127
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:39,428
We acquired one of his notebooks
from San Lazzaro.

128
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,473
This is the analysis report.

129
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,605
Rudimentary schematic for
a transportable vocal communicator.

130
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:53,525
He was designing a cellphone around
the time of the Ottoman Empire.

131
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,611
- Come on!
- Ridiculous, right?

132
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:58,531
You know me.
I'm not a New Age kind of guy.

133
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:01,242
I don't believe
in the power of the pyramid.

134
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,868
I'm not a big granola fan.

135
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:05,579
This stuff
typically makes me roll my eyes,

136
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:08,332
and then my eyes came across this.

137
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,709
Written in 1489.

138
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:12,836
Rambaldi wrote machine code?

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,965
If I could,
it's probably not machine code.

140
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:20,261
The concept of zero has been
around... Well, it precedes Christ.

141
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:23,013
The numeral one
has been around even longer.

142
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,307
Ptolemy used zeroes as punctuation.

143
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:29,436
In Indian text, zero is more of
a spiritual concept than a number.

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,648
When I say Indian,
I don't mean bows and arrows and -

145
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,942
Thank you, Marshall.

146
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:39,196
We don't know what it is.
Rambaldi has become a priority.

147
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,116
We want to learn what it is
before anybody else.

148
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,035
- Have you run the sequence?
- It's incomplete.

149
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,914
The sequence was written on
the back of two Rambaldi sketches.

150
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:52,793
We possess one. The other
is in this man's private collection.

151
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:57,172
Eduardo Benegas, Spanish VC.
Auto enthusiast.

152
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:02,052
He also owns the largest collection
of pornographic art in Madrid.

153
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,140
Which I thought
was an interesting fact. Sorry.

154
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:10,311
We negotiated to buy one of the
sketches and he withdrew the piece.

155
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,230
We believe he was tipped off
as to its real value.

156
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:17,401
We think it's K-Directorate.
They're on to Rambaldi too.

157
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,071
It's possible K-Directorate
stole a key from Benegas.

158
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:25,534
Our data-reconnoissance division
thinks, although it hasn't confirmed,

159
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,787
that he's surrounded at all times
by six bodyguards.

160
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:32,374
We're talking about guys trained
under UEl Special Forces.

161
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,418
We also have reason to believe

162
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,630
that Benegas keeps the key
on his person at all times.

163
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:41,884
So the big question is,
how did K-Directorate swipe the key?

164
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,470
Anna.

165
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:46,931
It was Anna, wasn't it?

166
00:10:55,522 --> 00:11:00,236
Eduardo Benegas has a sketch
drawn by Milo Rambaldi.

167
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,742
There's a code written on the back.

168
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,455
SD-6 wants that code.

169
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,459
The sketch is in a case.

170
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,797
The case is in a vault.

171
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,094
The vault is on the top floor
of a car museum owned by Benegas.

172
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,597
So I'm going to Madrid.

173
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,725
What's my counter mission?

174
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:35,604
So it's 2,000 words or less

175
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:39,024
on gene sequencing
in virus-resisting cabbage.

176
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:41,402
And I'm realising slowly that

177
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:43,904
I might not
have a real handle on it.

178
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:45,656
Which part?

179
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,576
Just the part
about the gene sequencing

180
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,412
and the virus-resistant cabbage.

181
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:55,207
Doesn't your paper have
a science correspondent? Hello?

182
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,376
Hi.

183
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,298
OK. Yeah.

184
00:12:03,591 --> 00:12:05,593
- Hello?
- OK, thanks.

185
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:08,470
- I will come by.
- Sorry, man. Wrong number.

186
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,556
So you're busy.

187
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,309
You OK? You looked like...

188
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:16,687
It was Danny's landlord.
They found some of his stuff.

189
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,814
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

190
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:22,109
D'you want me to...
I can get that stuff, bring it back.

191
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:25,571
Would you mind? It's just
I have to go to San Diego tonight.

192
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:28,157
Yeah, don't worry about it.
It's done.

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,075
Thanks.

194
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:34,455
- So, who called?
- It was a wrong number.

195
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,707
They were looking for a pizza place.

196
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:43,255
I think I'm gonna go for a quick run
before my cab comes.

197
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,262
- Hey.
- Hi.

198
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:53,515
Devlin wants you to follow through
on Sloane's orders.

199
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,893
We're both after
the same missing code.

200
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,686
- You're kidding me?
- No.

201
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,815
- You knew about Rambaldi?
- I didn't. The agency did.

202
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,526
Da Vinci meets Nostradamus.
I don't buy it.

203
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,863
Tell the CIA chief in Barcelona
to prep for a dead drop.

204
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:11,784
Worst case, I'll encrypt the code on
an MP3 and leave it on Audiogalaxy.

205
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,370
How'd the Russians
find out about Rambaldi?

206
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,580
You're the Intel guy.

207
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,501
What can you tell me
about this woman, Anna Espinosa?

208
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,966
Born in Cuba, raised in Russia.

209
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,051
One of the last Cold War babies.

210
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:33,597
Go-to officer at K-Directorate
for wet work and active measures.

211
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:36,809
A year ago, I met
with an informant in Yugoslavia.

212
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,687
Just a guy with Intel
who needed the money.

213
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,816
Anna recorded the conversation with
a mic from the building next door.

214
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,318
How do you know?

215
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,612
Because as I shook his hand to leave,

216
00:13:48,696 --> 00:13:52,324
she blew out his brains,
even though she got what she wanted.

217
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:55,452
Her way of telling me
I was out of my league.

218
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:01,125
- Be careful out there.
- I'll see you when I get back.

219
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,003
No, actually, you won't.

220
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,922
I'm being replaced by a senior.

221
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,634
I wasn't experienced enough
to be your handler.

222
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,975
It was really good to meet you.

223
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:21,103
Good luck in Madrid.

224
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:26,191
He's an idiot!
I mean, that's the problem.

225
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:29,570
So is Davenport.
They're so involved in their own...

226
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,822
- Protocol.
- Know who's replacing me?

227
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,324
- Lambert.
- Lambert?

228
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,660
Can I say something?
And not just as a fellow officer,

229
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,121
but as a very smart man.

230
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:41,165
- What?
- You're too emotional.

231
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,959
- Not again.
- You're attached to this woman.

232
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:47,046
- It's your answer for everything.
- If I analysed you...

233
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,924
- Shut up, stop it!
- I'd say maybe you're jealous.

234
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:53,761
Of Lambert? Gimme a break!
He may be senior, but he's junior.

235
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,222
Now he can see Sydney
and you're crazy.

236
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:58,265
- This is not about me!
- It is.

237
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,267
No, it's not!

238
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,446
She's going to Madrid.

239
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,200
There's another agent with
K-Directorate who is dangerous.

240
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:18,953
I'm scared for Sydney.

241
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:24,166
I know I'm off the case,
but I want her to come back.

242
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,880
There's nothing you can do about it.

243
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:33,759
You don't know if this K-Directorate
woman will be in Madrid,

244
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,220
so why worry?

245
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:09,169
You sure wrote a hell of a lot
about this Bristow girl.

246
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:11,881
Anything else
I need to know about her?

247
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,802
You'll find Sydney's
capable of speaking for herself.

248
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:22,099
Look at her.
Wouldn't kick that out of bed.

249
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,317
You're going to Madrid tonight

250
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,861
and the fund-raiser's
at this auto museum

251
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:36,530
and you wanna dress nice,
dress to thrill.

252
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:40,284
I thought maybe you'd like
to wear this... necklace.

253
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,203
The pearls are fibreglass.

254
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,288
Better to transmit vibrations

255
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,875
from your larynx to the mic
right inside the pendant.

256
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:52,046
You don't wanna try it on or...?

257
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,133
I could... sample it,
but it wouldn't match my...

258
00:16:58,052 --> 00:16:59,470
Senora.

259
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,098
Gracias.

260
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,436
- I'm in.
- Roger that.

261
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:12,524
Last year, Benegas lent money to the
paramilitary in Columbia which...

262
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:15,110
Well, it didn't fly well
with the guerillas

263
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:18,989
so everyone will be jumpy tonight,
but we can use that,

264
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:22,868
because we've got a normal-looking
Spanish peseta, right?

265
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,787
Wrong. Sonic wave emitter.

266
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,290
Make you sure you drop it
near a window.

267
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:00,656
Anna just crashed the party.

268
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,617
Careful, Syd.

269
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,496
I don't want tell you what to do

270
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,248
when you're in the field.

271
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,584
But the unveiling of the prototype...

272
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,545
It'd probably be a good time
to activate the coin.

273
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,631
They'll be looking at the car,
not you.

274
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:25,431
Benegas Racing is proud to present
its new 627 quantum prototype!

275
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:36,233
You take this pen right here,
a normal-looking pen you write with.

276
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,778
Click that like that, and boom!

277
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,626
Now, the vault is on the top floor.

278
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:57,046
So, you're gonna have to bypass
all the security cameras.

279
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:59,131
I got a remote modem, remote modem.

280
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:02,509
What you do is you wire it
in the central junction box

281
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:06,138
on the first floor, then Dixon
can loop the video signal.

282
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:08,349
Central panel, junction box A.

283
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:12,228
- Damn it!
- What?

284
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:15,606
Anna's been here.
She's tapped into the alarm system.

285
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,859
- Remote modem?
- Yes. Which means she's got backup.

286
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:22,404
Alright. Leave it there.
We'll piggyback off their signal.

287
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:25,616
We don't wanna trigger
the central alarm.

288
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,410
- Is Anna on any monitor?
- Not on any of the feeds.

289
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:39,380
She's in the ducts.

290
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:42,383
I'm heading for the elevators.
Did you rig the cameras?

291
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:44,093
Looping the feed now.

292
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:04,071
I'm running the lock descrambler.

293
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:35,227
Anna's in the vault.

294
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:41,984
The vaults will be unlocked
in five seconds.

295
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,570
What's wrong with the descrambler?

296
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:48,032
They're jamming your frequency.
I'll try and find them.

297
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,352
The elevator's locked down.

298
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,815
- The descrambler's still jammed.
- Hold on, Sydney.

299
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,817
I see them.

300
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,160
Hurry!

301
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,620
They're coming up!

302
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:43,712
We're back on line!

303
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:47,216
Senora? Senora?

304
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:26,213
She's taking the north corridor.
I'll try to head her off!

305
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,730
I'm headed for the chopper now.

306
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,587
Dixon, she's going out back.

307
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,053
Sydney!

308
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:59,515
Syd, up there!

309
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,479
Give me your gun.
Give me the gun!

310
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,328
Hi. I'm Will Tippin.
I'm a friend of Sydney's.

311
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:23,414
She asked me to pick up her stuff.

312
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,583
This is all of it.

313
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,628
Did they arrest anyone yet?

314
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,215
For the murder?

315
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,092
No. Not yet.

316
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,345
Do you know how long
that traffic camera's been there?

317
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,097
No, I don't.

318
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:49,356
Do the cameras take a picture
at every red light,

319
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,943
or just when there's a car
at the intersection? Really?

320
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:55,779
Can we get a hold of every photo
taken on June 8th

321
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:59,575
between midnight and 6am at
the corner of Alta Vista and Sunset?

322
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,327
OK, great. Call me back.

323
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,163
Fighting a traffic ticket?

324
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,873
I swear, the genetics piece

325
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:08,459
is practically
arriving on your desk now.

326
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,127
- Practically?
- Nearly.

327
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,213
Concurrent with this conversation.

328
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:16,091
So out of 2,000 words,
how many have you practically typed?

329
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:17,635
Counting the headline?

330
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:21,138
Don't make me regret
hiring people in their 20s.

331
00:25:27,478 --> 00:25:29,063
Yeah?

332
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:32,525
Hi. I don't know
if I'm talking to the right person,

333
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,152
but I need to borrow a million bucks.

334
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:37,988
The Olsen twins went public.
I want to invest.

335
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:41,116
You'll need collateral.
I don't think you have any.

336
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,952
Have you seen my blue Chevy?

337
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:45,913
With the hula girl on the dash?
Yes, sadly.

338
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:48,165
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

339
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,084
How was San Diego?

340
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,336
Boring. How'd the article turn out?

341
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,130
Boring. Listen,
you may be too wiped out,

342
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:57,299
but some of us are having dinner.

343
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,593
Love to. I could use some fun.

344
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:01,887
Wanna do it at my place?
I'll order in.

345
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:04,515
- Great. Seven?
- How about 7:30?

346
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:08,352
OK. I better get going before
I get fired, which is inevitable.

347
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,521
- Will?
- Yeah?

348
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,817
Nothing. It's just...
It's nice to be home.

349
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:21,615
Yeah. I'll see you tonight.

350
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:23,951
OK.

351
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,710
You're gonna like working with me.

352
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,587
Really?

353
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,047
Must have been...

354
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,301
I almost don't know how to say it.

355
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:42,636
Devastating, when Kenny was killed.

356
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,055
But I want you to know
you can trust me.

357
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,933
I understand you. I empathise.

358
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:53,898
- His name was Danny.
- Danny? Yes, of course.

359
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:58,068
Well, what happened to Danny
was a tragedy,

360
00:26:58,152 --> 00:27:01,530
and yet, you didn't give up.

361
00:27:01,614 --> 00:27:06,243
Mr Lambert, I got your message.
Is there a reason I'm here?

362
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:09,288
I just wanted to introduce myself.

363
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,541
Grab a little face time with my girl.

364
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:19,423
I wanted to make sure
you don't have any queries.

365
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:22,134
- I've got a query.
- Yeah? Shoot.

366
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,638
Are you insane? Calling me in here
for a social event?

367
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,515
SD-6 has a division
whose sole responsibility

368
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,769
is to track agents
and report back suspect activity.

369
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:34,021
Your girl is risking her life,

370
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,607
and you yours,
every time we see each other.

371
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,693
So do me a favour.
Don't be so friendly.

372
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:46,033
I just love your spirit.

373
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:50,371
That's heartening. Are we done here?

374
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:53,999
- Yeah, honey. We're all done.
- Great.

375
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:05,094
I'm legally blind
without my contacts in.

376
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:08,472
- Great. Another eye story.
- First day in my apartment...

377
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,057
Give me two.

378
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,977
In the kitchen
eating cereal for five minutes.

379
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,729
I hear someone coughing
and I put on my glasses

380
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:19,191
and there's three men
painting my walls.

381
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:21,527
- I forgot they were coming.
- That's bad.

382
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,405
- The bad thing was, he was naked.
- I was.

383
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:27,575
- Naked.
- I naked-clean.

384
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,910
Oh! He loves to embarrass me.

385
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:32,246
Wait, wait. Define "naked-clean".

386
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,123
- I clean naked.
- Please don't!

387
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:36,208
I clean our apartment naked.

388
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,919
He loves to embarrass me.

389
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:42,006
- I'm gonna see that. Raise it five.
- You're bluffing.

390
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,216
The most obvious tell on the planet.

391
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,302
What? First of all,

392
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:49,221
not even in the hardcore-est
of ways do I bluff.

393
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,515
You only raise when you're bluffing.

394
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,269
- No, I don't.
- Full house.

395
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,897
Man!

396
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,524
Damn it!

397
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,527
- When Will bluffs, you can tell.
- I'll be right back.

398
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,613
How come I can never tell with you?

399
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:09,909
OK, OK.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

400
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:13,537
What are you saying? All traffic
cameras were out that night?

401
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,789
OK. Hold on.

402
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:18,083
Within a mile of Danny's apartment?

403
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:22,129
Is that a normal thing? No, that
doesn't sound like a normal thing.

404
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:25,591
I got a review at 6am, maybe
we should go while we're ahead.

405
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:29,345
We should go. Sure.
Thank you, Sydney.

406
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:34,141
- Goodnight.
- See you later, Will.

407
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:35,643
Bye, Will.

408
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,854
Thank you, Jenny. Thanks.

409
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:40,940
That is weird, isn't it?

410
00:29:41,023 --> 00:29:43,108
Yeah, OK.

411
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:49,698
- What's weird?
- A stupid article I gotta write.

412
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:53,410
Look at this.

413
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,997
What is it about tequila?
It's like a trigger.

414
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:00,459
I always get this craving.
No, it's more than a craving.

415
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:04,129
When I drink tequila,
ice cream becomes...

416
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:08,384
- Like a chaser?
- Like oxygen, like a requirement.

417
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:12,012
Freshman year,
I didn't go to many parties.

418
00:30:12,096 --> 00:30:14,765
But I did go to this one, I remember,

419
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:17,643
and I had some punch, mostly tequila.

420
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:20,646
And I got so wasted.

421
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,483
It was pathetic!

422
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,569
I went to this 24-hour market.

423
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:29,530
I bought three pints
of chocolate-chip ice cream.

424
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:33,367
- My God, is this story gonna end?
- Shut up.

425
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,336
- Oh, my God, this is excellent.
- So much better.

426
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:46,881
You gotta try this.

427
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:51,802
It's a combination of chocolate
and chips, and it's genius.

428
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:56,223
- Isn't it?
- Here.

429
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:05,691
Thanks. No, thank you.

430
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:08,527
- Oh, my God
- Thank you.

431
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,822
It's good. No, this is good.

432
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:16,076
My shirt didn't have enough
ice cream on it.

433
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:44,313
Listen, I...

434
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,161
Will?

435
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,832
I left that box in my car.

436
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,336
It's Danny's.

437
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:13,008
I'm gonna go get it
before I forget it.

438
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,052
- Right.
- OK.

439
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:27,857
Marshall couldn't open the box.

440
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,484
In my defence,
it was rigged with a new tech,

441
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:34,196
a device that destroys anything
inside if opened without the key.

442
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,948
Please go back to work.

443
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:39,410
- I'm not being fired?
- Back to work means not fired.

444
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,787
We needed a contingency plan,

445
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:44,582
so we called in
our best game theorist.

446
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:51,130
Hello, Sydney.

447
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:54,967
Have a seat.

448
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:59,638
We mapped out a scenario where
you infiltrate the K-Directorate lab

449
00:32:59,722 --> 00:33:01,599
where the key is being held.

450
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,475
Jack thought...

451
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,188
Your father thought
it could be too big a risk.

452
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:09,064
It sounds like the right move.

453
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:12,443
Obviously, we need the key.
Obviously, they need the box.

454
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:15,362
Six hours ago,
I contacted K-Directorate

455
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:17,448
and we settled on an arrangement.

456
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,783
You and Anna meet
at a neutral location,

457
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:22,369
under cover
of both agencies' security.

458
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:25,122
Together, you'll open the lock box.

459
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,624
Is this a joke?

460
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:30,586
The Directorate doesn't know the
code was divided into two sketches.

461
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:32,755
We have nothing to lose
by doing this.

462
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:35,466
This symmetric scenario
compels both sides

463
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:38,510
to adopt a mutually reinforcing
course of action.

464
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:42,556
Close cooperation is one of the
most stable strategic paradigms.

465
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,517
Assuming all the players
are rational.

466
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:48,896
Plus, I'm just supposed to trust
Anna Espinosa?

467
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:52,233
I need to brief the advance team.

468
00:33:57,154 --> 00:34:00,241
- Their first plan was suicide.
- I could handle myself.

469
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:03,702
Then we disagree.
My way, you have a fighting chance.

470
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:06,038
Then I guess I should thank you.

471
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:12,002
- It never crossed my mind.
- Dad?

472
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:20,719
Before I go,
just answer my question about Mom.

473
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:32,731
Your mother knew I was CIA.
It was no secret between us.

474
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:40,239
She died in the accident.
I never lied to you about that.

475
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,138
What is this?

476
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:07,725
Two-way earpiece and tracking chip.
We want you to tag Anna.

477
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:10,311
We've got a surveillance team
in Berlin.

478
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:14,148
- No. Whose idea was this?
- This is my op, Agent Bristow.

479
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,693
This only works if everyone's
on their best behaviour.

480
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:19,695
I won't be the one to break rules

481
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:22,907
when snipers are waiting for me
to look the wrong way.

482
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,243
I hate to pull rank,
but time is a factor here.

483
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:29,246
It is a factor. You know
how much time? Seven years.

484
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,625
That's how long I worked for SD-6
before I knew who they are.

485
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,378
Now that I know, my days of
blindly following orders are over.

486
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:39,924
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I know who I'm talking to.

487
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,469
Tell Devlin if Vaughn isn't
on the other end of this earpiece

488
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:46,889
when I turn it on,
the CIA gets nothing.

489
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,975
Vaughn is a junior officer.

490
00:35:50,684 --> 00:35:52,853
Then promote him.

491
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:00,778
Daniel's apartment was here.
The cameras were off here to here.

492
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:03,822
He was in the centre
of a one-mile video blackout.

493
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:06,784
Unless this is a coincidence,
which is doubtful,

494
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,161
there's no way
this is straight B and E.

495
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:12,081
Maybe, but Eisenberg
is on the crime desk,

496
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:15,084
and you are a staff reporter
way past deadline.

497
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:20,965
Don't make me regret
working for people in their 50s.

498
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,383
40s.

499
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,469
One week.

500
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:38,816
Francie, sweetie,
you're overreacting.

501
00:36:38,899 --> 00:36:42,695
Charlie's cheating on me.
I have proof. I found something.

502
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:46,991
It's a matchbook with some girl's
name and phone number written in it.

503
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:50,119
Copy. We're five minutes out.

504
00:36:50,202 --> 00:36:54,248
- That could mean anything.
- It says, "I loved tonight. Rachel."

505
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:58,460
- The matchbook is from a hotel.
- Fran.

506
00:36:58,544 --> 00:37:02,256
Don't assume the worst yet.
You won't know until you know.

507
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:05,134
The truth isn't what it seems.
Bitte, nicht!

508
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:08,679
- Where are you?
- With a client. I'll call you back.

509
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,764
Clear to land the bird.

510
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,395
Listen up. Per agreement
with the Directorate,

511
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:18,856
we'll divide the stadium
down the middle.

512
00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:20,941
They get the west, we get the east.

513
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:24,528
Alpha team, you're on rear overwatch,
in case they surprise us.

514
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,489
Bravo and Charlie,
you're on countersnipers.

515
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,491
The rules of engagement are,

516
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:33,412
you're authorised to fire
only if our assets are fired upon.

517
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:36,665
K- Directorate are taking position.

518
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:45,341
Hold positions. We're waiting
for Bristow to go hot-mic.

519
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:12,326
- Who am I talking to?
- Your invisible friend.

520
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:14,537
Good. Where are you?

521
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,250
Satellite relay station back in LA,
watching you from a 200-mile orbit.

522
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,752
My guardian angel.

523
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:25,381
I was gonna say the same thing
to you.

524
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:29,009
- Thanks for the promotion.
- You're welcome.

525
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,553
Heads up.

526
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,186
- Team leader, we're hot.
- Copy that.

527
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,063
She's coming.

528
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:45,734
Have you two spoken,
about her mother?

529
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:50,698
Yes. She asked me about her death.

530
00:38:50,781 --> 00:38:53,492
Did you tell her the truth?

531
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,513
How's your Russian these days?

532
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:07,942
I heard about your fiancé.

533
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,444
Very sad.

534
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:14,949
I thought it was a security execution
sanctioned by your employers.

535
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,829
Maybe you said something
in your sleep you shouldn't have.

536
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,585
But then, why would you be here
in service

537
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:29,588
of the men
that killed your true love?

538
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:42,059
- I take it you brought the key.
- I take it you brought the box.

539
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:46,021
Once we see what's inside,
we go our separate ways.

540
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:23,475
Oh, my God!
