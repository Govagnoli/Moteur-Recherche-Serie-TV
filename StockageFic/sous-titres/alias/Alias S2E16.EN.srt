1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,117
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,896
The prosthetics I'll apply
are lined with a carbon powder.

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,149
The system's database won't find a match.

4
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,646
Well, then, let's begin.

5
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,157
You've cleared their systems.

6
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:43,241
We're United States agents. Lock down
your vault. You're being robbed.

7
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,086
- Sloane.
- Hold your fire.

8
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:50,872
We've rigged the lower level with
enough C-4 to level the entire city block.

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,336
So I suggest that you both lower your guns.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,715
You, my dear,
will be driving me out of here.

11
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,364
Stand down.

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,539
Let Agent Bristow leave with the suspect.

13
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,248
He's holding the detonator
and we have a clear shot.

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,466
No. You make one move and one of his
operatives will detonate the explosive.

15
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,590
He's got the area
under satellite surveillance.

16
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:39,055
That means let Sloane go and don't
tail him until we get this stuff defused.

17
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,827
There's a current running through here.

18
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,664
If we cut the wires, we'll break the circuit.
There's a fail-safe.

19
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,370
The only way to take this out is to disrupt
the electronics. We need the water cannon.

20
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,457
The remote detonator
operates on a radio frequency.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,957
Wouldn't it be faster to find out
what that frequency is and just jam it?

22
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,421
Yes, but accessing the frequency
might trigger an explosion.

23
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,598
There's got to be a way to block it.

24
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:28,520
Not unless you have some way
to encase the detonator in concrete.

25
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,272
This is Agent Vaughn.
Get me the bank manager now.

26
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,895
I told you not to come after me, Sydney.

27
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,442
I warned you that I will kill you
if you interfere.

28
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,537
If you knew what I have in here,
if you knew what my plans are...

29
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,241
This is bigger than SD-6, Sydney,
than the CIA.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,371
Than you being deceived by me,
than me being betrayed by you...

31
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,746
If things were different...

32
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,629
The safe, it's a Friedland, model 42C.

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,382
OK, here we go. Friedland,
Friedland, Friedland, Friedland.

34
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,760
OK, got it. Constructed with three inches
of high-density concrete,

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,016
surrounded by heavy-gauge steel.

36
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,515
- Will it block the signal?
- I don't know.

37
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,851
That depends on the detonator.
How big's the antenna?

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,139
About an inch, inch and a half.

39
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,437
Then it's probably transmitting at... divided
by the speed of light, times one fourth...

40
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,904
- Marshall?
- Three gigahertz.

41
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,775
Which means you should have enough
shielding so the signal can't get through.

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,064
Should have or have?

43
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,072
- Have.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,611
Right, tell Kendall to start tracking Sydney
in five minutes. She'll be in a Ford Focus.

45
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,247
- You know what model?
- ZX5.

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,791
- What colour?
- Blue. Why?

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,033
Oh, no, I was just curious.
I was thinkin' about getting one myself.

48
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,207
You know, lower it a little,
get some big tyres, rims, gold rims, and...

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,128
Hello?

50
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,932
Syd, we've shielded the detonator.
The bomb cannot be triggered.

51
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,014
Sloane can't know this. A team will
intercept your car in five minutes.

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,150
Change of plans. ETA, five minutes.

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,360
The CIA has a hit list.

54
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:11,081
35 people worldwide
its agents are allowed to kill.

55
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,789
35 out of six billion.

56
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,836
You're one of 'em.

57
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:21,082
Which means, when I kill you,
I won't even be breaking the law.

58
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,637
You jump, you die.

59
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,051
Officials with AMCORP are
hiding behind Swiss banking laws

60
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,218
to avoid telling us
what Sloane stole from the bank.

61
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,185
For the moment, his trail has gone cold.

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,142
In other words, we don't have a plan.

63
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,225
I mean, it's true, isn't it?
We've got nothing.

64
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,235
May I remind you, Miss Bristow,
that Sloane was last seen in your custody?

65
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,357
I was in his custody.
He was holding hostages...

66
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,857
You had the option to take him out.
You chose not to exercise it.

67
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,489
I chose not to incinerate
300 innocent people.

68
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,488
Are you telling me you think
I made the wrong choice?

69
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,289
I think we should just
stick to what we know.

70
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,869
Sloane is holding Neil Caplan hostage

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,118
for the purpose of building
some sort of a weapon.

72
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,703
Presumably, what he took from AMCORP
is helping him do that.

73
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,170
But, you see, we don't know that
because we lost Sloane.

74
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,966
And the reason we lost Sloane

75
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,887
is because he had something we didn't:
satellite surveillance.

76
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,509
And if we tasked one bird to follow him
after we defused the bomb

77
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,758
- we would have caught him by now.
- The satellites were tasked elsewhere...

78
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,852
See, that's my point.
We didn't take advantage of the situation.

79
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,052
No, we prioritised.

80
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,974
What's the point of strategising
if we're not willing...

81
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,229
- We're doing everything we can do.
- No, we're not.

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,738
We're not even close.

83
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,452
I need a progress report.

84
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,078
Caplan says he's a day away.

85
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,041
We took the magnetometer from AMCORP

86
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,294
to expedite the construction
of the Rambaldi device.

87
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,420
My flight is the day after tomorrow.

88
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,379
It needs to be completed before then.

89
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,426
I believe Caplan to be a man of his word.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,558
Mr Caplan is only assisting us because he
believes we're holding his family hostage.

91
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,762
If what he's putting together is
as powerful as I believe it to be,

92
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,523
I don't want him anywhere near it
when it's operational.

93
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,813
I'll conduct the preliminary test myself.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,352
You do that by tomorrow.

95
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,363
- I love the Zamboni.
- The Zamboni's your favourite part?

96
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:59,746
No, coming home with you
after the game is my favourite part.

97
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,042
The Zamboni was a close second.

98
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,629
- Hello?
- Hey.

99
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,008
Kendall has something
he wants to show you.

100
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,674
- Can it wait?
- Apparently not.

101
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,884
- He wants Sydney too. Are you with her?
- No, I haven't seen her.

102
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,974
- You're in bed with her now, aren't you?
- I'm trying. Just find out what he wants.

103
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,056
Kendall?

104
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,640
The Zamboni's your favourite part?

105
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,194
Could you at least try and pay attention?

106
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,893
Vaughn, can you hear me?

107
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:32,195
No, coming home with you
after the game is my favourite part.

108
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,328
- Vaughn?
- The Zamboni was a close second.

109
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,913
We'll be there soon.

110
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,842
Cleaning crew's on notice
to sweep the apartment ASAP.

111
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,507
I don't understand.
How can the apartment be bugged?

112
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,932
I have countermeasures.

113
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,144
Will and I talk there sometimes about work.
He needs to be told.

114
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,186
Already being handled. We need to know
who you've spoken with, what was said

115
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,901
and what intelligence might
have been compromised.

116
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,228
Plus you need to compile a list
of every person,

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,190
friend, serviceman, delivery guy, mailman,
who has been in or out of the apartment.

118
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,740
Kendall's waiting for you.
I'll take this to analysis.

119
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,489
What do you mean,
you bugged the apartment?

120
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,958
It's not like I broke in and
planted it myself. I made it.

121
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,870
Here, take a look.

122
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,535
Right there, I soldered into
the circuit board. Can you see that?

123
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,754
- What is that?
- It's a Superman logo.

124
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:33,883
Except this one's got an M on it.
It's kind of my signature.

125
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,892
When I used to work at SD-6,
I made it special for Sloane.

126
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,311
It operates using an MD-14 data adaptor,
which cloaks the signal,

127
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,604
making it undetectable by bug-killers.

128
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,850
I know, I know. I'm that good.

129
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,023
Which is bad.

130
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,568
Vaughn said he heard it repeat his
conversation through his cellphone.

131
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,150
Right, well, this is a burst transmitter.

132
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,732
It periodically transmits
what is recorded to a receiver.

133
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,238
Can you reverse-engineer the signal,

134
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,614
find out where the conversations
were being transmitted to?

135
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,787
Well, if the transmitter
records the phone number

136
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,578
that it sends the conversations to,
yeah, I guess it's possible.

137
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,465
Then do it.

138
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,385
"Please" would be nice.

139
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,051
That's all right. Never mind.

140
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:35,152
Caplan finished early this morning.
The Rambaldi device is complete.

141
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,317
I ran the test.

142
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,279
I think you'll be pleased with the results.

143
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,963
We agreed to combine our resources, sir.

144
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,583
You promised you'd show me
incredible things.

145
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,428
But a suitcase neutron bomb
designed in the 16th century,

146
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,838
is that even a theoretical possibility?

147
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,480
Forgive the mode of transportation.

148
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,939
A person in my position
cannot be too cautious.

149
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,357
I understand.

150
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,654
Our mutual friend, Mr Dreyfus...

151
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,746
He sends his respects.

152
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,703
Let me pay you the courtesy of being blunt.

153
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,916
I don't do business with Americans.

154
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,548
I'm a man with no country.

155
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,428
And few alliances.

156
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,809
All I have is a vision of an enterprise

157
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:30,437
that will influence an existing world order
that I believe to be corrupt.

158
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,603
I'm looking for partners
who share that view.

159
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,402
I am but a humble shepherd.

160
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,813
Whose control of the opium trade
along the Silk Road

161
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,576
is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

162
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:50,412
In this part of the world,
it's better to be practical than visionary.

163
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,503
Why should I invest in your enterprise?

164
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,668
Ah, that, my friend, is a long discussion.

165
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,676
First, my gift.

166
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,935
It once belonged to Khushal Khan Khattak,

167
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,603
the great 17th-century warrior-poet.

168
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,653
He united our lands.

169
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,448
He is a hero to my people.

170
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,791
This is a treasure.

171
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,465
Tell me more about
what you have planned.

172
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,363
Hey. So, how's it going?

173
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,369
- I'm good.
- No, I mean about Will.

174
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,412
Is this gonna turn into a thing?

175
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,419
What's goin' on?
Have you slept with him?

176
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,580
- No, not yet.
- Will hasn't said a thing.

177
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,541
He can't even look at me any more,
he's so freaked out.

178
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,843
You know, Sydney,
you've been acting sort of weird lately.

179
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,810
Really?

180
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,186
And I thought you'd been acting weird.

181
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,610
I thought maybe it was because of Will.

182
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,243
You don't talk to me any more.

183
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,741
I'm sorry, Francie.

184
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,784
I just get so caught up in work.

185
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,329
Don't forget,
we used to be really good friends.

186
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,749
You can talk to me.

187
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,133
- Hello?
- Get in here now.

188
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,638
OK.

189
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,525
- Who was that?
- Someone from the bank.

190
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,061
There's a problem with a client in Tokyo.
I have to go in.

191
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,697
See ya.

192
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,116
- Hello?
- They found the bugs.

193
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,830
How should I proceed?

194
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,411
They'll be looking for our LA asset.

195
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,215
- Give 'em someone.
- I'll take care of it.

196
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,176
- Send a copy of that to Kendall.
- Vaughn.

197
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,679
Is it Sloane? Did Marshall get a location
by reverse-engineering the bug?

198
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,138
It works on an encrypted feed.
It was untraceable.

199
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,469
But we got a lead on Sloane another way.

200
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:01,150
An asset outside Kandahar reported seeing
someone matching Sloane's description

201
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,152
in the company of men
loyal to Ahmad Kabir,

202
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,440
the Pashtun warlord
who played footsie with the Taliban.

203
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,031
When they ran, so did he,
except we don't know exactly where.

204
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,366
We believe Kabir's men took Sloane
somewhere in the Helmand Valley.

205
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,501
Last year Sloane assigned an SD-6 agent
to infiltrate Kabir's Helmand operation

206
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,045
and intercept routing information

207
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,750
regarding a shipment of
Soviet surface-to-air missiles.

208
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,126
Sloane stole a shipment of missiles
from Kabir, but now they're meeting?

209
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,756
- What am I missing?
- Kabir has no idea who Sloane is.

210
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,302
The agent he assigned
got in and out undetected.

211
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,762
Who was the agent?

212
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,927
Marcus Dixon.

213
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,519
None of the records we acquired
from SD-6 detailed that mission

214
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,687
and everything that Jack knows,
now you know.

215
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,438
The only person who can help us is Dixon.

216
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,281
Who has made it clear that he has
no interest in cooperating with us.

217
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,275
Well, you're just gonna
have to change his mind.

218
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,238
I want a full briefing on Kabir
by our analysts.

219
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,867
I don't think you appreciate
Dixon's sense of betrayal.

220
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,626
Correct me if I'm wrong, Agent Bristow,
but only yesterday

221
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,829
you were standing here complaining that
we're not doing enough to find Sloane.

222
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:09,173
If you do nothing and we lose him this time,
you'll have only yourself to blame.

223
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,796
Marcus doesn't want to see you.

224
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,727
And, for what it's worth, neither do I.

225
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,888
I know, Diane, I do.

226
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,307
I promise you I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

227
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,105
What good are your promises?

228
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,437
Right.

229
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,281
- Hello, Sydney.
- Hi.

230
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,910
I need some information.

231
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,625
- I can't help you.
- Look, five minutes.

232
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,371
- All I need is a location.
- He said no.

233
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,416
Look, it could mean the end of Sloane.

234
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,138
Sloane's with Ahmad Kabir. All I need
to know is where Kabir operates from.

235
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,013
These are bad people.
They need to be stopped.

236
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,807
Not by my husband, they don't.

237
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,466
The Agency might try to compel you
to tell them what you know.

238
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,432
If they do, I'll tell them what I'm telling you.

239
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,066
We've made a decision,
as a family, to move on.

240
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,535
- Do you own a suit?
- A suit? Yeah, one.

241
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,616
- Put it on.
- Why? What's going on?

242
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,042
You've only been doing analysis a short
time, but your written briefs are good,

243
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,332
one of them on Ahmad Kabir.
The director wants an oral presentation.

244
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:33,753
- Wait. An oral, like, in person?
- Yeah, just give him talking points.

245
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,220
- I'm a writer.
- Well, it's not really a request.

246
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,508
- I don't talk, I write.
- It's part of your job.

247
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,889
Do you know Sammy's Red Hots?

248
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,682
- Sure. Santa Monica and 17th.
- Yeah. Be there in one hour.

249
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,848
- Order the special and no pickles.
- I like pickles.

250
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,144
You'll be led out back, where a windowless
van'll be waiting to take you to operations.

251
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,439
If I'm going to be talking to the director,
is that a big deal?

252
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,484
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

253
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,748
It's from the 16th century.

254
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,919
It is a carving of an Arhat, a "worthy one".

255
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,471
In Buddhist tradition,
an Arhat is the "destroyer of the enemy".

256
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,964
How is it you know so much?

257
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm a collector.
This piece is very special.

258
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:32,058
You want a partner, someone to invest in
an incredibly ambitious global enterprise,

259
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:36,281
which is, at best, a risky proposition.

260
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,984
What you offer in exchange, to be my...

261
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,914
to be my Arhat...

262
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,914
I need some assurance that
you can deliver on that promise.

263
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,080
Oh, naturally.

264
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,751
And that's why I'm fully prepared
to give you a demonstration.

265
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,845
I leave it to you to choose the target.

266
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,682
- No suit, huh?
- It's been a while since I tried it on.

267
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,681
Or worked out, apparently.
Which makes me overwhelmed and fat.

268
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,514
Will Tippin, Professors Joyce and Fleming.

269
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,520
They flew in last night from the Kennedy
School. I'll go tell the others we're ready.

270
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,183
The Kennedy School.
Where is that?

271
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,022
Harvard.

272
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,190
That's right.

273
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,238
Our objective today is simple:
to identify a person or persons

274
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:32,786
who can give us the exact location of
Ahmad Kabir's Helmand Valley operation.

275
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,672
Despite the American-backed government,

276
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,669
the geopolitical reality of Afghanistan
is that it's still defined by ethnic rivalries.

277
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,598
The simplest way
to find a Pashtun like Kabir

278
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,217
is to first find an enemy
willing to sell him out.

279
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,185
Sharif Rabani is on record

280
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:53,610
as accusing Kabir's Pashtun supporters
of engaging in ethnic cleansing.

281
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,398
I'm sure we'll have no problem
getting him to lead us to him.

282
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,982
Then why hasn't he?

283
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:02,201
Well, the point is, yeah, they hate each
other, but they probably hate us more.

284
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:06,034
I mean, since 9-11, haven't we paid guys
like this millions of dollars for information

285
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,245
and gotten almost nothing in return?

286
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,168
Are you prepared to make
an alternate recommendation?

287
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,004
Yes, actually, I am.

288
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,295
All I have are these photographs.

289
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,256
Sydney...

290
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,625
This woman's name is Aliyah Kazabi.

291
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,173
She's married to an administrator with
the Vatican embassy in Mexico City.

292
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,936
Aliyah Kazabi used to be Aliyah Kabir.

293
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,178
She's Kabir's ex-wife.

294
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,560
Since the Taliban got booted,
a woman can have her marriage annulled

295
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,401
if it's determined that she was forced
or sold into that marriage against her will,

296
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,525
according to court records.

297
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,281
- You found court records?
- Yeah. They're published on the Net.

298
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,615
I realise that there's nothing
geopolitically correct about my analysis,

299
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,326
but in the hell-hath-no-fury department

300
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,570
I figure this woman
would pay us to mess with her ex.

301
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:53,868
I mean, she hates him so much that she
sent their son into hiding with her relatives.

302
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:59,331
I'll get you that Web address.
You should check it out.

303
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,046
OK, I'll alert our station chief in Mexico City.

304
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,711
Vaughn and Bristow,
you will leave in one hour.

305
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:10,101
We need to protect this woman.
No one can know the CIA's contacted her.

306
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,811
You'll go under an alias.

307
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,597
Kabir has chosen his target: his ex-wife.

308
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,646
We're using the device on Aliyah Kazabi?

309
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:23,445
You'll be briefed en route to Mexico City.
You'll leave at once.

310
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,654
Surveillance confirms Kazabi's in the
administrative wing adjacent to the church.

311
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,315
Now, according to Caplan's calculations
of the running requirements,

312
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,329
we need 20 million watts
to reach that section of the building.

313
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,537
20 per cent of its capacity.

314
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,539
Yes, that should give us coverage
of the entire embassy.

315
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:23,999
But, sir, if Caplan's off by even
a microtesla, this could go very wrong.

316
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,300
- Do it.
- That's easy for you to say, sir.

317
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:31,762
- You're 8,000 miles away.
- I'll wait to hear from you.

318
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,699
I'm approaching the steps.

319
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:10,012
- I'm in.
- All right, Kazabi works on the first floor.

320
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,943
Can I help you?

321
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,866
I'm not here to hurt you.
I work for American Intelligence.

322
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:39,291
I need some information
about your ex-husband.

323
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,627
I know you're worried about retribution
for leaving him and taking his son.

324
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,086
That's why I've come in secret.
No one knows I'm here.

325
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,010
No one will ever know
that you've talked with me.

326
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,632
I'm searching for a man,
a horrible, dangerous man.

327
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,391
He's with your ex-husband
at his residence in the Helmand Valley.

328
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,514
I need to know exactly where that is.

329
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,344
Vaughn, can you hear me? Vaughn?

330
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,846
- Yeah, what is it? What's wrong?
- We just had an Echelon intercept.

331
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,229
Key words were picked up: terrorists,
weapons of mass destruction...

332
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,192
But are you ready for this? Rambaldi.

333
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,734
- Did you get coordinates?
- Yeah, yours.

334
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,779
We don't know when it's happening, but
you're not waiting there for us to find out.

335
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,945
Get out, now.

336
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,871
- I cannot help you.
- Sydney, we have to get out of here, now.

337
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,410
There's gonna be some sort of an attack.
A car bomb, a suicide bomb, I don't know.

338
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,173
But I'm alerting the embassy.
They're gonna start an evacuation.

339
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,127
There's a door at the end of
the administration corridor. Meet me there.

340
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,294
You have to come with me.
It's for your own safety.

341
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,878
I told you, I won't help.

342
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,504
You seeing this?
We picked up a hotspot.

343
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:57,178
- Where?
- It's directly behind you. It's huge.

344
00:25:57,265 --> 00:26:00,017
- What? What is it?
- Some kind of a fire, something burning.

345
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,850
Listen to me.
It's this inferno and it's right behind you.

346
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,397
- You don't see it?
- There's nothing.

347
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,103
Is he seeing people, buildings, what?

348
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,644
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It disappeared. It's gone.

349
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:16,115
- Gone? What do you mean, gone?
- I don't know. It just disappeared.

350
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,776
Let's go back.

351
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,876
I'll tell you where to find my husband.

352
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,936
62 people are confirmed dead
in what government officials are calling

353
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:35,442
the worst act of terrorism
in Mexico City in a decade.

354
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,688
Some people describe it as an act of God,

355
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,946
though local officials are
still investigating the matter...

356
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,872
All of the victims were incinerated
beyond recognition.

357
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:49,701
Absent positive identification,
a list of presumed dead was published.

358
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,953
Your ex is on the list.

359
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,384
- What is this?
- A small token of appreciation.

360
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,851
No, no. This is too much.

361
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:20,825
- I cannot accept this.
- I saw you admire it, and deservedly so.

362
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,863
You have destroyed my enemy.

363
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,204
You are in every way my Arhat.

364
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:34,246
I will have 40 million wired tomorrow
to the account of your choosing.

365
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:46,053
Video surveillance places Sark
at the scene of the attack in Mexico City.

366
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:49,642
Subsequent to the attack,
intel tracked him as far as Kabul.

367
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:53,181
Here's what we can assume: Sloane
dispatched Sark to carry out his mission.

368
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,682
Now that it's complete,
Sark has returned to his master.

369
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,529
And thanks to Ms Kazabi,
we now know where that is.

370
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,318
The plan is for you to lead
a tactical unit into the Helmand.

371
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,658
You'll parachute into the compound,
effect a roof access,

372
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:08,196
steal the weapon and signal for backup.

373
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,365
You know how people are
describing it, don't you?

374
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,498
They're calling it a doomsday device.

375
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:16,037
Saying it's the first sign
of the coming Armageddon.

376
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:20,543
Like the devil himself rose up
to attack that church.

377
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:26,508
Excuse me. If I may offer a scientific
explanation, I think it might help the...

378
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,173
Hi, everybody. It's good to...
That's a really nice suit.

379
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,392
- OK, come on.
- Right.

380
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:35,180
What we're dealing with is
a high-energy pulse weapon.

381
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,858
Now, thanks to an Echelon intercept,
we were able to retask a KH-12 satellite

382
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:42,195
over the area, and this is what we found:

383
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:47,737
OK, the blue dots, those are
the people in the church before.

384
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:50,450
Now, this is what the infrared
picked up after.

385
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,912
The body temperature of everyone
in the affected area increased

386
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,951
by over 2,000 degrees -
they literally melted from the inside out.

387
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,086
And nothing else
in the church was affected?

388
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,961
Well, that's because
it works like a microwave.

389
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:06,512
It excites water and fat molecules,
which don't exist in inorganic materials,

390
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:11,176
and then it converts them
into atomic motion, or heat.

391
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,977
You said everyone
in the radius was affected.

392
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,640
Even people who were taking cover?

393
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,474
Yeah, well, there's no defence
against this kind of energy.

394
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,938
It goes through walls,
concrete, steel, everything.

395
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,230
- There's no shield?
- No, sorry.

396
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,157
Oh, I should probably also tell you that

397
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,079
this kind of energy
knocks out computer circuitry,

398
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:35,370
which means if it's pointed at the sky,
it could take down planes.

399
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,250
What concerns me is that
Sloane knows this kind of use of force

400
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,127
is a deliberate provocation
that demands a swift response.

401
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:47,002
And yet he exercised it on
the ex-wife of a petty warlord. Why?

402
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,425
Got the inventory back from the cleaners.

403
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,184
They found audio and video transmitters,
all next-gen stuff.

404
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,182
- Video?
- Yeah. In the TV in your bedroom.

405
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:59,018
We're investigating everyone
you've listed as being in your apartment.

406
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,686
So far they're all clean.

407
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:02,769
Hello?

408
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,654
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey.

409
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:08,025
I know we had plans for tonight,
but I have to work.

410
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,359
What you have to do
is quit that job of yours.

411
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,660
- Fran, I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

412
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,452
The truth is, I probably wasn't
going to be able to make it anyway.

413
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,033
- So you don't wanna kill me?
- No, of course not.

414
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:21,331
You know, can we talk about this later?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

415
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,756
Yeah, yeah, I'll call you later. Bye.

416
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,055
OK, you remember that movie <i>Predator,</i>
when Schwarzenegger was being chased

417
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,472
by that crab who could
only see in thermal?

418
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,226
- No.
- No, you never saw that?

419
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,776
It was a great movie.

420
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:47,606
Schwarzenegger... it was
one of his better movies. <i>Twins... </i>

421
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,032
Listen. Anyway, Kabir's security cameras,
they work the same way.

422
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:57,537
They read heat signatures, which is kind of
a problem cos, well, you're incredibly hot.

423
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,417
See? Yeah?

424
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:03,915
Now, the solution I have devised
is you parachute onto the roof,

425
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,423
you rip off your tactical gear,
and then you slip on this baby.

426
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,170
Now, it's part of a cold suit.

427
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:16,095
It's all black, it's formfitting, and it will bring
your body back down to room temperature.

428
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,807
Yep. Put these babies on...

429
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,352
So, as long as I'm covered,
the security cameras can't see me?

430
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:25,106
Yeah, you'll be the invisible woman. See?

431
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,504
I'm on the eastern stairs.

432
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,720
All right, go right at the bottom.
According to his ex,

433
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,936
Kabir keeps weapons and ammunitions
in a storage room at the end of the hall.

434
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,051
There's no door.

435
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,557
- What?
- Work's been done.

436
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,684
Maybe this place was bombed in the war
and had to be reconfigured.

437
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:08,939
- You mean your intel's worthless?
- There has to be another way in.

438
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,545
I've been made.

439
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,012
Sydney's been compromised.
You have to order the tac unit in after her.

440
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,974
- Did she defuse the weapon?
- What difference does that make?

441
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,183
Kabir's been alerted.
If he's got the weapon, he'll use it.

442
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,469
- Issue the order.
- You heard Marshall.

443
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,975
There's no defence against it.

444
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,639
- If you don't issue it, I will.
- The tac unit wouldn't stand a chance.

445
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:49,570
- We can't just leave her there.
- Unless we can find another way in,

446
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:52,489
I'm afraid that's all we can do.

447
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,623
I don't think we've been formally
introduced. My name's Michael Vaughn.

448
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,034
I work with Sydney.

449
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:08,874
- I'm out.
- Sydney's in trouble.

450
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,041
- Respect my decision.
- I can't do that.

451
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,218
Not when your decision
may cost Sydney her life.

452
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,305
You wouldn't tell Sydney
how you infiltrated Kabir's,

453
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:22,467
so she found an alternate way in,
using what turned out to be faulty intel.

454
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:26,774
She was captured, and unless
we find another confirmed access point,

455
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:30,607
no one will be sent in to get her out.

456
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,403
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

457
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:37,566
You will either help save
Sydney's life or you won't.

458
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,533
Please leave.

459
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:48,539
I can't do that.
Not until I get your answer.

460
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,336
Admit you are CIA.

461
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:05,969
Submit to a videotape acknowledging you
are here in violation of international law.

462
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:15,523
Condemn the Great Satan
and maybe I will spare your life.

463
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:31,832
Sydney, tell him what he wants to hear.

464
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,919
Or this will not end well.

465
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,972
You know, in many ways...

466
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:50,144
I'll always consider you
my proudest accomplishment.

467
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,309
Please, Sydney.

468
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,769
Unfortunately,
I can't do anything about this.

469
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,530
Bye, Sydney.

470
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,250
Have you reconsidered?

471
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,674
Admitting you're CIA?

472
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,928
Perhaps you need a little incentive.

473
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:40,315
Enough.

474
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:44,323
My house guests have left and it seems
there's nothing more for us to discuss.

475
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:49,158
The cartilage that lets the kneecap
slide around does not regenerate,

476
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,121
which you should know in advance of this.

477
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,975
You OK?

478
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:20,652
I don't understand.
How did you find a way in?

479
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,110
Let's go.

480
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,334
Let's go. We got the device.

481
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,381
- Sloane?
- No.

482
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,379
This way.

483
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:07,215
Good work.

484
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:10,092
- I was lucky.
- You got the weapon.

485
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:13,101
- We've saved countless lives.
- Yeah.

486
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:19,604
I didn't get Sloane, or figure out
what the hell he's doing with Kabir.

487
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,444
We found these on a plumber whose
name you gave us. He was murdered.

488
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,898
He's either responsible for the bugs
in your apartment, or he was set up.

489
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,482
At the moment it's a dead end.

490
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,246
I'm glad you're home.

491
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,178
- Hi.
- Hi.

492
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,401
I know I say this to you a lot.

493
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,104
Thank you.

494
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:19,783
I can't judge you for
not telling me about SD-6.

495
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:25,216
If I had been in your position,
I can't say I wouldn't have done the same.

496
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:37,388
What's going on with Diane?

497
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,939
I don't know.

498
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:24,225
The Kings are in town on Friday night.

499
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:28,560
You could watch the Zamboni.

500
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,035
What we saw...

501
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:47,748
at the church.

502
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:53,255
And every time we think
we've seen the worst...

503
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,902
We talk of power and control.

504
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,952
But when we create
an incredibly powerful weapon,

505
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,159
you leave it in the hands
of a complete stranger.

506
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:26,869
Tell me, how was what happened
good for us?

507
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:36,219
Hand me the top page of the manuscript.
