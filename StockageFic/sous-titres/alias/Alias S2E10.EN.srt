00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,411
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,966
- OK, Dixon. I'm in.
- Stand by.

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,225
Sydney, you're looking for Vasili Kabilov.

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,220
ID tag C-16.

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,072
What's going on?

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,735
We just heard from Analysis about
the codes you acquired in Uzbekistan.

7
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,491
They have nothing to do with
troop communications.

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,614
What are they for?

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,959
They're the control codes
for six portable nuclear warheads

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,750
that the Uzbeks have admitted
and defence intelligence has confirmed

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,334
went missing six months ago.

12
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,212
- Do you know where the nukes are?
- Yes, I do.

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,383
They're in Kashmir, under what used
to be a maximum-security prison camp.

14
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,423
All right, Ms Derevko.
You're gonna lead us into that prison.

15
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,678
I handed those codes to SD-6.

16
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,441
Your guilt is unfounded.
You were doing your job.

17
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,019
I'm going, Dad.

18
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:13,566
I am not about to let Irina Derevko near six
nuclear weapons supervised only by you.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,529
If you're lying about this,
none of us will survive.

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,202
The only reason you know about the nukes
is because of me. I want some respect.

21
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,990
- We'll miss our window unless you jump.
- Shut up.

22
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,384
Right now we have six suitcase nukes
that are going to be activated tomorrow.

23
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,936
- Is that confirmed?
- CIA doesn't have any details.

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,267
- Boot Camp, this is Mountaineer.
- Abort. Listen to me.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,314
Fighter planes are in the sky.
You have to leave now.

26
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,135
We've got the cores.
Tell them to call off the air strikes.

27
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:33,023
This is Agent Vaughn. Abort the air strikes.
Repeat, abort the air strikes.

28
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:53,169
When I found out
my mother faked her death 20 years ago,

29
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,040
after mourning her for most of my life,
she was still alive,

30
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,884
I tried to imagine what it would feel like

31
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:05,433
to stand in a room
with both of my parents again.

32
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,809
It seemed impossible

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:18,189
that two people
with so much deceit between them

34
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,860
could ever find a way
to breathe the same air.

35
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:29,032
And all of a sudden there we were,
just the three of us,

36
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:35,412
walking down a dirt road
in the middle of Kashmir.

37
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,587
We were out there working as a team.

38
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,003
It was comforting.

39
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,760
We were ambushed and we fought back.

40
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,893
And we survived.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:57,609
Yeah. My parents and I sort of
went through the same thing.

42
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,480
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

43
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,278
Oh.

44
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,541
Vaughn told me Devlin approved you
to do research

45
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,962
if you pass
the Milgram-Reich allegiance test.

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,212
This is your SOP and where to meet
for the pick-up. Remember to drop...

47
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,469
Drop it in water, dissolve it. Yeah.

48
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,714
- Hey.
- What's up?

49
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,884
Where you been?

50
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,604
OK, listen.
Every time I walk in the room lately,

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,856
you guys hush up as if
I'm interrupting something. I mean, am I?

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,772
What? No.

53
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,979
Francie, seriously, we were just talking.
Why don't you have a seat?

54
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,108
I can't. I gotta...
I forgot my keys.

55
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,366
I gotta go open the restaurant. I'll see you.

56
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,113
OK.

57
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:20,274
Kendall's allowed me 15 minutes here
twice a week.

58
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,991
You put in the request, didn't you,
to give me time out here?

59
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,152
Yeah.

60
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,530
We appreciated your help in Kashmir.

61
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:40,123
I need you to understand,
I was 18 when the KGB recruited me.

62
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,711
For a woman to be asked to serve
her country, it was a future,

63
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,969
it meant empowerment, independence.

64
00:05:53,978 --> 00:06:01,357
I was a fool to think that any ideology
could come before my daughter.

65
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,363
Sydney?

66
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,572
Stand down.

67
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,247
Let me see your hands.
Keep 'em up.

68
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,509
What is this? We have an arrangement.

69
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes. One you failed to live up to.

70
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:36,803
Our operation in Kashmir
was a waste of SD-6 resources.

71
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,972
We acquired nothing.

72
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,026
So my question is:

73
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,740
have you betrayed me
or are you simply incompetent?

74
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,952
This interrogation technique
was developed by the Khmer Rouge

75
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,659
to minimise bruising on political prisoners

76
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,707
when they were allowing them
to be photographed.

77
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:07,755
You see, if I pull this just a little harder,

78
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,252
the glass will break.

79
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,881
And I do not wanna do that.

80
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:19,764
So tell me, do you think that we were
unlucky on our first venture together?

81
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:24,150
Or do you have another plan
that you wanna tell me about?

82
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:37,364
I didn't betray you.
We agreed to combine our efforts.

83
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,503
I swear to you, that's still my intent.

84
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,541
Then tell me,
what went wrong in Kashmir?

85
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:50,258
The Indian Western Command
carried out an air strike on the PRF prison.

86
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,299
The Rambaldi artefact was destroyed.

87
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,429
My contact in the region, Gerard Cuvee,

88
00:07:55,517 --> 00:08:00,511
mistakenly believes
I tipped the Indian authorities off.

89
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:06,062
With all due respect, sir,
could the leak have come from this office?

90
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,984
So Sloane has no idea
you sabotaged the operation in Kashmir?

91
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,362
If he did, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

92
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,739
Since Sark failed to deliver on
his promise with Sloane,

93
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,366
their partnership may not last for long.

94
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,946
Unfortunately it isn't over yet.

95
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,253
Sloane is sending me to Paris
with Sark tonight.

96
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,495
Why?

97
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:32,046
The Echelon satellite system. Phone calls,
emails, faxes from around the world

98
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,715
are filtered through a program capable
of flagging key words on an NSA watch list.

99
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,848
Echelon has been
immeasurably successful

100
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,063
in indicating threats to
our national security.

101
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,433
Mr Sark has provided us with
new intelligence indicating that

102
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:52,399
an enemy of this country may have
acquired the ability to access this terminal.

103
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,698
Gerard Cuvee: former leader of
the People's Revolutionary Front,

104
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,999
a crime syndicate, whose headquarters
were raided by Indian authority last week.

105
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,328
Mr Sark.

106
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,372
My dealings with Mr Cuvee
go back several years.

107
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:10,543
He once showed me an Echelon
access terminal he stole from the NSA

108
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,792
that he keeps at a front company in Paris.

109
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,930
Recent attention by local authorities have
led Cuvee to believe that I betrayed him.

110
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,135
Therefore, he's sure to move the terminal
to an undisclosed location.

111
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,717
Surveillance team intercepted
an operations log

112
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,805
indicating that an armoured transport

113
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,852
has been scheduled for
a pick-up tomorrow afternoon.

114
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,268
We believe that's when
they'll be moving the terminal.

115
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,359
Sydney, you and Sark will intercept
the convoy en route

116
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,743
and bring the terminal back here safely.

117
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,204
If Sloane gets ahold of that terminal,

118
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,745
well, the Alliance will be able
to eavesdrop on corporations,

119
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,660
law enforcement, political campaigns.

120
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,872
The potential for blackmail and
insider trading would be unlimited.

121
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,422
What's my countermission?

122
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,958
I'll have Technical Services provide you
with a secure deletion program.

123
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,009
You'll upload it on to the Echelon terminal.

124
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,097
When SD-6 turns it on,
it'll wipe the hard drive clean.

125
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:05,979
Sloane will think Cuvee installed a fail-safe
to prevent unauthorised access.

126
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,140
I'll do it on the return flight.

127
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:14,236
Sark and I are travelling separately to make
sure no-one can connect him to SD-6.

128
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,361
Oh, by the way,

129
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,862
I'm meeting with Will tomorrow to help him
prep for his psych evaluation.

130
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,243
Thank you.

131
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,205
- And I like it.
- What?

132
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,040
- Your new suit.
- Oh. It's not new.

133
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,877
I just don't wear it that often.
I came from a funeral.

134
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,547
Alice's father died.

135
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,672
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,346
- How's she doing?
- OK.

137
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,642
Not really, but she'll be fine.

138
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,018
Let me know if you need anything.

139
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,576
Miss Bristow. Hi.

140
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,828
Uh, I know you have a plane to catch,
but you mind doing a favour for me?

141
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,290
- Sure.
- OK.

142
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,075
Will you take some snapshots
around Paris with that for me?

143
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,495
You know how we have to maintain
our cover for our loved ones.

144
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,747
Well, my mom thinks
I run global IT services for the bank.

145
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,842
So I like to composite myself
into photographs for her.

146
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,597
Oh, I actually have an example right here.

147
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,839
There's me and the Sphinx.

148
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,510
Of course, I've never left
Southern California,

149
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,428
but every once in a while
I like to show my mom

150
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,853
all the places I've never really been to.

151
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,015
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

152
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:37,482
OK. Have a safe trip.
I don't like to fly, personally. But, uh...

153
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,237
That's why I'm here and you're...
I got some stuff to do.

154
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,672
Convoy's on the move. ETA five minutes.

155
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,888
- I'm right behind the truck.
- Copy that. I'm in position.

156
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,640
You know, it's a pity
we're travelling separately.

157
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,022
We could have used the opportunity
to get to know each other better.

158
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,234
Yeah, I'm broken up about that too.

159
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,943
You're surprisingly adept
at keeping your curiosity in check.

160
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,491
Don't flatter yourself.

161
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,573
I'm referring to the fact that your mother
and I worked together before I arrived here.

162
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,786
Before she went into hiding.

163
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,877
I learned a lot from her. In some ways
I think of her as a mother myself.

164
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,672
Listen to me.
You and I have nothing in common.

165
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
We're not friends.
We're not gonna become friends.

166
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,009
And you certainly won't bait me with stories
about a woman I never knew.

167
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,844
I don't get any consideration at all

168
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,601
for the fact that I didn't tell Sloane
that you conspired to kill him?

169
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,644
We've covered this. You can't expose me
without exposing yourself.

170
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,732
Now, I'm almost into
the city's traffic control network.

171
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,278
Get your head into the game.

172
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,713
How are your wounds healing?

173
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,800
You obviously had the chance
to betray us in Kashmir, but you didn't.

174
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,647
I don't imagine
that means you decided to trust me.

175
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:43,898
Our previous dealings would indicate
that your strategy here may be long-term,

176
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,276
so for now I trust
that your behaviour's predictable.

177
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,413
By "previous dealings"
you mean our marriage?

178
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:58,919
You know, technically,
we may still be husband and wife.

179
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,253
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,300
Sydney's on assignment with Sark.

181
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,964
It's my belief that he's still working for you,

182
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,015
that you've coordinated your efforts
to infiltrate both SD-6 and the CIA.

183
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:22,520
Whatever you have in mind,
I promise you it won't work.

184
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,317
So I'm going to offer you a deal.

185
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,614
I'll see to it that you're relocated
to a private residence on Puget Sound.

186
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,696
Under 24-hour surveillance, of course,

187
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,621
but the illusion of freedom
is better than none at all.

188
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,373
- In exchange?
- In exchange you'll confess.

189
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:45,505
Tell us what you're really doing here.
Why you've turned yourself in.

190
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,928
I'll give you time to consider my offer.

191
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,283
I see you. I'm turning the intersection red.

192
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,342
It is two-for-one day
here at Marshall's Tech Emporium.

193
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,807
Not only is this magnetic shape charge

194
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,801
capable of penetrating
two metres of armoured steel,

195
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,014
but, act now, it will also come equipped
with a secondary tear gas munition,

196
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,897
which will disable the guards
inside the truck.

197
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,058
Operators standing by. Hello.

198
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:53,277
- I'm moving in to disable the escort car.
- Copy that.

199
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:53,678
- It's empty. The terminal's not there.
- The truck's a decoy.

200
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,545
Get in the car.

201
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,421
- I got your message.
- Yes, Jack.

202
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,468
Come in. I want you to meet someone.

203
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,796
Jack Bristow, this is Ariana Kane.

204
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,143
Ms Kane is the head
of Alliance Counterintelligence.

205
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:29,056
She's the one
who plugged the leak last year at SD-9.

206
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,064
Impressive work,

207
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:34,279
particularly considering the guilty party
attempted to frame you as the mole.

208
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,531
Men always call women crazy
when they're caught with their pants down.

209
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,362
Ms Kane is here to investigate the events
leading up to Emily's disappearance

210
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,993
and the subsequent attempts
to blackmail me.

211
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,582
- How much have you shared with him?
- He knows everything I know.

212
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,833
I'm aware of your reputation
as a first-class strategist, Agent Bristow.

213
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,375
Tell me,
where would you begin this investigation?

214
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,628
With me.

215
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,714
Over the years, Arvin's trusted me with

216
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,965
everything I'd need to know
to be the perpetrator.

217
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,642
And if his standing within the Alliance
were undermined,

218
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,137
I'd be a candidate to inherit his seat.

219
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,150
- Motive.
- Well, that's a hell of an answer.

220
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,777
In addition to being true,

221
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,646
it's the only thing you can say to diminish
your viability as a suspect.

222
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,235
Not really.

223
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,611
Your obvious awareness of game theory
would invalidate my approach.

224
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,824
Therefore, the best course of action
for me to take, as a suspect,

225
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,747
is to simply tell the truth.

226
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,588
Well, as soon as you've officially eliminated

227
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,045
the possibility of Agent Bristow
as a suspect,

228
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,472
I'm sure he'll be quite happy
to assist you in your investigation.

229
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,761
Of course. If you'll excuse me.

230
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,602
- A pleasure.
- All mine.

231
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,731
You ever have the dream where
you're back at school

232
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:00,985
and they won't let you graduate
because you've failed a test?

233
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,985
I had that last night.

234
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,865
Well, we don't screen for general
knowledge. It's strictly a psych profile.

235
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,159
So I can't fail,
but I can find out I'm a sociopath.

236
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,034
Yeah. Listen, some of the questions on
the test may seem a little shocking.

237
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,873
- Shocking how?
- Well, like, things you might

238
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,211
punch someone out in a bar for asking.

239
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:25,091
I don't wanna get ahead of myself here,
but, um, if things go my way, what's next?

240
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,641
Well, you're cleared
to read classified documents

241
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,186
and you get a government salary.

242
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,897
- Which isn't much.
- Compared to what I make now, it's much.

243
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,312
Oh, and just be honest.

244
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,560
Cos if you're caught in a lie,
you're automatically disqualified.

245
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:40,227
And since we don't know
how often SD-6 keeps tabs on you,

246
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,530
it's too risky to take the test
at a federal building.

247
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,155
So we've arranged for you to go to
one of our operational fronts.

248
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,075
Now, when you get there,

249
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,949
the officer will lead you in the back room
where you'll take the test.

250
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,531
He'll tell you the shipping manifest
was lost in transit

251
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,535
and that he needs your help
to ID the parcel.

252
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,127
He'll take you in a back room,
and that's where you'll take the test.

253
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,720
Now, there's no time limit but
it shouldn't take you more than an hour.

254
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,886
I can't believe
some of the questions they asked.

255
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,097
It was, like, "If forced to choose,
who would your rather kill -

256
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,388
a) your mother, b) your father,
c) yourself?"

257
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,389
And "None of the above"
wasn't even an option.

258
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,762
I mean, what the hell does that measure?

259
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,183
How you see yourself
in relation to authority.

260
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,405
Basically, whether or not you'd be willing
to sacrifice your life for your country.

261
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,114
You know, that actually makes sense.

262
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,358
By the way, I got Francie season tickets
to the Hollywood Bowl

263
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,862
for her birthday from both of us.

264
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,029
Oh, great. Thank you.

265
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,707
You know,
she was right about what she said.

266
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,879
We used to tell each other everything.
Now I can't tell her anything.

267
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,299
I know. I hate it too.

268
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,055
But after Danny
and what happened to you,

269
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:50,974
I've accepted the fact that it's a gesture
of love to deceive the people I care about.

270
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,357
- Mm.
- What?

271
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,072
Hey, what are you doing here? Rita, right?

272
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,731
- Alice. Hi.
- Hi.

273
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,025
- Hey, Rita.
- Hey.

274
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,029
- This is Will.
- Hey.

275
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,411
- Hey. Michael. Nice to meet you.
- Michael. Nice to meet you.

276
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,073
- Hi. Alice.
- Hi.

277
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,078
Michael and I work together
at the State Department.

278
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,120
Oh, great.

279
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:23,128
- I was so sorry to hear about your dad.
- Oh, thank you.

280
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,719
Michael's been amazing.

281
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,427
He's an amazing guy.

282
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,434
Oh, Rita, we're gonna be late.

283
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,934
- We gotta go and meet friends. I'm sorry.
- It's no problem.

284
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,647
- It was nice running into you guys.
- You too.

285
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,319
- Bye.
- See you.

286
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,584
The Echelon access terminal
that you retrieved in Paris

287
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,630
was rigged with a boot sector fail-safe.

288
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:11,765
When we turned it on,
the hard drive was erased.

289
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,717
The good news is that Mr Cuvee
is no longer in possession of the terminal.

290
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:20,308
The bad news is that
he may still have a way to access Echelon.

291
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,398
One of Cuvee's men placed a call
to a data storage facility in London.

292
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,192
This facility caters to
high-end corporate clients.

293
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,283
It's likely
Cuvee duplicated the Echelon software

294
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,859
and had them stored
in a secure server there.

295
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,990
If he did, he could use them
to reverse-engineer a new terminal there.

296
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:40,661
Sydney, you'll acquire the files and
delete them from Cuvee's backup server.

297
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:45,416
Mr Sark has provided Marshall
with tech specs on the data storage facility.

298
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,501
Actually, um...
Yeah, actually, about that.

299
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,548
The facility's wired
with electronic countermeasures

300
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,805
and the computer's secured
via military-grade encryption,

301
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:56,976
so any decryption device or radio contact
would be detected.

302
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,101
So the only way the terminal
can be accessed

303
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:03,233
is by someone who knows how
to crack polymorphic algorithms.

304
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:07,150
My math skills may be above average, but
I can't do advanced calculus in my head.

305
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,690
That's why you're going in with Marshall.

306
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,234
Marshall who?

307
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,071
Wait a minute. What?

308
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,206
You're the only one qualified
to hack the server

309
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,787
without the aid of an electronic device.

310
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,879
But I can't go
because I'm not field-rated.

311
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,624
You will be by the time you leave.

312
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,005
Sark will help you review
the operational parameters,

313
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:33,257
and I'm sure
Sydney will take very good care of you.

314
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:43,938
We got your debrief. If Marshall succeeds
in copying those system files,

315
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,899
Sloane will be able
to reboot the Echelon terminal.

316
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,062
Marshall has a photographic memory.

317
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,906
Once the files flash across the screen,
he'll remember them.

318
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,154
- Yes. We know that.
- I can't just give SD-6 a fake Marshall.

319
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:01,452
- No, but we can pull him out of SD-6.
- What?

320
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,164
Devlin made it clear that we cannot,
under any circumstances,

321
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,045
allow SD-6 to access Echelon.

322
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,622
And sabotaging the mission
is too risky after Kashmir.

323
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:13,046
Sloane could start to suspect something.

324
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,803
We've considered every option, Syd.

325
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,596
There's no other way to do this.

326
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,142
When you and Marshall
return from London,

327
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,690
we'll take him into protective custody.

328
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,352
He'll be transported to Langley
for an extensive debrief.

329
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:36,400
As ridiculous as this sounds,
SD-6 is his whole life.

330
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,451
It's never easy finding out
everything you believe in is a lie.

331
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,911
We'll do whatever we can
to make it easier for him, I promise.

332
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,495
And when he adjusts,
he'll have the option to come work for us.

333
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,125
What about his mother?
Will they be able to make contact?

334
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:58,173
That'll be up to Marshall, but we can bring
her into protective custody too.

335
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,093
What's my cover story with Sloane?

336
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,592
As far as you'll know,
the mission went without a hitch

337
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,098
and you separated at the airport.

338
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,106
We'll intercept Marshall on his way home.

339
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:12,019
- I should pack.
- Listen. About the bar...

340
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,823
Did you see the security camera?

341
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,996
Yeah. We sent an agent to pull the tape
so we couldn't be tied together.

342
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,158
Good.

343
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:32,044
- Alice seems really nice.
- She said the same thing about you.

344
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,895
- How long have you known Arvin Sloane?
- For 30 years.

345
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,440
When we met
he was my superior at the CIA.

346
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:01,863
Yes. And once he left the CIA
he invited you to work with him at SD-6?

347
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,991
Yes. We were both disillusioned
with the US Government.

348
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,826
We'd both come to see it as corrupt.

349
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,994
And we believed then, as we do now,

350
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,670
that the Alliance would ultimately succeed
in achieving global dominance.

351
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,999
If you and Sloane have been so close
all these years,

352
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:19,173
why do you imagine he recruited your
daughter into SD-6 without telling you?

353
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,933
Because he knew
I would have been opposed to it.

354
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:26,180
Trust doesn't come easily to Arvin Sloane.

355
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,310
So while at the time
I may not have approved,

356
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,019
I now accept that he recruited Sydney

357
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,276
to ensure that he'd never
have to take my loyalty on faith.

358
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,731
You're asking me to believe that
Sloane took your daughter hostage

359
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,567
to ensure your friendship?

360
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:45,697
In our line of work we can't just cry foul
when things don't go our way.

361
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:56,082
With whom have you had intimate contact
over the past ten years, Agent Bristow?

362
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,460
I'm curious to know
where you're going with this.

363
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,590
More secrets have been revealed through
pillow talk than through torture.

364
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,016
If there's a prostitute
or a stewardess out there

365
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:10,017
you think may have heard you talking
in your sleep, I need to know about it.

366
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,728
There is one way for you to verify

367
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,984
if my nocturnal activities are
a security risk, Ms Kane,

368
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:19,938
but somehow
I think we'd both prefer the torture.

369
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,988
What happened to that gentleman
I met in Sloane's office this morning?

370
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,533
He got tired of your baseless accusations.

371
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,163
Good.

372
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:39,296
I don't trust anyone who doesn't have the
sense to when know he's being insulted.

373
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,793
Are we through?

374
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,558
Yes. For now.

375
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:03,487
APU, set. Aft cargo heat, set.
Hydraulic pumps, set.

376
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,739
Marshall, what are you doing?

377
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,031
Oh, I patched in to in-flight phone network
and logged on to the on-board computer.

378
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:13,283
Just wanna make sure the pilots don't
miss anything in the preflight check list.

379
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,920
What was that?

380
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,709
Flaps extending.
Totally routine. Totally routine.

381
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,210
Is this really your first time on a plane?

382
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,547
Yeah. I couldn't sleep last night so I
memorised the FAA 747 flight ops manual.

383
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,346
Whoa.

384
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,551
What the heck? Sorry. Sorry.

385
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,968
Just a little nervous.

386
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,732
Marshall, you're sweating.
Maybe you should take your jacket off.

387
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,223
No. No way. No way.

388
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,153
I compressed
a high glide tactical parachute

389
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,064
in the lining of my jacket just in case.

390
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,825
Don't worry, though,
my belt hyperextends into a tandem sling.

391
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,826
Just loop it around your waist,
it'll hold us both.

392
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,448
Thanks.

393
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:55,209
You don't have to thank me.
It's my job to keep you safe.

394
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,714
What was that? That's not a plane sound.
That could be bad.

395
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,174
Marshall.

396
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,222
Oh, a little kid playing a dee-dee, dee-dee.

397
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,808
Is he... Is that all right?
Is he allowed to... on board play the...

398
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:17,392
You're not supposed to...
Can I get a ginger ale?

399
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,776
I don't think I've ever seen you look
quite so handsome, my darling.

400
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,539
And you look lovely, my dear.

401
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,497
- Shall we?
- We shall.

402
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,330
Oh, this is so cool.

403
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,624
Hey. How's it going? Good to see you.

404
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:48,551
Hey. How's it going?
How you doing? Nice to see you.

405
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,724
The key to doing this right -
be inconspicuous.

406
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,886
Right. Sorry. I'm just...

407
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,063
- Hey.
- You don't need to say hello to everybody.

408
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:00,648
Box seats have been reserved for you
at Royal Hall behind this man.

409
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,226
Thatcher Powell,
Cuvee's head of IT security,

410
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:06,275
and the only man with
access to his secure server.

411
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,651
Powell attends the London Philharmonic
every third Saturday of the month,

412
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,781
and takes in the performance
with a bottle of Cristal.

413
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,583
Um...

414
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,374
You know, Bach is my favourite composer.

415
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,755
- Are you speaking to me?
- Yes.

416
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:34,182
I bet you didn't know that the last piece
of music that Bach ever composed,

417
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,389
he encoded his name
into the musical notes.

418
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,980
He certainly was the most ingenious
composer of the Baroque movement.

419
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,899
I always say if it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.

420
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,609
Pardon my husband.
He does tend to prattle on.

421
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,106
Sorry.

422
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:55,540
Once Powell ingests the Scopolamine,
it'll take effect in roughly five minutes.

423
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:01,577
The idea is to make Powell believe he
merely fell asleep, so the dose will be mild.

424
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:05,372
That means, once you steal the access
card, get across town to the server facility,

425
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:10,129
download the Echelon software and return
the key to his pocket before intermission.

426
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:13,887
There will be a car waiting for you
out front.

427
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,428
Oh, thank goodness you're still open.
I'm Marie Robinson.

428
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,803
- This is my associate, Frederick Fields.
- Hello.

429
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,849
We work for Jennings Aerospace.

430
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,727
The New York office just paged me
at the symphony.

431
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:04,309
Our CFO's laptop was stolen. We need
access to our backup server right away.

432
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,274
May I have your corporate PIN number,
please?

433
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,069
86119.

434
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:13,610
- You're on server 13. Second floor.
- Thank you.

435
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,868
- We won't be more than ten minutes.
- Cheerio.

436
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,410
SD-6 has opened an account
at the data storage facility

437
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,408
under the name Jennings Aerospace.

438
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,659
Your client status
will get you past the desk guard,

439
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,244
and the security staff
will be reduced for the night shift.

440
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,047
Since Cuvee is justifiably paranoid,

441
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,458
he's leased out the entire third floor
as his own.

442
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:34,003
You'll need to break into the third floor
to access the server.

443
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:37,300
Syd, you were amazing.
You were acting, spying...

444
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,227
- You ready to do your magic?
- Yeah, me? I'm ready for anything.

445
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,680
How did you get up here?
This area's restricted.

446
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,028
Sir, you're gonna have to come with us.

447
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,743
Syd, I've been shot. Oh, my God.

448
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,292
Syd, I've been shot.
I'm shot. Oh, my God.

449
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,085
- Marshall.
- Oh, my God.

450
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,955
Wait. It's just a trank dart. It's OK.
I pulled it out before you got a full dose.

451
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,674
Thank God for the British
and their anti-gun laws, right?

452
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,752
Are you OK?

453
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:16,087
- I'm OK. I'm OK.
- What were you saying to those guards?

454
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,098
I think I said "I can smell you from here."
In Ewok.

455
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,512
Ewok?

456
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:24,765
Official language of the indigenous
creatures on the planet Endor.

457
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:29,814
I think I peed myself a little. I mean,
not a lot, just, like, a little squirt.

458
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:33,485
Marshall. Stay with me. Stay with me.

459
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,779
- I'm OK.
- You OK? You sure?

460
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,699
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm just a little...
Let's walk. I can walk.

461
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,835
OK. OK.

462
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,787
Hang on. Hang on there. Hang on.

463
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,455
- Twenty....
- OK.

464
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,211
- Three.
- OK, stay awake.

465
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,628
Stay awake. Stay awake.
Come on. Come on.

466
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,635
Stay awake. Stay awake.
Stay awake. Stay awake.

467
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,312
Marshall, focus.

468
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,436
I love you.

469
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:14,862
The Echelon software is on this computer.
You have to access it. I'll do the rest.

470
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:19,491
- OK, OK, OK. I got it.
- Go.

471
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:22,329
I got it. So...

472
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,668
- Marshall.
- Hm?

473
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,252
Mama.

474
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,389
Accounting for the relevant state
during key generation

475
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,681
and the crypto compiler combined
with the pseudo random number generator

476
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,595
will give you a password.

477
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,812
Marshall, you're a genius.

478
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,573
Thank you so much.

479
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,164
Goodness, I must have dozed off.

480
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,963
Well, you certainly weren't the only one.

481
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:55,126
And you know
the light is fading all too soon

482
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,335
- So this car will take you home.
- Thanks.

483
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,298
Hey, you think the driver
will take the scenic route home?

484
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,639
I've got this unbelievable film strip
running in my head,

485
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:08,347
and the thing I still can't believe is
that we're the stars.

486
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:12,849
I just wanna watch it a couple more times
before I go back to my room.

487
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,186
- Sure.
- Hey.

488
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:20,528
At least I got some real pictures of London
to show to the folks back home now.

489
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:28,990
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls

490
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:35,369
And there's nothing wrong
but there is something more

491
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,003
Marshall.

492
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:49,092
- See you soon, OK?
- OK.

493
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,262
Hey, you know the best part?

494
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,360
I've never been prouder
to be one of the good guys.

495
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:09,780
Is how it falls, how it falls, how it falls

496
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,790
Yeah, Mom, I'll be home in a little while.

497
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:22,507
I'm just getting back
from my big business trip in London.

498
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:25,215
Mom, of course they fed me on the plane.

499
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,005
I don't know. It was some sort of chicken
or squid. Wait, hold on a second.

500
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,642
Um, actually, could you make
a left right there?

501
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,601
There's a nightclub I wanna drop by.

502
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,782
What's going on?

503
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:47,191
Surprise.

504
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:52,531
This is why you shut up
when I walked in the room.

505
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,700
Happy birthday.

506
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,456
- I love you so.
- Happy birthday, sweetie.

507
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:03,218
Oh, my God.

508
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,733
Jack Bristow's not the man responsible
for blackmailing me.

509
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,226
His answers are too perfect. Hm?

510
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,073
I mean, he even gets angry
when it makes strategic sense.

511
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,992
If if he had nothing to do with it,
I would expect his answers to be perfect.

512
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,904
Now, Ariana, unless you have evidence...

513
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,905
Contrary to what you tell
your subordinates,

514
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,456
we are not the US Government.

515
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:39,001
I don't need probable cause
to go after Bristow. All I need is a hunch.

516
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,123
Well, your hunches notwithstanding,

517
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:44,920
you're talking about a man with whom
I've been partner for 30 years.

518
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,714
You have a blind spot
when it comes to him.

519
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:50,509
Look, he's not the first suspect
I interviewed.

520
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,757
I talked to all the other heads
of the SD cells,

521
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,768
people who might have taken issue
with your promotion to the Alliance.

522
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:59,187
You know what I found?
They're all afraid of you.

523
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:01,765
Except for Jack Bristow.

524
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,854
Who, I promise you, is hiding something.

525
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,287
Have you thought about my offer?

526
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:30,422
I have nothing to confess, Jack.

527
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:34,132
I know you find it hard to believe I'd turn
myself in to make up for my mistakes.

528
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,716
But that's the reason.

529
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:41,773
The only reason I'm here.

530
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:44,645
If that's the truth,
why didn't you simply refuse the offer?

531
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:49,362
I was considering whether or not
to fabricate a confession

532
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,366
just to get out of this cell.

533
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:56,069
You were right.

534
00:40:56,164 --> 00:41:00,909
Although our marital contract
was founded on fraudulent pretences,

535
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,920
it's still valid until it's annulled.

536
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,090
Which means, technically,
we are still married.

537
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,921
Jack.

538
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:18,726
Thus far I've agreed
to be debriefed only by Sydney.

539
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,607
From now on, I'm willing to talk to you too.

540
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:41,241
Vaughn here.

541
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,457
What do you mean, we didn't pick up
Marshall at the intercept point? Who did?

542
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:58,384
Oh, my God.

543
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:04,104
Please don't hurt me, mister.
Mister, please.

544
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,938
Please don't hurt me. Please.

545
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,068
Tell me, how did you enjoy the symphony?
