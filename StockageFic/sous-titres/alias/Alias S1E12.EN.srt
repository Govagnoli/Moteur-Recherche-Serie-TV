1
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,778
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,448
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth,
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,377
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,630
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:34,969
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA,
where my handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:41,392
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,729
My father.

12
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:50,901
- Hi. I'm Will Tippin.
- David McNeil.

13
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,654
- Why are we here?
- I'm researching something.

14
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,322
It's called SD-6.

15
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:58,409
I don't have anything to say
about that.

16
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,412
Why don't you just tell me
what you know?

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,791
It's been a mystery within
the agency for over two decades,

18
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,462
who murdered those CIA officers.
We have our answer now.

19
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,673
It was your father.

20
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,925
And I'm going to report him.

21
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:18,804
Those Cyrillic codes you found
in those books,

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,141
yes, they were orders from the KGB,

23
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:25,811
and, yes, they were orders to kill.

24
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,481
Including your father, Mr Vaughn.

25
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,650
But, Sydney, I was not that agent.

26
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,987
Your mother was.

27
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,873
Sydney.

28
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,292
Wait.

29
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,505
- Don't lose control over this.
- This is no time to lecture me.

30
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:54,298
- I know how it feels.
- No.

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,967
You've had a lot longer
to make sense of this.

32
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,429
There was a time
when this was news to me, too.

33
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,683
Your mother was sent
to the United States

34
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,853
to steal secrets from
a ranking officer of the CIA.

35
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:10,481
How she and I happened to meet,

36
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,650
how she supposedly fell in love...

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,695
...I thought it was all true.

38
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,824
But it was just a setup.

39
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:25,871
Even her wanting to have a family?
Was that just part of the plan, too?

40
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:59,822
TWO DIE IN IC Y COLLISION

41
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,959
Something happens when you
discover the truth about someone.

42
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,753
I know a little about this.

43
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,969
The truth changes everything.

44
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:27,391
There's this woman.

45
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:31,896
A personality, like a collage
I've put together,

46
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,316
from the photographs
and the few memories I have.

47
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,818
The scraps of stories I've heard.

48
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:40,738
The clothes of hers I've got.

49
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,200
Her books.

50
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,748
And none of it's real.

51
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,880
She wasn't that woman at all,
she was...

52
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,008
She was a horrible person...

53
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,556
...who killed your father.

54
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,773
Vaughn, I just wanted to say...

55
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,612
...that I'm so sorry.

56
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:20,379
- We've lost coverage on the garage.
- Any signs of forced entry?

57
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:24,925
Negative from gate control.
I'll check it out.

58
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,803
While you're at it,
grab me a coffee. Two sugars.

59
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,329
You know about any AC repairs?

60
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,167
Negative.

61
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:15,476
- I don't want this job any more.
- That's why your doing what you do.

62
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,728
You're helping bring an end to SD-6.

63
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:20,481
- Not any more.
- Sydney.

64
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,067
I need someone in my life to be real.

65
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,444
This, right here,
what we do, is real.

66
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:29,031
Look where we are. This isn't real.

67
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,576
This isn't what we should be doing.

68
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,621
- I want out.
- Out?

69
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:45,047
- You want the protection programme?
- No. I'm not going to hide.

70
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:49,301
- If you don't, Sloane will kill you.
- I don't think he will.

71
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,395
- You like hockey? The Kings?
- Yeah. How'd you...?

72
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:02,273
The pen in your briefcase.
It's a Kings' pen.

73
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,943
- Yeah, I got that...
- They play the Islanders next week.

74
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,863
We should go.

75
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:16,537
Sydney, you can't do this.

76
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,756
Here's the appeal filed
by McNeil's lawyer last year.

77
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,594
I found out that SD-6 is an
ingredient in artificial sweeteners.

78
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,473
But that's probably not the SD-6
you're talking about.

79
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,017
- Does my voice annoy you?
- Your voice?

80
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,312
I was going over this interview
with Eloise Kurtz.

81
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,982
I thought of McNeil. He had a look
in his eyes as I interviewed him.

82
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,734
His lawyer was the same.

83
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:49,779
You're a journalist.
You get paid to be annoying.

84
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:52,573
- So, I'm annoying?
- Not to Danny or Eloise Kurtz.

85
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:55,367
- Not to dead people?
- You're their champion.

86
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,453
What if I'm hurting these people?

87
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:01,791
If I could bring back Danny
and Eloise, I would. But I can't.

88
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,126
And if championing them
is going to cause

89
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,088
David McNeil's daughter to be
in danger, I can't live with that.

90
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:12,676
I don't think I can do this
any more, this SD-6 story.

91
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,931
I'm out.

92
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:33,864
Right on time.

93
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,979
How do I look?

94
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:38,596
Yes, will you get me my wife's
doctor on the phone, please?

95
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:50,107
Dr Mendelson is on line one.

96
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:00,868
Sir?

97
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:19,637
Hey there, beautiful. Why don't you
turn that frown upside down?

98
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:20,573
Sydney.

99
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,995
- This is suicide.
- I don't think so.

100
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,497
What exactly is your exit strategy?

101
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:31,834
Politely asking Sloane
to let you out of SD-6?

102
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:36,213
Based on his behaviour, protecting me
in Denati Park, assaulting Russek...

103
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:40,926
Sloane answers to people. People
who don't know or care about you.

104
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,305
If he lets you go, those people
will eliminate him, and you.

105
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,813
Cole.

106
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,779
The people Sloane works for,
the Alliance.

107
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:03,657
If you abandon them, they'll kill
anyone they think you've talked to.

108
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:08,120
Your roommate, Francie. That
reporter friend of yours. Anyone.

109
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,005
Let me guess,
you forgot the two sugars.

110
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,889
We have a physical breach.
Start lockdown procedure.

111
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,307
Sure thing, Arvin.

112
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,602
Whatever you say.

113
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,313
I felt this way
before I learned about my mother.

114
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,273
This life has to stop.

115
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:16,313
Dead. But a blackout
wouldn't shut down security.

116
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:41,338
- Tippin.
- Go to your desk.

117
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,301
I'm off the story.

118
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,220
Leave the bathroom
and go to your desk.

119
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:07,239
Will Tippin's office.

120
00:14:07,323 --> 00:14:10,451
Yeah, he's right here.
Some guy, totally nasal.

121
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:15,539
Clips on the housing story. Litvack
wants 2,000 words by noon tomorrow.

122
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,753
Hello?

123
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:24,715
There's something inside
the envelope to make McNeil talk.

124
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,344
- I don't wanna make him talk.
- You said you didn't scare easily.

125
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:32,431
If you're so brave, lose
the voice box and tell me your name.

126
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,976
Don't call me again.

127
00:14:56,413 --> 00:15:00,084
Five minutes ahead.
Get 'em wrapped up, baby.

128
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:08,217
Chopper, secure the elevator. Have
you got the scanning-room door code?

129
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,969
Got it.

130
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:18,018
You will stay down.

131
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:21,021
- You jammin'?
- I'm jammin'.

132
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,157
Wanna get a pizza? That new place?

133
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,325
No, thanks.

134
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:50,217
Sydney wants to quit SD-6.

135
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,970
Which she knows she just can't do.

136
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:03,773
It's a weird thing, you know,
learning how your father died.

137
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:09,361
It's always been this intellectual
idea I had, knowing he died,

138
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:13,616
just not having any details.

139
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,536
You want some space,
or are we gonna get drunk?

140
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,706
There's this bar,
you won't even remember it tomorrow.

141
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:28,172
- What a day.
- Why do you say that?

142
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:32,343
Come on. Bristow's mom? Your dad?
It's no secret round here.

143
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,220
Vaughn, it really sucks.

144
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,099
- Well put.
- Barnett's gonna be good for you.

145
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:41,268
- I'm not seeing Barnett.
- You are. She wants to see you.

146
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:46,107
Come on. You're Bristow's handler.
You hear her mom killed your dad.

147
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,193
She's a shrink.
She lives for crisis management.

148
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,529
I think she'll be good for you.

149
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,366
I like thick crust,
if you want me to come.

150
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,659
We don't.

151
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,501
Did you know about Barnett?

152
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:14,635
Still can't get a signal.

153
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:18,931
Whoever's down there
could be jamming the frequencies.

154
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,018
Emergency lockdown procedures.

155
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:28,441
The elevator is returning to SD-6.
The doors will automatically open.

156
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,304
Elevator secure.

157
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,686
The advantages
of high-level clearance. Let's go.

158
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:06,705
How could K-Directorate
overpower 50 trained agents?

159
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,752
If K-Directorate attacks SD-6, they
know SD-6 will return the favour.

160
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:15,965
The team that's invaded SD-6 isn't
working for any organisation we know.

161
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,135
My guess is
they're working for a group,

162
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,804
clearly unpredictable and dangerous.

163
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,807
Hand me that cable.

164
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,394
Now plug it in.

165
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:47,329
There are 600 cameras
hidden throughout SD-6.

166
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:48,706
Oh, my God.

167
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,880
- Look at that hardware.
- Latest military spec.

168
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:59,800
Extended magazines,
compensators, laser sights.

169
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:04,638
- I see four.
- And there's a fifth.

170
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,528
I wanna talk to you.
That's the sick part.

171
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:23,407
Catch up and stuff. So much
has happened these last five years.

172
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,952
And this place, it hasn't changed.

173
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:30,372
But you, you look...

174
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,751
...older.

175
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:38,923
But that's good.
Your hair... looks good.

176
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:44,512
You know what the worst part is?

177
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:49,809
Being left for dead in Grozny,
Arvin?

178
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:52,978
Well, you're going to learn
the worst part.

179
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:56,982
But another part that sucks
is seeing guys you worked with,

180
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,319
guys you thought
were tougher than deer jerky,

181
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:03,155
tortured to death.

182
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,783
That's no good.

183
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:11,038
The most ironical part for me
is we did the damn job.

184
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:16,001
We blew that pipeline to hell
first night we landed.

185
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,170
But you know me, Arvin.

186
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,714
- You know this guy?
- I know the operation.

187
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,261
Sloane sent a team to Chechnya
to destroy the Shali Oil Pipeline.

188
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:29,014
There were complications.
They were captured by the Russians.

189
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:34,061
And if that chopper had been where
you know it should have been...

190
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:40,317
...my whole life would have taken
a different direction.

191
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,778
What do you want?

192
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:47,867
I got this really kick-ass new job.

193
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,370
See, I'm working for
this gentleman they call The Man.

194
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:55,916
You will learn about The Man.
What The Man wants

195
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
is a certain little something.
Something you got in the SD-6 vault.

196
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:03,549
Well, you initiated lockdown.

197
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:07,428
Not only is the vault secure,

198
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:10,139
the vault access room
is locked now, too.

199
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:14,101
Don't worry about the vault access
room, we're taking care of that.

200
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:17,938
What I need is the combination
to the vault.

201
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,196
Not a chance.

202
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:29,825
That's cool.

203
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:35,873
You still got that room downstairs?
The conversation room?

204
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:38,959
That's what you used to call it,
right?

205
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:43,756
"Torture room" is like you admit
what you're doing down there.

206
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:49,929
So, Arvin, let's go
to the conversation room.

207
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,477
Check this.
People victimised by a developer,

208
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,231
using his political connections
to have their homes condemned.

209
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:02,566
We go in, shed light on the subject,

210
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,027
protect the little guy,
no one gets hurt.

211
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:07,530
I have to go interview
the developer now.

212
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:10,449
- So, no more McNeil?
- No.

213
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:13,577
Interesting.

214
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,133
- Hiya.
- Hi.

215
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,719
- Michael Vaughn, we've met.
- I remember. Judy Barnett.

216
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,680
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

217
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:35,683
- You got my voicemail?
- Yeah.

218
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:40,146
I have nothing against shrinks.

219
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:42,356
Well, good.

220
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,900
But I think this might be
a waste of time.

221
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:47,778
You know we've learned
that Sydney Bristow's mother

222
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:50,531
was a KGB agent
who killed my father, among others.

223
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:54,910
- Yes.
- Which is not ideal news, obviously.

224
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:58,622
And, yes, it's emotional,
but I already knew he was killed.

225
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:01,542
And it happened almost 20 years ago.

226
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:05,087
So, I really don't think
I require crisis management.

227
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:07,006
There's no crisis.

228
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:10,593
Everything you say to me
I will keep confidential.

229
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,388
OK.

230
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:18,851
I wanted to talk to you about
your relationship with Ms Bristow.

231
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:22,104
How often do you meet with Sydney?

232
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,025
Couple of times a week.
Three or four, sometimes.

233
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:28,611
Only about operations?

234
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:33,574
We have met on occasions,
when Sydney wanted to talk to me

235
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:36,952
about what was happening in SD-6,
or regarding her father,

236
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:40,039
when she believed
he was a KGB agent, not her mother.

237
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:42,166
You and Sydney have a friendship?

238
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,879
She needs someone to talk to,
you'll appreciate that.

239
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:49,089
I'm the only person
she can confide in.

240
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:54,095
You feel your relationship with
Ms Bristow is fully appropriate,

241
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,140
that it falls within
the guidelines of agent and handler?

242
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:00,476
What are you asking me?

243
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,479
I have gotten reports
about your behaviour...

244
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:05,022
Reports? From who?

245
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:08,359
After the incident in Tuscany
when you sent in a team

246
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:12,196
to protect Sydney... I've been
following your work, mostly good.

247
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,281
Thank you. That's very nice.

248
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:17,868
Did you purchase a Christmas present
for Agent Bristow?

249
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:32,925
I am not familiar, Dr Barnett,
with the regulations...

250
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:36,470
...preventing officers
from observing with co-workers

251
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:39,557
a widely recognised holiday
such as Christmas.

252
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,144
- May I ask what the gift was?
- Tell me who's been reporting me.

253
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:46,856
- I can't do that.
- Then I'm going to have to guess.

254
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:51,110
Endo, what's up?
Where are we? I need status.

255
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:56,740
Almost done drilling.
Then we'll start packing explosives.

256
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:04,874
Those other two,
where the hell did they go?

257
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,967
We'll be in the vault in 10 minutes.

258
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,180
- What do they want from the vault?
- Could be anything.

259
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:21,432
Why was Sloane
sending you to Taiwan?

260
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:24,935
FTL acquired scud launchers.
I'm to scramble their launch codes.

261
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,272
- Marshall's working on a device.
- He showed it me last week.

262
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,024
- What does it look like?
- Why?

263
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,902
Sloane has activated
the emergency fail-safe.

264
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:37,323
There are 500 pounds of C4
within this building's substructure.

265
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,909
Opening the vault
will trigger that C4.

266
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:42,620
All underground levels will collapse,

267
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:46,707
burying any evidence that the Los
Angeles cell of SD-6 ever existed.

268
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,084
You want to scramble the vault codes.

269
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,180
Can you see the scrambler
in Marshall's office?

270
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:03,974
There. It's that compact on his desk.

271
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,893
It's not far from the air vent.

272
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:08,813
But getting into his office
is too much of a risk.

273
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,900
So, then...

274
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:17,279
...we fish for it.

275
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:21,992
They took us to their base
in Khankala.

276
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,122
And after 38 straight days
of beatings,

277
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:28,457
they finally began interrogating me.

278
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,918
They took me into a room.

279
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:33,337
They tied me to a chair.

280
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,424
They asked me questions
about Islamic rebels

281
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:39,468
and where they kept Russian POWs.

282
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:42,763
I told them, "I'm just a kid
from Redondo Beach

283
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:47,810
running black ops for Uncle Sam.
Get it? I'm an American citizen."

284
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:52,690
Well, that senior Russian officer,
he didn't want any of that action.

285
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:56,610
He had the KGB contact Langley,
through front and back channels.

286
00:27:56,694 --> 00:27:59,864
CIA claimed
they'd never heard of me.

287
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,408
They denied all knowledge

288
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:06,036
of any operative
by the name of McKenas Cole.

289
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:12,418
So, when that Russian got off
the phone, he was so pissed.

290
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:15,880
He was so insane with rage.

291
00:28:18,674 --> 00:28:21,427
That was when he showed me this.
Baby.

292
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:38,152
Watch the security feeds. If I'm
caught, get out as fast as you can.

293
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:40,279
Wait! You're not doing this.

294
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:41,697
- Of course I am.
- No.

295
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,284
You'll have to crawl through
a maze of shafts to the scrambler,

296
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,953
get to the vault,
then scramble the code,

297
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:51,624
in under ten minutes.
No offence, but, Dad, I'm doing this.

298
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:56,128
Get to the vault and use
the scrambler, and stay low.

299
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,047
I know how to use the scrambler.

300
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,425
I can't believe, of all things,
we're saving SD-6.

301
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:25,491
Want to see what's inside?

302
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:28,494
I know you do.

303
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:31,038
I'll open it.

304
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:34,500
Want me to?

305
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:44,176
You're going to give me
the combination to the SD-6 vault.

306
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,180
And if you don't,
I'm going to open this box.

307
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:53,519
And, Arvin,
trust me when I tell you...

308
00:29:54,728 --> 00:30:00,025
...you do not want me
to open this box.

309
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,169
- Will Tippin?
- Yeah.

310
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:21,505
Thank God. You're the third guy
I've introduced myself to.

311
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,674
Maitre d' is giving me an evil look.

312
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:28,053
I'm sorry, are you with
Carla D'Angelo's office?

313
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:31,432
- Who?
- The developer.

314
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,642
The woman
I'm supposed to meet here.

315
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:37,146
On my voicemail you said you were
doing a story about my dad.

316
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:38,814
About your dad?

317
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:41,150
Yeah. David McNeil.

318
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,327
I...

319
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,997
I never called you.
Now, I don't know what you know...

320
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,459
With my father? I know everything.

321
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:02,171
- Well, we never talked.
- OK, maybe, but we're talking now.

322
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,673
No, this, here, this never happened.

323
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,635
Your dad, I don't know him,
he seems like a good guy.

324
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:09,261
He's the best.

325
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:12,932
I think he knows what's best
and he does not want us talking.

326
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:14,475
Who does?

327
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:17,269
Goodbye.

328
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:27,321
What's your problem, Haladki?
Reporting me?

329
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:28,948
No, you have the problem.

330
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:31,659
This might shock you
but my business isn't yours.

331
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,120
- I'm looking out for the agency.
- Then quit.

332
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:35,663
Stay out of my way.

333
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:38,582
Did you feel good
saying I got Sydney a gift?

334
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:42,419
- You're too attached to her.
- Like you'd know anything about it.

335
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:45,172
- Your judgement's impaired.
- I'll kick your ass.

336
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:49,051
- You're out of line.
- You are. Stay out of my operations.

337
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:51,846
Who's out of control, Vaughn? Me?

338
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:54,181
Did you see that? Everyone see that?

339
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,851
That's what I'm talking about.

340
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,485
No, come on.

341
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,417
Explosives in place.
Activating detonator.

342
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,973
- We're in.
- Excellent!

343
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:42,892
Arvin, here's the deal.

344
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:46,061
We are in the vault. Two things.

345
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:51,108
One, you don't give us the codes,
we got the tech to get in anyway.

346
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,444
It'll just take a while.

347
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:57,531
And two, you give us the codes,
I won't have to open the box,

348
00:34:57,615 --> 00:35:00,743
which would be
really excellent for you.

349
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:06,207
Am I the first person to have
difficulty taking you seriously?

350
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:12,379
Well, while that was
a moderately clever retort...

351
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:17,009
...l'm the man holding the box.

352
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,398
Have you ever regretted being born?

353
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:39,990
That's a pretty thing to experience.

354
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:46,288
Regret at having emerged
from your mother's womb.

355
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:49,083
I mean, I've had some dark days,

356
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,253
but nothing close to
regretting the day I was born.

357
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,713
Until I met...

358
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:59,260
...Ahgneh-niyeh Eeg-li.

359
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:04,140
Needles of fire.

360
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,994
No, Sydney, don't.

361
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:06,619
Good.

362
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,854
We need help here.
This guy's having a seizure.

363
00:37:33,938 --> 00:37:36,398
Ice! Where the hell are you?

364
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:50,538
I heard something back there.
I'll go check it out.

365
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:56,210
Oh, no. Excuse me.

366
00:37:56,293 --> 00:38:00,840
As luck would have it, I'm feeling a
Stockholm Syndrome thing happening.

367
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:19,984
There's this Cajun food place
in Abita Springs, Louisiana.

368
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,654
It's called Rocquemore's.
You know what they're famous for?

369
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,948
Making people cry.

370
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:28,868
You know what makes them cry?
The hot sauce.

371
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,579
No one knows
how they get that crap so hot.

372
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:34,707
Legend has it that the devil
comes by once a month

373
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,542
and spits in their frying pan.

374
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,586
The point being,

375
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,592
the hot sauce at Rocquemore's is
like a fluffy vanilla ice-cream cone

376
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:47,845
when compared to what's in these.

377
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,808
Each one is like you took
a bag of red jalapenos,

378
00:38:52,892 --> 00:38:55,686
threw 'em in a blender,

379
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,772
and used them for an enema.

380
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:03,694
And, Arvin,
you're about to get to know 'em.

381
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:14,705
These needles,
they're a whole lotta no fun.

382
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,430
Wait.

383
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:35,810
You have to have a pen.

384
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,530
I know you said
you don't want to talk, but...

385
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:51,534
- I want to. I don't think we should.
- Fine. Whatever. Then just listen.

386
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,915
What I said before about knowing
everything, that's not true, OK?

387
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,626
I don't know what SD-6 is,
and I don't know why

388
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,754
the people who are a part of it
destroyed my life.

389
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:09,260
All I do know is that they killed
my mother. And framed my father.

390
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:12,346
Every time I say that, it's like,

391
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,433
do people really exist
who do things like that?

392
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:19,228
And if so, isn't it our obligation
to do something about it?

393
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:22,022
Not if it means
more innocent people get hurt.

394
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:24,191
Which is why I'm here.

395
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:27,236
You see, I know my dad won't talk

396
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:30,781
because he's afraid of what
will happen to me if he does.

397
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:34,827
- Yeah.
- Robert Stoller, my godfather,

398
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,206
he knows people who can send me
away, where they'll never find me.

399
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,418
I'll be safe, so my dad
won't have to be afraid any more.

400
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,921
I can go now, tomorrow,

401
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:49,884
whenever I know that
someone's fighting for my father.

402
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:53,512
So, please, if you can...

403
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:56,682
...just help my father.

404
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,437
Please.

405
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:41,936
Eight, five,

406
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,397
nine, three.

407
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,942
And three.

408
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,282
Now, it takes the powder
a few minutes to kick in.

409
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:57,535
I can always take it out.

410
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:01,038
So, Arvin, why don't you
give us the real combination?

411
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,937
Where are you?

412
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:30,961
Three.

413
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,465
- Access denied.
- Sloane!

414
00:43:56,987 --> 00:43:58,239
Target out of range.

415
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:01,909
Go get 'em.
