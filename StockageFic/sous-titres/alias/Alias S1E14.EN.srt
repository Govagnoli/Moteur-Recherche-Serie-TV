1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,648
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,820
Seven years ago, I was recruited by a
secret branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:14,532
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:18,035
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,124
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,418
I had been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,672
So I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:34,969
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,639
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,475
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,019
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,771
My father.

13
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:51,277
Francie... will you marry me?

14
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,822
Yes. Yes, Charlie, I will!

15
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,287
You said you were working on a story
about my dad, David McNeil?

16
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:06,876
My dad won't talk. He's afraid of
what will happen to me if he does.

17
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,295
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go away. Now,

18
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:13,257
tomorrow, whenever I know
someone is fighting for my father.

19
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:15,384
So, please,

20
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,304
just help my father.

21
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:24,560
I was on covert duty, penetrating
Cole's intelligence network.

22
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:26,270
Cole?

23
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:28,814
McKenas Cole,

24
00:01:29,982 --> 00:01:31,776
former SD-6.

25
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,904
Now he works
for someone he calls The Man.

26
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:37,490
- Is that perfume?
- Whatever it is,

27
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:40,618
we have it now and they don't.
Because of you.

28
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,746
- Not just me.
- Because of you.

29
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:34,421
This is surveillance footage from
outside Tyno-Chem Engineering.

30
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:38,384
Which, as you know, is the front
company for FTL headquarters.

31
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,929
You may recognise
the man on the ground as Quan Li.

32
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,140
Wait, Quan Li was assassinated?

33
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,058
- The head of FTL?
- Yes.

34
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,353
His security detail was ambushed
inside the building,

35
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,647
leaving Li utterly defenceless.

36
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,401
- Have you ID'd the shooter?
- He's not in any of our databases.

37
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:59,447
- He doesn't mind being photographed.
- This man led a commando unit

38
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,118
into FTL headquarters at precisely
the same time we were attacked here.

39
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:07,913
The objective was the same.
To steal a Rambaldi artefact.

40
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:13,419
Their agent roster was compromised
and their network crumbled in hours.

41
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,754
You're saying FTL no longer exists?

42
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,467
Sorry, stupid question, but...

43
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:24,180
...since FTL is, sorry,
was an enemy for ever,

44
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,348
why aren't we drinking champagne?

45
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:30,102
Someone was able to launch
a unilateral attack on us and FTL,

46
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,104
and we haven't got a clue who.

47
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,524
And they now have
the most significant collection

48
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:38,027
of Rambaldi artefacts in the world.

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,656
Maybe enough to uncover what
Rambaldi was working on before us.

50
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:47,745
Yeah, that does suck.

51
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,625
It doesn't end there. Our Vladivostok
assets intercepted a communiqué.

52
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:57,046
A group claiming responsibility for
the attacks contacted K-Directorate.

53
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:01,300
They're meeting this week to discuss
sharing Rambaldi technology.

54
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,260
This man is Brandon Dahlgren.

55
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:06,597
He lives year-round
in a penthouse of the Regal Casino.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,267
He's a go-between for K-Directorate.
He is expecting a call

57
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:14,772
giving the time and location of this
meeting. Information that we need.

58
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,275
Dixon, you're on point.
Sydney, you're on comms.

59
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:22,238
You'll go in as Darian Buchanan,
a delegate from Jamaica

60
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:26,408
who's visiting Las Vegas next week.
As soon as we know he's en route,

61
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,745
you'll go in as Buchanan.
You'll be flagged as a VIP,

62
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:34,041
so you can gamble in the private
suite where Dahlgren plays.

63
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,254
You'll plant a bug Marshall's making
to match a ring Dahlgren wears.

64
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:43,092
Be prepared to leave when we hear
that Buchanan's plane is in the air.

65
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,553
Sydney, stay a minute.

66
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,144
Is everything OK?

67
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,313
Funny, I was about to ask you
the same question.

68
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:01,861
Listen, I don't mean to pry,

69
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:05,656
but I had a conversation
with your father, about your mother.

70
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,534
He told you that she was KGB.

71
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,288
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,833
It's OK.

73
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:20,754
I want to tell you again how much
I appreciate your service to SD-6

74
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:23,090
during the incident last week.

75
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,385
Every person here
owes you their life.

76
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,270
How's the finger?

77
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:41,484
Well, I'm told
it's gonna heal nicely.

78
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,903
Thank you.

79
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:45,154
Shall we?

80
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:59,335
I felt sick.
All those people standing there,

81
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,880
patriots, believing
they work for the US government.

82
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,467
None of them realise the information
they gather is being used

83
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,053
by heartless men like Arvin Sloane,

84
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:13,933
for an organisation that would trade
them in for a profit in a heartbeat.

85
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:17,978
I wanted to rip his finger
right off again.

86
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:23,025
- Does that make me a bad person?
- No. It might've blown your cover.

87
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:25,653
- You think?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,908
Look, you'll tag Dahlgren in Vegas.

89
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,410
When SD-6 knows more
about the meeting,

90
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,621
we'll figure out our next move.

91
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,332
Did the guy from your office
report you?

92
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:41,961
Haladki? He did. But Devlin
only slapped me on the wrist,

93
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:45,506
even if entering SD-6 without
clearance wasn't constitutional.

94
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:51,470
I hoped he'd get done for snitching,
but I guess we broke even. You OK?

95
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:53,848
It's nothing. Just a little bruised.

96
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,307
Can't really tell.

97
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:58,227
That's cos I'm wearing
a pound of cover-up.

98
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,736
We just heard from Jamaica.

99
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,158
Buchanan's pilot is on standby.
He could be off the ground today.

100
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,702
Be ready to leave this afternoon.

101
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,538
That's fine.
I just have to swing by school.

102
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,916
How's that going?

103
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,587
School?

104
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,548
Good.

105
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,091
OK.

106
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,679
Actually, since you're asking...

107
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:38,350
...l've gone from thinking
Mom was a literature professor

108
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,686
to finding out that she was KGB.

109
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:45,775
I'm sure when you found that out,
you must've felt as lost as I do.

110
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,453
Last week, I was ready to leave SD-6.

111
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:02,124
But maybe I was focusing
on the wrong place.

112
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,170
I think maybe I only went
to grad school because Mom did.

113
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:11,008
She was a teacher, so I thought
it was something I wanted to do.

114
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,762
But now I know
it was just her cover,

115
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,264
that it didn't mean anything
to her...

116
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,519
...l'm thinking I should drop it.

117
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,777
Dad?

118
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,279
Yes, I'm...

119
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,407
I understand, I just...

120
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,957
I'm not sure
I'm the best person to ask.

121
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,586
OK.

122
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,215
I should go.

123
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,097
I actually had two tape recorders.

124
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:43,684
You're the best.
Mine just died. Great.

125
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,937
- What is that?
- What?

126
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,482
- Is that a hickey?
- No. Is it? What?

127
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,694
Oh, my God.
I have to go to a meeting.

128
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,988
- I have cover-up.
- Do you have enough?

129
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,324
- Yeah.
- This is very embarrassing.

130
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:01,911
- That I saw it or that it's there?
- I feel 15 years old.

131
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:04,663
- The age of your intern.
- I knew you'd say that.

132
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:07,374
- Did Clinton teach you nothing?
- I'm not married.

133
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,252
Don't defend this.
Jenny's not in your league.

134
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,714
Who's in my league? What league?
Show me the league.

135
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:17,802
I'll go to the meetings and try to
find those people. Where are they?

136
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:22,139
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,352
What?

138
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,728
Nothing.

139
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,024
The next time we do breakfast
with our parents,

140
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,193
remind me mimosas are verboten.

141
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:36,320
Today was the big brunch.

142
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,155
- Didn't get along?
- We wish.

143
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,407
They're going on vacation together.

144
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:44,703
- What's wrong with that? It's nice.
- Nice?

145
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:48,666
It's a disaster. They'll go without
us and plan the whole wedding.

146
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,794
What's in the bag?
Where are you off to this time?

147
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:55,673
- Vegas.
- Vegas? What was I just saying?

148
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:59,009
- Where shall we go?
- After brunch, Vegas is too close.

149
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:03,305
- I'm serious. We can go tonight.
- Wait.

150
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,101
This is not a vacation.
It's a public relations conference...

151
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,353
We don't need you to baby-sit.

152
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:13,190
What I mean is,
I'd wanna hang out with you guys.

153
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,401
Wait a week. We'll all go together.

154
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:18,237
Right, I guess. That breakfast blew.

155
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,865
Tell me later.
I've gotta go to school.

156
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:22,575
I gotta go, too.

157
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,412
I got a gig, on Thursday.

158
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,207
Would you put up some flyers
on campus for me?

159
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,168
Yeah. Do I get ten per cent?

160
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:36,005
Sure. I'll give you that dollar now.
You wanna put some up, too?

161
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,008
- My meeting's at a prison.
- You never know.

162
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,927
- Take care, man.
- I will.

163
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,222
I'm surprised
you wanted to meet so soon.

164
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,391
I've spent eight years in here,

165
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:51,437
living in fear of what these people
might do to my daughter, to Kelly.

166
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,149
So you come in here and ask me
questions about SD-6...

167
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:59,069
- I just wasn't prepared.
- I understand.

168
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:03,532
But... Kelly came to me.
She told me she'd met you,

169
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:07,077
about her conversation with Robert
about going away.

170
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,457
I can't spend another eight years
like this. I need to talk.

171
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,959
Is Kelly safe?
I won't do the story if not.

172
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,961
I'm her father.

173
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:17,296
Neither would I.

174
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,841
Yeah, she's been sent away.
Out of the country.

175
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,804
Cost me nearly
everything I have left...

176
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,056
but she's safe.

177
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,102
So who are they? What do they do?
What the hell's SD-6?

178
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:38,442
I'll tell you what I know. But first
there's something you have to do.

179
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,075
I'm Will Tippin.

180
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,369
I'm here to interview Mr Glasser.

181
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,914
You have to contact
a company called O T Technologies

182
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:55,793
and tell them you wanna interview
their CEO, Larry Glasser.

183
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,004
- Why would I wanna interview him?
- You don't.

184
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,967
But you gotta get into the building.
See, I used to work there,

185
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,138
and before my trial
I did something illegal

186
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,681
but really smart.

187
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:12,768
I knew there were people that wanted
to use my encryption software,

188
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,979
and someone would use it for no good.

189
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,982
So I wrote a subroutine
in the program

190
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,109
to send a tag to a dedicated server.

191
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:24,238
- I don't know the technical jargon.
- It's like a digital guest book.

192
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:27,908
Anybody that uses the program
would unknowingly sign in.

193
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:32,371
I needed a trail in case I wanted
to pursue the people that set me up.

194
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:34,874
- A list of users of your program?
- Right.

195
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:38,002
On a server in the computer room
at OT Tech.

196
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:42,590
Once you get in the building,
say you want to use the rest room.

197
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,717
Excuse me. Where's the rest room?

198
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:49,597
Three doors past the bathroom on
the first floor is the computer room.

199
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,808
The pass code
is four, seven, four, seven.

200
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:11,702
Once you're in, log on to the system.
I'll give you all the access codes.

201
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:15,331
Search for a file called Dolphin.
Download it.

202
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,334
That's the one.

203
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,795
That's our road map.

204
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:23,380
That's gonna lead us to SD-6.

205
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:30,763
Your paper was unlucky to be
the last one I graded.

206
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,100
I didn't come for the paper.

207
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:38,687
I've decided to leave the programme.

208
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,315
I need your signature
to drop the course.

209
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,361
Why?

210
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:50,991
I've been wearing myself too thin,
with the programme and my job.

211
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,954
You were right when you said
work was getting in the way.

212
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,456
But the fact is...

213
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,210
...l'm not sure
I wanna be a teacher any more.

214
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:04,755
Sydney...

215
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,717
...you're one of the best students
I've ever had.

216
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:15,933
That's it, that's my pep talk.
But I urge you,

217
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,936
think a little more
before any final decision.

218
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,332
- Oh, my God!
- What?

219
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,210
- I didn't know Charlie was a singer.
- You know him?

220
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:46,088
Yeah, unfortunately.

221
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,759
You were in
"British authors before 1800".

222
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:53,345
- Yeah.
- Good class. Stella Campbell.

223
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,765
Sydney Bristow. Why unfortunately?

224
00:15:56,974 --> 00:15:59,810
I don't know, it was nothing.
He...

225
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:04,523
We went out for a few months and
he was just a jerk when he ended it.

226
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,860
- He's just a guy.
- How long ago?

227
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,489
- Just a few months ago.
- A few months?

228
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,408
- Yeah, why?
- Because...

229
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:18,454
He's engaged to a friend of mine.
Charlie Bernard? Are you sure?

230
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:20,748
- Engaged?
- How long did you go out?

231
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,375
- Just a few months.
- A few months?

232
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,712
What a pig. God, it figures.

233
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:29,048
Is your friend Rachel,
the blonde girl?

234
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,551
- I thought something was going on.
- No, it's someone else.

235
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,012
Listen, you know what?

236
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:38,516
I just really need to learn
how to keep my mouth shut.

237
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,102
- I'll see you around.
- OK.

238
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,948
Will, I don't know what to do.

239
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:57,493
- Sure it's the same Charlie?
- Yes. Francie'll be devastated.

240
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:02,873
This doesn't make sense. Who the
hell lives a double life like that?

241
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,875
Seriously.

242
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:08,420
- There are people.
- Yeah, I guess.

243
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,923
How am I gonna tell her?

244
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:14,844
OK... Let me make a suggestion.

245
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:19,682
Make sure she's sitting down
and make sure she is very drunk.

246
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:24,687
Yeah, you gotta get her sauced
because... this is really gonna hurt.

247
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,313
It is gonna hurt.

248
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,900
- I'll call you later.
- OK.

249
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:38,200
- Can you focus?
- We're trained to see details.

250
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:42,455
To read people and situations,
to look at clues, red flags.

251
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,499
I started to think
I was getting good.

252
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,461
It turns out
my best friend's fiancé is a cheat.

253
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,546
Out of the blue?

254
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:56,677
I guess, in retrospect,
there were signs.

255
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,764
But he could be so sweet to her.

256
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,935
I don't have to lecture you about
people's capacity to keep secrets.

257
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:11,192
I'll be in touch as soon as I'm into
the database. Transmitter's hot.

258
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,570
Marshall says this is an exact copy
of Dahlgren's ring.

259
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:17,239
Exact would be nice. Thanks.

260
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,366
- And good luck.
- You too.

261
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:28,209
Miss. This entrance
is for employees only.

262
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,212
Sorry, I just started on Friday.

263
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,548
My mistake.

264
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,312
I'm in.

265
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,124
- Oh, my God!
- What's wrong?

266
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,132
You won't believe it.
Francie and Charlie are here.

267
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,925
- Did they see you?
- No.

268
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,427
Make sure they don't.

269
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,694
- How far off are you?
- Gimme two minutes.

270
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:57,131
So, you want to hack into a casino?

271
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,635
Remember how tight security was
in that Siberian silo?

272
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:05,473
Cakewalk compared to Vegas.
Casino security is like an onion.

273
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:07,683
It's layer after layer after layer.

274
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,394
The more you peel back,
the more you wanna cry.

275
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:13,731
Face recognition, video surveillance.
The only way in

276
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,525
is to splice into
the fibreoptic cables.

277
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,195
But interrupting the feed
alerts security.

278
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,864
Except the one thing
nobody else has but you

279
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,033
is me. And I...

280
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,161
...have this.

281
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:29,663
Now, this is a razor-prism.

282
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:33,000
It will cut directly
into a fibreoptic cable

283
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,962
and allow you total access
without interrupting the data stream.

284
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:52,561
OK, Dixon, go!

285
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,959
Sir, Mr Buchanan's arrived.

286
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,045
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Likewise.

287
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:21,382
- We were expecting you tomorrow.
- Yes, I know.

288
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:27,012
I came ahead of the delegation to
win back the money I lost last year.

289
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:30,975
Though I suspect the US Senate
hosts these conferences here

290
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,269
so that we will lose our shirts.

291
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:36,939
Perhaps you'll be more comfortable
in our private gaming suite.

292
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:39,024
How kind. Yes, thank you.

293
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:43,821
Syd, we're in Vegas.
What room are you in?

294
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,615
Call my cellphone
when you get this message.

295
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:49,827
Where the hell are you?
I'll talk to you soon.

296
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,955
Number nine, we have a winner.

297
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,625
We just got here!
We're up a hundred bucks. Alright!

298
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,336
Was coming to Vegas
a great idea or what?

299
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,175
Check it out.

300
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,343
There's a wedding chapel.

301
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:09,764
- Come on.
- Why not?

302
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:14,602
Just think about it.
Just us, no parents, no hassle.

303
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:20,107
You have a line of credit with us.
Like to draw a downer?

304
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:24,153
Yes, man. I usually start with
half a million. I feel lucky today.

305
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:34,246
OK. Dahlgren
is at the back poker table.

306
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:39,585
- May I join you?
- Yeah, sure.

307
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:48,135
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

308
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:52,765
The game is five-card draw, sir.
Pot limit. Minimum bet is $5,000.

309
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:05,027
OK, Dahlgren's got a pair of jacks

310
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:06,695
and an ace kicker.

311
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,532
I always start off modestly.

312
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,909
It leave me room to get out of hand.

313
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,412
Fifty thousand.

314
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:36,100
- Bets, please.
- In case you're wondering,

315
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:38,394
I draw an inside straight.

316
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:45,067
One hundred and twenty thousand.

317
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,245
Not my hand.

318
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:06,839
Americans. Them really gullible.

319
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:13,721
Good evening.

320
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:21,312
Francie, what are you doing? No.

321
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,273
Please, no.

322
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:31,280
Dixon, listen, hold on the switch.
Play a few more hands.

323
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:33,282
Let him see your poker face.

324
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:37,870
If it's OK for me to go radio silent
for two minutes, clear your throat.

325
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:47,463
Going radio silent.

326
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:53,052
Thank you. Now, if you'll just sign
the bridegroom's registry.

327
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:04,313
I was just finishing my meeting
across the casino and I saw you.

328
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:06,148
What are you doing here?

329
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:08,109
I bought the tickets anyway.

330
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,277
No, I mean, what are you doing here?

331
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:13,114
Are you guys getting married?

332
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,908
- I know it sounds crazy.
- No, I totally get it.

333
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:19,036
I called you.
Will you be our witness?

334
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:26,460
I just need to talk to Charlie
privately for two seconds.

335
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,380
OK.

336
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,177
- What's up?
- I met a friend of yours today.

337
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,513
- Who?
- Stella Campbell.

338
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,185
So, how's Stella doing?

339
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:47,481
Does Francie know
about your relationship with her?

340
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:57,074
You and I are friends. I have nothing
against you going into this.

341
00:25:57,158 --> 00:26:01,579
But you marry Francie without telling
her about it and I will kill you.

342
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,999
- Sydney...
- No discussion.

343
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:07,585
You don't tell her, I will.
You got it?

344
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,046
Yeah.

345
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:13,591
I got it.

346
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:17,928
Tell Francie I had to get back
to work. I'll call her later.

347
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:26,479
- Number of cards, please?
- Gimme two cards, man.

348
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:31,817
What the hell!
I'm outta here after this.

349
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:35,029
I'll take three.

350
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:38,324
My friend, the night's still young.

351
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:43,162
The night began $86,000 ago,
my friend.

352
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,254
- What's wrong? Where's Sydney?
- Fran, we gotta talk.

353
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:59,428
- Yeah?
- Sir, we have a problem.

354
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:01,514
We can't get married like this.

355
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:04,308
- Why not?
- Cos I wanna do it right,

356
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:08,395
with all our friends
and family there. Don't you?

357
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,443
I'll see your ten...

358
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:16,821
...and raise 15.

359
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:20,324
All the chips I have left.

360
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:23,828
I see your raise,

361
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:26,664
and to show I'm not a greedy man,

362
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:30,084
I will raise you
something personal.

363
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,378
This,

364
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,506
a gift from King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia.

365
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,928
I've got this watch.

366
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,222
I have a watch.

367
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:45,391
But I don't have no ring.

368
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:52,314
My fraternity ring?
It's not worth anything.

369
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,860
If it's worth something to you,
it's worth something to me.

370
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:06,787
Dixon, I'm back.

371
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:13,043
Screw it,
this is my last hand anyway.

372
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,716
No, Dahlgren's got a flush.
You're gonna lose.

373
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,509
Make the switch now.

374
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,223
Three wise men.

375
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:34,398
Flush.

376
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,405
Thanks for a good game.

377
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:49,872
Something's wrong. Floor manager's
coming with security.

378
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:57,588
Sir, an urgent message for you.
Will you step outside?

379
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:00,049
Yes, of course.

380
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:08,599
- Wait! What is the meaning of this?
- Your attaché just called.

381
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:11,644
Apparently, you're stuck in Jamaica.

382
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,316
There are worse places to be stuck.

383
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,819
Dixon!

384
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,379
OK, so we're down $300.

385
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:42,007
I kept hoping you'd show up
and give us some luck.

386
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:46,470
Thank God you didn't, cos this huge
lady sits next to me, from heaven,

387
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:49,598
and all of a sudden,
we are on a huge streak.

388
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:52,935
- How much did you win?
- Two thousand dollars.

389
00:29:54,478 --> 00:29:57,731
Look what he bought me.
Isn't it pretty?

390
00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:00,317
Yeah, it's really sweet.

391
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:07,950
What did you say to Charlie
about not getting married?

392
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:12,455
- What did he tell you that I said?
- He didn't.

393
00:30:12,538 --> 00:30:16,292
I just wanted to thank you.
You know me, Miss Spontaneous.

394
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:20,796
I would've regretted marrying there.
It was stupid.

395
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:30,473
I don't know how to say this
without it being horrible,

396
00:30:31,223 --> 00:30:33,809
but I ran into this girl on campus...

397
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:40,274
...who said that she had an affair
with Charlie two months ago.

398
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:43,068
Francie, I am so sorry.

399
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:46,697
What are you talking about?
Who is this girl?

400
00:30:47,364 --> 00:30:49,742
Her name was Stella. I don't know.

401
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:51,869
- You don't know her?
- No, I don't.

402
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,163
It's so like you
to believe a stranger.

403
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:56,999
- Wait, I like Charlie.
- No, not really.

404
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:00,419
- When have I said or done...?
- You're not supportive at all.

405
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,588
- I am.
- You don't even know this girl.

406
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:04,715
- Why make it up?
- You told Charlie?

407
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,760
- Yes. He didn't deny it.
- But he didn't admit it?

408
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,347
No, he didn't.

409
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,854
You know, Sydney,

410
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:22,817
there are a lot of things
we haven't told each other lately.

411
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,152
- Like?
- I knew you didn't like Charlie

412
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:27,154
when you missed looking at dresses.

413
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:31,784
- That was only about work.
- I'm sick of your stupid bank job!

414
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,623
Since working there, you've been
elitist and private and distant!

415
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:44,088
You've let me live here, that's fine.

416
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:48,676
But we were closer when I lived with
Charlie, where I should've stayed.

417
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:53,764
I don't even know who you are
any more. And I don't want to.

418
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:11,782
- That is tough.
- More than tough, it was revealing.

419
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,868
Not just about Charlie. About us.

420
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:16,579
So it's more than
Francie and Charlie?

421
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:22,960
I don't know if she's gonna want
to be my friend after that.

422
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:28,716
You gave her the worst news of her
life. How do you expect her to react?

423
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,593
Yeah, I guess.

424
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:35,806
- How many more hickeys you got?
- Shut up.

425
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,016
Just asking.

426
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:42,313
Well, I gotta do an interview anyway.

427
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:46,525
You'll be fine. I'll call you later.
Know your way out?

428
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:51,071
- Hello?
- It's me.

429
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,240
Your trip to Vegas was a success.

430
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:56,243
- I thought you should know.
- That's good.

431
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:59,497
We intercepted a call to Dahlgren
off the transmitter.

432
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,292
- Linguistics is translating it now.
- Anything I can do?

433
00:33:04,168 --> 00:33:07,797
If you have the time,
I'd like you to meet me somewhere.

434
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:17,515
So, why are we at a carousel?

435
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:20,226
You always loved this spot.

436
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,980
Your mother and I would bring you.

437
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:32,613
I'd just been transferred to the LA
field office. You were two years old.

438
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:42,331
We'd watch you go round on
the carousel and talk about our day,

439
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,042
the future.

440
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:50,047
And sometimes, foolishly,
my work at the CIA.

441
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,759
I never imagined

442
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:57,763
that our conversations were being
passed along to the KGB.

443
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:06,564
I haven't been back here in 20 years.

444
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,943
Why did you bring me here now?

445
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:17,158
When you asked me the other day
about school...

446
00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:21,328
...I couldn't help you. I...

447
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,708
I'm out of practice,

448
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:29,462
when it comes to personal matters.

449
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:33,758
Dad, I'm in no rush.

450
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,263
Believing your mother was a professor

451
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,974
may have influenced you somewhat,
but...

452
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:48,439
...the decision to go back to school
was yours.

453
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,442
And I'd trust that.

454
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:55,321
I think that...

455
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:59,492
if you stick with it...

456
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:05,331
...you could become the kind of
teacher students always remember.

457
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,003
Thank you.

458
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:33,067
Linguistics
decoded Dahlgren's phone call,

459
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,070
but we still know nothing
of the agency or who's behind it.

460
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:39,156
Learning that
and getting a visual ID of The Man

461
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,911
is our top priority. I'm tired
of referring to him as The Man.

462
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,707
- I wanna know who he is.
- The meeting with K-Directorate

463
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,544
is scheduled for 20 hours from now
in Moscow.

464
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:56,507
You will surveil the meeting to
obtain data that leads us to The Man.

465
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:04,265
This is a flash memory card.

466
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:07,768
It's compatible
with your fibreoptic camera.

467
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:11,647
On your flight home, leave it
in the plane. Seat pocket 15C.

468
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,941
One of our agents will pick it up.

469
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:16,068
15C.

470
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:21,157
Yeah. Last week, when you
talked about quitting SD-6...

471
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,283
I was naive.

472
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:26,871
No, but... what you said
about wanting to go to a hockey game,

473
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:32,084
wanting me to be part of your life,
I wasn't clear about something.

474
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,717
That it would be nice
to be in public with you,

475
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,511
to actually get to look at you.

476
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,393
Grab a pizza or go to a hockey game.

477
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,188
I wasn't clear that...

478
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,356
I would really like that, too.

479
00:37:03,783 --> 00:37:05,659
Good luck in Russia.

480
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,335
- Where have you been?
- Three movies.

481
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:06,971
Charlie told me everything.

482
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:10,224
I think everything.

483
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,270
You were right.

484
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,659
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

485
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,747
I feel so stupid...

486
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,961
...and I'm so sorry
I said all those things to you.

487
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:40,755
It's OK.

488
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:48,888
You know I'm on your side, right?

489
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:50,848
Thank God.

490
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,525
- You're dropping a class?
- No.

491
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:07,656
No.

492
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:54,829
- How's it hanging, Syd?
- Very funny.

493
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:06,298
We're on.
Heading toward the building now.

494
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,475
Fibreoptic camera is hot.

495
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,354
OK, Syd, we're live.

496
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:12,031
OK, going for audio.

497
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:25,461
Gentlemen, welcome.

498
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:28,631
I'm Mr Sark, director of operations.

499
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:36,972
- On behalf of my employer...
- Who is your employer?

500
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:43,729
Certainly he doesn't expect us to
continue referring to him as The Man?

501
00:41:43,813 --> 00:41:46,941
My employer's identity
must remain confidential for now.

502
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:49,110
This is no way
to begin a negotiation.

503
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:53,030
My employer sends his apologies,
Comrade lvankov,

504
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:56,408
and has authorised me
to detail our proposal,

505
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:58,452
with your approval.

506
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:01,163
You seem young
for such responsibility.

507
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:07,586
My employer's offer is simple.
We will transfer

508
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,881
one hundred million dollars
to your Cayman account,

509
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,467
number A6112B.

510
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,762
Sydney, that isn't
a K-Directorate representative.

511
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:20,516
It's Ilyich Ivankov.
Head of K-Directorate.

512
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,435
How did you know that number?

513
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:27,106
In exchange, you will give us the
Rambaldi manuscript you acquired

514
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:30,568
and whatever analysis you made
of its content.

515
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:37,575
One hundred million?
It's quite an opening offer.

516
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,618
It is a final offer.

517
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,956
The Rambaldi manuscript is priceless.
It's not for sale.

518
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:49,545
I am authorised to tell you that
this offer expires in 60 seconds.

519
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:55,050
- Is this a joke?
- 55 seconds.

520
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:02,600
Tell your employer if ever
he wastes my time like this again,

521
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:05,478
our next meeting
will not be so cordial.

522
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:23,329
Congratulations, Comrade Kessar.

523
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:26,707
You now control
the indestructible K-Directorate.

524
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:31,462
You have also inherited what I hope
is, by now, a very simple decision.

525
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,672
The offer still stands.

526
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:38,761
Unfortunately, you only have
20 seconds left to decide.

527
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:48,229
We...

528
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:51,899
We have an agreement.

529
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,153
My employer will be so pleased.

530
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:08,040
Sydney!

531
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,095
Sydney!
