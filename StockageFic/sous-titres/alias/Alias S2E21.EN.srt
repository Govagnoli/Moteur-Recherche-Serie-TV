00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:01,990
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:02,915
What's going on?

3
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,794
We've decrypted the specs
on Project Helix.

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,083
The data describes a breakthrough
in next-generation molecular gene therapy.

5
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,674
It refers to a new procedure
whereby a patient's face and body

6
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,217
are reshaped to identically resemble
someone else.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,016
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,304
Yes. Everything's in place.

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:46,207
I went shopping the other day and I saw
something that reminded me of you, so...

10
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,670
You bought Vaughn a present?

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,880
Sydney's always saying
that you're wearing suits,

12
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,585
so I thought you could
always use a new tie.

13
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,504
It's beautiful. Thank you.
That's very sweet.

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,548
You're welcome.

15
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,690
- I couldn't take it.
- Me either.

16
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,112
- Seriously. I thought I was losing my mind.
- Me too.

17
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,113
- That was the longest debrief in history.
- I was staring at you the whole time.

18
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,610
- Did you notice?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,665
- I think my dad noticed, too.
- No, he didn't notice.

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,083
Why do you think
he assigned you the investigation?

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,007
Cos it's a big job.
It's a big deal.

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,219
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,932
Someone unauthorised accessed our
computer systems. We're gonna find them.

24
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:49,482
- I'm the point guy.
- You're the point guy?

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,643
I'm the point guy.

26
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,819
Where are Will and Francie?

27
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,159
They're out.
They won't be back for hours.

28
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,073
You're so beautiful.

29
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,948
- Will Tippin may be compromised.
- Our superiors deal in absolutes.

30
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,000
Either he is or he's not.

31
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,126
The CIA is on a mole hunt to find out

32
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,381
who accessed the defence satellite
communications system.

33
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:19,046
It's only a matter of time before they trace it
it back to Tippin and then to me.

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,342
I assume Sloane will want Tippin killed
before the CIA interrogates him.

35
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,478
Sloane's gone. Perhaps for good.
We can't wait for his return.

36
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,477
If the CIA uses regression therapy to find
out who he's been leaking information to,

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,022
our Los Angeles asset
will be compromised.

38
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,816
I don't want Tippin killed.

39
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,284
I've set up a meeting with someone who
can help us reacquire the Di Regno heart.

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,079
He'll get us the plans to the NSA facility
where they keep the Rambaldi artefacts.

41
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:52,956
In the meantime, tell our asset
Tippin's frame needs to be convincing.

42
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,338
Starting tomorrow, you'll be asked
questions that only Will Tippin can answer.

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,715
Places you've been,
things you've said and done.

44
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,844
You'll remember some things
and forget others.

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,767
The more personal the questions,
the less you will recall.

46
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:16,144
In fact, the more you try to recall details,
the more elusive they'll become.

47
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,238
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

48
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,898
Now, listen carefully.

49
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,699
Do not move.

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,170
- I'm not supposed to tell you this.
- What?

51
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,259
- It's supposed to go through channels.
- What? It's bad, isn't it?

52
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,765
An operation based on my analysis
went historically wrong.

53
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,972
You passed the upper-level analyst test
you took last week.

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,353
- I did?!
- With one of the highest marks.

55
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,434
- Congratulations.
- You know what this means?

56
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,311
Not that it means anything for sure,
but I heard that guy Roberts is retiring.

57
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,236
I know.

58
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,734
Which means
there's a senior spot for an analyst.

59
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,241
Which you're now qualified to apply for.

60
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,406
- Hands up.
- Hands in the air.

61
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,203
- What's going on? Who are you?
- Special Agent McCain, FBI.

62
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,080
- Mr Tippin, you are under arrest.
- Arrest? Arrest for what?

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,088
- Who approved this?
- Agent Bristow, do not interfere with this.

64
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,044
Tippin's being detained under
the Patriot Act on suspicion of espionage.

65
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,510
Espionage?

66
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,880
Don't say anything until you hear from me.

67
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,642
- Who ordered this?
- Your father.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,478
This is insane.
Will is not a traitor.

69
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,359
Over the last month
we've had two breaches

70
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,983
of our defence satellite
communications systems.

71
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,572
The first disabled our coverage
over Panama, allowing Derevko to escape.

72
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,909
The second was a download
of our imaging archives,

73
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,748
specifically the raid
on Sloane's villa in Tuscany.

74
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,323
There's no way
that Will's working for Sloane.

75
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,332
Syd, excuse me, sorry.
When I ran a diagnostic on the network,

76
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,707
I found that Will's user account
was active in two places simultaneously,

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,793
a glitch which has since been corrected.

78
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:07,133
However, the satellite footage was
accessed from one of those accounts.

79
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,430
Anyone could have logged on
with his user ID.

80
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,684
- Or he did it himself.
- I have known Will for years.

81
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,638
- Trust me on this.
- There's another possibility.

82
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,731
That the man we have in custody
is not Will Tippin.

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,153
Project Helix. The doubling prototype
that you destroyed in Poland

84
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,614
was designed to reshape
a person's physical attributes

85
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,276
to identically resemble someone else.

86
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,416
The prototype's database revealed
two scheduled recipients of the procedure:

87
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,578
Dr Renzo Markovic, who was killed,
and a second unknown individual.

88
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:46,090
- You think Will is the other double.
- We found Provacillium in Will's car.

89
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,717
It's a medication usually taken
by gene-therapy patients

90
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,095
to keep the body
from rejecting the DNA mutations.

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,342
What about giving him an ocular scan?

92
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,268
Actually, that's a really good point,
Mr Vaughn... Michael.

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,853
I probably shouldn't call you Michael.
Mr Vaughn. An ocular scan is often used...

94
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,614
Tippin's being transferred
to medical services as we speak.

95
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,983
They'll scan him
and have the results shortly.

96
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,160
But there's something else.

97
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,615
A digital recording
was found among Tippin's things.

98
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,202
It was taken by the surveillance equipment

99
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,539
you found in your apartment
several months ago.

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,808
- They think I'm not me?
- They don't know what to think.

101
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,888
Someone breached the system
and they're freaking out.

102
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,564
They disabled all Wi-Fi access points and
reset all user accounts and passwords.

103
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,688
- It's a witch-hunt.
- What was that eye scan?

104
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,987
It's a test. It analyses your retina. Someone
who's been doubled develops proteins.

105
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,153
They're like markers.

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,164
They found proteins.

107
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,252
Syd, that's impossible.
It doesn't make any sense.

108
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:54,677
I was assigned to do research on Markovic.
This must be a setup.

109
00:07:54,766 --> 00:08:00,520
Go to my office.
Everything I've been working on is there.

110
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,061
I'm innocent. You know that, right?

111
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:15,198
Do you remember that time when we had
too much to drink, the night we kissed?

112
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,364
It was amazing. Of course
I remember that night, in your apartment.

113
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,290
Do you remember where it was
in my apartment? What room?

114
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,632
It's a small apartment.

115
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,010
I know. Of course, it was...

116
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:46,065
- We were eating.
- It was in the kitchen.

117
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,275
Syd...

118
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,569
I spilled something on your sweater.

119
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,779
Do you remember what that was?

120
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,704
Syd...

121
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,085
I swear it's me.

122
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,296
Pull Tippin's phone records,
read his emails, get his financials.

123
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,754
If he's the double, going over the record
could lead us to his handler.

124
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,337
Or exonerate him.

125
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,428
Sydney, he couldn't answer
your questions. Look at the evidence.

126
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,802
I have reasonable doubt.

127
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:06,308
The information Tippin fed Sloane
led directly to Diane's death.

128
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,600
Excuse me.

129
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,020
If someone wanted to set Will up,
this is exactly what they would do.

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,200
Plant these clues, condition him.

131
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,693
I'd like permission
to assign Francie a protective detail.

132
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,493
If Sloane is targeting my friends,
she could be next.

133
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,993
Done.

134
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,871
I'd also like to speak with her about Will.

135
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,168
She might have information
that could help.

136
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:36,084
Tell her whatever you think is necessary,
but only what's necessary.

137
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,595
I need to know
if he's been acting strangely.

138
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,714
What's wrong?

139
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,382
Forgetting things or saying things
Will wouldn't normally say.

140
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,598
Sydney, what are you talking about?
Where is he? Is he OK?

141
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,181
Just think about it.

142
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,074
He has been distant lately.

143
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,117
For how long?

144
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:13,294
I guess since the two weeks
he spent in Chicago with his family.

145
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,421
Sydney, what's going on?

146
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,304
There are gonna be some men
outside in a van.

147
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,466
They're security.

148
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,221
They're gonna be watching
the apartment, watching you.

149
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,983
Protecting you.

150
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,147
Why? Syd, you're creeping me out.

151
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,902
I don't work for a bank.

152
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,406
We downloaded valuable intel
from Tippin's computer

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,417
on the work he was doing
to locate the second double.

154
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,872
He managed to identify the man who
invented the computer imaging equipment

155
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,206
used by Dr Markovic.

156
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,378
This is Dr Hans Jurgens.
He's a chief scientist at Miracorps,

157
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,307
the largest hospital-supply company
in the European Union.

158
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,392
His equipment was used to monitor
the patients during the gene therapy

159
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,636
that was required
to complete the doubling process.

160
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,598
Our controlling assumption is that
he was personally involved in the process.

161
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,100
So we think he knows
the identity of the second double.

162
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,778
If the guy we've got isn't Tippin,
then we can't trust his intel.

163
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:25,741
- At best, it's a dead end. At worst, a trap.
- I think it's him.

164
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,498
I'm getting bored with your hunches.

165
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,166
Pardon me.

166
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,624
I say we move the prisoner to Camp Harris
for unrestricted interrogation.

167
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,791
I'm not letting my friend
be taken to a place like that.

168
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,125
We can't keep letting
your daughter's personal relationships...

169
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,757
Think. If Will's innocent,
he's not trained to handle torture.

170
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,931
- He'll say anything you want him to say.
- If not, he may know where your friend is.

171
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,305
For now, Tippin stays here.

172
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:57,808
Five hours ago we acquired
surveillance of Jurgens in Berlin.

173
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:02,363
A contact in country will meet you
at Bendex office building downtown,

174
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,987
then brief you on the operation.

175
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,318
Your plane leaves in half an hour.

176
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,965
- Man, I'm so...
- Stop.

177
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:46,112
That's what they recovered
from my wife's car after the bomb went off.

178
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:53,243
That's why we couldn't have
an open-casket funeral for her.

179
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,369
Turn the page.

180
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:05,217
First fingerprint is your right index finger.

181
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,506
The second is the partial
they lifted from the remote detonator

182
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,054
we found among your things.

183
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,561
The prints are a match.

184
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,727
You have Sydney fooled,
but I'm not gonna play games with you.

185
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,021
- You are not Will Tippin.
- Dixon, you can't think that I...

186
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,393
Help me find Arvin Sloane

187
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,324
and I will do what I can
to help you avoid the death penalty.

188
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,737
Dixon, please.

189
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,575
Refuse to cooperate and I assure you,
you will suffer.

190
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:37,789
Now, when you're done with this act,
you will tell me what I wanna know.

191
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,368
I'll prove it to you.

192
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,711
- How did we meet?
- Sydney introduced us.

193
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:55,135
- Where?
- It was... She had a party.

194
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,601
And there was a bunch of us together.

195
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,942
And, uh, I remember
what we were talking about. Uh...

196
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,788
Dixon, somebody did this to me
and I can't remember.

197
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,550
You murdered my wife.

198
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,755
You murdered my wife.

199
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,223
You murdered...

200
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:24,730
Dixon. Tippin's being transferred
to Camp Harris. I want you to supervise.

201
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,854
It's my understanding Director Bristow
decided he's not to be moved.

202
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:33,367
He's been overruled by DOJ.
Convoy leaves in ten minutes.

203
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,034
- She what?
- Bristow broke her cover with me.

204
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:40,787
- She told me she's CIA.
- Did she give you an explanation?

205
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:46,415
Given what's happening with Tippin, she
was concerned for my safety, of all things.

206
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,044
Bristow's willingness to confide in you
is an advantageous development

207
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,960
that will be lost if Tippin gives you up.

208
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,424
I intercepted a DOJ transmission.

209
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,265
They're moving Tippin
to a more secure location.

210
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,887
Once he's there he will be unreachable.

211
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,847
Organise a team
to intercept the transport and extract him.

212
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,346
To the CIA, this will confirm his value to us.

213
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,145
And once we have him?

214
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,109
Kill him.

215
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,302
Have you tried the restaurant upstairs?

216
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,721
Yes. The bratwurst is excellent.

217
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:43,050
Hello, my friends. We've tracked Jurgens
to a local sex club he frequents.

218
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,313
Leather, whips, latex, chains.
All the good stuff.

219
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,349
- How long's he gonna be there?
- Could be a couple of hours.

220
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,521
I say we move in now.

221
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,190
- What?
- Nothing.

222
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,611
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

223
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,542
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

224
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,709
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

225
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,258
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

226
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,839
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

227
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,473
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

228
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,055
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

229
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,606
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

230
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,151
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

231
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,696
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

232
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,277
I, I wanna mmm mmm, I

233
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,709
- I'm glad I'm not the one in leather.
- You'd look cute in a teddy.

234
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:50,253
Jurgens is with the security team
against the wall.

235
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,909
- Hello, honey.
- Hello, dear.

236
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,839
- Who is he?
- Your wife's name is Alba, right?

237
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,082
How do you know my wife?

238
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,836
Oh, no.

239
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,177
- Hi, Alba.
- Please.

240
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,186
We know about Project Helix,
that you built it for Markovic.

241
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,138
You do?

242
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,398
We also know that he used it
to double himself and one other person.

243
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,648
With Markovic dead,

244
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,192
you're the only one who knows
the identity of that second agent.

245
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,320
But I do not know.

246
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,365
I assume your wife's email address
is still the same?

247
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,243
What?

248
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,827
- She's gonna love these pictures.
- No, no, no, wait.

249
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,244
I just built it for Markovic.
I was not there for the procedure.

250
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,915
Your wife is gonna love having these
new pictures to add to your scrapbook.

251
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:02,800
I do not know the name,
but there is a way you can find it.

252
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:07,889
The computing power required to model
a person's entire genome is tremendous,

253
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,811
so during the doubling process

254
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,649
Markovic had to reconnect it to
an off-site computer facility, a server farm.

255
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,567
If you access those servers, you can
find the identity of the second double.

256
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:25,531
- Which server farm did he use?
- I do not know. I swear to God.

257
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,495
Please do not send those pictures.

258
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:34,910
Please let me go.
Please let me go.

259
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,538
- Here's your pictures.
- Please.

260
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,666
Give me back my pants.

261
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,174
- Please explain this transfer order.
- Tippin is stonewalling.

262
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,057
We need to break him before his handlers
realise he's been compromised.

263
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,810
- Unrestricted interrogation is premature.
- Justice Department didn't agree.

264
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,979
Tippin is a credible threat
to national security,

265
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,444
which means that from now on
they wanna be consulted

266
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,359
on every decision of this investigation.

267
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:11,327
What did you think, Jack? That I just
forged a transfer order on CIA letterhead?

268
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:16,622
- You went behind my back.
- Hardly unheard of in this office.

269
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:21,954
So what is this? Retribution
for me taking your parking space?

270
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,466
No. I do what my job compels me to do.
Nothing more, nothing less.

271
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,511
And if you can't see
that I'm trying to protect the lives

272
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:34,596
of everyone in this operations centre,
then I overestimated your intelligence.

273
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,328
That was Roosevelt Road.
ETA 20 minutes.

274
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,705
Copy that.

275
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,634
Shots fired.

276
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,987
We've got a sniper.

277
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,202
- Wait a second.
- Come on.

278
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,214
Move it.

279
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,473
Tippin.

280
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,973
You son of a bitch.

281
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,809
You transferred Will to Camp Harris
after we agreed to keep him here.

282
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:19,807
Sydney...

283
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,267
For the time being your father
may be my superior but I am yours.

284
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,478
Who the hell do you think you are
to talk to me like that?

285
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,811
My friend may be dead.

286
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,356
Your friend arranged for an armed
assault team to facilitate his escape.

287
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,611
How exactly did he do that from a holding
cell? He didn't even get a phone call.

288
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,648
Syd, I was there. I saw him with the gun.
He fired into the transport.

289
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,663
- Are you sure it wasn't self-defence?
- Would you excuse us, please?

290
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,410
I know it's not smart
to lose my cool with Kendall.

291
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,209
Sydney, you have to accept the possibility

292
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,917
that the man we had in custody
was not your friend.

293
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,261
Dad, I don't believe it.

294
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,424
I understand.

295
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,051
Cos if it wasn't Will,

296
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:10,939
then Will is most likely dead,
and I can't handle that.

297
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:18,031
We received your intel from Berlin. We're
analysing the list of server farms now.

298
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,903
As soon as we have
a lead on the facility, you'll know.

299
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,074
Go home, get some rest.

300
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,763
I have to admit,
I was surprised when I was contacted.

301
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,390
The plans, please.

302
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,687
What surprised me is you wanting
blueprints to a government storage facility,

303
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:54,822
rumour being
that you're working with CIA now.

304
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:02,445
Do me a favour.
Let me know how you plan on doing it.

305
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,163
Doing what?

306
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,333
Getting past
the new access-control system.

307
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:14,299
Because unless you know how to crack it,
these blueprints won't do you any good.

308
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:20,302
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It seems so insane.

309
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,715
I know.

310
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:29,061
How is it even possible that someone
could look like Will and sound like him?

311
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,150
I mean, it's just so ridiculous.

312
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,397
Does the CIA have any idea
where Will might be?

313
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,983
I mean, the real Will?

314
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,540
I'm sorry,

315
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,245
but I'm not authorised
to give you any details.

316
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,212
Syd, don't do this to me.

317
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,090
- Francie...
- Sydney, you're my best friend.

318
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,046
You just told me that you're a spy
and that my boyfriend's a double

319
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,628
and now you're telling me
you're not authorised?

320
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,881
The answer is we don't know.

321
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,861
- Hello?
- Syd, it's me.

322
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,742
Will, where are you?

323
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,736
I didn't escape.
An assault team hit the bus.

324
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,913
They tried to take me hostage or kill me,
I don't know. But someone's framing me.

325
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:31,126
The FBI and CIA both have you
on a shoot-to-kill watch list.

326
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,409
You have to tell me where you are.

327
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:37,130
So Kendall can send me to Camp Harris,
treat me like a terrorist? Not a chance.

328
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:41,843
I won't let that happen. If you are Will,
you know I will do whatever it takes

329
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,465
to make sure that nothing happens to you.

330
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,310
Please let me bring you in.

331
00:28:55,485 --> 00:29:00,277
Syd, I love you.
I can't trust you.

332
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,783
Not any more.

333
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,947
Meeting you...
Meeting you destroyed my life.

334
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,957
You wanna help me?
Prove I'm innocent.

335
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:21,297
There may be a DNA record of the surgical
procedure. It could clear you. It's...

336
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:25,466
It's on a server farm somewhere in Europe.

337
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:29,675
I'm gonna find it.
I promise.

338
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:37,024
OK, OK, this may be nothing, but Markovic
laundered money through real estate.

339
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,819
He had a farm in Marseilles. Maybe it's not
a cow-pig farm. Maybe it's a server farm.

340
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:47,660
- Marseilles. Do you remember where?
- No, no. I gotta go. I gotta go.

341
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,629
Syd, where is he?
Is he OK?

342
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,628
- I have to go.
- No, talk to me. Tell me what's happening.

343
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:04,209
I can't. I'm sorry.

344
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,472
Please try to understand.

345
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:23,146
- Sydney Bristow's headed to Marseilles?
- Should I follow her?

346
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:27,403
Stay there.
Finding Tippin is your priority.

347
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,542
How did it go?

348
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:40,246
The NSA facility uses
state-of-the-art locking mechanisms.

349
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,341
We've bypassed systems like that before.

350
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:48,005
The access codes I downloaded from the
CIA Echelon system won't work any more.

351
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:52,510
The NSA now uses
a time-synchronised key card.

352
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:03,611
Presumably a CIA agent, under the proper
duress, could obtain such a key card.

353
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:07,908
I'm about to confess something
that will either delight you -

354
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:13,117
which I hope is the case, that would be
nice - or it will make you furious.

355
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,578
While you were away, Will Tippin
was ordered to Camp Harris

356
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,787
for unrestricted interrogation.

357
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:21,749
They would have found out
about our asset.

358
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,954
What did you do?

359
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,632
I instructed that he be extracted and killed.

360
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,669
I told you I didn't want him killed.

361
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:33,173
Your asset could have been
pulled from the field.

362
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,767
Yes, I know, but the situation had changed.

363
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,894
Sydney, out of fear for Francie's life,

364
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,849
told her she was going to Marseilles to
recover evidence that would clear Tippin.

365
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,604
Is he dead?

366
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:50,699
No. He's at large
and believed to have escaped.

367
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:54,700
Which should provide us
the leverage we need to get into the NSA.

368
00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:00,080
If we recover the evidence in Marseilles
before Sydney, we can force her hand.

369
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,915
Proof of Will's innocence in exchange
for her aid in securing a key card.

370
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,585
We just got the forensics report back

371
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,965
on the detonator
we found among Tippin's things.

372
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:14,677
Will's fingerprint was placed on the trigger
after it was wiped down.

373
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,722
This is great. Now we have evidence
that confirms he was being framed.

374
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:23,483
Yes. Still, it'll take hours to get Justice
approval to infiltrate the server farm.

375
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:28,444
Take Vaughn.
The two of you will go in tactically.

376
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,114
- I'll have Marshall prepare your op tech.
- Kendall's gonna report you.

377
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,490
I'm aware of the consequences.

378
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:37,117
When the DOJ hears
you initiated an op without their approval...

379
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,243
Sydney, I've been doing this
longer than you have.

380
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,502
I'm not cut out for management anyway.

381
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,688
- We need to talk.
- Yes, I know.

382
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,653
I've been sanctioned by the DOJ.

383
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:13,523
I'm no longer in charge of this operations
centre. That honour goes to you.

384
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,489
Maybe I'm a slow learner, Jack,
because I don't understand you.

385
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,406
A month ago
you manoeuvred me out of my job

386
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,455
and now here you are handing it back.

387
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,246
I belong in the field.

388
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,546
You know, we can help each other.
We don't have to be adversaries.

389
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:30,503
I appreciate your magnanimity.

390
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,547
- Now you're just mocking me.
- Yes.

391
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,134
You know, part of the reason I sent Tippin
to Camp Harris was to protect Sydney.

392
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:43,348
Why do you think you have your job back?

393
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:55,485
- Thanks, Mr Bristow.
- Thanks, Sarah. Keep the change.

394
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,092
It's good to see you, Jack.

395
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:22,852
I assume that since you're sitting across
from me with so little regard for your life,

396
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,773
I'm in the cross hairs of a sniper rifle.

397
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:29,024
- Two of them.
- Of course.

398
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,859
I've missed your poker face.

399
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:41,538
So, there's something I want you to know.

400
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,869
- I forgive you.
- Excuse me?

401
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,998
Your betrayal of SD-6.

402
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,663
I'm curious, Jack.

403
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:57,468
When exactly did our friendship end?

404
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:02,467
The moment you recruited Sydney
over my objection.

405
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,431
I thought so.

406
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:09,270
If I had known that decision
would cost me our friendship

407
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,602
and my relationship with Sydney,
I would have done things differently.

408
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:19,694
- Self-pity doesn't become you.
- Jack, on the contrary.

409
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:24,697
I'm here to make you an offer.
I don't expect an answer now.

410
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:30,034
- What would that be?
- Come back to our partnership, Jack.

411
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,921
I will tell you everything
I've learned about Rambaldi.

412
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,631
An obsession I've never shared.

413
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,508
Well, now's the time to sign up.

414
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:44,845
For years I collected his artefacts,
as if that was the point.

415
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:49,100
I thought Rambaldi's work
was the window to the past.

416
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:57,198
Today I am one move away from proving
to you that it is so much more than that.

417
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:02,903
And this time
Sydney won't be a pawn in our venture.

418
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:08,035
Jack, sit here for a while, think about it.

419
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:14,048
We will never work together again.

420
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:23,505
The thing of it is, you are going to work
with me, sooner than you think.

421
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,894
The men who have you in their sights
have been instructed

422
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,270
to put a bullet through your brain
if you dial your cell

423
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,692
or leave this table within 30 minutes.

424
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:43,945
We'll see each other again, Jack.

425
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,988
Trust me on that.

426
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,514
The chief of security holds a kill switch

427
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,514
that enables him to wipe clean all of
their data storage at any sign of attack.

428
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,763
To prevent the destruction
of the information that we need,

429
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:15,640
I will proceed to the security room
and secure the kill switch.

430
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:18,985
After confirmation from Agent Bristow,
you'll expedite through the facility

431
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:21,111
where you'll consider
everyone you encounter as hostile.

432
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,276
We'll upload the file on the second double
to a CIA server. Any questions?

433
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,406
Agent Bristow.

434
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,240
- What is this, a private club?
- American?

435
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,409
Is this Paris?

436
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,500
- Come on. Can I...
- Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, monsieur.

437
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,920
I had a little too much to drink. OK?
It's no big deal.

438
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,501
Is this the fancy club?

439
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,516
Can I come in? I just wanna...

440
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:39,108
I know I've had a little too much to drink but
I really just wanna come in for a little bit.

441
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,898
My friends told me to come.

442
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,202
Listen, I love you, man.

443
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:07,591
OK. All right. You're so grumpy, man.

444
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,424
What's your status, Mountaineer?

445
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,966
- I'm going in.
- Copy. We'll move in.

446
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:13,362
Boy Scout in position.
All teams hold for Mountaineer's signal.

447
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,191
Hello, Sydney.

448
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,359
Sydney?

449
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:03,418
I know what you're after.
Your friend's suspected of being a double.

450
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,506
You believe the information
on these servers could clear him.

451
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,216
No, don't.

452
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,172
Go, go, go.

453
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,732
You erased it.

454
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,232
I transferred a copy to a secure location.

455
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:38,111
I'll give it to you. In exchange,
I want you to do something.

456
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,080
Go to hell.

457
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:47,205
If you don't, you'll never clear Will's name.
He'll be tried as a traitor and executed.

458
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:51,169
I'll be calling on you soon, Sydney.

459
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,920
Thanks for coming.

460
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:37,760
- You OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am now.
