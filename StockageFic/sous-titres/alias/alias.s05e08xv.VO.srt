1
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:56,297
- Did you crack Dean's encryption?
- Well, I was working on it, but...

2
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,732
I got a little sidetracked.

3
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,110
I intercepted a strong
of MI-6 transmissions.

4
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:03,420
They're all about the testing
and sale of a prototype M.P.B.

5
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,484
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

6
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,547
What's an M.P.B.?

7
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:10,994
Sorry, it's a Micro-Pulse Bomb.
These things... super nasty.

8
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:14,172
Incinerate the people,
leave everything else intact.

9
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,984
There was an incident aboard a train
in Siberia two days ago.

10
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,732
Information's leaking out slowly, but...

11
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,358
You think that's the test?

12
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,715
There's no way the Brits
are pursuing an M.P.B.

13
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,483
That breaks every arms treaty
own to man.

14
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,551
Well, have you notified
the Director General?

15
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:28,169
Until we know who we can trust,

16
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,295
we can't approach MI-6 officially.

17
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,693
Jack and Sydney are in England
trying to find out more.

18
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,045
In the meantime, we're going to go over
every single transmission

19
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:40,858
Marshall pulled off the server
to see if we missed something.

20
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,798
- I'm working on these.
- Okay.

21
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,799
I'll take these.

22
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,484
You should see my youngest grandchild
Daisy...

23
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:04,648
4 years old and already
a master of the computer.

24
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:07,295
Have you chosen a name?

25
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:10,696
I myself have always been partia
to "Rupert"...

26
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:12,361
such a distinguished name.

27
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:16,985
A shame it's fallen out of favor.
Wouldn't you agree, dear?

28
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:20,352
- Rupert... it's classic.
- Excuse me.

29
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:23,287
Can't seem to get enough
of that Devonshire clotted cream.

30
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,838
We don't have it in the States.
If you'll just pardon me?

31
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,714
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

32
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,425
I prefer the cinnamon,
but the blackberry is also very good.

33
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,649
Excuse me, ma'am,
you forgot a napkin.

34
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,894
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,583
Do you still play?

36
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,832
No, gave it up years ago.

37
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,955
You shouldn't have approached me here.

38
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,519
I take it Joseph still doesn't know
what you do for a living.

39
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,850
How would it look for
the French Ambassador

40
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,332
to have a spook for a wife?

41
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,456
Besides, this is where
I get my best intelligence.

42
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,894
I already talked with
the Minister of Finance. He's a dimwit.

43
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:22,395
What's this about, Jack?

44
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:25,768
We believe someone operating within MI-6

45
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,456
is attempting to acquire
a Micro-Pulse Bomb.

46
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:31,205
Well, that's outrageous.

47
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,580
- MI-6 would never sanction...
- I agree.

48
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:37,268
More likely, whoever it is
represents some corrupt element.

49
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,142
Are you suggesting
we have a double agent?

50
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:41,931
Yes, but it goes much deeper than that.

51
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,145
Have you ever heard of Prophet Five?

52
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,332
- Have you seen Elizabeth?
- No. Sorry.

53
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,644
Excuse me!

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,771
Are you Joseph Vachon,
the French Ambassador?

55
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:55,772
Why, yes, I am.

56
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:59,080
I knew it. Hey, I've been taking
French classes at night,

57
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,019
'cause little ones are supposed
to pick up so quickly, you know?

58
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,145
I was just wondering if I could just
practice a little bit on you.

59
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,518
- I suppose so, yeah.
- Great. Okay. All right.

60
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,923
The network behind Prophet Five
is far-reaching.

61
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,764
They appear to have infiltrated

62
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,613
multiple intelligence agencies,
not just MI-6.

63
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,425
And you think that following this weapon

64
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:39,988
will give us the key
to finding out more?

65
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,050
You want me to investigate my agency
from the inside?

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,612
I wouldn't be coming to you
if it didn't also involve Sydney.

67
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,075
Sydney? Is she all right?

68
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:51,174
She's fine.

69
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,525
You just met her, in fact.

70
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,324
Oh, my goodness!

71
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
It has been a long time.

72
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,048
And unless she's wearing
a very convincing disguise...

73
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,736
I'm going to be a grandfather...

74
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,999
A very young grandfather.

75
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:06,302
Jack...

76
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:08,926
She's lovely.

77
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:12,676
She is. The agent I told you about,
Michael Vaughn...

78
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,549
- He was her fiancé.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

79
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:21,552
What you're asking me to do,
to investigate my own agency...

80
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:22,927
that's treason.

81
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:27,489
What's a little treason
between old friends?

82
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,802
My source got back to me.
She confirmed what we suspected.

83
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,612
The acquisition of the M.P.B. weapon
is strictly off-book.

84
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,300
MI-6 has not sanctioned it.

85
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:43,426
Could she identify the double agent?

86
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,924
No, but she was able to identify
the engineer who designed the weapon...

87
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,550
this man... Lukas Basarov.

88
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,424
Tenured faculty,
University of St. Petersburg.

89
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:55,801
Holds advanced degrees in physics
and thermonuclear engineering.

90
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,798
Apparently, he has a side business.

91
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,347
Basarov is currently en route
to a conference

92
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:02,175
being held in Sao Paolo, Brazil.

93
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:05,237
He's scheduled to give a talk
on theoretical microdynamics.

94
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,488
Sounds awesome.

95
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:14,364
Well, Brazil. Isn't that, you know,
the place where they have string...

96
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,498
what are they called?
Not bikinis, but...

97
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,945
- Thongs.
- Yes.

98
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,174
My source found evidence
which indicates that

99
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,676
within approximately 48 hours,
Basarov will receive a transmission

100
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:28,675
regarding where and when
the sale is taking place.

101
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,946
We can presume
he'll be receiving this one

102
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,740
at the conference via his laptop.

103
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,678
Well, that's easy.
We just access the laptop,

104
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,799
upload the bugging software...
piece of cake.

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,861
I could definitely do it.

106
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:40,425
You need to be here
to decrypt the transmission.

107
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,549
Rachel's perfectly equipped
to do the work in the field.

108
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,987
Wheels up in two hours.

109
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:54,513
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,050
Here's your program.
It's a Flinkman special.

111
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,051
Thanks.

112
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,362
You're sure you're okay with this?

113
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,676
Yeah. I'm actually glad
that I'm going...

114
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:05,300
Anything to keep
the investigation moving.

115
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,426
When's the last time
you did something just for fun?

116
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,995
Hitting Gordon Dean on the head
with a shovel, that was fun.

117
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,177
Okay.

118
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:15,365
Okay, it hasn't been high
on my list of priorities.

119
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:18,492
But you have to have a life.

120
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,114
I know. Okay.

121
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,551
I'll work on it, I promise...

122
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:25,115
after Brazil.

123
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,155
Hi, I'm checking in. Lydia Sand.

124
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,632
The room you requested is available.

125
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,953
- I see you're here for the conference?
- Yes

126
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,739
Let me get your information packet.

127
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,175
I don't care what sort of
geek convention you have here.

128
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,676
I was told an upgrade
wouldn't be a problem.

129
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,264
Americans.

130
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,826
So, Lydia, you here on business?

131
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:24,638
Yes.

132
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:26,827
The geek conference.

133
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:30,513
You heard that, huh?

134
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:31,641
I did.

135
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,141
What are the odds, huh?

136
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,326
I'm in place.

137
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,575
Yes, I'm looking at him right now.

138
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:40,513
I'll have the details
of the trade by tomorrow.

139
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,329
Don't worry, Benjamin.

140
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,641
For what you're paying me,

141
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:47,954
I won't let anything stand in my way.

142
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,641
Dr. Basarov? Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

143
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:31,142
I was just reading your article,
and, well, I was wondering...

144
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:32,952
would you mind signing it?

145
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:40,328
Look. I have...
what do you call them? Groupie.

146
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,827
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

147
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,015
I would like the shrimp stew,

148
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:12,878
the pork and beef skewers

149
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,765
and also the tomato salad.
I'm trying to lay off the carbs.

150
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:26,265
Get it here in ten minutes,
and I'll triple the gratuity.

151
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,846
Room service.

152
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,532
- Agent Grace.
- Hi, it's me.

153
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,172
- How'd it go?
- It went fine... great.

154
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,911
Good. I'll notify Jack and Marshall.

155
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,733
So what do I do now?

156
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:13,594
Keep your P.D.A. with you.

157
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:16,593
It'll alert you as soon as it intercepts
Basarov's transmission.

158
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,910
Then go ahead and send it to Marshall.

159
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:21,783
Till then, it looks like
you got the night off.

160
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:22,784
Just relax.

161
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:24,535
All right.

162
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:43,845
Lydia?

163
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:46,036
Right?

164
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:50,036
I'm sorry about that crack
I made earlier.

165
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:53,308
12 hours on a plane next to
a screaming toddler.

166
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:54,845
You know how that can be.

167
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:58,221
- Of course, that's no excuse.
- Don't worry about it.

168
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,161
Whatever beer you have on tap, please.

169
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,221
My name's Bob Brown.

170
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:11,008
Lydia. But you already knew that.

171
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:14,409
Thank you.

172
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,723
Conference that bad?

173
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,498
No. It's just, you know, tough day.

174
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:28,097
Sometimes at these work events,
I feel like I'm in over my head.

175
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:30,160
I just started in a new division.

176
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,785
It's a lot more responsibilities,
more risks.

177
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,284
Sounds like you need to rethink
your perspective a little bit.

178
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:45,573
Anything in life worth doing
has an element of risk.

179
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:47,974
It's what makes life interesting.

180
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:54,546
I can definitely say my life has been
interesting lately.

181
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:59,285
And I did manage to do
what I came here for, so...

182
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,723
Well, then good for you.

183
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,911
As you say, cheers!

184
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:04,972
Cheers.

185
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:15,748
So, Bob, are you here
on business as well?

186
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:16,847
Yep.

187
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,787
I'm in international trade.

188
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,173
What do you trade?

189
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:25,096
Whatever my clients pay me to trade.

190
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:26,848
Do you like it?

191
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,347
Hell, yeah.

192
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,596
I work freelance, so I get to travel,

193
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,909
meet all sorts of fascinating people,

194
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,722
present company included.

195
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,474
Last year, I tried something
a little different...

196
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,411
something more conventional, stable.

197
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:46,851
How'd that work out?

198
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,913
It didn't. I was terrible at it.

199
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,337
I was so bored that I wanted
to blow my brains out.

200
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:58,662
So I decided to take
less drastic measures and do something

201
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,763
I know best.

202
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:05,724
I just moved.

203
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:09,037
Left my entire life behind, actually.

204
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,410
Well, new starts are good, right?

205
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:16,037
And the new people I work with
are great.

206
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,535
You don't sound too convinced.

207
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:21,998
No, they are.
That's part of the problem.

208
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,350
They're so good at what they do.

209
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,038
I mean, there's this one woman...

210
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,914
she's amazing,
and she's about to have a baby.

211
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,786
I'm not sure I could manage
work and a goldfish.

212
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:36,662
Well, aquariums are overrated.

213
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:38,974
Remember that.

214
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,787
Okay.

215
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,226
- You want another one?
- I would love one.

216
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:52,601
So, um... thank you
for keeping me company.

217
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,025
It was my pleasure.

218
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:02,723
- Good night.
- Good night.

219
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,104
Do you have your key?

220
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,930
Oh, no, we can't go in my room.
There are clothes all over the place.

221
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,036
Can't we go into yours?

222
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:20,411
- Uh...
- Please?

223
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,037
Please.

224
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,476
What the hell. Yeah.

225
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,523
Just so you know,
I don't usually do this.

226
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,895
Well, I appreciate you
making the exception.

227
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,148
You should know that

228
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:59,270
gorgeous engineers have a way
of throwing themselves at me, so...

229
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,146
I did not throw myself at you.

230
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:04,399
Okay, okay. If that's
what you need to believe.

231
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,833
Want something to drink?

232
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,834
- Yes, that'd be lovely.
- Okay.

233
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,361
We're in the tropics,
so how about some rum?

234
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,122
Okay, so you hate rum.

235
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:03,236
Sorry, I forgot how early my flight was.

236
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,800
What are you talking about?
We got a couple hours, right?

237
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:09,110
Seriously, I've got to meet with my boss
and I'm completely unprepared.

238
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:12,548
Well, I'd hate to be the one
to make you lose your job.

239
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,547
- Bob, it's been...
- Yeah, it has.

240
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:40,398
Carrie, honey, ln, I'm into something
really huge right now, okay?

241
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,548
No, no, no, Marshall. It's Rachel.
The transmission's coming in early.

242
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:46,263
Okay. Uh, give me a sec.

243
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:50,274
- Transferring now.
- I'll get right on it.

244
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,575
Rachel, you did great.

245
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,961
Marshall's almost done
analyzing the transmission.

246
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:04,149
- It won't be much longer.
- I'm glad.

247
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,024
You're in a good mood.
Anything you're not telling me?

248
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,647
I... nothing. Just...
The trip was really relaxing.

249
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:16,962
What did you do? Spill it out.

250
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,412
I met a guy at the hotel.

251
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:24,273
Some business guy,
which is not at all my type.

252
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:28,151
We were just talking at the bar,
and, well, one thing led to...

253
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:31,339
Another, obviously.
Are you going to see him again?

254
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:34,961
He thinks I'm Lydia, a British engineer.

255
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,651
Oh, rats. Yeah.

256
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
So no, I guess.

257
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:42,026
Guess what happens in Brazil
stays in Brazil.

258
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,262
What happened in Brazil?

259
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,212
Oh, Rachel got food poisoning.

260
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,149
Sorry.

261
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:50,836
Marshall decrypted the transmission.

262
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:54,524
The double agent is due to meet Basarov
in Spain in 14 hours.

263
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,336
I'm leaving now to surveil the exchange.

264
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:58,274
Are you taking anyone with you?

265
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:01,439
My MI-6 contact is joining me.

266
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,651
You'll coordinate from here?

267
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,652
- Yeah.
- Good.

268
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:19,149
Well, this is charming.

269
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:21,649
I knew you'd like it.

270
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:25,338
I could have spared you the trip,
handled this alone.

271
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:26,999
Someone from my agency is involved,

272
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,275
you can't expect me
to stand in the sidelines.

273
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,401
I figured as much.

274
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:33,320
Why don't we start with the cameras?

275
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,374
This is Phoenix. How are you doing?

276
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,025
We're almost set up.

277
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,153
Connection's good.

278
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:48,278
Okay, should be getting visuals.

279
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,653
Got it. We're standing by.

280
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:58,464
We can tag the weapon
with this tracker. Once they...

281
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:02,528
Joseph.

282
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:04,963
Where does he think you are?

283
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:06,901
Developing Nations Summit.

284
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,715
You were saying?

285
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,213
Once the weapon's in transport,
we'll notify the C.N.A.

286
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:17,014
so they can recover it
without tipping the double agent.

287
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:18,777
Sounds good.

288
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:22,840
Looks like they're ahead of schedule.

289
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:36,964
Do you see that?

290
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:39,500
Yeah. Given the size, I'm assuming

291
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,153
it's got at least
a 20-mile blast radius.

292
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,026
I thought he was showing up alone.

293
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,027
So did I.

294
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:56,252
That man... can you get a better image?

295
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:57,964
Yeah. I'm on it.

296
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,465
Oh, my God. That's Masari.

297
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:03,779
Who?

298
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:06,152
Dad, those are not MI-6 agents.

299
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,462
Repeat... those are not MI-6 agents.
That is Benjamin Masari.

300
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:10,588
Wait, who's Masari?

301
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,026
Sudanese head of the R.L.F.

302
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:15,901
Terrorist squad responsible for bombing
western targets in Africa.

303
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:17,027
This is an ambush.

304
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:20,902
The bomb!

305
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:28,465
Dad, can you hear me?

306
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:34,464
It's no good, Syd.
They're jamming our signal.

307
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,151
Oh, God, dad. Dad, do you copy?

308
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,778
Dad, can you hear me?

309
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:41,590
I want intel from anybody
who's ever done business with Masari.

310
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:43,757
I don't care if they crossed the street
next to him,

311
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:44,965
find out what they know.

312
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:46,151
Anything yet?

313
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,963
Well, I'm indexing passenger manifests
to and from Malaga.

314
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,214
- So far, nothing.
- Find something.

315
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,029
The head of Interpol is on the line.

316
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,116
Any trace from the signal?

317
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:58,905
No. They must have disabled the tracker.

318
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,715
I want everything we have on the R.L.F.

319
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:01,716
Right away.

320
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,329
I came as soon as I heard.

321
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,902
I'm sorry to pull you away from Nadia.

322
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:07,906
How did it happen?

323
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:09,438
They were surveilling a weapons trade.

324
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:12,330
An M.P.B. was supposed to be delivered
to a double agent within MI-6.

325
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:14,403
Masari and his men showed up instead.

326
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:17,089
I've been reviewing the footage.

327
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:21,242
- What time was the meet set?
- 2:30am, local time.

328
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:23,868
- Masari and his men?
- Showed up at 2:17.

329
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,366
The double agent never had a chance.
They beat him to it.

330
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,929
You think it's unrelated?

331
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,180
Micro-Pulse Bomb...

332
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:36,806
it's the kind of weapon that would be
coveted by most criminal organizations.

333
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:37,992
Masari must have found out.

334
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:38,993
How?

335
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,867
How did you get your intel, Sydney?

336
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:43,807
Rachel intercepted a transmission.

337
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:46,058
Well, maybe she wasn't the only one.

338
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,305
Someone else was in that hotel.

339
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:56,820
Say hello to an old friend...
Julian Sark.

340
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,931
Footage places him
at the hotel in Sao Paolo

341
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:02,995
at the same time that Rachel
intercepted the message,

342
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,620
which makes it likely
that he did the same.

343
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:06,992
I thought he was out of the game.

344
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:07,993
Apparently not.

345
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:10,087
He must have been working for Masari.

346
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,867
He was probably paid
for the information.

347
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:12,868
Who is this guy?

348
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:16,057
Kidnapper, extortionist, murderer,
the list goes on.

349
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:20,308
Formerly tied to SD-6 and the Covenant.
He mostly works for himself.

350
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:21,558
Freelance.

351
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,867
I had no idea. I will do anything.

352
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:31,868
I have to ask... did he use you
for information?

353
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:35,543
No. There's no way.
We were never in my room.

354
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:39,493
He never even had access
to the transmission. I can find him.

355
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,413
He's probably halfway
around the world by now.

356
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:44,368
No, when I was in his room,
I saw a plane ticket.

357
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,994
He's going to the Bahamas.

358
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,559
Lydia.

359
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,807
How nice. You remembered my name.

360
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:08,932
Do you remember me?

361
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:12,868
Sydney.

362
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:16,057
I suppose a congratulations is in order.

363
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:19,531
I'm warning you,
if you're planning on arresting me,

364
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,926
I'm not gonna make it easy on you,
people could be hurt.

365
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:25,251
My father and another agent
have been taken captive

366
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,529
by Benjamin Masari.

367
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,866
We need to find his base of operations.

368
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:34,178
My clients pay handsomely
for their privacy.

369
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:39,240
It would be unprofessional of me
to give that information to you.

370
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,865
Which is why we aren't here
to arrest you.

371
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,303
We're here to hire you.

372
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:08,716
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd forgotten about us.

373
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:13,805
I imagine for you this cell
seems somewhat inhuman.

374
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:19,400
You westerners, so accustomed
to your indulgences.

375
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,344
Why are we here?

376
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,560
You were transmitting a video feed
when you were found.

377
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,719
Where was it going?

378
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:38,222
Holiday photos.

379
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,719
Costa Del Sol in winter.

380
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:44,469
As you say,
we do like our little indulgences.

381
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:47,594
Do not touch her!

382
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,593
If you want to spare her, answer me.

383
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,404
Where was the transmission going?

384
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:55,657
Take me.

385
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:00,092
I'm not easily frightened.

386
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,093
You should be.

387
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:11,345
The right one.

388
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:17,908
If you want to spare her,

389
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:20,718
answer me.

390
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:27,648
Perhaps we should try this again.

391
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,182
Who do you work for?

392
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:32,172
- Wait.
- Don't tell him!

393
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,554
Clearly, you don't work
with your hands, huh?

394
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
What is it?

395
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,034
My sources tell me
things got complicated in Spain.

396
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,343
What do you know about it?

397
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:57,844
Everything. You've kidnapped two agents.

398
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,909
One's C.I.A.
The other's British intelligence.

399
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:03,656
There's an international search
underway.

400
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,823
I appreciate the information.

401
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,157
You've saved me some time
and a few bullets.

402
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,095
Perhaps I could do more.
I have a proposition.

403
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,222
Always the businessman.

404
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:19,656
Well, those agents you've kidnapped
are quite valuable.

405
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:22,222
I know some people that would pay
an exorbitant amount of money

406
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,344
to get their hands on them.

407
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:25,532
Best kill them and be done with it.

408
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,095
Do whatever it takes.

409
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,536
Benjamin, you have many enemies.

410
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,185
Given what I know,
I imagine I could broker

411
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,407
a pretty lucrative deal for myself.

412
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:38,972
Are you threatening me?

413
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:42,909
As you said, I'm simply a businessman.
When opportunity knocks...

414
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,117
I'll expect you
within the next 24 hours.

415
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,660
Where should we make the exchange?

416
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,552
Tunisia. My compound.

417
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,032
Can we trust him?

418
00:31:53,284 --> 00:31:54,784
He is telling the truth.

419
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:56,468
I'll arrange for transport.

420
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:59,094
Sydney, getting your father
from Masari...

421
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,283
We need to go in tactically.

422
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,097
How am I supposed to sit here
and do nothing?

423
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,470
It's my dad.

424
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:14,283
We both know he wouldn't want you to go.

425
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,159
I can't lose him.

426
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:22,535
You won't.

427
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:40,511
- A gift?
- A locator.

428
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,855
We need to know exactly
where Masari's holding them.

429
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:44,534
We can't risk tipping him off.

430
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,533
You haven't done this before, have you?

431
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,194
Look, I imagine you feel

432
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:52,845
somewhat to blame for all of this,
but you're not.

433
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,095
I'm very good at what I do.

434
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,910
When you're with them,
press the winding stem on the watch.

435
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,036
We'll do the rest.

436
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,483
I must admit,
you're quite fetching in black.

437
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:01,489
I will gag you.

438
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,720
Does this mean we can't be friends?

439
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:17,518
- Time to switch.
- Thank God.

440
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,597
Hey. Heard the phone ring.

441
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:31,158
Wasn't them.

442
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,228
Um, you want some company?

443
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:38,785
You know, while we wait?

444
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:42,034
I'd like that.

445
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,785
Masari's expecting me.

446
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:18,577
I'm sure Colonel Masari
will be very pleased to see you.

447
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,921
If you expect to be paid,

448
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:23,285
have this wreck fixed
before I'm done with my business.

449
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:42,647
How was the trip?

450
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:44,764
Exhausting, as usual.

451
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,205
Have you ever thought about
moving somewhere more accessible?

452
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,934
Remoteness is a virtue.

453
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,710
Yes, and it's also time-consuming.

454
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:59,109
So I'm afraid we're gonna have
to cut this visit short.

455
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,835
If you could take me to the prisoners,
I can be on my way.

456
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:09,957
Why the rush?

457
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,710
I need to be in Tunis by nightfall.

458
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:18,190
I'm afraid that, uh...
won't be possible.

459
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,383
Cover the entrance. Come on!

460
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,088
She needs medical attention.

461
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,717
You don't look so good yourself.

462
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:16,841
- You okay?
- Yeah.

463
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,217
An extraction team is standing by.
I'll call for them.

464
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,839
- Yeah.
- We've got them.

465
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:23,402
And Masari?

466
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,654
He and Sark are still missing.

467
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:47,963
- Yeah?
- Sydney, it's me.

468
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,653
Oh, thank God. How's my father?

469
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:52,279
He's alive, but we've got
another problem.

470
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:05,715
Can we evacuate?

471
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,110
No, there's not enough time.
They won't get very far.

472
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,777
Rachel, we're going
to talk you through this.

473
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:17,091
Okay, Rachel,
there should be a front panel.

474
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Do you see that?

475
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:21,841
Uh... yeah. It's screwed in.

476
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:25,214
- Okay, great. Just unscrew it.
- Unscrew it? With what?

477
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:27,215
Might I suggest something sharp?

478
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:29,781
Hold on.

479
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,563
So what happened?

480
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,593
I overestimated my friendship
with Masari.

481
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,905
He assumed I was betraying him,
and he took the money and he left.

482
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:46,218
Oh. So then he knows you pretty well.

483
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,465
Okay, I unscrewed the front panel.
Now what?

484
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:55,527
Okay. If this bomb works
on microwave energy,

485
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:59,031
it should have a coaxial capacitor bank.
Do you see that?

486
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:00,639
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

487
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:03,593
It should be attached to a power source.

488
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:05,717
Okay, I found it.

489
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,451
Okay, great. You need to jam the pulse.

490
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,454
How?

491
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,591
Reroute the wires to a neutral bank.

492
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,077
- Okay.
- Wait.

493
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:28,086
- If that's the wrong wire...
- I thought you liked risks.

494
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,093
I also like my body.

495
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:31,491
As I recall, you do, too.

496
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:38,593
It's still armed.

497
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:42,216
That's okay. You just need to disable
the compression generator.

498
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:45,654
Look for a wire running
to the microwave antenna. Okay?

499
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:47,718
Don't you want to get Dixon?

500
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:51,531
No offense, but you haven't had
the best judgment lately.

501
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:52,948
Okay, I got it.

502
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,239
Cut that. That should work.

503
00:38:56,094 --> 00:38:57,781
- Should or will?
- Should.

504
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,032
Just so we're clear...

505
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,341
you approached me.

506
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:09,604
You were the one that was stupid enough
to let me into your room.

507
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:12,531
And afterwards, you were the one
that wanted to cuddle.

508
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,106
It's disarmed.

509
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:21,856
That was spectacular, Rachel.

510
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:23,732
Thank you.

511
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,636
About what you just heard...

512
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:30,916
Don't need to know,
don't want to know.

513
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,667
I've spoken with the driver.
There's a plane waiting in Tunis.

514
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,418
You'll be in a London hospital
by nightfall.

515
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,981
Wish Sydney well for me.

516
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,542
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

517
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:50,546
Don't be.

518
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:03,230
About your payment...

519
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,730
You'd love to arrest me right now,
wouldn't you?

520
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,230
Next time.

521
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:12,105
Give us the account number.
We'll wire you your fee.

522
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:17,484
Don't bother.

523
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,794
This one's a freebie.

524
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:37,168
You sure you don't need anything?
I could stop by on my way home.

525
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:41,131
- I'm fine, just exhausted.
- That's understandable.

526
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,355
Why don't we meet for breakfast?
I'll come by and pick you up.

527
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:45,356
That'd be great.

528
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Dad...

529
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,921
If anything had happened,
and I couldn't have been there...

530
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:59,684
Sydney, you did exactly
what I would have wanted.

531
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,795
You and the baby are all that matters.

532
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,172
I love you, dad.

533
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:09,046
Sleep well.

534
00:41:45,347 --> 00:42:08,047
