1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,069
Seven years ago, I was recruited by a
secret branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:14,031
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,035
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,418
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,672
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:35,010
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:38,806
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:41,392
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,814
My father.

13
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,608
Rambaldi
was a 16th-century inventor

14
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,987
who seemed to have had
a psychic vision of technology.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,865
This book seems to be
an instruction manual.

16
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,909
The work we're doing here,

17
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:03,164
trying to figure out who Rambaldi
was, what he was working on...

18
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,001
...is becoming an obsession for me.

19
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,171
I'm not sure I'm a believer.

20
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:13,132
- Mr Vaughn?
- Yeah, I'm late for a meeting.

21
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:14,633
You'll want to cancel.

22
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:18,429
We figured out how to read
the Rambaldi document.

23
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:23,517
I have the page with me.
I'd like you to see it.

24
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,562
OK.

25
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:16,695
Who is Sydney Bristow and why
should our time be spent on her?

26
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,323
She's a double agent, senator.

27
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:24,745
A CIA asset working undercover
as an operative of SD-6.

28
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:36,048
Last week, we came
into possession of that drawing

29
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,592
from a manuscript
belonging to Rambaldi.

30
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:43,430
Rambaldi. Miss Evans,
we've been all over this.

31
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,486
Look at the partially decoded text.

32
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:02,158
Rambaldi wrote it in reference
to the woman in the drawing.

33
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:45,618
Sir, I understand your reluctance to
invest our resources in this matter

34
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,662
- but I strongly suggest...
- Dr Evans.

35
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,835
What do you need?

36
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,804
Vaughn, I'm back from Brazil.

37
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,432
I did what SD-6 wanted.

38
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:15,272
Got surveillance photos of someone
they think might be The Man.

39
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,693
I'll forward them to you as usual
and wait for further instructions.

40
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,787
Who the hell are you?

41
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,039
Carson Evans, DSR.

42
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,709
We have authorisation.

43
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:38,796
National Security Agency's
investigating Bristow?

44
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,714
Department of Special Research.

45
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:44,135
Because her picture
was in a manuscript?

46
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,138
- That's special access only.
- I'm her case officer.

47
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,015
The loop is closed.
Orders from the DCI.

48
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:54,103
I don't care. If the NSA
know something, I should, too.

49
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,355
We should, sir.

50
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,859
Unless you already do.

51
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,364
Close the door.

52
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:23,883
I got your message. If this is
about the photos, I encoded them.

53
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:27,094
- Forget the photos.
- They might identify The Man.

54
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,389
I nearly got eaten by dogs
trying to get them.

55
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:33,601
- You're investigated by the DSR.
- DSR?

56
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,561
Department of Special Research.

57
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,064
It was created to investigate
Nazi interest in the occult.

58
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:43,569
After the war, an order was signed
empowering them to investigate

59
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:46,989
fringe science,
parapsychology, remote viewing.

60
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:48,240
Why do they want me?

61
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:51,285
They want to know why
you're in the Rambaldi book.

62
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,829
- It seems ridiculous.
- It is ridiculous.

63
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,873
- Your picture...
- It's not mine.

64
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,083
- They don't think so.
- They're wrong.

65
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:03,339
They took my files. They're
gonna bring you in for questioning.

66
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:07,009
- I wanted to give you a heads-up.
- The drawing is 500 years old.

67
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:10,221
Millions of women have looked
like that. My mom did.

68
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,891
- Maybe it's of her.
- They don't think so. She's dead.

69
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,019
They believe the woman
in the picture is still alive.

70
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,229
I don't understand.

71
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,440
The DSR partially decoded
text from that page.

72
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,737
- And? What did it say?
- Look, they didn't tell me.

73
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:31,534
Apparently Rambaldi refers to future
dates, indicating the woman is alive.

74
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:35,121
The DSR is referring
to this text by name.

75
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,250
They're calling it The Prophecy.

76
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,877
I wanna stress at the outset,
this is not an interrogation.

77
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,629
You are not the subject
of a criminal inquiry.

78
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,340
Our purpose is to gather information

79
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:32,887
and I'd like to note how much
we appreciate your cooperation.

80
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,099
- Do you have any questions?
- Yes, just one.

81
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,645
Are you not going to tell me
what this prophecy says?

82
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,899
- I think we've been over that.
- Yes, we have.

83
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:47,318
Just not to my satisfaction.

84
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:51,572
Dr Watterson?

85
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,742
Yes.

86
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,580
- Agent Bristow?
- Sydney's fine.

87
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,709
Question one.

88
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,589
What would be
the next picture in this series?

89
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,469
D.

90
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:19,183
Study this figure.
If it was rotated 180 degrees,

91
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,769
it would look like
which of the following?

92
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,318
C.

93
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,448
What is the next image
in the series?

94
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:37,326
- Love the tech stuff.
- Haladki?

95
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,831
It's like a thermometer. The heat
from the eyes tracks brain patterns.

96
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:43,582
What are you doing here?

97
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,461
My department got tapped
to facilitate cooperation.

98
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,214
Q and seven.

99
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,757
You're in a forest.

100
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,510
You come to a river. Do you cross it?

101
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,309
Agent Bristow? Would you cross it?

102
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,443
I don't know. It depends.

103
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,865
If you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

104
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,617
What is going on in this picture?

105
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,125
The mother is teaching
the girl to bake.

106
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,462
And what feelings
does this picture evoke?

107
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:16,675
The girl doesn't like it.
She wants to go and play.

108
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:28,145
- We need to cut this short.
- What is it?

109
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,564
Sorry, need-to-know only.

110
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:49,917
Would you come with us?

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,001
Why?

112
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,838
We have some physical
examination we need to do.

113
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:54,964
Excuse me?

114
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,884
General tests.
MRI, lumber puncture, blood work.

115
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,637
- What's going on?
- No, I don't think so.

116
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,223
- Agent...
- It'd be better for you...

117
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:08,310
I have answered every question,
but that's as far as this goes.

118
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:12,481
If you wanna touch me, you have
to tell me what this prophecy says.

119
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:15,526
You don't have clearance
for that information.

120
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:21,115
You are wasting your time taking
this Rambaldi thing so seriously.

121
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:24,952
There are real threats in this world.
I have work to do.

122
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:33,794
You move out of my way, or
I will make you move out of my way.

123
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,261
Thank you.

124
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:46,557
They're just letting her leave?

125
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:56,150
- Third-row seats?
- Yeah, behind the Lakers bench.

126
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:00,529
- Wait. Near Kobe?
- Yeah. My friend has a contact.

127
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,531
He scored them free of charge.

128
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:06,660
- I'll be sitting near Kobe Bryant?
- Yes.

129
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:09,705
Are you asking the right roommate?

130
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,795
As is sometimes obvious, I know about
wanting somebody you can't have.

131
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:19,173
For a few hours, you can
forget about hating Charlie.

132
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:20,090
Sounds good.

133
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:24,136
Can I ask you guys something?
I dreamt about a fortune teller.

134
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,389
- He had a prophecy about me.
- What was it?

135
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:31,852
I don't know. That's the word
he used, prophecy.

136
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,562
Does that sound good or bad?

137
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,898
- Prophecy?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,443
- Definitely bad.
- Yeah, bad.

139
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,990
- Who cares? It was just a dream.
- I know.

140
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:48,494
Enjoy your breakfast.
See you, guys.

141
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,916
Using all resources, we've finally
tracked down the enemy

142
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,878
who we no longer
have to refer to as The Man.

143
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:01,924
Thanks to the photos from Brazil,
we have confirmed his identity.

144
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:06,220
- Alexander Khasinau.
- He received the Sark communiqué

145
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:09,181
reporting on the loss
of the manuscript.

146
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:12,685
Decorated former
lieutenant colonel of the KGB.

147
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:17,773
He is a power broker for the Russian
mafia, dealing with rogue states

148
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,942
and the international arms bazaar.

149
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:23,195
- We're facing the Russian mafia?
- As a source of financing.

150
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,656
But in terms of tactics and reach,

151
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:30,035
his organisation operates
on a different order of magnitude.

152
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,497
- So, what's next?
- Nothing.

153
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:38,377
After being identified, he moved
his base to an undisclosed location.

154
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:41,046
He knows he's a target.

155
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,092
The next move we make
must be made with extreme caution.

156
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,093
So, no mission?

157
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,307
Actually, I do have to
ask you something.

158
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,312
It's a personal favour. The last few
days haven't been good for Emily.

159
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:58,314
When you came to the house...

160
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,110
...I hadn't seen her spirits
that high in a long time.

161
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:08,115
If you wouldn't mind calling her
or perhaps pay a visit, say hello?

162
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,160
- Of course.
- Thank you.

163
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:17,374
When we know the right move to make
with Mr Khasinau, we'll make it.

164
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,090
I want Khasinau dead.

165
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,677
The Alliance
doesn't know what it wants.

166
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,222
They're meeting
in London on Tuesday

167
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,891
to resolve whether
the Alliance should invest

168
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,977
the resources to find and kill him.

169
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:42,733
It makes sense. Members of the Soviet
Bloc control five of the 12 votes.

170
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,860
They're cold warriors.

171
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:47,363
They prefer the paradigm of détente.

172
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,281
They'll reject going to war.

173
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:52,284
These five men are cowards.

174
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:56,580
All of them. Of the seven
remaining members,

175
00:14:56,664 --> 00:15:00,167
there are four who will vote
in favour of aggressive action.

176
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:05,256
- So three men control the outcome.
- He sent men into this facility.

177
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,344
They stole from us, they killed
some of us. There should be no vote.

178
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,516
- What's your strategy?
- Edward Poole.

179
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,351
Oversees SD-9.

180
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:21,147
It's one of the three swing votes.

181
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,442
I'll start with him.

182
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,530
- Hello?
- Edward?

183
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,825
Arvin. Good to hear your voice.

184
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:35,744
Yes, Edward. You, too.
How've you been?

185
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:40,374
I think we've all been better.
I'm seeing you on Tuesday.

186
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,085
That's why I'm calling you.

187
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,381
Your position on Khasinau.

188
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:51,427
Shall I assume that you'll support
a declaration of war against him?

189
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:57,016
I am flattered
you would think me so forgiving.

190
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:04,523
But Khasinau must pay
for what he's done.

191
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,067
Even if I have to
take care of it myself.

192
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:10,070
Good. Glad to hear that.

193
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:15,493
Unfortunately, the Alliance
is nearly split on this issue.

194
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:19,330
Now, as far as I'm aware,
there are two swing votes left.

195
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,958
Oskar Dunst and Jean Briault.

196
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:27,129
So, Edward, it's up to you and me
to take the appropriate action.

197
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,174
What are you suggesting?

198
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:34,136
I have personally seen
what Khasinau is capable of.

199
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:38,099
And I will not let his aggression
go unanswered.

200
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:45,606
So, what I'm suggesting, Edward,
is that we do whatever must be done

201
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:50,653
to ensure that
this declaration of war be ratified.

202
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,948
Yes, I was going to wait
and present this at the meeting.

203
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,491
What's that?

204
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:59,995
Under the circumstances, I think
I should come to Los Angeles.

205
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,915
I have some intel you should see.

206
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,793
- Good.
- I'll be there in the morning.

207
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:07,128
OK.

208
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,435
Arvin's such a sweetheart,
asking you to look in like this.

209
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:25,438
I would have come,
but I didn't want to bother you.

210
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,106
Not at all.

211
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:31,861
You know, I really liked meeting
your friend, by the way. Will?

212
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:37,616
- Yeah, he's a great guy.
- He thinks you're great, too.

213
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,827
He and I are just friends.

214
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,955
- He's cute.
- He is cute.

215
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:48,794
I know it's been a while, but I
still feel guilty about dating again.

216
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:55,676
Must be especially hard,
doing what you do.

217
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,148
It is. It's difficult sometimes.

218
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:13,652
I mean working for my husband.

219
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:19,325
- Well.
- This has been difficult for Arvin.

220
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,660
My illness.

221
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:26,957
I look just like everyone else,
and I usually feel that way.

222
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:33,047
The fact is,
I won't be alive next Christmas.

223
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:39,345
- Don't say that. You don't know.
- I do.

224
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:44,266
For a long time, I ignored the pain.

225
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,353
Then, one morning over there, I...

226
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:52,274
...I collapsed.
I woke up in the hospital.

227
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:57,071
The doctor told me. Cancer.

228
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,409
He said if I'd seen him
in the beginning...

229
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:06,455
...I probably could've survived.

230
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:12,294
But there's a fear,
like nothing I've ever felt before.

231
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:17,800
It comes over you when you know
that there's something really wrong.

232
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:24,807
For four months, I did nothing.

233
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,144
I was so terrified
of what I didn't know.

234
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,981
So terrified that I was paralysed.

235
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:40,823
The longer that went on,
the more terrified I got.

236
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:46,745
Wanting to know the truth, but
being too afraid to find the answers.

237
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:08,017
Go ahead.

238
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:13,022
Run all the tests you want.

239
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:23,949
What I'm about to tell you,
you may find difficult to believe.

240
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:28,120
Arvin, I know
that Jean Briault is a friend.

241
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:30,122
Yes. He's a friend.

242
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:34,460
A friend of yours.
But not of the Alliance.

243
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:42,259
The other man in the photo
is your friend, Jean Briault.

244
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:48,724
This only means that Khasinau
and Briault know each other.

245
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:51,727
This... Nothing more.

246
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:59,151
On the left is a brokerage account
in the name of Briault's wife.

247
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:04,657
On the right, a holding company
that Khasinau uses to launder money.

248
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,827
Five deposits
in excess of $45 million

249
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,955
were made into the account
in the past three months.

250
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:16,418
Arvin, I would not have made
this trip if I did not truly believe

251
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:19,505
that Khasinau
had infiltrated the Alliance.

252
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:23,759
And that Briault was in his pocket.

253
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:28,931
No. I was in Chile with this man
under Allende.

254
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,559
He recruited me.

255
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:35,438
On the other hand,

256
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:40,067
Briault's always seemed a good man.
He has served the Alliance well.

257
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:45,281
So maybe we should just... gamble.
Do nothing.

258
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:49,493
Just play it out
and see what happens.

259
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,495
If this vote goes the wrong way

260
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:57,293
because a member has been bought,
it would be the end of the Alliance.

261
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,256
But Briault, as you know,
is a famously cautious man.

262
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,926
The hit would have to be carried out
by someone who had access.

263
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,848
Someone that Briault
would agree to meet alone. A friend.

264
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:15,102
If the hit occurs, yes.

265
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:21,567
No. This can't be right.

266
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,487
There's another
explanation for this intel.

267
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,743
So, I appreciate your coming here
with this information, but...

268
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,167
...I can't believe
that Jean Briault is a traitor.

269
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,964
No one hopes you are right
more than I.

270
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,057
I'd like to welcome to Los Angeles
our friends from Washington.

271
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,352
I have always had a fascination
with the work of the DSR.

272
00:22:56,435 --> 00:23:01,857
Although inter-agency cooperation
is notoriously problematic,

273
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:07,071
I don't foresee any difficulty
while you're working in our offices.

274
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:12,743
I speak for everyone when I say
how much we appreciate your help.

275
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:16,831
That said, let me pay you
the courtesy of being blunt.

276
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,250
To date, our requests for files

277
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:23,295
more comprehensive than these,
have not been processed.

278
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,924
Those requests, Miss Evans,
are being assessed.

279
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,385
The directive
doesn't provide for that.

280
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,263
I don't mind you
coming to work with us...

281
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,766
Let's be clear. You don't work
with us, you work for us.

282
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,269
To presume you're in charge,
we have...

283
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:41,814
- The directive specifies...
- This is my office.

284
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:47,445
The directive gives you authority
to take her into custody.

285
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,738
But Sydney Bristow is well placed.

286
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:55,453
And she has provided the agency
with valuable intelligence.

287
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,582
I understand this so-called prophecy
is interesting,

288
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,377
and that these times
require us to be vigilant

289
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:06,005
against any threats
to our national security.

290
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:09,383
But let's take a step back
for a second.

291
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,844
This is a 500-year-old text.

292
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:17,057
Based on that text, we are treating
Agent Bristow like a lab rat.

293
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:19,643
I am all for being prudent...

294
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:26,275
... but what we're doing,
the way we're doing it, is absurd!

295
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:35,284
We should investigate, yes.
But not persecute.

296
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:44,668
Dissenting might not be the best
move, but I need to say something.

297
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,757
Steven Haladki.
Domestic Resources Division.

298
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,718
For months,
I've been worried about Bristow.

299
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:55,429
My concern was
that Michael Vaughn

300
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:58,390
was too emotionally involved,
which I still contest.

301
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:01,310
Then I became concerned
about Bristow herself.

302
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:05,106
In her file, there are discrepancies
and significant questions.

303
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:09,193
For example, she met with a Rambaldi
disciple on the Amalfi coast

304
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:12,029
at exactly the time
his death was prophecised.

305
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:17,993
Now, after reading what
Rambaldi's written about Bristow,

306
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,829
excuse me, but I am terrified.

307
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:23,958
Haladki, you are assuming
that Rambaldi's prophecy is accurate

308
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:27,711
- and that he's referring to Bristow.
- Say Rambaldi was wrong,

309
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:31,382
or that it wasn't Bristow
he was talking about. Fantastic.

310
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:35,052
But we're testing her to see
if she has the physical anomalies

311
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:38,514
that Rambaldi mentions.
It's like 666, guys!

312
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:41,851
You see it on the kid's scalp,
you know there's problems.

313
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,735
- Thanks for coming.
- Are you alright?

314
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,489
This prophecy, do you know
anything about it? What it says?

315
00:25:55,573 --> 00:26:00,327
No. The DSR was close to a panic
when they had half of it decoded.

316
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,289
- They cracked the rest today.
- I wanted to ask.

317
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:06,208
They need a code key.
Do they have the right one?

318
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,961
The DSR spent years
trying to decipher this.

319
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:12,256
The key they're using
is one they reverse engineered.

320
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:19,513
If the DSR is misreading that text,
they'll take me into custody,

321
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:22,475
which will blow my cover with SD-6.

322
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,394
And, probably yours.

323
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:32,526
- You want Rambaldi's code key?
- If it exists.

324
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,989
It does. But the agency won't
go after it, for political reasons.

325
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:42,286
- Dad, what does that mean?
- The code key is in the Vatican.

326
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,874
- Think what this means for Sydney.
- I know.

327
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:48,918
Doing nothing isn't an option.

328
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:52,630
I can't authorise an operation
that goes against the DSR's work.

329
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:55,382
- Classify it as recon.
- Langley won't approve.

330
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,510
The DSR is being irresponsible.

331
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,553
You don't have to attack the DSR.

332
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:02,056
Those bastards
have taken over this office.

333
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:05,810
- Then prove them wrong.
- Langley is watching us closely.

334
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:09,855
It's a discretionary op.
You're arguing semantics with me.

335
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:16,112
If she weren't my daughter,
I wouldn't be fighting for this.

336
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:19,281
I know this prophecy
is special access,

337
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,368
but those who have it
might be misreading that text.

338
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:26,664
I'd go, but Sloane's
headed to London.

339
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:31,460
I'm overseeing operations while he's
away. You know that's an opportunity.

340
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,839
So, Ben...

341
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,134
...I need your help on this.

342
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:19,175
- Hello?
- Edward, it's Arvin.

343
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:22,595
- Any news?
- We can't risk Briault.

344
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:26,599
Please don't talk about this
with anyone.

345
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:30,186
- Don't share your intel.
- Alright.

346
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:35,065
I've decided to take care
of our problem myself.

347
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,526
I understand.

348
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:48,037
You'll break into the Vatican?

349
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,705
The last thing I'm gonna do

350
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,376
while the DSR is waiting
for test results is sit on my ass.

351
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,544
But the Vatican?

352
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,671
The secret archives.
I have a number.

353
00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:01,258
They don't know the form
the code key's in. Could be anything.

354
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,763
I called you cos I need
a partner for this op.

355
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:07,056
Someone I can trust.

356
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,977
We'd have to fly out
separately, undercover.

357
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,562
We have to leave tonight.

358
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,692
You in?

359
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:28,828
Yeah. I'll break into
the Vatican with you.

360
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:39,046
His parents named him
after steak. Kobe.

361
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,299
- They saw it on a Japanese menu.
- I didn't know that.

362
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,469
He's perfect for me.
Plays ball and named after food.

363
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:50,057
You know what would be excellent
about leaving?

364
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:53,519
- We might get to see the game.
- I'm not going half done.

365
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:55,688
- She's obsessed.
- You think?

366
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:59,608
So, did that thing come true?
The dream?

367
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,444
The prophecy.

368
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:07,366
Not yet. I gotta go.
I gotta make my plane.

369
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,910
Have a great time.
I'll see you whenever.

370
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:13,289
Where's corporate banking
taking you this time?

371
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,792
Boston.

372
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:17,937
I was thinking we're in Rome,
the city of Trattoria di Nardi.

373
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,146
What's that?

374
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,690
My favourite restaurant
in the world.

375
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,567
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

376
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:40,209
- Why is Trattoria di Nardi so good?
- It's only good if you like food.

377
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:42,962
Did you know Kobe Bryant
was named for a steak?

378
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,380
Yeah, I did.

379
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:48,175
- The explosion triggers the alarm.
- It's on a 15-second delay.

380
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:51,762
You said you can disarm it in under
20 seconds. How far under 20?

381
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:53,889
I work better under pressure.

382
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:04,525
Later tonight, when we get the code
key, maybe we can check it out.

383
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,112
- The restaurant?
- It's almost too good not to.

384
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,781
Unless SD-6 spots us there
and has us killed.

385
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:14,118
The food's so good
it's almost worth the risk.

386
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,336
OK, it's set. Let's go.

387
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:30,968
Ready?

388
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:19,266
Pope Alexander VI.
Rambaldi was his chief architect.

389
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,936
Rambaldi hid his real work
in ordinary things.

390
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:23,687
The code is in this painting.

391
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:27,358
- We don't have time to take it.
- Wait a minute.

392
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:29,693
Give me the flashlight.

393
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:36,575
Begin with the 11 th letter,

394
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,704
three rows of 16 along the X axis
and another 43. This is it.

395
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,332
- This is the code key.
- Alright. I got it.

396
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:09,316
He's sending for backup.
We've gotta move!

397
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:20,411
Poole was here. Is he with us?

398
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,874
Where the hell's Sydney?

399
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,001
I believe she's at the university.

400
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:35,217
We got word from Kleinhoff. There's
a counterfeit page in the manuscript.

401
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,220
- Counterfeit?
- Page 47. There's nothing on it.

402
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,847
We had it tested.

403
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:43,976
It doesn't match the other pages
in the manuscript.

404
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,979
Number 47 had special significance
for Rambaldi.

405
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:49,899
In his writings, page 47
had critical information.

406
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:54,236
- I wanna know why we don't have it.
- I'll tell Sydney when she comes in.

407
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:57,448
Her schoolwork is a liability, Jack.

408
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,618
She's familiar with your opinion.

409
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,913
Her education is important to her.

410
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:06,415
She needs to examine her priorities.

411
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:11,003
You're leaving for London
a day early.

412
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,756
I believe we have
the necessary votes.

413
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:18,928
When I get back, the Alliance will
officially be at war with Khasinau.

414
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:22,389
Follow up with Kleinhoff
while I'm gone.

415
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,725
I want to know
what happened to that page.

416
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:28,604
- Done.
- Tell Sydney that we need to talk.

417
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:19,113
Look at us, Jean. Two old men.

418
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:22,616
I feel younger now
than I ever felt when I was 18.

419
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,953
With age, I've become
more comfortable.

420
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:29,123
Listen, Jean,
I want to apologise to you

421
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:32,001
for asking you
to keep this so secret

422
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:39,008
but this business that we have
to discuss is extremely sensitive.

423
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:42,136
Look, while I am intrigued,

424
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:47,683
right now, I am more interested
in my new grandson.

425
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:52,563
Eight pounds, nine ounces. He's big.

426
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:55,441
He has my chin.

427
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:58,319
But he's better looking than me.

428
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,791
What is it?

429
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:47,660
We have suffered another tragedy
in what is already a difficult time.

430
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:50,162
I would like to observe
a moment of silence

431
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:52,832
for our friend and colleague,
Jean Briault.

432
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,384
We come together today
to make a decision.

433
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,220
Alexander Khasinau is our enemy.

434
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:09,807
He and his operatives
are a powerful force.

435
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:15,229
Aggressive, brutal. We've coexisted
with our opposition for years,

436
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:18,399
so the choice is clear.

437
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:22,611
Either we choose
to respond with force,

438
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:26,574
equally sharing the burden of cost,
manpower and equipment,

439
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:29,243
or we choose
to seek a diplomatic détente.

440
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,832
So, let us now vote.

441
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:47,803
Six votes to five. We have resolved
to reject aggressive action.

442
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:51,265
We will now seek,
through all diplomatic channels,

443
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:56,771
contacts with Mr Khasinau.
Once they have been established...

444
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:11,660
It wasn't Briault getting paid off
by Khasinau. It was you.

445
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:14,497
You doctored the photos,
the accounts.

446
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,751
Arvin, you're upset.
You've lost a friend.

447
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:22,713
Our conversations weren't recorded.
We talked on secure lines.

448
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:25,049
You made sure
I met Briault in secret.

449
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:27,843
You used me.

450
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:31,180
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

451
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,226
I will repay the favour.

452
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:42,566
Give my regards to Emily.

453
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:22,690
- How was your flight?
- OK.

454
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,358
- Sent the pictures?
- Yes.

455
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,903
Soon we'll know exactly
what Rambaldi wrote. The truth.

456
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:31,615
- It's the only defence you need.
- I know.

457
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:35,870
They agreed to wait on the encryption
before taking any action.

458
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:37,830
Why don't you go home and relax?

459
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,874
This insanity is almost over.

460
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:44,211
Next time we're in Rome,
Trattoria di Nardi.

461
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:47,840
I'd like that.

462
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:35,596
How was your trip?

463
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,016
It was great!
How did your thing with Kobe go?

464
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,395
- He was ignoring me.
- I won't be part of your delusions.

465
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:46,273
Kobe so loves me. He loves me.

466
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:23,227
I just remembered I have a phone call
to make to Hong Kong.

467
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,645
It'll take me a while.

468
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,814
We're going to The Pantry.
We'll wait.

469
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:30,151
No, go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

470
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:33,154
You've gotta come,
because she's driving me nuts.

471
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:35,739
- Shut up!
- I'm serious.

472
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,805
- Vaughn?
- Sydney, listen.

473
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:01,932
Pursuant to national security,

474
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:05,352
you are now in the custody
of the federal government.

475
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:09,190
- What the hell is going on?
- I promise, we'll figure this out.

476
00:43:09,273 --> 00:43:11,567
What about the code key?
What happened?

477
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,486
The CIA had the same key.

478
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:16,322
- They broke the code correctly.
- What?

479
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:17,948
The medical tests you took,

480
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:21,911
they wanted to match three physical
anomalies Rambaldi mentioned.

481
00:43:21,994 --> 00:43:26,916
DNA sequencing, platlet levels
and the size of your heart.

482
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,085
You match all three.

483
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:31,962
What does the prophecy say?

484
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:40,596
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks."

485
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:44,225
"Signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works."

486
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:50,272
"Bind them with fury.
A burning anger. Unless prevented,

487
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:54,485
at vulgar cost, this woman
will render the greatest power

488
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:56,153
unto utter desolation."
