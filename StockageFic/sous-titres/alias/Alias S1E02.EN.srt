1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:03,813
Seven years ago,
I was recruited to work for SD-6,

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,649
which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:10,361
I was trained as a spy,
warned not to tell anyone what I did.

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,822
I thought I was working
for the good guys

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:16,450
until I told my fiancé about SD-6,
and they had him killed.

6
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,494
That's when I learned the truth,

7
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:21,747
that SD-6 is part of the enemy
I thought I was fighting.

8
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:25,918
Now, I'm a double agent, working
with the real CIA to bring down SD-6.

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:30,923
My only ally is another double agent,
a man I hardly know. My father.

10
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:41,887
That was three years ago when
I met him first, Leonard Dreifuss.

11
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,682
He helps bankroll SD-6 operations.

12
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:47,476
This guy's very hands-on.

13
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,312
Not just in this business.
He's a real slime.

14
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,189
He runs a division in Geneva.

15
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:55,192
A transport guy,
he'll get anything, anywhere fast.

16
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,528
Sloane relies on him,
he's a big target.

17
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,990
- OK. Listen.
- A Memphis crew provides firearms.

18
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:03,617
- Graphite, titanium, plastics.
- Memphis?

19
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:06,537
Memphis, Egypt.
I just started work with you guys,

20
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,873
but if we're gonna bring down SD-6,

21
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,168
we have to eliminate
their source of arms, Ineni Hassan,

22
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,670
Three of Her Majesty's favourites.

23
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,721
And now, the new design,
as I promised.

24
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,476
I named it the Benni,
that's my son's name.

25
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,854
It holds 12 rounds
and it's semiautomatic.

26
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,699
What the hell is this?

27
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,551
No!

28
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,065
That was... Sorry.

29
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,904
I'm sorry you had to see that.

30
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,447
That was six months ago.

31
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,201
I have friends from the Middle East.
Hassan's not one of them.

32
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:29,912
- I don't blame you. Listen.
- There's more.

33
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:32,623
A geneticist in Kuala Lumpur, he...

34
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,292
OK, stop. You have to listen to me
now. OK?

35
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,295
We're talking about the plan,
I'm giving it to you.

36
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,089
I'm giving you the plan.

37
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,509
Tomorrow you're back at SD-6,
nothing should change.

38
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:47,555
You'll detail your mission
on a paper bag. Bag.

39
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,433
Then you'll call this number.
Memorise it.

40
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:52,393
After three tones press a digit.

41
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:56,188
1-6, each corresponds to a trash can
at a specific location.

42
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:59,442
We'll review your information,
create a counter-mission.

43
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:04,071
We'll contact you posing as a wrong
number, Joey's Pizza. Any questions?

44
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:07,241
Yeah. Can you show me what
a bag looks like again?

45
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:10,578
You listen to me.
I appreciate what your job is,

46
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,455
even if you're too young for it,

47
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,791
to establish a protocol between
the CIA and their agent.

48
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,253
But I'm not here to pick up
Langley procedure.

49
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:22,798
I am here for one reason only
and that is to destroy SD-6.

50
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,383
- Hey!
- Then I am out.

51
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:29,180
I want no more spy crap, that's why
I went to you in the first place.

52
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:34,810
I will hand you, in record time, the
people who will render SD-6 useless.

53
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:37,313
- Record time?
- Two months, tops.

54
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,607
And then I am out. I walk.

55
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,699
Draw me a map.

56
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:53,496
Draw me an SD-6 map, all its allies,
how far you think it reaches.

57
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,374
- Do I look like I'm in junior high?
- Just draw me an SD-6 family tree.

58
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,586
- Do you see a retainer?
- Just do it!

59
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:32,451
What's your problem with me?
Maybe it's that I'm a woman.

60
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:35,788
Maybe you don't like my attitude,
I am sorry about that,

61
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,541
but I really don't feel
like wasting time here.

62
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:42,962
There is only one way we're going
to immobilise SD-6 and that's my way.

63
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:46,090
So forgive me for being
forthright or female,

64
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,260
but this is how it's gonna be.

65
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:27,590
Since I've been at the CIA,
I've only seen this map grow.

66
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,009
This is what
you're in the middle of.

67
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,219
If shutting down
the LA cell was all,

68
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,847
we would have raided
that office years ago.

69
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,808
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster,

70
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,394
this is about killing the monster.

71
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,063
The work ahead of you,
your father's work,

72
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:47,443
it's complicated, it's political,
and it is long-term.

73
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,952
- Here, memorise this.
- I did.

74
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,830
OK. I guess we'll wait
to hear from you.

75
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,626
Hey, wait.

76
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,265
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

77
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:33,948
- Hey, see you in class.
- For sure.

78
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,328
- Look, this one's chipped.
- That's OK.

79
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:24,832
That's one of my mom's.

80
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,168
OK. These are heavy.

81
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:32,631
Put this down right... right here.

82
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:34,925
No problem.

83
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,012
- Thank you.
- That's almost it.

84
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,475
- I'll need a massage later.
- OK. Good to know.

85
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:44,477
- Finally.
- I know, I'm sorry.

86
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,605
Litvack called and I had to rewrite
The Parking Lot.

87
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,774
- They had no horseradish.
- Cool.

88
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:53,778
- That's annoying.
- There's a woman eating newspaper.

89
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,362
- Eating?
- She's pregnant.

90
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,740
It's a condition some get before...

91
00:09:57,823 --> 00:10:02,161
- Eating newspaper's a condition?
- Yeah. This is how I make a living.

92
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:05,915
And Litvack says my writing's
judgemental. Who cares?

93
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,833
She's gonna swallow it.

94
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,961
- What are you doing Thursday?
- Probably rewriting.

95
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,922
Charlie got an offer.

96
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,383
Hey, that's great. Where?

97
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:20,054
Fleming Letterman. That's
corporate law, downtown office.

98
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,180
I heard of that.

99
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,432
Dinner Thursday, you are required.

100
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,893
I'm totally there. Congratulations.

101
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:40,574
Hey. Do you want...?
Do you want any food?

102
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:44,411
Yeah. I just want to do the closets
first so I feel like I live here.

103
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,456
Here.

104
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,166
Thanks.

105
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,181
- Syd, I can't take it.
- Will, let's not do this.

106
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,809
- You know, I can't let this go.
- Will, come on.

107
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,479
- You took Amy's passport and...
- I know what happened.

108
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm spinning, Syd.

109
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,870
It's the bank.

110
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:30,166
What was going on with Danny,
was he in trouble?

111
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,292
I need you to...

112
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,627
- Shut up?
- Accept what I've told you.

113
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:37,756
- You've told me nothing.
- I started imagining things.

114
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,427
Maybe you're not imagining it.
Syd, this is what I do.

115
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,555
- I may find something the police...
- Stop it!

116
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,933
Please.

117
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:50,978
I'm trying to move on here.

118
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,398
I need your help to do that.

119
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:00,571
OK?

120
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,820
- Miss Bristow.
- Hey, Marshall.

121
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,448
I don't get overly personal,
I don't like to cross that line.

122
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:48,244
You probably don't notice,
but I'm not much of a social person.

123
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:51,122
I like myself,
I mean, I enjoy myself,

124
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,166
it's just I don't feel pressure
when I'm by my...

125
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,918
Do you ever feel that?

126
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,170
You can say anything you want to me.

127
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:03,551
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm really sorry about your fiancé.

128
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,137
And it's nice to have you back.

129
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,766
Thanks.

130
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,901
Let's start with what we know.
We've received two pieces of intel.

131
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:24,113
First is this memo
from GRU headquarters.

132
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:27,450
It seems certain files
were reported missing last week

133
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,493
from the 7th floor of the Aquarium.

134
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,663
- That's Foreign Intelligence.
- Then we got the second.

135
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,250
Abul-Hasayn Navor,
military attaché from Sudan,

136
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,752
whom you'll remember from last year.

137
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:41,630
He's on his way to Moscow
to meet these two men,

138
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:45,217
Kazamir Shcherbakov
and Luri Karpachev,

139
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,762
both ID'd as members
of the Russian Mafia.

140
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,097
We think they stole the documents.

141
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,058
The codes indicate
that these lost documents

142
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:56,937
pertain to the Soviet-American
nuclear arsenal during the Cold War.

143
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,857
Buying 20-year-old
intelligence records. Why?

144
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,111
That's the part we don't know.
You're leaving tomorrow morning.

145
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:08,282
The job is to prevent the transaction
and retrieve the stolen files.

146
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:12,787
- Marshall, tell us what you got.
- OK. Who here has trouble

147
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,206
falling asleep at night?

148
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,544
Well, anyway, myself on occasion.

149
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,215
I find it difficult to nod off,
mind racing, ideas, et cetera.

150
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,926
This kind of pertains
to the sleeping thing.

151
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:30,179
I created this just for Navor. Now...

152
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:34,016
You take this little round thing
here, it's pretty cool,

153
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,977
and you just touch it
with your finger or your...

154
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,772
Barely touch it
and you're knocked out.

155
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,525
It's like free-basing
Thorazine, boom!

156
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,610
You only get two times on this.

157
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:48,155
It only works twice, so you don't
want to use it three times.

158
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:52,576
- Do we need to wear those gloves?
- No, you can make it a nice ring,

159
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,122
or perhaps an attractive cuff link.

160
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:58,457
I'm wearing gloves
cos I touched this

161
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,044
the other day, knocked my head
and was out for 20 minutes.

162
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,005
You can see the...
Right, but that's not...

163
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,885
I'm trying to be Pavlovian about
these puppies. No pun intended.

164
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,347
- They keep coming back.
- You mean Navor?

165
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:16,058
How is that man
able to walk after Atbarah?

166
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:19,270
- It'd be him or someone else.
- Let it be someone else.

167
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:23,149
We kill ourselves,
but the bad people keep coming back.

168
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,570
- Sydney, do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course.

169
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,196
I'll be in tech ops.

170
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,199
It'll take you some time
to adjust to being back.

171
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:34,410
I want to make sure you're alright.

172
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:35,828
I'm fine, thanks.

173
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:39,123
Good. I need to show you something.

174
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:48,549
I'll leave you two alone.

175
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,227
It's OK, the room's clean.
No-one's listening.

176
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,272
- Hello, Sydney.
- What is this?

177
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:07,443
I'm here to tell you what you
already know. That I work for SD-6.

178
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:09,779
- Or so they think. Sloane did this.
- Why?

179
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:12,948
Because it will facilitate
what we're doing,

180
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,034
if they know that you know.

181
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,875
It wouldn't hurt if you acted
surprised when you left the office.

182
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:37,681
Since I've known the truth
about you...

183
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:43,479
...l've asked myself questions,
thousands of questions...

184
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,650
...but this one I have to ask you now.

185
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:52,738
When Danny was killed...

186
00:16:56,408 --> 00:17:00,037
Dad... did you know?

187
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,711
Did you know that's
what they were going to do?

188
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,091
Yes.

189
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:25,938
Don't you ever speak to me again!

190
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,709
Abul-Hasayn Navor
is attempting to purchase files

191
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,587
stolen from the Russian Government.

192
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,550
Sloane is sending us to Moscow to
prevent Navor from getting the files.

193
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:00,347
Dixon will impersonate Navor.

194
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:05,770
My job is to break into Navor's hotel
room and take the money for the buy.

195
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:08,689
So, what's next?

196
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:42,348
- Hello.
- Joey's Pizza?

197
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:47,228
I'm sorry,
you've got the wrong number.

198
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:03,869
- It's me.
- How are you doing?

199
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,288
How am I doing?
Things have been better.

200
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:09,834
I'm working with friends
who have no idea who they work for.

201
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,753
- Sloane had you meet your father?
- Yes, he did.

202
00:19:12,837 --> 00:19:15,005
So what's my countermission?

203
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:18,134
Navor's been short-listed
for six months.

204
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:20,678
He attempted to purchase
a nuke from Libya.

205
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,138
You knew about Moscow?

206
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,348
No, we didn't. Thank you for that.

207
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,517
Don't mention it.

208
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:31,397
- That was cold. So what's my move?
- Carry out your assignment.

209
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,359
Get the documents. When you get
back make sure you hold the files.

210
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:38,279
We'll execute two brush passes
at the airport.

211
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:39,864
The first at the gate.

212
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,741
We'll duplicate the material
and return them

213
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:45,161
in a second pass
at the airport kerb.

214
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,871
- That's it?
- That's it.

215
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:48,747
- Want a Slush-O?
- No, thanks.

216
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:52,626
- They're delicious.
- No, thanks. I said I was cold.

217
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,795
Good luck.

218
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,851
No, I can imagine.
That must have been devastating.

219
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:12,438
Did he say anything
after he drove over your cat?

220
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:15,649
Did he make any threats?

221
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,694
To you or your cat?
Sure. No, OK.

222
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,988
You have my number at the paper.
OK. Bye.

223
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:23,073
- A man ran over his cat.
- I understand.

224
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,825
People drive over cats!

225
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,369
- You never answered my question.
- Which?

226
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,206
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Jenny, you're 19.

227
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,792
- I'm 20.
- I'm not having this conversation.

228
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:37,171
I'm ancient compared to you.
Look how red my eyes are.

229
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:42,218
- You don't look too bad.
- Pull me that file on Daniel Hecht.

230
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,931
- What, that murder? Your friend?
- Yeah, do you mind?

231
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,558
- No.
- Thanks.

232
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:54,063
- You don't take me seriously?
- No, I don't.

233
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:15,876
- Dixon, do you copy?
- Wow, that's loud.

234
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,046
You told Marshall you wanted
it louder, I was there.

235
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,382
OK, my headache and I are 10-17.

236
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,010
- Break a leg.
- You, too.

237
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:49,869
- I'm on 15.
- Get the cash quickly.

238
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,037
That is the plan.

239
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:25,029
Shcherbakov and Karpachev
just showed up.

240
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,072
Standing by for your call.

241
00:22:56,352 --> 00:23:01,065
Wow! The bodyguard's out, Navor's in
the shower. I'm going for the money.

242
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,903
Move fast, they've spotted me.

243
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,163
- Are you my Sudanese friend?
- Mr Shcherbakov?

244
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:18,499
Karpachev. I'm the handsome one.

245
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,963
- No protection with you?
- Why? Should I not feel safe here?

246
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:28,634
Here? Here you should feel very
safe, yes. Come, let's sit down.

247
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:46,318
I know the guy who owns this club.

248
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:50,865
He thinks I brag too much.
It's true, I do.

249
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:53,117
Yes, I brag too much.

250
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:08,340
That's the problem with Sudan,
there is no place for fun.

251
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:11,302
It's a nice change,
being out of the Sudan.

252
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,053
You said you travel often.

253
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:18,184
Yes... but not often enough.

254
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:27,485
I can see you don't have the money
with you. Is that correct?

255
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:31,864
No, not at the moment.
But the money is very close.

256
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:16,700
I've got bad news.

257
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:19,662
Dixon, this wasn't a buy,
it was a hold-up.

258
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:22,164
There's no money here.

259
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:25,334
- Fantastic.
- What?

260
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:30,005
The vodka.

261
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:41,225
Dixon, don't panic.

262
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:50,151
I'll be there in two minutes.

263
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,288
Any word from her?

264
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:06,125
No, I don't expect to hear
anything till she gets back.

265
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,962
- Your girlfriend is Alice?
- Shut up.

266
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:11,881
- I'm just checking.
- Get out.

267
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:13,048
OK. Alright.

268
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,972
I'm in the bar.

269
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,641
I can see you.

270
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:31,734
Are those the files?
If they are, cough.

271
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:38,699
Are they documents?

272
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:40,868
Are they on disk?

273
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:44,830
How many?

274
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,130
Get ready to make a switch.

275
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:04,433
Just like a drug deal.

276
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:10,064
Would you like to taste the coke?

277
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:12,691
How do I know
you haven't made copies?

278
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,819
Those disks are encrypted.

279
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,169
OK, enough nonsense.
Where's the money?

280
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,006
- Stay here, I'll go get the cash.
- Sounds good.

281
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,884
Who are you?

282
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:42,513
At first I thought Navor sent you.
Now I don't even think that.

283
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,890
Two three-and-a-halfers. Move fast!

284
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:29,185
Use the 3rd and 4th copies.
It'll take about 90 seconds.

285
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:32,605
- We're talking seconds.
- I hope they're not corrupted.

286
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:44,700
- Moving to the main terminal.
- We know. We're doing what we can.

287
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,794
Let me see that data as soon
as it goes up. I'm seeing it.

288
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,927
- We got it. Give me the other one.
- Come on!

289
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:45,446
So he says,
"I asked for butter an hour ago."

290
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:48,866
I'm thinking,
"No, you asked the other black girl,

291
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:51,035
you rich entitled son of a bitch."

292
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:54,663
Some people go out,
this is my theory, to abuse waiters.

293
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,665
- No question.
- Creepy, isn't it?

294
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:58,167
There are bad people.

295
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,668
Hello.

296
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:03,005
Sorry I'm late.
This is for the offer.

297
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:06,675
- And for helping me move.
- Thank you. Wow, look at this.

298
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,677
Now we have drink when you come.

299
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:11,847
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

300
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,227
I'll be right back.

301
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:23,442
What's going on?

302
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:26,695
We've known each other
for three years. Confirm that.

303
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:27,780
Yes.

304
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:31,617
It feels a lot longer, right?
We know each other pretty well.

305
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,202
Yeah, we do.

306
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:35,996
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

307
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,208
- And you know I'm a curious guy.
- Will, what did you do?

308
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,627
- You gave me no info on Danny.
- Oh, God!

309
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,173
I looked around a little bit and
I found out a piece of information,

310
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:48,676
which you might not know,
but maybe you do.

311
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,302
What?

312
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,888
The night that Danny was killed...

313
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,893
Did you know that he was booked
on a flight from LAX to Singapore?

314
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:06,026
- Yeah. I knew that.
- You did? You knew that?

315
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,362
Yeah.
Danny had a medical conference.

316
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:13,200
He wanted me to fly out, meet him
afterwards, have a week in Bali.

317
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,420
I spend all day, every day,

318
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:27,465
trying not to see him
the way I found him.

319
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:32,970
And I know you mean well,
and I love you for that,

320
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:37,850
but please, let this go. Please.

321
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,935
- Syd, I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

322
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:42,521
I get it, I won't bring it up again.

323
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:45,608
OK. I just need a minute.

324
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,071
- Syd, I feel horrible.
- No, it's OK.

325
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,657
I'll be right there, OK?

326
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,791
OK.

327
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:11,675
Doomsday Six. That was the name
of the operation.

328
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,637
During the Cold War,
six armed nuclear weapons

329
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,014
were smuggled into
and buried in the USA.

330
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:20,810
In December '89 this was disclosed
to the US Government.

331
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:23,938
The bombs were quickly
recovered and disarmed.

332
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,482
- That was the info on the disks?
- No.

333
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:30,611
They revealed a seventh nuke,
buried still, right now, in the US.

334
00:33:30,694 --> 00:33:32,279
- Where?
- We don't know yet.

335
00:33:32,363 --> 00:33:35,741
Those disks were encoded
with a sectional encryption.

336
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:39,912
Analysis is still working on it,
this is all we've got so far.

337
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:46,335
Milovich lvanov,
Buckingham, Virginia. Who's he?

338
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:50,047
We assume he's the man Navor was
looking for. He has no file.

339
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,842
- You think he's minding the nuke.
- Yes, I do.

340
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,511
Go to that address,
report back on lvanov.

341
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:59,807
Any aliases, where he lives, works,
what he drinks, the whole deal.

342
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,856
Thanks.

343
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:13,070
- Yeah?
- I'm going to see Ivanov.

344
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:14,780
Who?

345
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,824
Sydney? Sydney!

346
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:19,618
We have a name and address,
we can't sit on it.

347
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:22,079
Sir, we cannot move
on that information.

348
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,330
We can and we will.

349
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:26,167
We are risking her place in SD-6
and her life.

350
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,170
That may be,
and we might sacrifice a double.

351
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:33,382
- She's going to see a sleeper agent!
- It's a nuclear weapon.

352
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:36,385
Do you expect me
to wait until she contacts us?

353
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,220
Have you read her file?

354
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:41,515
Do it. You'll learn that
she's an asset doing our work.

355
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,477
- She was supposed to contact you.
- She couldn't.

356
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,354
If we send in a team,
we risk blowing her cover.

357
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:49,106
We can't afford to do that.

358
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,941
- Read her file.
- I've read it.

359
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:57,281
- What do you want?
- Five hours. Give her five hours.

360
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:01,494
- Five hours.
- Thank you.

361
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,294
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

362
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:14,131
Balls of steel. That's what I'm
going to call you from now on.

363
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,550
Hey, have you met Balls of Steel?

364
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:34,939
We've got a red wire, a yellow,
a blue, a blue-white, a white!

365
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:39,110
A black, a white-black, an orange,
a purple, a purple-white...

366
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:43,572
- OK. Cut the blue-white wire.
- Cutting the blue-white wire. OK.

367
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,699
- Hold!
- Don't tell me to hold.

368
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:49,078
- I'm sitting on a ticking nuke!
- Are there two timers or one?

369
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,413
Just... I only see one.

370
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:53,958
Alright, try the blue wire.

371
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,753
- Try it?!
- No, cut it!

372
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:17,940
Hello?

373
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:25,990
You called SD-6 instead of the CIA.
You should've called me.

374
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:29,160
- What would you have done?
- Access scientists.

375
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,954
- I had two minutes!
- You didn't contact us.

376
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:34,623
- I did contact you!
- You are irresponsible.

377
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:37,960
Yes, SD-6 has a nuke,
and, yes, it's my fault.

378
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,504
After I called,
SD-6 knew I'd found it.

379
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,923
But we'll track it and steal it back.

380
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,009
It's in Cairo.

381
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,762
- What?
- When SD-6 picked up our nuke,

382
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:49,930
they put it on a plane to Egypt.

383
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:53,934
Are you ready for this?
They sold the thing to Ineni Hassan.

384
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,948
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

385
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:13,162
Reflected on both our records, FYI.

386
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:23,255
- What?
- I've been there, Hassan's.

387
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,299
- I can go back.
- No, can't do it.

388
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:28,427
- Why not?
- It will get back to Sloane.

389
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:31,514
We'll just have to make sure
they never see me.

390
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,292
Thanks for meeting me here.

391
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,713
I'm sorry about hitting you.

392
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,758
- You're off to Cairo. Devlin said.
- Yeah.

393
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:11,137
That's why I had them call you.
I need your help.

394
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,056
SD-6 can't know
that's where I'm going.

395
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,474
I'll take care of it.

396
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:21,313
Dad.

397
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,025
It was you, wasn't it?

398
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:30,531
Who bought the ticket...
to Singapore.

399
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:38,622
You were in Taipei.

400
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:44,920
I'd arranged a flight for you as
well. You could've gone anywhere.

401
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:52,595
I went to Danny's apartment,
except I got there too late.

402
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,849
Just minutes too late.

403
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:07,777
Thank you.

404
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:21,248
I have to go... obviously.

405
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:46,357
- I'm in operations. If Alice calls.
- I need you.

406
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,526
Yeah. I know.

407
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,736
Just call me if there's anything.

408
00:41:52,154 --> 00:41:54,615
- Let me say about Bristow.
- Don't bother.

409
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:58,410
Don't apologise, you're not
in trouble, it was my call.

410
00:41:58,494 --> 00:42:01,455
She is intimately familiar
with the Hassan base.

411
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,125
She'll disable the weapon,
we're all over it.

412
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:08,587
You don't have to be. You're being
pulled off the Bristow case.

413
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:10,714
What? Why?

414
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:14,135
Devlin wants a more senior officer.
You were right.

415
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:16,303
This girl is pretty important to us.

416
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,806
- Yeah, I know.
- He wants you to oversee

417
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:22,226
the presentation at
the DCI non-proliferation meeting.

418
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:26,188
Which under the circumstances
is pretty ironic.

419
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:32,111
Yeah?

420
00:42:32,194 --> 00:42:34,280
Yeah, send him in.

421
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:45,166
- You heard from Sydney?
- Yeah. What's wrong?

422
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:48,043
She went up north.
She just needed to get away.

423
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,837
- Is she OK?
- She will be.

424
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,674
I think it's hard for her,
accepting the news about what I do.

425
00:42:55,217 --> 00:42:58,179
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, of course. Why?

426
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,849
I don't know, you seem a little...

427
00:43:04,226 --> 00:43:06,228
What?

428
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,731
Nothing.

429
00:43:08,814 --> 00:43:10,900
Nothing.

430
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:14,779
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. OK.

431
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,462
I'm in.

432
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:07,873
- I think I found it.
- Copy.

433
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:15,631
- Yeah, I found it.
- Copy. Commence disabling.

434
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:35,526
Open. I'm going for the core.

435
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:37,570
Radio silence until completed.

436
00:44:37,653 --> 00:44:41,198
Do you have to talk
like such a robotron?

437
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:44,702
- Radio silence requested.
- I guess you do.

438
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,543
Alright, robotron,
I'm holding the core.
