1
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:03,405
What about my father?

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:05,902
He knew how badly you wanted to
become field-rated.

3
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:08,404
And he thought it
was too dangerous,

4
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:11,453
so he made sure
it didn't happen.

5
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:15,453
We're going to my facility
in Nevada.

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,923
Project: Black Hole.

7
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,466
I've never heard
of Project: Black Hole.

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,042
This is everything
the government has collected

9
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:24,173
on or about Milo Rambaldi
since the 1940s.

10
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,934
A quarter of the artefacts
were collected by you,

11
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,343
and they're also
housed in Nevada.

12
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,635
You had an affair?

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,399
It was Irina Derevko.

14
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,597
Sydney's mother.

15
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:40,113
Are you telling me
Sydney is your daughter?

16
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:43,816
I never tried to prove it
one way or the other.

17
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,321
Sark's on Flight 0028.

18
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,897
It left Chateaudun
Air Force Base 12 hours ago.

19
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,985
They're due to arrive here
in two hours.

20
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:29,154
We're coordinating with security
to set up a perimeter

21
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,527
- around the airport.
- Good.

22
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,912
The Intelligence Committee
is sending Senator Reed to

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,079
oversee the interrogation.

24
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,291
Why the sudden interest
from Washington?

25
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,837
Sark is a key player now.

26
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:40,673
They expect us to bleed him dry.

27
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,336
Hold on a second.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,340
Robin, Steven.

29
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,337
Connor's dad's here.

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,387
- Bye, Dad.
- Later.

31
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:51,756
Heads.

32
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:54,390
Dad!
Connor's watching!

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,307
Go.

34
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,394
Sorry about that.

35
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,725
All information
concerning Sark's case

36
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,811
is being strictly
compartmentalised

37
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,232
within the task force.

38
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,564
If we have any operational leak
in the next few days,

39
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,065
we're gonna know it came
from inside the Rotunda.

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,236
Copy that.

41
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,679
How's it going?

42
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,317
I'm compiling
a list of questions

43
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:44,853
I plan on asking Sark
during his interrogation.

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,982
So, that's it?

45
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:52,820
Wasn't your father supposed
to arrive like an hour ago?

46
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,664
He went straight into a meeting

47
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,952
with Jack Bristow
and Director Dixon.

48
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,582
Are you gonna be okay
while he's here?

49
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:04,080
I guess I'm about to find out.

50
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,669
Washington's gone
to great lengths

51
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:11,177
to secure Mr. Sark's
extradition from the French.

52
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,388
They're expecting results.

53
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,433
And delivering them
will strengthen my case

54
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,975
when the appropriations bill
for your task force

55
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,685
comes before my committee
next month.

56
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,526
We appreciate your effort,
Senator.

57
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,988
Sark's transport will be
arriving at Dover Airfield

58
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,187
within the hour.

59
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,026
Agents Bristow and Weiss
are on site

60
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:31,280
to escort him into custody.

61
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,160
Based on recently
acquired intelligence,

62
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,534
we know Sark was promoted
to co-command

63
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:37,746
The Covenant's
North American operations.

64
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,534
It's imperative we learn
the identity of his associate.

65
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:44,255
Excuse me.

66
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,790
There you are.

67
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,793
Hello, Dad.
Good to see you.

68
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:49,917
Please sit, Lauren.

69
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,301
This concerns you as well.

70
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,014
Once Sark is in custody,

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,926
he will be transferred
to medical services

72
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,687
and prepped
for the Inferno protocol.

73
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,344
It's my understanding
that 50% of the test subjects

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,110
suffered cardiac arrest
during that procedure.

75
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,936
The United States
is not in the business

76
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,270
of torturing witnesses
for information.

77
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,281
Mr. Sark isn't being classified
as a prisoner of war.

78
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,818
He has no protections
under the Geneva Convention.

79
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:17,154
But given Sark's history
of selling out his employers,

80
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:18,825
is it even necessary?

81
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,327
He's likely to comply
quite willingly.

82
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:21,876
That may have been true
in the past.

83
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,630
He now has $800 million
invested in this organisation.

84
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,086
His loyalties will lie
with his money.

85
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:30,757
All relevant materials you have
should be turned over to Jack.

86
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,968
He'll be conducting
the interrogation.

87
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,546
This has been cleared
through your superiors.

88
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,847
Langley has requested
certain questions be included,

89
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:39,263
some of which
contain information

90
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,927
that exceeds
your classification level.

91
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,980
I understand.

92
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,812
I'll review this immediately.

93
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:52,319
Director Dixon.

94
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,902
Given Sark's importance
to The Covenant,

95
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,400
we can't rule out the
possibility of a rescue attempt.

96
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:57,361
Put her through.

97
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:58,949
Put Level 3
containment procedures

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,664
into effect immediately.

99
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,789
No, they're not sick.

100
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,920
I don't understand.

101
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,544
Their carpool
picked them up hours ago.

102
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,418
This cannot be good.

103
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,756
Sark was supposed
to land 20 minutes ago.

104
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,890
Agent Bristow here.

105
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:22,183
We're on our way.

106
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,228
Sark's plane just landed
in the desert

107
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,604
60 miles east of here.

108
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,589
Is the area secured?

109
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:50,622
Copy that.

110
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,338
No one's gotten on or off
the plane since it landed.

111
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,260
Sark's gone.

112
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,839
The plane landed on autopilot.

113
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,924
We checked the body count
against the crew manifest.

114
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:42,676
One of Sark's armed guards
was missing.

115
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,677
If Sark had an accomplice,
we have to assume

116
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,015
that he made it out alive.

117
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,564
The passengers were frozen,

118
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:50,020
indicating Sark may have
parachuted at altitude

119
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,568
Ieaving the cabin
depressurised.

120
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:53,360
Marshall's pulling
the satellite feeds.

121
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,189
If Sark punched out
within a 100-mile radius,

122
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,989
we should be able to narrow
our search.

123
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,023
Put together a team.

124
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,275
Be ready to move
on Marshall's lead.

125
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,781
Sydney and Weiss
are on their way back

126
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,450
with the flight recorders.

127
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,664
Steven and Robin didn't
show up at school.

128
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,543
I tried their cellphones.

129
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,464
I've traded calls
with relatives, friends.

130
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,291
Our neighbours.

131
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:16,625
The police.

132
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,628
It's Robin.
Thank God.

133
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,718
Where have you been?

134
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,717
We have your children.

135
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,850
They're safe,
and they will remain so,

136
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:30,104
assuming you follow
our demands precisely.

137
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,638
Our calculations
indicate The Covenant

138
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,928
abducted these children
between 8.30 and 8.45 a.m.

139
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,680
In exchange
for their safe return,

140
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,345
Sark is demanding
the release of these men.

141
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,897
Five Covenant operatives
currently in custody

142
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:16,528
apprehended within
the past year.

143
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,185
- We have 48 hours.
- That's impossible.

144
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:21,607
Aren't these prisoners being
held by different governments?

145
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,815
Yes, and even in the event

146
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,282
that we could coordinate the
release of these prisoners,

147
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,031
the diplomatic feat required
will take days,

148
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,202
if not longer.

149
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,915
We should begin working on

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,459
securing their release
immediately.

151
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,168
It's not that simple.

152
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,626
There's a reason we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

153
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,125
It sets a dangerous precedent.

154
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,051
As would not doing everything
to protect those children.

155
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,757
Who's to say that next week
the same organisation

156
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,764
won't target the children of
others working in Intelligence?

157
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,558
We are not discussing
some hypothetical.

158
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,600
The Covenant abducted
these hostages --

159
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:52,142
Steven and Robin.

160
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,306
I'm sorry?

161
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,938
Their names.

162
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,609
I only suggest that,

163
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:08,700
for the safety
of all of our families,

164
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,039
we may need to find
an alternative.

165
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,406
Anyone else?

166
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:16,076
Marshall is analysing the
data recorder from the plane.

167
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,500
It may give us a lead.

168
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,540
May I also suggest
we at least begin negotiations

169
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,427
with the countries
holding these prisoners?

170
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,137
Whether or not we trade,

171
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,381
as Ms. Reed mentioned,
this will be a lengthy process.

172
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,633
We can use the negotiations
to buy time

173
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,221
while having
The Covenant believe

174
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,557
we are proceeding in good faith.

175
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,813
Then that's how we'll proceed.

176
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,066
One last thing.

177
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:41,272
The only thing we do know
for certain...

178
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,273
Sark managed his escape

179
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,323
because he was provided
with information

180
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,992
that could only have come
from this office.

181
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,991
I want this leak identified.

182
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,835
They're doing
exactly as we expected.

183
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:01,042
The advantages of having
a predictable adversary.

184
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,209
Not to mention
someone on the inside.

185
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,259
Yes. Indeed.

186
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,303
Which brings me
to my next question.

187
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,548
Our superiors would like
to know how your efforts

188
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,681
in securing a scapegoat
are progressing.

189
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,342
I've already taken care of it.

190
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,344
<i>Oui,</i> Mr. Sloane?

191
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,433
Tell Karl that Judy's
on her way down.

192
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,269
<i>Oui,</i> Mr. Sloane.

193
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,983
The limo is here.

194
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,902
I don't want to go.

195
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,999
Then don't.

196
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:42,255
I have used up all my sick days
and every conceivable excuse.

197
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,461
I have got to get back to work.

198
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:47,676
You may find this
hard to believe,

199
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:51,464
but I'm usually
very professional.

200
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:55,014
Why would I find that
hard to believe?

201
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:59,396
I found our time together
very therapeutic.

202
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,450
If the Agency finds out
about us,

203
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,658
I will be totally discredited.

204
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:13,869
No one will know.

205
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,913
I give you my word.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,705
I wish that were enough.

207
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,888
I'm not gonna
see you again, am I?

208
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,151
I should go.

209
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:56,332
This is the last
communication from the crew.

210
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,491
Tell them you're
experiencing radio failure,

211
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,411
or you're both dead.

212
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,709
Albuquerque Centre,
November Niner-Seven.

213
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:05,252
We're experiencing intermittent
communication problems.

214
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:08,508
- Nothing to worry about.
- Copy that.

215
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,337
Continue your approach.

216
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,214
Please! Don't!

217
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,259
We assume that Sark
bailed out over New Mexico.

218
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:17,550
But check this out.

219
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,562
20 minutes later, the recorder
picked up some faint noise.

220
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,023
Can you be more specific?

221
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,568
It turns out our friend
Mr. Sark made a phone call.

222
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,694
Notify the extraction team.

223
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,406
I should be at the L.Z.
on schedule.

224
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,366
Do we have the hostages?

225
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,326
Excellent.

226
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,200
Not if I see you first, love.

227
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,877
Sark was still on the plane
once they passed New Mexico.

228
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,421
- That would put him in...
- Arizona.

229
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,628
I tasked Echelon to focus
on a 200-mile radius

230
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:47,711
around the drop point,

231
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,259
added keywords
to the dictionary.

232
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,965
Echelon picked up a burst
of Covenant communications

233
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,343
from a warehouse in Nogales.

234
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:57,183
I believe they might be
holding your children there.

235
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,221
Based on Marshall's intel,
I have the authority

236
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,474
to go tactical right now
and attempt a rescue.

237
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,525
Or you can continue
the negotiations.

238
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,900
I need an honest
assessment, Jack.

239
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,649
The last time we did
business with The Covenant,

240
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,196
they killed a hostage
as a negotiation tactic.

241
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:15,993
If history is any indication,

242
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,320
they may kill one of
your children to compel us

243
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,694
to meet their demands.

244
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,534
What if we give in
to their demands?

245
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,199
There's no guarantee
they'll let them go unharmed.

246
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:28,589
And if we attempt rescue,
the risks are equally high.

247
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,216
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,305
Prepare the tactical option.

249
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:44,726
Marshall, we're in place.

250
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,274
We're disabling
the alarm system.

251
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,603
Once the alarm is down,

252
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,398
you need to access
the closed-circuit feed.

253
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,523
- Perimeter's clear.
- Alarms are down.

254
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,609
We're hacking into
the closed-circuit feed now.

255
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:00,036
Okay, receiving images.
Receiving.

256
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,248
There they are!
I see them!

257
00:14:07,338 --> 00:14:08,880
The children are inside!

258
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:10,874
I'm mapping coordinates.

259
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,842
They're one level down.

260
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:14,338
Let's go.

261
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,145
Marshall, anything?

262
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:33,112
Okay, try the first door
on your right.

263
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,036
Marshall, they're not here.

264
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,075
That doesn't make any sense.
Hold on, let me do a re-scan.

265
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,510
Oh, my God.

266
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:02,640
We've got an explosive device.
1.12 left to go.

267
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,478
Copy that, Boy Scout.
I'm checking it out.

268
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,099
Marshall,
it's another explosive.

269
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,306
59 seconds.

270
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,770
Copy that, Mountaineer.
Can you describe it to me?

271
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,565
It's got a wireless receiver.

272
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:19,029
Oh, my God, the bomb
is connected to a network.

273
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,490
There are six other charges.
You need to get out!

274
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,954
The whole place is rigged.

275
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,031
Team, fall back now!

276
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,404
I'm going for my children.

277
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,493
Copy that.
We got to go.

278
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,790
No, this can't be.
This can't...

279
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,423
Mountaineer, the children
are not in the building.

280
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,422
The tape is on a loop.
It's a trap! Get out!

281
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,590
Dixon, Marshall says
the tape is on a loop!

282
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:43,632
We have to get out!

283
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:44,722
I can't leave them!

284
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,221
But they're not here!

285
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,221
We don't know that!

286
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,019
Dixon, if you stay here,
you are gonna die!

287
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:55,272
Robin and Steven are out there,
and they need you to find them.

288
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,398
Dixon, go!

289
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,734
Marshall, I need you
to pull up the server logs

290
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,369
for the classified FAA database.

291
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,825
Sure.
No problem.

292
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:47,910
What are we looking for?

293
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:50,121
Everyone who accessed
Sark's flight information.

294
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,451
Filter it to show only the
results from the last two days.

295
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,703
No problem.

296
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:58,542
There. That's not one of our
internal I.P. addresses, is it?

297
00:16:58,634 --> 00:16:59,797
No, it's not.

298
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,800
Looks like they logged on
using Dr. Barnett's account.

299
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,633
That's interesting.
They...

300
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,346
tried to spoof their I.P. by
bouncing it off several servers.

301
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,105
- Can you find the origin?
- I think so.

302
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,765
To what do I owe this pleasure?

303
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,600
I take no pleasure in this,
Arvin.

304
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,398
You're dismissed.

305
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,030
Go!

306
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:20,542
It wasn't enough for you
that I saw my wife die?

307
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,958
I'm afraid I don't understand.

308
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:24,926
They are children.

309
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:25,961
Children.

310
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,628
If I only knew what I was
being accused of, I...

311
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,261
You gave information
to The Covenant.

312
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,311
It's because of you
my children are missing.

313
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,975
Dixon, I'm...

314
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,906
The mistake I made was not
putting a bullet in your head

315
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,612
three years ago
when I had the chance.

316
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,825
Dixon, wait. No.
You can't do this.

317
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,740
Get out.
I don't want you to see this.

318
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,157
If you kill him,
it will be you locked up.

319
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:56,200
Is that what you want?

320
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:58,203
I want my children back.

321
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,576
This is not
the way to help them.

322
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,664
We'll find them.
We'll find them, Dixon.

323
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,417
We'll bring them home.

324
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,589
Sydney, for the last time.
Get out of here.

325
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:12,761
What would Diane say
if she saw you like this?

326
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,354
What about your kids?
They need you.

327
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,479
What would they want you to do?

328
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,524
What would they want you
to do, Marcus?

329
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:41,746
I didn't do this.

330
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,807
God!
Steven!

331
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:44,850
Oh, God.

332
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,521
Daddy.

333
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:51,030
Oh, Steven.
Are you alright?

334
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:53,320
Where's your sister?

335
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,202
You need to tell me.

336
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,079
Where is Robin?

337
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,709
They want to talk to you.

338
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,217
They said they wanted me
to watch my children die.

339
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,309
They wanted me to know
what it felt like.

340
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,139
The Covenant knew we'd come.

341
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:26,103
They fed us Echelon intercepts.

342
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:30,238
Dangled the whereabouts
of my children like bait.

343
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,569
The Covenant is now demanding
the immediate release

344
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,034
of 10 prisoners.

345
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,073
Any further attempts on our part
to outmanoeuvre them,

346
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,073
and they have sworn...

347
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,535
...I will never see
my daughter again.

348
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,620
If I told you I was capable
of processing all of this,

349
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:50,507
I would be lying.

350
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:54,840
All I know is
my daughter is out there.

351
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,639
And because of a failed
rescue mission I sanctioned,

352
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:02,811
she is in even more danger.

353
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:05,566
The emotional toll
this has taken

354
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:08,105
and my current state of mind

355
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,566
convinces me that I am no longer

356
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:13,525
the best guarantee
of her return.

357
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:16,154
Therefore,
I am stepping down temporarily

358
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:20,537
as director of this task force
until this matter is resolved.

359
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:26,410
I trust you will stand
in my stead

360
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:28,377
and do everything
in your power

361
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,955
to bring my daughter
back to me.

362
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:44,517
I've already put in calls
to State.

363
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,479
We're gonna do everything
in our power

364
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,108
to meet The Covenant's demands.

365
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,149
I appreciate it.

366
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,405
The Covenant's agenda is rash.

367
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:55,647
There's something behind
the boldness of their demands.

368
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,401
- Like what?
- I don't know.

369
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:58,691
Until we determine what it is,

370
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:02,570
we should proceed negotiating
the release of the prisoners.

371
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,676
How's he doing?

372
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:24,007
He's dehydrated.

373
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,223
But I think the damage is
more emotional than physical.

374
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,649
So, what can I do?

375
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:32,651
Sydney, Steven was sent back
with a message,

376
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,406
but it had nothing to do
with releasing prisoners.

377
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,438
I don't get it.

378
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:40,696
They told me if I disclosed
their true demands to the CIA...

379
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,244
...Robin would die.

380
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,279
What do they want?

381
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,829
A Rambaldi artefact
from Project: Black Hole

382
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,243
in the Nevada desert.

383
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:51,210
Lot 45.
I don't know what it is.

384
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,791
Why the false demands?

385
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:54,755
Keep the CIA occupied.

386
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,965
The Covenant is aware
that I have clearance

387
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,294
to enter the DSR facility.

388
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:01,215
I have personal access codes.

389
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,142
Access codes that can be
traced back to you?

390
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:07,845
My daughter's life
is in their hands.

391
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,728
If I could do this alone,
I would.

392
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,480
Whatever you need.

393
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,224
Miss, this is a restricted area.

394
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,894
Dude...

395
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,944
...this is sweet.

396
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,439
I'm psyched to run into you.

397
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,112
I was dunin' with my buddies,
and I got separated.

398
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,118
I've been just goin' in
a circle for about an hour.

399
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,990
Miss, you are not
supposed to be here.

400
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,535
I'm not?

401
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,789
The map says...

402
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,669
Have a look.

403
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:22,552
Can you ever read these things?
I can never tell.

404
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,182
Dixon, I'm in position.

405
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,761
Copy that.
Arriving now.

406
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,768
The director of research
is expecting me.

407
00:25:37,153 --> 00:25:38,066
Thank you.

408
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,564
Haven't had a chance
to congratulate you

409
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,564
on your promotion, Erin.

410
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,235
Thank you
for the recommendation.

411
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,701
I'm sorry about your daughter.

412
00:25:44,785 --> 00:25:46,161
If there's anything we can do.

413
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,620
I believe there is.

414
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:50,706
Does the term "countershadow"
mean anything to you?

415
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,618
I'm not sure
about countershadow.

416
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,667
There are specific
references to shadows

417
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,667
in neopaganism.

418
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,996
There's over a dozen
references in the Bible.

419
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,047
Anything Rambaldi-related?

420
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:01,593
My son said his captors

421
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:03,836
mentioned the word
"countershadow."

422
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,340
It's all I have to go on.

423
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,803
I need access to a research
terminal for an hour or so.

424
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:09,386
Not a problem.

425
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:11,802
Mind if I tag along?

426
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,849
Actually, I have to tag along.

427
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,055
We're at a Code Orange.

428
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,430
You understand.

429
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:20,812
Understand?
I instituted the protocol.

430
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,941
Dixon, I've reached the grate.

431
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:02,772
Most of the files
are cross-referenced

432
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:03,895
within the archive.

433
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,690
But we should also check
the historical database.

434
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,991
It's still sealed.

435
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:14,407
This could take more time
than I thought.

436
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,247
Coffee?

437
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,908
Sure.
I'll have some brought in.

438
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,334
Heat bubbles
are getting critical.

439
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,216
I'm gonna have to abort.

440
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,220
- Are you alright?
- I'm sorry.

441
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:31,674
All this hits
at the strangest times.

442
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,843
I understand.

443
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:37,222
Do you pray, Erin?

444
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,936
No.
I'm agnostic, actually.

445
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:47,314
Dixon, temperature is 248
and rising.

446
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,118
Why don't I give you a moment?

447
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,829
Thank you.

448
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:06,333
Sydney, I'm patching into
the security console now.

449
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm through the grate.

450
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:24,392
I'm in.

451
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:33,328
This place...

452
00:28:35,331 --> 00:28:38,747
They've got every Rambaldi
artefact ever collected.

453
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,516
Dixon, Lot 45 is gone.

454
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,605
Dixon, what do I do?

455
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:09,068
Give me a second.
I'll try to find it.

456
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,952
It's been moved for analysis.
Level eight, quadrant one.

457
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,238
I'm on my way.

458
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:25,913
Did you call
the Algerian minister?

459
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:27,417
Yes, sir.

460
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,465
Hello, Ambassador?

461
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,720
These negotiations
are meant to fail.

462
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,355
Why?

463
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,646
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

464
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,810
All of the resources of this
agency are being diverted

465
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:49,393
to meet demands The Covenant
must know are unattainable.

466
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,730
Which leads me to believe
it's merely a distraction.

467
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,199
What do they really want?

468
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:56,902
Well, then my question to you
is why target Dixon?

469
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,035
What does he have
access to, Jack?

470
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,702
Come on, Jack.

471
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:09,120
If you want my help, you're
just gonna have to trust me.

472
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:12,217
He has access
to Project: Black Hole.

473
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:17,719
Proceed down the North corridor

474
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:20,679
until you reach the central lab,
room 74.

475
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,261
That's where they're
holding Lot 45.

476
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,643
I'm approaching the door.

477
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:31,734
It's locked.

478
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:33,614
I'm working on it.

479
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,653
Got it.

480
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:52,714
- I see it.
- Good.

481
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:53,964
Can you get to it?

482
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,045
I can try.

483
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:57,965
Go ahead.

484
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,385
I've got the artefact.

485
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,355
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.

486
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,434
Copy that.

487
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,802
Director Dixon!

488
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:28,726
You forgot the hard copy.

489
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:30,227
Thank you.

490
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,107
You saved me a trip back here.

491
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:33,770
You're welcome.

492
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:39,324
I got your message.

493
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:40,606
Dixon made contact.

494
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,239
He's prepared
to make the exchange.

495
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,360
I understand.

496
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:45,486
I must admit,

497
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:48,867
I wasn't sure the good
director had it in him.

498
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,158
I'm impressed.

499
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:53,004
That man is living
through his worst nightmare.

500
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,081
You might consider
losing the sarcasm.

501
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,454
How touching.

502
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,258
You actually care.

503
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,838
When is the meet?

504
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,340
Four hours.

505
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,838
Make sure nothing interferes.

506
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:20,941
What is this about?

507
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,109
I know you removed an artefact

508
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,527
from Project: Black Hole
to trade with The Covenant.

509
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,578
I talked to Sloane.

510
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:28,993
The Covenant is desperate

511
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,455
to acquire a box
constructed by Rambaldi.

512
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:33,620
It's Sloane's understanding
that they're close to locating

513
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:34,744
a key to activate it.

514
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,127
Why should we trust
a thing Sloane says?

515
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,125
Sloane believes
the contents of that box,

516
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,498
in The Covenant's hands,

517
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:42,053
will put Sydney's life
in jeopardy.

518
00:33:42,138 --> 00:33:44,379
And I believe him.

519
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:48,220
Dad, there is something
you should know.

520
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,015
There's an inscription
on the box.

521
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,228
Mom's name.

522
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,816
You cannot give The Covenant
the artefact.

523
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,563
Not until we know more.

524
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,564
By then Robin could be dead.

525
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:03,317
Jack, if I had another option...

526
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,817
We can produce
a duplicate artefact,

527
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,869
send in a team
to the exchange site,

528
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,414
apprehend Sark once
the trade occurs.

529
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:12,452
If Sark in any way thinks we're
trying to double-cross him,

530
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:14,701
my daughter will suffer
the consequences.

531
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:17,547
- I can't take that risk.
- I share your concern.

532
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,505
Which is why I'm committed
to finding a way out of this

533
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:21,549
without risking
my daughter's life as well.

534
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:25,004
Robin didn't choose this life.
I did.

535
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,802
It's my decision to make, Dad.

536
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,515
And the exchange
is happening tomorrow.

537
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,521
Then I'm going with you.

538
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,892
Tell the Algerian minister
that if he refuses,

539
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:43,479
I will personally see to it
that his foreign aid bill

540
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,317
doesn't make it
to the Senate floor.

541
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,861
Sir, Project: Black Hole
has been compromised.

542
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,243
Tell him I'll call back.

543
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,073
Excuse me?

544
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,709
Lot 45 is missing.

545
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:56,786
A list has been compiled
of all visitors and workers

546
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,462
at the facility
in the last 24 hours.

547
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:01,498
That'll be all.

548
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:02,873
Yes, sir.

549
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:11,974
This is Senator Reed.

550
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,644
I want Marcus Dixon's name
added to the federal watch list,

551
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:17,807
and I want
a tactical team deployed

552
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,269
to bring him
into custody immediately.

553
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:28,734
What is it?

554
00:35:28,828 --> 00:35:30,238
Dixon needs our help.

555
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:48,716
Air Unit One,
what's your status?

556
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:52,720
Air Unit One engaging GPS
to locate the target area.

557
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,470
- The helicopters are up.
- We wouldn't ask --

558
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:55,760
Listen, say no more.

559
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:59,271
If anybody ever laid a hand
on my mini-Mitch, I swear...

560
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,452
They're using
a GPS navigation system

561
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:12,996
- to vector the choppers.
- Meaning?

562
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,287
I might be able
to uplink to their GPS receiver

563
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,999
and induce a deviation error.

564
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,080
Might or can?

565
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:20,042
We'll find out soon enough.

566
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:23,130
Air Unit One,
receiving GPS signal.

567
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,504
Proceeding to target area.

568
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,812
I want my daughter.

569
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,657
Once I take possession
of Lot 45,

570
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:53,701
my associate will release her.

571
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:55,827
You have my word.

572
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:59,286
Air Unit One,
we're over the contact area.

573
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:01,914
There's no one here.

574
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:04,914
Well, it looks like
they're taking a little detour

575
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:07,676
outside of Long Beach Harbour
over the Pacific Ocean.

576
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,338
Thank you so much, Marshall.

577
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,336
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some insurance

578
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:47,625
to guarantee I reach
my extraction point safely.

579
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:50,172
This collar contains
a lethal cardiotoxin.

580
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,467
Once I've placed this
on your daughter,

581
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:54,097
you'll have two minutes
to disarm it

582
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:56,755
before the compound
is released into her system.

583
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:58,760
You son of a bitch!

584
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,347
That was not part
of our agreement.

585
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:03,355
This mechanism is well within
your disarming capabilities.

586
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,314
Two minutes is generous,
in my opinion.

587
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,393
You will not put that
on my daughter.

588
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,945
Use me instead.

589
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,188
Put the collar on me.

590
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,785
She's 13 years old.

591
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:21,416
Alright, very well.

592
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:31,210
If you try and remove this
device before disarming it,

593
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:34,053
the injection is instantaneous.

594
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:36,676
Now I want my daughter.

595
00:38:43,564 --> 00:38:44,513
As always...

596
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:47,524
it has been a pleasure
doing business with you.

597
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,779
You don't deserve to walk
out of here alive.

598
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:54,651
Before you consider
taking any drastic measures,

599
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:56,117
you should know

600
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:58,823
that if I release my grip
on this remote,

601
00:38:58,913 --> 00:39:00,371
the toxin will automatically

602
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,864
go into your daughter's
bloodstream.

603
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,829
A fail-safe, if you will.

604
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:10,292
As I said,
you have two minutes.

605
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:14,049
Get Robin out of here.

606
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:16,259
- Do it. Now.
- Go.

607
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,553
Sydney, stand very still.

608
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,722
The mechanism's armed.

609
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,898
Our best bet is to sever
its link to the relay board.

610
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,608
I see it.
It's wired to a mirror.

611
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:30,938
If we clip the lead,

612
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:34,148
it will register
the voltage drop.

613
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,986
Dad...

614
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,698
Easy.

615
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:41,027
It's okay.

616
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:17,314
If I told you I was innocent

617
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,566
of these charges,
would you believe me?

618
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,617
No.

619
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:25,956
Look, Judy, why don't you
ask yourself...

620
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:31,411
If I wanted to damage you,

621
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:33,628
if I wanted to damage the CIA,

622
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:36,123
would I be so careless?

623
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:37,673
Would I leave a trail

624
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,134
that so obviously leads
in my direction?

625
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:42,630
You used me.

626
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,260
I compromised my judgement

627
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:48,721
because I believed
that you had changed.

628
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,808
But you are incapable of it.

629
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:59,192
If you can't trust me now,
I accept that.

630
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:03,158
All I ask is that you respect
the confidentiality

631
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:05,119
in what I told you.

632
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:09,917
Regarding my affair with Irina.

633
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:16,581
I'm going home.

634
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,956
Have you seen your father?

635
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:19,131
I haven't seen him.

636
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,630
Maybe that's a good thing.

637
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:22,299
You might be right.

638
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:26,185
It's come to my attention
that Senator Reed's effort

639
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:31,144
to retrieve Lot 45
was thwarted inexplicably.

640
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:33,308
Well, I imagine the Senator
will be gearing up

641
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:34,515
for an enquiry.

642
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,733
Although I doubt he'll find
any concrete evidence

643
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,778
of wrongdoing.

644
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:42,150
Well, whoever intervened
to save Robin's life,

645
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:47,201
not to mention Sydney's,
is owed my deepest gratitude.

646
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:48,997
Good night, Jack.

647
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:53,920
See you later?

648
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:56,330
Not if I see you first, love.
