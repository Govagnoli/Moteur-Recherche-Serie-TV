1
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:36,912
Honey, you're late. I was getting worried.

2
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,004
I'm sorry, beautiful. I got hung up at work.

3
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,852
It doesn't make any sense.

4
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:53,893
What is so hard to understand? Take a ball, right?

5
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,506
You roll it. You knock over some pins, and then everybody cheers for you.

6
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:57,973
Or in your case, everyone laughs.

7
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:58,821
That's true.

8
00:01:58,912 --> 00:01:59,906
How is that fun?

9
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:01,612
How could she even ask such a thing?

10
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,080
I think I know what your problem is.

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,171
You've never had a true bowling experience.

12
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,458
We have bowling in Argentina, you know?

13
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,152
Yes, but you don't have like glow-in-the-dark pins.

14
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,677
You don't have all-you-can-eat hot dogs after 10:00

15
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,194
or bad disco music pumping through the stereo.

16
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,662
You know what? Why am I still talking about this?

17
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,179
Let's just do it. We're going bowling. Come on.

18
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,074
Really?

19
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,723
Yeah, yeah. Come on. We're all going bowling.

20
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:24,713
Now?

21
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:26,037
Yeah. There's a 24-hour bowling alley.

22
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,838
- That's not the point.
- We have work tomorrow.

23
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,213
Guys, you don't have to analyze everything you do.

24
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,018
You can just decide to have fun. It's okay.

25
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,056
We're fun.

26
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:37,482
Yeah. You guys are about as spontaneous as my grandparents -- and they're dead.

27
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,618
- Look, it's wednesday night.
- We're not going bowling.

28
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,134
All right, well, suit yourself. Big kids are going out.

29
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,636
How can I resist all-you-can-eat hot dogs after 10:00?

30
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:47,249
- Don't wait up.
- Let's go.

31
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,539
We don't analyze everything we do.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,467
Do we?

33
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,115
No, no, we don't.

34
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,108
And besides, we agreed to take things slow.

35
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:59,001
Right.

36
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,838
We're choosing not to be spontaneous.

37
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,582
Exactly.

38
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,679
And that's why they call us when something's wrong.

39
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,793
- Vaughn.
- Yeah?

40
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,384
Six hours ago, an electromagnetic weapon

41
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,375
was stolen from a warehouse in Kostroma.

42
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,465
Now this thing is a prototype.

43
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:24,416
Really bad news. Repeatable core, amplified radius.

44
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,509
And you guys know what electromagnetic pulse does, right?

45
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,882
Destroys electronic equipment, melts circuitry.

46
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,256
Right. Now, if this baby goes off,

47
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:35,393
anything within a 10-mile radius that contains electronic parts, like

48
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:39,611
computers, radios, cars, radar -- everything will be fried.

49
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,845
If a terrorist were to detonate this in a major metropolitan city,

50
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,647
the casualties would be extreme.

51
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,401
Hospitals would lose power.

52
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,633
Traffic grids would be destroyed.

53
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,052
Airplanes fall from the sky.

54
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,137
I mean, it's really --

55
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,941
oh, and the most impressive thing about this particular device

56
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,363
is its repeatable core.

57
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:57,116
You could black out Los Angeles

58
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:00,587
and then use it to take down San Francisco in the same day.

59
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,908
Who's the thief?

60
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,662
His name is Yuri Kurelko,

61
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:07,899
former KGB officer currently reported to have ties with an extremist group

62
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,700
known as the October Contingent.

63
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:10,835
The russian ultranationalists.

64
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:14,354
That's right. Largely ex-military. But they're looking for new recruits.

65
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,587
Three days ago, german authorities picked up a man and a woman

66
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,823
attempting to smuggle weapons through a customs checkpoint.

67
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:25,156
Subsequent interrogation revealed them to be Dimitry and Ilyana Tabakov,

68
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,385
suspected chechnyan mercenaries.

69
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,999
Under duress they disclosed the October Contingent

70
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:32,661
has made back channel overtures toward them to join their group.

71
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,322
Sydney and Vaughn, you will impersonate the Tabakovs,

72
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,363
infiltrate the contingent.

73
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,978
Your mission is twofold. You will identify the group's objective

74
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,257
and retrieve the electromagnetic weapon.

75
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:46,779
Sydney, Vaughn, you know any attempt to communicate with you on our end

76
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,439
might jeopardize your lives.

77
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,619
So we're on our own.

78
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,018
Not quite. Marshall.

79
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,055
Yes. Uh...

80
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:57,723
What I have here is a normal, everyday wristwatch.

81
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,380
Now, under normal uses,

82
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,564
it won't alarm any countersurveillance scans,

83
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,700
but once activated,

84
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:06,648
it will give us the gps coordinates to triangulate your position.

85
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:10,255
Oh, and it is also capable of short-burst transmissions.

86
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:11,436
You can send images.

87
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,429
And we'll monitor you as best we can.

88
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,326
And if we detect that your cover is in jeopardy,

89
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,507
we'll send the abort signal.

90
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,341
I want you to extricate yourselves immediately.

91
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:22,813
Your plane leaves in an hour. I wish you well. Good luck.

92
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:43,737
  

93
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:47,536
  

94
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,634
  

95
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:54,126
  

96
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,781
  

97
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,203
  

98
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,484
  

99
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:06,287
We are able to get by, yeah.

100
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,642
  

101
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,611
What  would you like me to say?

102
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,452
I think that'll do just fine.

103
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,288
I gotta tell you,

104
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,236
you two are half as good as rumored, we're really in for a treat.

105
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:22,371
Come on. Hop on in. Let's get you out of the rain.

106
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,124
My name's Tom, by the way.

107
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,501
NRO retasked a keyhole satellite for infrared flyover,

108
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,399
picked them up on the M8 shortly after Sydney began transmitting.

109
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,485
D estination?

110
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,981
Well, the nearest city in that area is...

111
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,193
Petrozavodsk.

112
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:42,595
It's about 12 hours away.

113
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:43,725
What else is in the area?

114
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:46,241
Nothing, really. Farmland, tundra, turnips.

115
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,995
Let me know the moment that van stops moving.

116
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:48,845
You got it, boss.

117
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,842
This is Nick. He's gonna take some photos of you for our project.

118
00:06:56,935 --> 00:07:00,793
And this project involves us speaking English like americans for some reason?

119
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,955
Well, first order of business,

120
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,138
we need to establish some new identities for you two,

121
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:09,283
and something tells me that David and Karen Parker

122
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:12,468
don't exactly spend a lot of time speaking in the russian tongue.

123
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,749
Don't worry. We'll go over everything when we get to Liberty Village.

124
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,267
In the meantime, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

125
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,020
You just became americans.

126
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,976
I want to know more about this group that Sydney and Vaughn have infiltrated

127
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:02,117
so, Jack, I'm recommending that you reach out Alexei Vassilyvich.

128
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,864
Any objections?

129
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,604
He'll want something in return.

130
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:07,729
Yeah.

131
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,242
Look, Jack, I can task another agent if you feel this is something --

132
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,607
I simply questioned whether it's prudent to involve him at this point considering --

133
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,193
Yes, Marshall?

134
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,764
Uh, mr. Sloane, you're gonna want to come see this.

135
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:22,659
Okay.

136
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,278
I think I found something.

137
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:29,586
About an hour ago, the van left the highway.

138
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,155
They followed access roads to this facility -- Suberov 13.

139
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,099
It's supposed to have been abandoned in the late '70s.

140
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:36,042
Perimeter controls,

141
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:39,086
manned gun emplacements along the access roads, active airfields.

142
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,747
It certainly doesn't look deserted.

143
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,256
Marshall, can you put that on the screen?

144
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,241
Yeah. Let me just...

145
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,988
There it is.

146
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:51,212
Is that military housing?

147
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,921
Not like any I've seen.

148
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,650
Russian base housing resemble barracks.

149
00:08:57,098 --> 00:09:00,143
Those are single-family homes with lawns and cul-de-sacs.

150
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:01,785
Is that a swing set?

151
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,272
Looks like my neighborhood.

152
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,824
Hope you guys like your new house.

153
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,831
I love mine. It's almost exactly the same.

154
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:38,586
I just hope the guests haven't trashed the place.

155
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,817
We have guests?

156
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:45,680
This shouldn't be too long.

157
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,599
We just have to do a, well, an initiation of sorts.

158
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:53,812
Don't worry. Shouldn't be too painful.

159
00:09:56,055 --> 00:10:00,723
Everyone, guys, allow me to present David and Karen Parker.

160
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,908
- Hey, welcome, guys.
- Nice to meet you.

161
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,088
- Hi.
- Hello.

162
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,727
Welcome to the neighborhood.

163
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:09,092
Thank you.

164
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:48,556
The town's officially known as training sector 56b,

165
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,487
but students started calling it Liberty Village sometime during the mid '80s.

166
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,577
Trying to capture that american sense of irony, I suppose.

167
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,328
So this is a government operation?

168
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,942
It was a government operation, Karen,

169
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:01,983
but it's a private enterprise now, which is fine with us,

170
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,023
because it gives us the freedom to do our job.

171
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:08,566
What exactly is our job, Tom?

172
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:13,976
Well, right now your job is to prove that you belong.

173
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,964
You're under evaluation.

174
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:19,292
We need to be sure that you can portray americans convincingly.

175
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:22,574
From this point on, assume that everything is a test, you understand?

176
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,202
Excellent.

177
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,717
Now let's go do some formal introductions

178
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,806
so you can get to know your new neighbors.

179
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,268
They're transmitting.

180
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,211
It is so nice to finally meet you.

181
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:42,727
Thank you.

182
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,863
We've  been looking forward to this for quite some time.

183
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,045
Believe me, we have been, too.

184
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,115
Marshall.

185
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,534
Working on it.

186
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,809
Hold on. Wait a sec.

187
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:55,964
Come on.

188
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:58,868
Got it.

189
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,328
Sergei Danislov and Elena Vasya.

190
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,366
Weapons, drugs.

191
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,551
Suspected terrorist affiliations include the Novgorod authorit--

192
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:10,691
They're responsible for the Grozny bombing in '98. They killed 47 people.

193
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,013
I went ahead and did a little shopping for you.

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,722
You have a bunch of clothes in your closet upstairs you need to go through.

195
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,148
Honey, please, there'll be plenty of time to talk about shopping later.

196
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,278
And this is Bill and Donna Johnson.

197
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:24,602
They live in the house just next to you.

198
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,974
- Hi there.
- Hi.

199
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,390
Anatoli and Tatiana Sedova.

200
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:32,234
Former GRU. They're wanted by british authorities

201
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,424
in connection with a bank robbery that left seven dead.

202
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:37,610
And of course, Ken and Linda Taylor.

203
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,173
Linda. Hi.

204
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:42,358
Raisa Tupokov and Nikolai Brekev.

205
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:46,162
Contract killers, russian mafia ties, known murders in the double digits.

206
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,526
We just moved in a few days ago.

207
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:49,897
You are going to love it here.

208
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,604
- That's good to hear.
- Great.

209
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:52,592
And of course...

210
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,761
my lovely wife Dianne.

211
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,611
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

212
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,411
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

213
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:02,456
Marina Avdin, former chief interrogator at the Markova detention center.

214
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,446
I was just looking at your photo.

215
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,537
Tom and I just adore Rome. How long ago were you there?

216
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:10,820
Oh, what was it, five years ago?

217
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:11,907
Has it been that long?

218
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,182
Yeah.  We were going too for the millennium,

219
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,839
but we didn't want to fly because of Y2K.

220
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,497
At the time, it was a big deal.

221
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,059
So we decided to go in the spring.

222
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:19,936
Loved it. No crowds, no tourists.

223
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:21,594
We even got to hear the pope speak.

224
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,213
Yeah, yeah, that was pretty good.

225
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,616
Yeah. I liked the part about Y2K.

226
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:28,842
You can do a lot better, though.

227
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:29,880
Oh, without a doubt.

228
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,349
But don't worry. We're not gonna kill you over a bad story.

229
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,292
Not on the first night, anyway.

230
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,001
What's the connection?

231
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:44,691
Why is the Contingent associating with terrorists, thieves, contract killers?

232
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:47,018
More importantly, why are they all dressed up like the Cleavers?

233
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,628
They must be using the facility

234
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:50,717
as a training ground for some impending operation.

235
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,425
It is unlikely a terrorist group could gain unlimited access

236
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,566
to a russian military base without some kind of state sponsorship.

237
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,652
Jack, talk to Alexei.

238
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,262
I'll leave the negotiations to your discretion.

239
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,060
Do we hold off on the abort code?

240
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:07,154
For now. But be ready. This situation could deteriorate rapidly.

241
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,335
This is my 3-layer casserole.

242
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,371
Oh, thank you.

243
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:13,079
Just enjoy. We'll later go over the recipe.

244
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,067
Ahem.

245
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,482
We'll go over the recipe later.

246
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,402
I can't wait.

247
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:23,812
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

248
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:28,230
- Take care, all, all right?
- Good night. Thank you.

249
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,549
So...it's a lot to take in, isn't it?

250
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:34,210
It's different from our usual jobs.

251
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,535
Not to worry. You guys are doing great.

252
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,130
Just a couple things to keep in mind.

253
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,838
We recruited you because you're a couple. Embrace it.

254
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,070
Americans love to show affection for each other.

255
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,298
You two --

256
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,716
you seem a little cold.

257
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,926
We're not cold.

258
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,901
I know, I know. First night's a common problem. Don't sweat it.

259
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:55,087
Oh, and just one more thing. We have a little homework for you.

260
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,374
You want us to eat this pie?

261
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:00,752
It's a little welcome gift. Open it up.

262
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,437
Are you familiar with the new Tokorev?

263
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,363
Get familiar. You'll need it tomorrow.

264
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,497
Make sure you can assemble it in under 20 seconds.

265
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,899
And don't forget to put Tammy's casserole in the fridge.

266
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,844
That third layer's tuna.

267
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,020
All right well, we'll see you tomorrow.

268
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,517
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

269
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:21,151
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye.

270
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:25,647
Huh.

271
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,629
Yeah.

272
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,648
What the hell is going on?

273
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,638
Yeah, it's like a weird nightmare.

274
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,918
That we're trapped in. Did you see the security when we arrived?

275
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,336
It's like an entire military division.

276
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,995
Why would they go to this much trouble?

277
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:38,891
They must be planning an attack.

278
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:39,891
On what, suburbia?

279
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,837
Maybe some sort of long-term infiltration.

280
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,399
Why steal the E.M.P. if it's long-term?

281
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,581
Why train operatives to be american if it's short-term?

282
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,813
I'm not saying it's logical. They asked us to play charades.

283
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,474
That's an act. They're well organized, they're professional.

284
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,227
It's part of their test.

285
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,360
Which apparently we're failing.

286
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:53,569
Oh, come on, that was ridiculous.

287
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,897
What did they expect us to do, just drop and go at it on the floor?

288
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,222
If  one more person calls us boring --

289
00:15:57,313 --> 00:16:00,119
He didn't call us boring. He called us cold.

290
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,730
Who thinks we're boring?

291
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,481
Nobody. That's not the point. How do we proceed?

292
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,475
We have to assume they're tracking our every move. We maintain cover.

293
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:10,039
Yeah, so just act like we have nothing to hide.

294
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,222
I'll do some reconnaissance, see if I can locate the E.M.P.

295
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,790
Okay, in the meantime, one of us should start on our homework.

296
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,704
Can I help you with something?

297
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:53,807
You scared me.

298
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,863
I thought you might still be up.

299
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,620
I wanted to thank Dianne for that bath salt kit she left us.

300
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,994
That was really nice.

301
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,510
How'd you know this was our house?

302
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,291
Your name's on the mailbox.

303
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:14,509
What are you, out for a jog?

304
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,339
I needed to clear my head.

305
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:20,605
Good chance to do some reconnaissance as well, I'd imagine.

306
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:25,747
So what's your assessment of our little town?

307
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:32,412
Strong military perimeter.

308
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:34,478
Armed guards, rotating patrol.

309
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:37,706
Not a lot of people getting in -- or out --

310
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:39,697
if you don't want them to.

311
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:43,014
Lack of obvious security presence within the town itself

312
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,232
suggests  heavy surveillance. Security cameras in all the street lights.

313
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,606
In this immediate area, judging from the power lines,

314
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:52,601
one of those houses is probably a guard station.

315
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:53,543
Yeah.

316
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,012
First sign of trouble, we sound the alarm, lock down the streets,

317
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:58,195
give the snipers the go-ahead to fire at hostiles.

318
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:01,046
It's our version of the neighborhood watch program.

319
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:03,038
Helps everyone sleep well at night.

320
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,017
Anyway...

321
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,991
don't stay up too late, okay? Got a big day tomorrow.

322
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,902
Oh! Um, I'll be sure and tell Dianne about the bath salts.

323
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,272
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome, Karen.

324
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:28,552
- Good night.
- Good night.

325
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,779
- How was your run?
- Great. I ran into Tom.

326
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,950
I don't really sleep well at night.

327
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,511
Well, that's a relief.

328
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,291
  

329
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,757
  

330
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,744
  

331
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:07,675
  

332
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,923
  

333
00:20:28,238 --> 00:20:29,231
Hello, Jack.

334
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,147
Alexei.

335
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,980
What can I do for you?

336
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,874
There's a military facility 300 miles southeast of Petrozavodsk.

337
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,488
I assume you're familiar with it.

338
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,481
We train some of our best operatives there.

339
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:53,082
I need to know if the government is still running active operations out of it.

340
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,696
Well, it depends how you define government, I suppose.

341
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:02,770
I have assets in play within the facility.

342
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,243
We may require assistance with their extraction.

343
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:12,620
This is not some fringe group we're talking about, Jack.

344
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:16,188
The people who control that base may not have official sanction,

345
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:20,754
but there are many in power who look upon their actions favorably.

346
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:25,658
You would have my gratitude for any assistance rendered.

347
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:29,509
While that has warmed my heart,

348
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:33,457
I'm afraid the reward does not outweigh the risk.

349
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,327
What do you want, Alexei?

350
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:41,550
Well, now that you mention it,

351
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,347
perhaps there is something you can do for me.

352
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:50,235
- Good morning, Tom.
- Morning, Cheryl.

353
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,482
Rise and shine. Got ourselves a big day.

354
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,660
- Karen.
- Hi, Tom.

355
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,940
Aren't you just the picture of radiant?

356
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,519
Good morning. Oh, how'd you sleep, Dave?

357
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:10,654
Ah, like a baby.

358
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,693
Hey, look at that. We're wearing the same shirt.

359
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:14,401
You'd be amazed how often that happens here.

360
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,871
Guess we'll be twins today. Shall we head out?

361
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:17,909
Should I bring the gun?

362
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:19,663
Nah, you'll be provided with one.

363
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,275
We have a working gas station, movie theater.

364
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,075
- Hi, Tom.
- Hey.

365
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,068
Supermarkets, bowling alley.

366
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,632
Why would the government need a bowling --

367
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,528
Too many agents weregetting burned in the '50s.

368
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,996
Soviets couldn't grasp the culture,

369
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,324
so they immersed themselves in it.

370
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,508
Found out there's no substitute for the real thing.

371
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,583
Oh, hey, that reminds me. I, uh, have another little gift.

372
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,287
If you two are gonna be a couple,

373
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:48,043
you may as well be dressing the part.

374
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,445
I just figured that might help with your...

375
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,704
you know, intimacy issues.

376
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,981
Oh. Mr. Bristow, you shouldn't have.

377
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:14,642
Irina Derevko collected 19th century literature.

378
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,300
There was a small bookstore in Prague

379
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,435
that stocked rare first editions.

380
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:22,514
Whenever I was in town, I'd buy one for her as a gift.

381
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,696
Oh. That's sweet.

382
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,643
The KGB encoded assassination orders in these pages.

383
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:30,876
Oh. Well, that's...

384
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,627
not as sweet.

385
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,999
The NSA deciphered all the codes in these books,

386
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,042
but Irina's former resident chief just asked for them back,

387
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:42,613
which means there's something in here the NSA overlooked. Find it.

388
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:46,921
It's not a novel concept.

389
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,482
Trust me, somewhere in America,

390
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,335
CIA agents are sitting around in a fake Peroskovia

391
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:53,472
practicing their russian table manners.

392
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,511
You built a used car dealership?

393
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:59,694
Training station 327-F, home of the Krilov scenario.

394
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:02,737
Your objective is simple. You have to buy a convertible.

395
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:03,641
What?

396
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,445
You'll be evaluated on characterization, reflex analysis,

397
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:08,725
emotional response, and physical endurance.

398
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,236
Physical endurance?

399
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,989
Welcome to Liberty Village automotive.

400
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:13,360
Good luck.

401
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,638
You folks must have heard about our democracy sale.

402
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:18,201
We've got 0% financing for 72 months

403
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:21,436
and a mind-blowing selection of pre-owned stepsides.

404
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:24,573
Uh, well, actually, Phil, we're here to buy a convertible.

405
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,563
You sure about that?

406
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:28,031
Because we only have one convertible,

407
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:30,833
and it's a pretty fast car.

408
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,287
That's how we live Phil -- fast.

409
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:35,628
Okay.

410
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,568
Few things scream freedom like a brand-new convertible.

411
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,803
You put the top down, and excitement blows through your hair.

412
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:50,309
What's it gonna take to get us over the curb in this baby, Phil?

413
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:53,963
You guys are first-time buyers, aren't you?

414
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,191
Is it that obvious?

415
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,185
Well, you don't get to be regional sales associate of the month

416
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:00,894
four times in a row without knowing how to read people.

417
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,878
Newlyweds, right?

418
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,579
Relative newlyweds.

419
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,230
Let's see that ring.

420
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:13,676
How'd he pop the question?

421
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,830
He... took me to --

422
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:19,681
Santa Barbara, actually.

423
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:25,293
I had this whole romantic weekend planned.

424
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,409
Presidential suite at the Biltmore.

425
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:31,307
Candlelit dinner on the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

426
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,275
So we went into town,

427
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:36,979
and she wouldn't stop talking about the zoo.

428
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,920
So we went to the zoo.

429
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:42,004
Figured I'd get it over with.

430
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,601
And then I saw how happy it made her.

431
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:54,165
It made me forget about all my stupid plans.

432
00:25:55,052 --> 00:26:00,677
And here we had a personal chef making this unbelievable meal at the hotel, but...

433
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:05,667
I proposed on one knee in sawdust in front of a giraffe with a crooked neck.

434
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:09,437
Now how can I resist the charms of young love?

435
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,425
Tell you what.

436
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,039
Let's sit down, and we'll talk deal.

437
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:22,110
What?

438
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:27,827
Good news, guys.

439
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:29,605
I had to butt heads with my sales manager,

440
00:26:29,745 --> 00:26:33,554
but it turns out I am gonna be able to offer you the newlywed rate.

441
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:35,499
There's just one small problem.

442
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,011
Another couple is interested in the car.

443
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:40,052
You guys know Ken and Linda, right?

444
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,184
We met them last night.

445
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,339
Well, they arrived in Liberty Village a few days before you did,

446
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:50,551
and they're under evaluation as well.

447
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:53,995
We're only gonna let one couple join our family here.

448
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,131
And this being America,

449
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,505
we thought we'd decide things with a good old-fashioned...

450
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,099
competition.

451
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,464
The winning couple gets to move on in our program.

452
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:08,315
Oh, and a brand-new convertible.

453
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:11,343
While the losing couple...

454
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,222
well, dies.

455
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:22,904
Now, I should probably get on out of the way before I get myself shot.

456
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:27,082
Oh, and it looks like Lloyd gave them a bit of a head start.

457
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,935
Sorry about that. Good luck to you guys.

458
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:52,758
Get down!

459
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,328
Come on!

460
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,250
It's dead.

461
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,920
Well, protocol dictates we contact A.P.O, let them know what's going on.

462
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,008
We might have access to communications

463
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:21,697
now that we've joined the Liberty Village family.

464
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,167
They tried to kill us over a car. I mean if we stay,

465
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,666
they might send us to the supermarket and launch grenades at us.

466
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:29,517
Well, we can't just leave. This place is like a prison.

467
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,371
Our best bet is still to maintain cover.

468
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:33,867
Yeah, well, next time we go on one of his tests,

469
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,575
I'm bringing our gun. I don't care what he says.

470
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,166
Vaughn, come here.

471
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,199
Is it bad?

472
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,313
You've looked better.

473
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,544
The story you told at the dealership --

474
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,880
we were supposed to go to Santa Barbara three years ago,

475
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,333
and we never made it.

476
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:37,579
Karen and Dave did.

477
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:46,494
Well, I started by eliminating the more obvious --

478
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:49,633
sequence book codes, steganography, invisible ink, maybe the watermark.

479
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,055
But then I realized

480
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,190
it was right in front of my face the entire time.

481
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:55,658
The inscription.

482
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,155
Take a look. Right here.

483
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:58,522
Ahem.

484
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:04,808
"Laura, all my love, forever and a day... Jack."

485
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,800
That's really sweet.

486
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,033
I mean, that's a side of you I really never get to see, mr. Bristow.

487
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,021
I have to --

488
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:13,059
I have to say, I like it.

489
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:14,480
I fail to see the relevance.

490
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:15,518
Right. Sorry.

491
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,698
So did the NSA.

492
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:19,932
Anyway, I ran a chromatographic analysis of the ink,

493
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,633
and check this out.

494
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,373
One of the periods in the ellipses contains ink

495
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,070
that was different than the inscription itself.

496
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,453
It was added after you wrote it.

497
00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:31,253
Irina encoded it with a microdot.

498
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,200
So I magnified it with a digital microscope,

499
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:36,836
and -- look at this --

500
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:39,259
it's a protocol Irina used to contact one of her operatives.

501
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,772
Someone important, given how detailed it is.

502
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,527
Any idea who she was communicating with?

503
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:44,660
Well...

504
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,740
all that's there is a code name --

505
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:48,342
Sentinel.

506
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,875
Do we have copies of everything inside?

507
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:55,201
Well, yeah, but you're giving it to the russians?

508
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,329
Sentinel's a deceased operative. It's a dead end.

509
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:02,558
The russians can have it. Our priorities are Sydney and Vaughn.

510
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:25,176
Good.

511
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:27,143
You're awake.

512
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,962
We need to get you packed. We're going to America.

513
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,713
The agreement was for all of the books.

514
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,458
That's the one you're looking for.

515
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:56,402
We haven't heard from Irina in quite some time.

516
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,145
She's a difficult woman to keep track of.

517
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,128
That she is.

518
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,901
She always spoke quite favorably of you.

519
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:13,185
Her attachment made her work problematic at times.

520
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:17,549
I hope I didn't cause you too much inconvenience.

521
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:22,794
I have an aircraft waiting at the Jeznyev airstrip.

522
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,694
A support team will provide transport for your assets

523
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:28,786
once they have left the facility's perimeter.

524
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:32,514
Goodbye, Jack.

525
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,583
Alexei.

526
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,941
1526 Glenbury Lane.

527
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:46,796
3-bedroom, 2-bath, hardwood floors. They've even got a breakfast nook.

528
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:47,978
What, are we moving to Chicago?

529
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:51,379
You're Chicago, they're Atlanta. Dianne and I are New York.

530
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:53,897
You have a meeting on tuesday with Pierce Financial.

531
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,795
We've prepared extensive backgrounds for you.

532
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,172
Human resources should flip out over a young upstart couple like yourselves,

533
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,117
provided you ace the interview, of course.

534
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,631
We're attacking an investment firm?

535
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,577
We just need access to their servers.

536
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:08,499
At some point in the near future,

537
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:12,115
an unfortunate incident is going to befall the New York stock exchange.

538
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:13,471
If we have access to the servers

539
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,275
of America's financial institutions during that time,

540
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:19,792
we'll be in prime position for a massive redistribution of wealth.

541
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:23,504
Think of it as, um, aggressive marxism.

542
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:29,196
What's the casualty projection for this unfortunate incident?

543
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,854
Are the gladiators of Liberty Village automotive

544
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,372
having a sudden crisis of conscience?

545
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:36,938
Civilian deaths mean repercussions.

546
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:39,497
We'll need an exit strategy.

547
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,378
  

548
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,211
That reminds me.

549
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,344
We should go through the op-tech

550
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,289
in case I have to reroute you guys through New York.

551
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:56,646
What do you know about electromagnetic weapons?

552
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:26,221
Mr. Sloane, the Tabakovs --

553
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,274
the couple that Sydney and Vaughn are impersonating?

554
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:29,680
The germans just moved them.

555
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:31,913
To a maximum security prison in Havel.

556
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:34,811
The consulate informed me of the transfer a few minutes ago.

557
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:37,617
The consulate informed everybody of the transfer a few minutes ago.

558
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:39,181
They sent the order over an unsecured line.

559
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:42,015
If the October Contingent had the Tabakovs' names flagged...

560
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,763
Send the abort code.

561
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,949
Get Sydney and Vaughn out of there now.

562
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,922
Now, underneath you got a secondary compartment

563
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:57,298
with your meet protocol, documents.

564
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:59,958
We even threw in the backgrounds of all your new neighbors.

565
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,757
Should help you make small talk at barbecues.

566
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:07,138
Disengage the fail-safe, lift the cover, flip the switch.

567
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:09,130
You don't wear a pacemaker, do you?

568
00:36:09,222 --> 00:36:10,406
I'm kidding.

569
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,442
Hi, honey.

570
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:17,477
Yeah, yeah. No, things are right on schedule.

571
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,204
Mm-hmm.

572
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:24,516
Yes. Yes, no, they're very excited about their breakfast nook.

573
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:29,087
  

574
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:31,300
Okay.

575
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:32,525
Yes.

576
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:34,852
I'll be sure and tell them.

577
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,548
I love you, too.

578
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:44,874
That was Dianne. She said to pack warm.

579
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,961
Chicago's cold this time of year.

580
00:36:47,056 --> 00:36:49,145
She gets a little obsessed when we travel.

581
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,086
You want some more coffee?

582
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,440
I'd love some, thanks.

583
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:56,436
Ha ha. Watch, I'm telling you, it's amazing. It's just like clockwork.

584
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,143
As soon as we'll be outside of Vologda,

585
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:01,330
she'll think that we left the stove on.

586
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:12,886
So we had to do our initial evaluation at the Liberty Village fried chicken.

587
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,003
I got burn marks all over my back from the fry machine.

588
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:22,542
  

589
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,468
They're on to us.

590
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:18,505
Yeah, I figured that part out.

591
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:21,578
I don't know what happened, but we got to get out of here.

592
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:34,726
Set it off!

593
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:36,146
Set off the E.M.P.!

594
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,858
Maybe it's time we move out of the suburbs.

595
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:08,055
Russian authorities officially deny

596
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,223
an american training ground ever existed within their borders.

597
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:13,490
However, off the record,

598
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:16,438
they have expressed gratitude for our assistance

599
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:19,192
in their takedown of the October Contingent.

600
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:23,511
We'll debrief in detail upon your arrival.

601
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,166
But for now...

602
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,906
good work.

603
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,594
Thank you.

604
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:29,342
Thank you.

605
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,848
So, Alexei made good on his promise.

606
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:37,130
Which means our suspicions regarding Sentinel are accurate.

607
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:40,680
The russians are searching for Elena Derevko.

608
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:43,818
Yeah. We will have to move up our timetable.

609
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:47,800
It's strange,

610
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:53,365
but I'm not exactly excited about returning to America for some reason.

611
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:56,216
Well, it was kind of nice not to have to be us for a while.

612
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:03,975
Well, I happen to like us, even if we are a little cold.

613
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,299
And boring. Don't forget boring.

614
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:06,335
How could I?

615
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,841
You know, we have operational command of this aircraft.

616
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,977
The pilot could take us anywhere we want.

617
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:16,589
Our orders are to proceed with our extraction.

618
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,680
If we were to divert this aircraft for our personal use,

619
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:21,791
we would get into a lot of trouble.

620
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,097
Yes.

621
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:25,543
Yeah.

622
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,952
You want to have dinner with me in Paris?

623
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:28,896
Absolutely.

624
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,496
