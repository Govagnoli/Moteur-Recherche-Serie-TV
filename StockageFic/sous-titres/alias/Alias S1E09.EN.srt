1
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,402
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:14,115
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,377
I had been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,630
So I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:36,178
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:38,556
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,434
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,604
My father.

13
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,233
Sloane's having me followed.

14
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,278
If Sloane suspects a double agent,
he'd turn to Dreyer.

15
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,449
Dreyer will give us an imaging test.
It is very difficult to deceive.

16
00:00:56,532 --> 00:01:01,203
- Are you an agent of SD-6?
- Yes.

17
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:04,457
- Are you a double agent?
- No.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,293
We've found our mole.

19
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:11,088
- What is that?
- A star chart.

20
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:16,343
A snapshot taken from a specific
place at one moment in time.

21
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:19,847
And the only spot on earth
with that exact view of the stars

22
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:22,600
is on Mount Aconcagua

23
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,810
on the Chile-Argentina border.

24
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:27,229
I think we're almost
at our way point.

25
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:31,984
I'm going in.

26
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:40,534
Dixon? I've found it.
Rambaldi's journal, I've found it.

27
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,661
Sydney, they found us.

28
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,500
What did you do to Dixon?

29
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:07,788
Dixon? Dixon, do you copy?

30
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,960
Dixon, please don't be...

31
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,704
Dixon!

32
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:50,247
Oh, no, no, no.

33
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,255
You weren't wearing your vest!
Why weren't you wearing your vest?

34
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,637
You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK, Dixon.

35
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,639
Just hang in.

36
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,565
Take this with you.

37
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,277
It's a satcom phone. You can
contact the CIA from anywhere.

38
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:24,240
What happens when SD-6 sees I'm
lugging around a CIA-issue phone?

39
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:27,993
- Don't let them see it.
- It's like a brick. I can't take it.

40
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:32,414
Take it. Worst case scenario,
you might need it.

41
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,796
Base Ops, this is Freelancer.
How copy? Over.

42
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,299
B Ops reads you, LC. Go ahead.

43
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,968
Freelancer...

44
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,389
This is code six. I repeat, code six.
Emergency med evac, over.

45
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:53,018
Copy. Launching
extraction team Lancer.

46
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:58,190
Set navcom transponder
in three, two, one, mark.

47
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,316
Set!

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,194
Who's Freelancer? Who's...?

49
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:08,075
Just hang in there, buddy.
Just hang in there.

50
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:14,123
Come on, come on.

51
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:17,168
Just hang in, buddy. I got you.

52
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,259
Are you OK?

53
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,181
I'm fine.

54
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:34,977
So, what happened
when the chopper came?

55
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:41,650
The CIA helicopter airlifted us
to a hospital in Buenos Aires.

56
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,487
The whole flight,

57
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,697
I was thinking about Sloane.

58
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,701
What he might do
when he found out.

59
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:54,371
Learning that I was betraying
SD-6 this whole time.

60
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,208
Then I thought of a way out.

61
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:03,255
I called Sloane, told him that I'd
dragged Dixon back to the Humvee.

62
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,925
And that I drove him
to the hospital myself.

63
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,178
I couldn't tell if he believed me,
but I think he did.

64
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,597
They airlifted us to Los Angeles.

65
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,435
When we got here, they took us
to Angel of Mercy Hospital.

66
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,896
- Good.
- No.

67
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,607
It's an SD-6 hospital.

68
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,985
Gunshot wounds,
14 hours old. Internal bleeding.

69
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,655
Have you been briefed
on your cover story?

70
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:32,034
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Mrs Dixon wants to talk with you.

71
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,745
I know my story.
Is my partner gonna live?

72
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,038
I dunno.

73
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,543
Then I had to lie to Dixon's wife.

74
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,754
We were outside
the bank's office in Rome

75
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,590
and this car pulled up.
I didn't even see it.

76
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,385
These men stepped out.
They had guns.

77
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:53,931
They wanted the bank's computer
codes. I had them in my briefcase.

78
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:58,561
Your husband grabbed me, pulled
me to the ground. I heard gunshots.

79
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,938
You should've seen him.

80
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:04,650
I didn't even know he'd been hit.

81
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:09,572
You just never think
something like this...

82
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:14,201
He's strong. He's gonna make it.

83
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,828
He will make it.

84
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,788
You don't know that.

85
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:21,792
Dixon was bleeding so much.

86
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:26,297
I was afraid if I took my hand off
his wound, he'd lose too much blood.

87
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,758
So I used the satcom phone,
right in front of him.

88
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:32,094
You said he was barely conscious.

89
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:35,431
But he heard me.
He repeated my code name twice.

90
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:39,602
I suggest you put operatives there
for when he regains consciousness.

91
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,146
But it's an SD-6 hospital.

92
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,984
He will make it.

93
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:08,255
You're in a very difficult
position, Mr Dreyer.

94
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,675
You've been sent to SD-6
to find a mole.

95
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,345
The alliance
must be pressuring you.

96
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,808
- I'm just doing my job.
- We're both doing our job.

97
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:23,270
When I look at Sydney Bristow's test
results, she didn't falter once.

98
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,773
She's guilty. She's the one.

99
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:28,818
A dangerous accusation
made by a desperate man.

100
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:31,487
I'm not desperate, Mr Sloane.

101
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,366
But I am curious why you feel
the need to defend Miss Bristow.

102
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,745
I don't.
I don't need to defend her.

103
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:41,539
The results defend her.

104
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,875
The results are too perfect.

105
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,795
We all have our speciality.
This is mine.

106
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:52,716
With all due respect, Mr Sloane,
you're ignoring the facts.

107
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,679
Bristow has made numerous mistakes,

108
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,390
not least, her most recent mission.

109
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,435
Her partner was almost killed.

110
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:05,354
She could have retrieved
the Rambaldi book,

111
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:08,524
which is now in K-Directorate hands.

112
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,652
Sydney Bristow is the mole.

113
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:17,241
If you don't follow protocol on this,
I'm going to the alliance.

114
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,951
Dreyer.

115
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,580
Don't you do a damn thing.

116
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,335
I'll take care of Bristow.

117
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:07,833
- Is Dixon gonna be OK?
- He's in ICU. They don't know.

118
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:11,712
- Guys with guns came out of a car?
- It was over so quickly.

119
00:10:11,796 --> 00:10:14,673
What for? Codes, bank stuff?

120
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:18,928
- Can you not be a reporter now?
- I'm asking because I care.

121
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:24,225
I just think it's weird for this
to happen. First Danny, now this.

122
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:28,104
Leave her alone, or I will
kick your ass. I'm not kidding.

123
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,986
Thank God you're OK.

124
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:48,249
Nobody move! Down on the floor!

125
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,460
Get down on the floor!

126
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:52,795
Stay down!

127
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,966
I've seen hundreds
of bank robberies.

128
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,969
At first glance,
there's nothing out of the ordinary.

129
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,304
But these men
have skills and materials.

130
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,432
The robbery was a distraction.

131
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:07,143
While those men
were accessing the registers

132
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:11,605
these two men hacked into the bank's
mainframe and rerouted funds.

133
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:14,275
They work for Ineni Hassan.

134
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:17,111
Why would Hassan
rob a bank in the States?

135
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:21,782
It controlled his assets,
recently frozen by the US government.

136
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:25,619
He used the men to transfer
his money, so he could access it.

137
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:31,542
We put up with him for years because
he provided us with good intel.

138
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:36,755
Now he's closing shop, relocating.
He's been missing for two weeks.

139
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,469
Hassan is dangerous as a free agent.
We must bring him to justice.

140
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:45,514
- Where did he reroute the money?
- We need to find out.

141
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:47,683
If we don't steal back his fortune,

142
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,478
he could buy protection
in the Middle East.

143
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:56,066
He could then partner with a hostile
country and provide them with arms.

144
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,699
Logan Gerace. An accountant
with one client. Ineni Hassan.

145
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:06,368
Gerace is known
for his parties in Tuscany.

146
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,829
He entertains dignitaries, diplomats.

147
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:13,000
He's having an event on Friday.
You'll be there. You'll go it alone.

148
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,712
We have no in to the party.
You won't be on the guest list.

149
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,464
Shouldn't be a problem.

150
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:21,967
You need to retrieve
Hassan's offshore account number

151
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,803
from Gerace's computer,

152
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:28,432
dead drop the info at Denati Park,
which is five miles from the party.

153
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,935
- When do I leave?
- Tonight.

154
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,146
So this guy I know was killed.
Danny Hecht.

155
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,941
Nicest guy in the world.
Killed in his bathroom.

156
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:41,362
The police say there was no motive,
no suspect. Then I stumble on this.

157
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,031
There was a video blackout
that night.

158
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,658
- Weird.
- That's weird.

159
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,786
There's more.
There's a woman, Kate Jones,

160
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,915
who was supposed to be travelling
with Danny to Singapore that night.

161
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:57,128
So I call around, I find this woman.
Winds up she's lying to me.

162
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:01,882
Her real name is Eloise Kurtz,
and somebody paid her to talk to me.

163
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:04,969
- Weird!
- Thank you, yeah.

164
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:11,058
It gets weirder. The woman who said
she was Kate Jones is dead. Killed.

165
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,104
- Who killed her?
- I don't know, that's why I'm here.

166
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,815
Who killed Kurtz?
Who killed Hecht?

167
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,818
Then somebody covers up
the passenger manifest.

168
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:24,196
I think whoever did that
gave Eloise that pin.

169
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,656
- Here we go.
- What?

170
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:30,578
Damn!

171
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,752
- This momma's gorgeous!
- Why is she so gorgeous?

172
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:42,548
MEMS. Micro electromechanical
system technology.

173
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,050
This is, like,
the next gen's next gen.

174
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:48,471
This is government issue?
The guy at the science lab...

175
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,187
It's on.

176
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,232
- What, you mean, like, right now?
- Yes.

177
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,654
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

178
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:12,119
- You should report your boss.
- No kidding.

179
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:16,499
Sending you to Boston after all this.
You deserve a month off.

180
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,959
What do you think
of this wedding dress?

181
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:21,796
You can't shop for a wedding dress
in a magazine.

182
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,298
Let's go to that boutique
on Beverly.

183
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:28,135
I always wanted a reason
to go there, and now I have one.

184
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:33,307
- Yeah. You're getting married.
- I am. I'm getting married.

185
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:36,435
How about Saturday?

186
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,023
Hello?

187
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:44,068
- Joey's Pizza?
- Wrong number.

188
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:48,823
- So, Saturday? Noon?
- For sure.

189
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:52,868
SD-6 doesn't want to bring Hassan
to justice. They want revenge.

190
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:56,038
- Revenge for what?
- Something you did.

191
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:02,628
When Hassan bought the nuclear
weapon and you stole the core back,

192
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:07,675
he thought he was double-crossed
and only SD-6 knew about the bomb.

193
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,135
Oh, God!

194
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:14,682
Last week, he sold SD-6 ten Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles for Oman.

195
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:18,644
Hassan had a good laugh. He took
the money and he didn't deliver.

196
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:22,356
SD-6 wants to send out a message
to those they do business with.

197
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,692
Don't mess with SD-6.

198
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,236
The CIA
wants to bring Hassan to justice,

199
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,697
but we want SD-6 to have that money.

200
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,781
Why?

201
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,993
So we can tag the accounts
and see where they take it.

202
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:38,581
It will give us a profile into how
SD-6 does their banking. Take this.

203
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,627
Attach it to
the SD-6 retrieval device.

204
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:46,755
It'll copy what you get
from the computer.

205
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,592
- OK.
- Are you OK?

206
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,138
I was getting briefed by Marshall.

207
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,556
This thing sucks.

208
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,478
Literally. It sucks information
from the hard drive into the RAM.

209
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,022
Place it on or near the hard drive

210
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:06,525
and when this light is green,
it's reading.

211
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:09,612
- How long does it take?
- 40 gigs in two minutes.

212
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:11,489
Do you want some candy?

213
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:15,493
I'm trying to make
the place a little more inviting.

214
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,746
Do you want to take a seat
in the inflatable chair?

215
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:23,250
Come and see me when you're done.

216
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,630
I should start
with your test results.

217
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:31,091
You passed just fine.
The numbers were normal.

218
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:32,510
I'd hope so.

219
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:38,724
I know what a difficult time this is.
I understand.

220
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:41,977
- Dixon in the hospital.
- Have you heard anything?

221
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:46,607
Yes. He's still unconscious.
They're not sure how bad it is.

222
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,277
Look, Sydney.

223
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,701
I don't blame you for not talking
to me the way you used to...

224
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:07,503
...for hating me
since what happened with Danny.

225
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:12,383
Believe me when I tell you
it was the last thing I wanted.

226
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,219
I begged security section
not to do that.

227
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,054
No, you didn't.

228
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:21,183
You don't have to believe me.

229
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,812
- Why would you try and stop it?
- Because of you.

230
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:31,235
I knew there was something about you
from the first time I saw you.

231
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:36,157
- A lot can change in seven years.
- It's been longer than that.

232
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:41,495
I've known your father since 1971.
I met him at Langley.

233
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,040
I knew your mother.
I went to your parents' wedding.

234
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,585
I've known you since you were a baby.

235
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:52,173
I was out of the country for most of
your childhood, various operations.

236
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:56,051
But I kept tabs on you.
I checked in, in my own way.

237
00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:02,600
I thought of you as my daughter.
Even from the beginning.

238
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:13,068
Well, I just wanted
to let you know.

239
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:17,364
Before you went away.

240
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,795
It was almost like
he was saying goodbye.

241
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,297
Like he knew
that I'm not coming back.

242
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,841
You'll be OK. We'll get through this.

243
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,136
Contact me when you get back.

244
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,515
I know, with his account numbers.

245
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,059
No, I mean
with or without the accounts.

246
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:48,270
- Just as soon as you get back.
- OK.

247
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:51,732
- OK?
- OK.

248
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,570
You wanted to see me?

249
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:01,659
- Sir?
- Yes.

250
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:07,706
I need to send a communiqué
to SD-4 Office in Rome.

251
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,126
Attention Spinelli.

252
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,841
- Put it out through server five.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:23,013
I'm ordering, with Security Section's
full knowledge...

254
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:26,600
...the assassination
of an SD-6 officer.

255
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:30,521
Method, close-range hit.

256
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:36,819
This officer will make a dead drop
at Denati Park, 10pm tomorrow.

257
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:39,864
That's when the kill
should take place.

258
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,450
Yes, sir.

259
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,079
The target's name is Bristow.

260
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,878
Sydney Bristow.

261
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,733
Find Gerace, get hold
of something he touched.

262
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:02,446
Looks like a normal phone.
"Hi. You wanna go out Friday?"

263
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,281
"No? OK, that's fine."

264
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,451
But it's actually
a biometric sensor.

265
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:11,622
It lifts the print
off any smooth surface, digitises it,

266
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:16,001
and creates a latex duplicate you
can use to get into Gerace's study.

267
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,587
There's only enough latex
for one copy.

268
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:21,298
So make sure you get
the right fingerprint.

269
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,094
Damn it!

270
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,930
You look so beautiful in that dress.

271
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:17,021
I don't know who you are.

272
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,815
But Kurtz was wearing this
when she met me,

273
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,360
so I assume you heard
at least that conversation.

274
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:29,325
You know I'm a reporter, looking into
what happened to Hecht and Kurtz.

275
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,620
So if you killed her,

276
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:36,916
you would have known that
I'm a threat and you would have,

277
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,418
you would have killed me, too, so...

278
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:43,672
Unless you didn't kill her.
In which case, I need to talk to you.

279
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:46,175
My cell number is

280
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:51,514
3105550153.

281
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,140
Please...

282
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:57,561
...call me.

283
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:01,023
Please.

284
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:03,234
I need to talk to you.

285
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:10,241
Hello?

286
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,785
Francie? Yeah, hi.

287
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,290
No, I don't know where she is.
I don't think she got back yet.

288
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:13,429
Agent Bristow has been made. We got
this communiqué off the SD-6 server.

289
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:14,555
What?

290
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:17,767
10pm, Denati Park.
They're gonna kill her.

291
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,227
SD-6 is gonna kill her.

292
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:23,647
I went to tell Davenport.
He's not in his office.

293
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:26,901
It's Vaughn.
We need an extraction team.

294
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:29,528
We only have two hours.
I'll tell Davenport.

295
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,405
- He's not there.
- I'll find him.

296
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:33,532
Get Jack Bristow on the phone.

297
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:59,308
I don't speak Italian. But I love
everything about this house.

298
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:03,354
Except the spinning.
Can you do something?

299
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,397
These floors are not for guests.

300
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:08,692
Can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

301
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:13,447
It's up the stairs. Watch your step.

302
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:18,202
- Yeah?
- I got your message.

303
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,455
There's a hit out on Sydney.
I'm getting her out.

304
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,375
- You could be making a mistake.
- I don't think so.

305
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:28,838
- Do nothing until you hear from me.
- We have a team en route.

306
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:36,345
I sent a communiqué to SD-4.
They never got it.

307
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,807
- Want some candy?
- No, check the server logs.

308
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:43,936
Here it is.

309
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:49,400
Here is a list of all outgoing
messages in the last 72 hours.

310
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:53,070
- This includes every server?
- Except server five.

311
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:57,491
It's not on the network, but the
communiqué wouldn't go that route.

312
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,618
Let's look there anyway.

313
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,631
OK, team's in Denati Park.
We've got six armed officers waiting.

314
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:17,178
By the fountain, the southern
entrance and the western gate.

315
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,971
Snipers at the north end.

316
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:21,974
Awaiting Bristow. First sighting,
I take her to safety.

317
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:26,020
- Are they scanning for gunmen?
- Yes. No shooters.

318
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:28,731
I've got three operatives on lookout.

319
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:35,613
- Jack.
- Take me to Field Ops.

320
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,617
- Mr Bristow.
- Call them off.

321
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,869
She'll be in the park any minute.

322
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:44,997
- This is a setup.
- What are you talking about?

323
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,335
Sloane's transmission was sent out
on server five, only to you.

324
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,171
They know someone's listening.
It's a test.

325
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:55,341
We'll get Sydney out
and argue about this later.

326
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:59,095
If you pull her out, it proves you
intercepted Sloane's communiqué.

327
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:00,513
Sydney will be exposed.

328
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:03,224
- You don't know that.
- Why am I talking to you?

329
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:05,309
- Abort this mission.
- Wait a minute!

330
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:09,438
- You could be killing your daughter.
- You're killing her if you don't.

331
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:11,148
How can you risk this?

332
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,318
If Sydney makes her dead drop
and leaves the park,

333
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,613
she will have proven herself loyal
to SD-6.

334
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,994
- Have them hold till we give order.
- No. Hold it. This is Sydney's life.

335
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:26,580
You were meant to see
that transmission.

336
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:28,874
Someone in that park
is going to kill her!

337
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:32,253
I know how Sloane works.
He's bluffing.

338
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,761
Alpha-2, come in.

339
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,348
Bristow's entering the park.

340
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:47,059
We have two vehicles
that are not on our list.

341
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:56,902
- Who is this guy in the jacket?
- Copy that.

342
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:02,908
Position three.
We have an approaching hostile.

343
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:06,704
Acquired male target, 75 metres.

344
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,424
This could be our guy.

345
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:21,427
- Promise you're not wrong.
- Hold your position.

346
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:32,188
- He could be going for a gun.
- Prepare to take him out.

347
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:33,481
Stand by.

348
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,871
Copy that.

349
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,542
That's her dead drop.

350
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:58,422
OK, she's out of the park.
She's clear.

351
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:03,969
Good work, Jack.

352
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:12,895
I just lost 30 pounds.
I'm not kidding.

353
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:21,028
This is why I became a reporter.
It's like the best movie ever made.

354
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:24,615
- His Girl Friday?
- What's a better movie than that?

355
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,409
Godfather? On the Waterfront?
Citizen Kane?

356
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:28,702
OK. You're right.

357
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:33,124
- Raging Bull? Empire Strikes Back?
- OK. Whatever. It sucks, alright?

358
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,376
But it's why
I wanted to be a reporter.

359
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:40,089
I saw this when I was a kid
and loved it. All the quick...

360
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:41,590
- Repartee.
- Yeah.

361
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:44,927
It just looked fun.
Being a reporter looked fun.

362
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,972
But it's not. It's not fun.
It's a pain in the ass.

363
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:51,809
What's your problem? Well?

364
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,899
What are you doing?

365
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:03,737
Scoot over.

366
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:11,996
Is something even in there?

367
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:17,918
- It's so ugly.
- It's a bug. It's a microphone.

368
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:20,713
- No. Where did you get that?
- It's a story.

369
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,425
I'm like living in a puzzle.
I can't figure anything out.

370
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:28,262
I don't know who's doing what.
I'm a mess. Literally.

371
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:30,014
You're looking at a mess.

372
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:33,851
And whoever's listening
can go to hell.

373
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:36,979
- Did you hear that?
- You think someone's listening?

374
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:40,733
I don't even care.
I just want to watch old movies.

375
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:43,611
Do you think
I will find a good wedding dress?

376
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:47,239
- It's not a magic 8-ball.
- Hello!

377
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:49,366
Tell them to stop torturing me.

378
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,912
Stop torturing Will Tippin.
He's my friend.

379
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:56,957
Bad people.

380
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,629
- Hello?
- Stop talking about the bug.

381
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:05,341
Tell the person you're with
this was a wrong number.

382
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:12,932
- Who was that?
- It was a wrong number.

383
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:21,107
You sent the communiqué
on server five.

384
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,735
High-level intel could deduce
that your directive was bogus.

385
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:29,115
Whoever hacked into our network
won't believe we're setting them up.

386
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:31,659
The point is,
they received the intel.

387
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:33,702
If Bristow had been their agent,

388
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:37,039
they'd have stopped her
going to the park last night.

389
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:40,626
- Say she had been the mole.
- You're convinced she's not?

390
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,629
Well, whether she is or not,

391
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:48,717
if your plan had worked,
if she had been revealed as a mole,

392
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,512
she would have been
saved by her people,

393
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:57,685
and you would have effectively
let her go.

394
00:31:57,768 --> 00:32:00,646
You have your answer
regarding Sydney Bristow.

395
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,314
What are you protecting?

396
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:09,071
Mr Dreyer, I still believe
we have a situation here at SD-6.

397
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:12,366
I strongly suggest
you keep looking for the mole,

398
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,121
and stop questioning
every decision I make.

399
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,018
- Syd?
- Fran.

400
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,520
- When did you get back?
- Your wedding dress!

401
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:43,647
- Don't worry about it.
- I am so sorry.

402
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,316
How was Boston?

403
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,694
- Did you get my message?
- I did. It's OK, seriously.

404
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,823
It was insensitive of me to ask you
to go wedding-dress shopping.

405
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,074
Why?

406
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:58,913
Well, because you were
supposed to be going through this.

407
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,915
And I understand.

408
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:05,586
And if you feel weird,
I'll do whatever you need.

409
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:08,047
It's OK.

410
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:14,929
Francie?

411
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:21,268
This wasn't about me losing Danny.
It wasn't about me at all.

412
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:25,981
The only reason I didn't show up
was because of work. I promise.

413
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:30,444
- Let's go next week, OK?
- OK.

414
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,241
Any news about Dixon? Is he OK?

415
00:33:35,324 --> 00:33:38,661
- He still hasn't woken up.
- I'm really sorry.

416
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,336
- Hello?
- Hello, Will Tippin.

417
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:53,676
- Who is this?
- Go to 7 th and Spring.

418
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,846
Analysis has reviewed
the information you obtained

419
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,639
from Gerace's computer.

420
00:33:58,722 --> 00:34:01,600
Hassan is more
paranoid than we predicted.

421
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:03,477
His account info wasn't there?

422
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:07,690
Yes and no. We know the bank
but not the account numbers.

423
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:13,070
Those numbers are not stored on any
computer, because it can be hacked.

424
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:15,698
If they're not there,
where are they?

425
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:18,826
In a safety deposit box
in this bank.

426
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,496
Omnicorp Incorporated, Geneva.
You're going with Russek.

427
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,584
You'll be Christiana Stephens,
representing Drybergh Diamonds.

428
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,504
You're looking for a bank to
recommend for high-volume storage.

429
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:32,256
You leave tonight.

430
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,468
Great job in Tuscany.

431
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,519
- So, it was a trap?
- Yes, it was.

432
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:49,064
If you'd pulled me out, Sloane
would've known I was the mole.

433
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:52,109
But I would have been safe.
He gave me an out.

434
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,738
- He considers you a daughter.
- Don't remind me.

435
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,157
How did you know not to step in?

436
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:04,705
It was your dad. He figured
the truth, Sloane was setting us up.

437
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:09,126
- What?
- It'll take forever to get them.

438
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,504
This might help a little.

439
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,255
- What is it?
- A transmitter.

440
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,591
We can hear you in Switzerland.

441
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:19,220
When you open the deposit box,
read the account numbers aloud.

442
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:22,223
- SD-6 will get them, too.
- It doesn't matter.

443
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:26,477
We'll tag the accounts
and track every move SD-6 makes.

444
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:30,231
It's not exactly
a crushing blow, but...

445
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:32,316
Every bit helps.

446
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,122
- Yes, hello?
- Tell me you weren't followed.

447
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:51,961
- No, not a chance. Who is this?
- You have questions about Jones.

448
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:54,797
How far are you willing to go,
Mr Tippin?

449
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,675
I need to hear the words,
"I'm ready".

450
00:35:57,758 --> 00:36:00,386
Why? Could my life be in danger?

451
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,972
Say the words.

452
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:06,892
Yeah, I'm in.

453
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,480
I'm ready.

454
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:43,262
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Mr Franco is please?

455
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:45,347
Wait here a moment, please.

456
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:03,783
Mr Franco. Christiana Stephens.
I have an appointment.

457
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:08,871
Our security system is powered
by an on-site underground generator

458
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:12,708
which means that we are unaffected
by the city blackouts.

459
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,632
What is your insurance coverage?

460
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,217
We have no preset limit,

461
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,845
though if your clients
wish to store their diamonds here,

462
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,808
we'd have an independent appraiser
value the merchandise.

463
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:33,104
How's the political climate
affected your privacy laws?

464
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:36,982
Well, our first duty is always
to the customer that we...

465
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:48,369
OK, Russek, I'm in.

466
00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:52,998
Gerace's box is 22364.

467
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:56,669
I'm accessing the bank's
on-line server. Wait for your relay.

468
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:58,212
Got it.

469
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,866
- Russek, I got it. Ready?
- Go.

470
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:31,287
Delta 6-1-3-5 Charlie

471
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,706
7 Echo. That's it.

472
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,337
Get this to treasury.
I don't wanna lose track of a penny.

473
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:43,048
Money's transferred.

474
00:38:57,605 --> 00:39:02,526
- Are you out of there yet, Sydney?
- Not just yet.

475
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:13,579
Help! He just fainted.
I'll call an ambulance.

476
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:24,859
It's an anomaly, sir.

477
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:30,573
While Sydney was in the vault, there
was a transmission out of Geneva.

478
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:33,075
Not one of ours.

479
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,744
I picked it up
in Signals Intelligence.

480
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:41,834
It's just, you wanted me to tell you
if there was anything unusual...

481
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:45,713
I didn't just get someone
in trouble, did I?

482
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:17,495
- Hello?
- Sydney, it's Diane.

483
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:19,330
He's woken up.

484
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,490
It's OK. Go on in.

485
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,327
- I'm going to get some coffee.
- OK, thanks.

486
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:11,549
- It's so good to see you.
- You, too.

487
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:22,518
Dixon.

488
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:30,943
Do you know what...?
Do you remember what happened?

489
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:37,491
Last thing I remember...

490
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,498
...was walking out,
trying to link to the satellite.

491
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:50,546
And that sweet smile of yours.

492
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,800
Yep, there it is.

493
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:16,507
- Yeah?
- We got her.
