00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:01,741
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,993
Something you should know.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,998
I spent three years studying you
for my postdoctorate dissertation.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:13,801
And to some degree
I understand you, Arvin.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,640
And I can help you if you let me try.

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,766
I lie. I keep secrets.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,231
I divulge only what I must
in order to elicit the reaction I need.

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:30,773
One of those secrets affects the
only two people I care about in the world.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,070
Sydney and Jack Bristow.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,024
This watch belonged to my father.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,489
It's broken now,
but it used to keep perfect time.

12
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,247
He said,"You could set your heart
by this watch."

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,710
It stopped October 1, the day we met.

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,341
We will find each other.

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,549
We always find each other.

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,155
You two are gonna
continue working together.

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,071
You're gonna be heading up
our new North American cell.

18
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,781
That sounds just about right.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,624
Now, of course, this doesn't absolve you
of your responsibilities.

20
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,416
Working overtime
as an agent for Uncle Sam.

21
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,083
Of course.

22
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:35,219
But in the meantime, may I suggest -
and this is just a suggestion -

23
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:41,388
that you put the kibosh on
your husband's extracurricular sextivities?

24
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,892
Lauren. Hi.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,441
I see what's going on between
you and Michael, so let me be clear.

26
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,777
Stay the hell away from my husband.

27
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,461
Michael, what are you doing?

28
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,677
Sometimes I hate my job.

29
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,139
Baby, what's going on?

30
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,010
You know how doctors
always make you wait?

31
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,600
What?

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,641
When you go in for an appointment.
My dad hated that.

33
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,523
He used to say
he always kept his appointments

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,655
and everyone else
should do the same.

35
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,527
Are you OK?

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,158
Yeah.

37
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,791
I just... I was looking for my house keys
and I found this.

38
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,712
Why were you looking
for your house keys?

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,382
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd go for a jog.

40
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,796
What time is it?

41
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,131
I dunno. It's broken.

42
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,644
Are you sure you're all right?

43
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,188
Yeah. I'm fine.

44
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,500
I'll see you later.

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,006
Will he ever open his eyes?

46
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,301
Well, babies sleep, Weiss.
That's what they do, you know?

47
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,639
Except when they're screaming.
Last night from midnight to six.

48
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,552
- He's gorgeous, Marshall.
- Thanks.

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,135
Isn't he beautiful?

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,472
Looks like he has my nose.

51
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,688
- Oh, look at him.
- Thanks.

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,232
You know, last night he looked at me.
He barely opened his eyes,

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,400
but... I swear to God, guys,
Mitchell's a genius.

54
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,199
Oh, Mr. Bristow.

55
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,238
Take a look.
It's Mitchell. He's my guy.

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,655
- Cute.
- Thanks.

57
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:16,163
- Your tie's on backwards.
- Oh, I didn't get a lot of sleep.

58
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,663
You're familiar with the Shining Sword?

59
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,917
Fundamentalist terror network
based in the Philippines?

60
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,920
They've been dormant
since the Bali bombings of '02.

61
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,127
Are they operational again?

62
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,843
Earlier today we intercepted
a burst transmission

63
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,804
which indicates
that an operative of Shining Sword

64
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,389
has acquired a plasma charge.

65
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,646
Plasma charge?
I thought those were only theoretical.

66
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,275
According to the burst transmission,

67
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,357
the operative is shipping the bomb
to one of their European cells.

68
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,020
The transmission included specs.
Now, believe it or not,

69
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,405
these schematics are two times scale,

70
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,286
meaning this device is only six inches
in diameter. But it packs a wallop.

71
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,122
Now, this is a conservative interpolation
of the damage it would cause if detonated,

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,745
and this doesn't account for fires
or collateral explosions.

73
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,214
And...

74
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,964
Sorry. Dunno how that got in there.
That was at breakfast... Mitchell.

75
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,626
Is the bomb being shipped transpacific
or via the Atlantic?

76
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,513
We don't know,
but we traced the transmission

77
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,757
to a digital storage facility in Vancouver

78
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,223
where the Shining Sword operative
maintains his database.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,261
Were we able to hack in?

80
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,648
Well, DigiStash is basically
a self-storage facility for digital files -

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,727
corporate records, medical databases,
that sort of stuff -

82
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,479
so their firewall's state of the art.

83
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,314
I wouldn't be able to hack the database

84
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,071
unless someone on the inside
were to open up a port.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,205
Sydney, Vaughn. You'll go to the facility
looking to lease vault space.

86
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,329
Once inside you'll uplink with Marshall.

87
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,034
Now, if we're lucky, the operative will
have archived the details of the shipment

88
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,880
and we can intercept the bomb
before it's delivered.

89
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,547
Shall I tell them the idea I had?
I had a great idea what you guys should...

90
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,004
I think you should pose
as radio astronomers.

91
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,430
You know, looking to back up
your recordings of interplanetary noise.

92
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,514
Now, I came up with a little cheat sheet
that should help you,

93
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,973
and you can review this en route.

94
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,264
And one more thing.

95
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,980
The Covenant may have intercepted
CIA intelligence

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,531
regarding our mission in North Korea
and our pursuit of the Doleac agenda.

97
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,775
Langley has assigned
a counterintelligence team

98
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:14,289
to determine whether someone within
the agency has been leaking information.

99
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,624
Jack will run point on their investigation
inside this office.

100
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,581
Marshall, Lauren, I've scheduled you
in the first round of interviews.

101
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,332
You'll be available later this afternoon?

102
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,045
Actually, I'm due in DC tonight
for an NSC briefing,

103
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,878
but I'll call them
and let them know I can't make it.

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,054
That's OK. As soon as you return, then.
Weiss, you'll go instead.

105
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,179
Good. Let's get moving.

106
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,140
Lauren, we need to talk.

107
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:37,769
Lauren?

108
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,263
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

109
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,226
Hey, guess what? It's me.
Come on. How you doing?

110
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,939
I'm hanging in there.

111
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,949
How was Lauren about it?

112
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,826
- She didn't remember.
- And you didn't say anything?

113
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,169
Nah. I mean, she's got a lot on her mind.

114
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,959
Yeah, that's probably it.

115
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,895
- Hello?
- Dr. Barnett, this is Arvin Sloane.

116
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,988
I'm calling to apologise for my discourteous
behaviour the other day when we met.

117
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,444
I'm not accustomed to just
simply sitting around and talking.

118
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,158
- Well, not everyone is.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,955
Actually, it would have been
much more simple

120
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,077
if there had been a bottle
of Château Haut-Brion on the table.

121
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,248
Excuse me?

122
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:48,292
I'm suggesting that we talk over dinner.
You know? <i>In vino veritas?</i>

123
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,461
I know a lovely little
out-of-the-way restaurant

124
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,096
in a former sewing machine factory.

125
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,056
It's called Brasserie Al Pontile.
I'm hoping you enjoy French cuisine.

126
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,515
Well, that wouldn't be very professional.

127
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,688
Well, why don't you consider it
an office with food?

128
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,309
After all, psychoanalysts do eat dinner,
don't they?

129
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,614
Zurich is such a lovely city.
It would be criminal for you to dine alone.

130
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,818
At any rate, you know the name of the
restaurant. I shall be there at eight o'clock

131
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,828
and I am hoping you'll join me.

132
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,363
Goodbye, Dr. Barnett.

133
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,381
So you're looking for alien life?

134
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,095
In a manner of speaking.
Our radio telescopes inspect the cosmos,

135
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,312
Iooking to detect artificially generated
signals. Basically, anything below 300Hz.

136
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,264
But don't worry. The alien invasion
is still a few months away.

137
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,557
As we discussed over the phone,

138
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,068
our telescopes gather over 350 gigabytes
of information per day.

139
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,073
Not a problem. Our vaults are designed
to accommodate teraflops.

140
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,780
You could store 20 years of data
in the vault you've leased.

141
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,408
Number 2289 please, Luc.

142
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,783
Data is backed up twice daily. The servers
are monitored around the clock.

143
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,126
Climate control, fire suppression,
all state of the art.

144
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,882
- The interface is hot-swappable.
- Oh, great.

145
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,172
If you need anything, you can call me.

146
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,964
Thank you.

147
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,556
Luc?

148
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:28,187
OK, guys. Let me know when you're
connected to the mainframe, OK?

149
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,233
Copy that.

150
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,820
OK, now, once we download
the shipping information

151
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,119
we should be able to pinpoint
the location of the plasma charge.

152
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,912
Connection established.

153
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,868
Oh, listen, I wanted to
ask you something. The truth, now.

154
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,873
Your science-geek character -
was that supposed to be me?

155
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,955
- Your son.
- Funny.

156
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,875
Although that would have been pretty cool,
don't you think?

157
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,750
Little Mitchell working
side by side with his old man.

158
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,178
- We're downloading now.
- I see it. Another 15 seconds.

159
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,094
Marshall, what's happening?

160
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,026
I don't know. There's someone else
in the system with you.

161
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:12,894
Here, from our end?

162
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,814
It has to be.
There's no other way to access the files.

163
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,575
I think they just planted a virus.
It has to be the Covenant.

164
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,328
The mole must have leaked our intel.
They beat us here.

165
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,285
You guys, listen to me.
Disconnect from their system

166
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,996
before their virus affects our copy.

167
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,493
- Did we get the shipping information?
- I'm not sure.

168
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,118
I'll have to see if I can reconstruct the data
from what we've got.

169
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,620
Let's get out of here.

170
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,675
Please. Don't do this.

171
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,023
The shooter.

172
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,825
There! Vaughn!

173
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,964
The F-150.

174
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,750
Vaughn!

175
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,546
How much of the data
did we get our hands on?

176
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,207
Looks like 63 percent,
give or take a few megs.

177
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,758
Oh, I slept 20 minutes last night, FYI.

178
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,341
How long before
you can extrapolate the rest?

179
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,643
Well, I ran the code through a high-grade
decryption algebra... algorithms, I mean.

180
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,895
Oh, but you should look at this,
stare at this, right here. It's like a lava lamp.

181
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,646
- If you look... I passed out before when I...
- Marshall, how long?

182
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,684
12 hours?

183
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,944
We don't have 12 hours. If the Covenant
gets their hands on the plasma charge...

184
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,273
Sydney. I know.

185
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:50,491
The decryption program will work,
but it just requires a little time.

186
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,365
I'm out of coffee. I had 12 cups
and I'm not feeling anything.

187
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,955
You'd think it would... Caffeine...
I'm gonna check if it's the real deal.

188
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,214
- Do you guys want?
- No, thank you.

189
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,838
Oh, by the way, after six hours
in the hot seat

190
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,004
from the boys from counterintelligence,

191
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,766
Langley has declared me exhausted,
but free from suspicion.

192
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,888
Never had a doubt in my mind.

193
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,362
Is something wrong?

194
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:28,951
- No. No. Just getting old, I guess.
- You expect me to believe that?

195
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,822
Just had a lot on my mind lately,
that's all. It'll pass.

196
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,783
Yesterday was the day,
wasn't it?

197
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,452
The anniversary
of your father's death.

198
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,047
How could you remember that?

199
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,973
I remember what missing him
does to you.

200
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,436
Sorry.

201
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,606
Hey.

202
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,855
How was your day?

203
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,782
- Oh, frustrating. Hit a bit of a roadblock.
- Anything I can help you with?

204
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,448
No, but thanks for asking.

205
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,914
Michael, would you mind
holding a second?

206
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,490
No, go ahead.

207
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,084
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm being called away. I love you.

208
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,378
Uh, you too.

209
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,191
Glad you came.

210
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:53,073
So that we're clear, I'm here
for professional reasons only.

211
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,078
Oh, we're clear.

212
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,744
Although I must say
I don't necessarily believe you.

213
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,545
Well, I told you that I was writing about you,

214
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,301
but I haven't told you
the premise of my thesis.

215
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,176
Aha. Well, I would say I'm fascinated,

216
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,053
but that would sound egomaniacal,
wouldn't it?

217
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,676
<i>Salud.</i>

218
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:19,095
You certainly have given proof
that anyone can change for the better.

219
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,058
Given the proper stimuli.

220
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,352
You look beautiful. Beautiful.

221
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,190
That's just a layman's opinion, Dr. Barnett.

222
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:36,739
All I'm saying is that
you made a remarkable transformation.

223
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,163
Master spy to humanitarian.

224
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,744
Yeah.

225
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,076
Well, sometimes I wonder which is harder.

226
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,916
The Rambaldi device was instrumental
in your transformation.

227
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,630
Oh, yes, it was critical.

228
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,341
It only revealed one word to you.

229
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,390
- "Peace."
- That's correct.

230
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,225
And yet there were eight yards
of parchment scroll

231
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,555
before the message appeared.

232
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:10,900
- What was on that?
- Oh. It was nothing. Blank paper.

233
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,773
Sort of the equivalent of leader tape
on a cassette.

234
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,318
I discarded it.

235
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,992
I'm not quite sure why you did that.

236
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:27,960
You could have studied it,
sold it, kept it for antiquity.

237
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,455
It's hard to believe
that you threw away something

238
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,966
that you would normally consider holy.

239
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,385
Are you calling me a liar?

240
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,140
You almost revealed something
to me the other day.

241
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,066
A secret.

242
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,851
That wears on you.
Those were your words.

243
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,730
I am not your patient...

244
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,321
your client...

245
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,867
or your lab rat.

246
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,241
Now, we can speak in generalities,

247
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:08,663
have an elegant meal,
perhaps laugh together,

248
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:14,259
but there are some truths
you will never learn from me.

249
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,179
Do you understand that?

250
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:25,474
You must be ravenous. I suggest the
Barbary duckling. It's their signature dish.

251
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,186
This was a mistake. Sorry.

252
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,991
Now, there are still several hundred
gigabytes to decipher,

253
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,578
but I was at least able to decode this.

254
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,539
Freighter. Liberian registry.
Will dock in Lisbon, 14 hours.

255
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,963
- How do we locate the bomb?
- With this.

256
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,792
It is a modified explosives sniffer.

257
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,338
Now, I've added plasma to the list
of detectable compounds that it detects.

258
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,136
You know, like Semtex,
dynamite, HMX, you know.

259
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,227
It works just like
a normal tracking device.

260
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,886
When you're within 100 feet,
"bling, bling, bling".

261
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,473
- Found the prize in the Cracker Jack.
- 100 feet.

262
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:16,562
Sorry, I would have done better
if I'd had a little more sleep.

263
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,669
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.
We're on board.

264
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,925
We have you five-by,
Mountaineer.

265
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:46,055
Perimeter is clear. Now let's fire up
that sniffer and find the bomb, baby.

266
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,600
- Hot or cold?
- Freezing.

267
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,856
Wait, I think we've got something.

268
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,350
Towards the stern, 30 yards below us.

269
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,853
We've got tone below deck,
possibly the engine room.

270
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,655
Copy that. Proceed.

271
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,543
Mountaineer? Boy Scout? Report.

272
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,170
- Sydney, do you copy?
- Vaughn, are you OK?

273
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,442
Michael, what are you doing?

274
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,533
Sometimes I hate my job.

275
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,945
Baby, what's going on?

276
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,704
I was looking for my house keys
and I found this.

277
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,665
Why were you looking
for your house keys?

278
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,256
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd go for a jog.

279
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,669
What time is it?

280
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,053
I dunno. It's broken.

281
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,391
Are you sure you're all right?

282
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,103
Yeah. I'm fine.

283
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,031
I'll see you later.

284
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,876
- This better be good.
- And a good morning to you, too.

285
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,047
You paged me on my NSC cellphone.

286
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,216
You know that they track
all incoming numbers.

287
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,974
This cellphone's been cloned,
so you have nothing to worry about.

288
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,102
We've just learned that
a freelance munitions expert

289
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,017
has created a cutting-edge technology.

290
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:00,275
One that he's since sold
to one of our rivals.

291
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:04,276
We need you to filter back any CIA intel
that might help us get a lock on it.

292
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,821
You called me to remind me to do my job?

293
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,321
Darling, it's not like that.

294
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,534
Yeah.

295
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,450
You're familiar with the Shining Sword?

296
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,785
Fundamentalist terror network
based in the Philippines?

297
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,753
They've been dormant
since the Bali bombings of '02.

298
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,954
Are they operational again?

299
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,622
Earlier today we intercepted
a burst transmission

300
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,636
which indicates
that an operative of Shining Sword

301
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,180
has acquired a plasma charge.

302
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,468
Plasma charge?
I thought those were only theoretical.

303
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,137
According to the burst transmission,

304
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,893
the operative is shipping the bomb
to one of their European cells.

305
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,603
Is the bomb being shipped transpacific
or via the Atlantic?

306
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,519
We don't know,
but we traced the transmission

307
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,770
to a digital storage facility in Vancouver

308
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,437
where the Shining Sword operative
maintains his database.

309
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,613
Sydney, Vaughn. You'll go to the facility
looking to lease vault space.

310
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,696
Once inside you'll uplink with Marshall.

311
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,739
Now, if we're lucky, the operative will
have archived the details of the shipment

312
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,456
and we can intercept the bomb
before it's delivered.

313
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,459
Lauren, we need to talk.

314
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,256
Lauren?

315
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,965
Everything I needed to say
I've already said.

316
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,881
Then here's my turn.

317
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,546
The implication that somehow I've set out
to undermine your marriage

318
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,267
is wrong and unfair.

319
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:18,432
I've done nothing but respect
the relationship that you and Vaughn have.

320
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,394
You were saying?

321
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,324
Vaughn and I have a history,
a complicated one.

322
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:32,860
I can't deny that,
but I won't apologise for it either.

323
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,990
If your marriage is in trouble,
if you and Vaughn are having problems,

324
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:40,210
I suggest you leave me out of it
and take it up with your husband.

325
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,349
Are you ready for our first job
as senior management?

326
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,390
You're so ambitious. I love it.

327
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,561
The job's in Vancouver. It requires
a breach of a digital storage facility.

328
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,771
- Really? What's the prize?
- A plasma charge.

329
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,320
Next-generation destructive power.

330
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:13,108
- I thought those were just theoretical.
- Apparently not in Vancouver.

331
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,694
- All right. I'll meet you there in four hours.
- Three.

332
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,576
We have to be first in line.
The CIA are sending agents.

333
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,659
- Who?
- One guess.

334
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:24,251
Oh, sweetheart. This should be fun.

335
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,915
I'll see you in Vancouver.

336
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,879
Don't be late.
Or call me "sweetheart".

337
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,461
Ambitious and domineering.

338
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,631
Fantastic.

339
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,903
How long before
Sydney and Vaughn get here?

340
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,647
20 minutes, if that.

341
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,191
Well, you'd better show me
the meaning of haste.

342
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:58,908
Once we have the transport information,
I'll corrupt the files, leave the CIA blind.

343
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,083
It looks like another black mark
on your husband's record.

344
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,787
How does it feel to systematically ruin
a man from the inside out?

345
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,000
It wouldn't be the first time.
Buzz me into 2201.

346
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,420
As we discussed over the phone,

347
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,682
our telescopes gather over 350 gigabytes
of information per day.

348
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,686
Not a problem. Our vaults are designed
to accommodate teraflops.

349
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,725
You could store 20 years of data
in the vault you've leased.

350
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,389
Number 2289 please, Luc.

351
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,988
Data is backed up twice daily. The servers
are monitored around the clock.

352
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,693
Hurry. Hurry.

353
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,457
..his former sweetheart are early.

354
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,367
They're headed for room 2289.

355
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,080
Planting the virus now.
Get out and get the car ready.

356
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,917
You are so controlling.

357
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,666
Move it. I'm right behind you.

358
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,964
If you need anything, you can call me.

359
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,756
Thank you.

360
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,679
Luc?

361
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,433
Marshall, what's happening?

362
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,807
I don't know. There's someone else
in the system with you.

363
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,682
Here, from our end?

364
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,567
It has to be.
There's no other way to access the files.

365
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,897
I think they just planted a virus.

366
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,948
Luc?

367
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,358
Has anybody seen Luc?

368
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,993
God.

369
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,868
Drop the walkie.

370
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,168
Please. Don't hurt me.

371
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:35,292
You think about pointing that gun at me
and I'll shoot you in the heart.

372
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:39,301
The couple in room 2289, when they
come out, I want you to kill them both.

373
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,632
- What?
- Or you die. It's your choice.

374
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,561
But I haven't shot a gun...

375
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:49,189
- This isn't a negotiation.
- OK. OK.

376
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,111
Let's get out of here.

377
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,443
Please. Don't do this.

378
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,330
The shooter.

379
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,836
There! Vaughn!

380
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,750
- They're right behind us.
- Yes, thank you, I can see that.

381
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,159
Vaughn!

382
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,287
Stop the car.

383
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,457
- What are you talking about?
- Stop the car now. Pull in here.

384
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,318
How was your day?

385
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,112
- Oh, frustrating. Hit a bit of a roadblock.
- Anything I can help you with?

386
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,832
No, but thanks for asking.

387
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,292
Michael, would you mind
holding a second?

388
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,752
No, go ahead.

389
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,587
I'm working.

390
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:28,559
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm being called away. I love you.

391
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,802
Uh, you too.

392
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,728
- Tell me, did they spot us?
- No, I don't think so.

393
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,271
According to the transport order,
the ship docks in 16 hours.

394
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,488
We should get going.

395
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,734
You should know...

396
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,070
you were amazing.

397
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,489
Before, I mean.

398
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:57,956
Typically, this is where
you return the compliment.

399
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,629
I am not your patient...

400
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,219
your client...

401
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,227
or your lab rat.

402
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:17,690
But there are some truths
you will never learn from me.

403
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,982
Do you understand that?

404
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,984
This was a mistake. Sorry.

405
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:32,905
Hi.

406
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,288
Could I get my coat, please?

407
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:44,040
Until I turned into a complete son of a
bitch, we were having a wonderful evening.

408
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,840
Something we can both agree on.

409
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,258
Though I am now known
as a humanitarian...

410
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,555
Your words, not mine.

411
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,138
I sometimes regress.

412
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:03,776
Dr. Barnett, I'm sorry I snapped at you.

413
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:07,647
Trusting you, trusting anyone,
will take time.

414
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,280
You know so much about me.

415
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,826
I know almost nothing about you.

416
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:17,165
I want to. Very much.

417
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:23,672
I'm not sure I can understand
how your manipulating this date

418
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,965
can help you gain my trust.

419
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,141
Would you excuse us for a moment?
Thanks.

420
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:41,142
You want my secret?

421
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,939
I'll tell you. But only you.

422
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,649
I have betrayed people,
many of whom deserved it.

423
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,080
But only one didn't.

424
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,242
It was a long time ago.

425
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:04,756
I sometimes try to convince myself
that it was worth it, that she was worth it.

426
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,414
What is this? You had an affair?

427
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,593
Yes.

428
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,929
It was Irina Derevko.

429
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,851
Sydney's mother.

430
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:27,025
Jack never knew. Emily, my wife,

431
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,272
she never knew.

432
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:33,826
Irina and I pledged to take that secret
to our graves.

433
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:40,198
Are you telling me
Sydney... is your daughter?

434
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,459
I never tried to prove it,
one way or the other.

435
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:58,717
But the strength that Sydney finds within...

436
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,520
I like to believe that comes from me.

437
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,535
Well, how about that?

438
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,247
The world didn't come to an end.

439
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,760
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.
We're on board.

440
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,303
We have you five-by, Mountaineer.

441
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,340
- Hot or cold?
- Freezing.

442
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,096
It's a tranquilliser dart.

443
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:48,441
The humanitarian work of the CIA.

444
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,688
Let's go.

445
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,204
Towards the stern,
30 yards below us.

446
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,997
We can't let them go below deck.

447
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,346
Mountaineer? Boy Scout? Report.

448
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,438
Vaughn, are you OK?

449
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,273
Yeah. I'm fine.

450
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,364
But I'm glad I wore the vest.

451
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,988
We have to get the bomb.

452
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:52,796
- Meet me in the engine room.
- I'm going to the upper deck.

453
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,054
It's just ahead.

454
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,469
Go to the engine room.
I'll cover.

455
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:25,033
It's secured.
I'm gonna need a minute.

456
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,379
Freeze.

457
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,973
Drop the gun.

458
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,474
Put your hands in the air.

459
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:54,319
Put your hands in the air!

460
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:57,358
Now turn around. Slowly.

461
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:01,149
Turn around.

462
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,243
Take off the mask.

463
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,663
Do it. Take off the mask.

464
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,890
Take off the mask.

465
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,271
Put the gun down, Agent Vaughn.

466
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,526
- Drop the gun.
- Not a chance. You drop yours.

467
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,697
- Put the gun down now. Drop it!
- No, Vaughn, don't!

468
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:45,531
If you love her,
you'll put the gun down now.

469
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,583
Vaughn, don't!

470
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,614
Sark's got the bomb.

471
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,199
OK, you go after him.
I'm gonna cut off Sark.

472
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,037
Got it!

473
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,080
I've lost mine.

474
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:27,970
Freeze!

475
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,681
Give me the bomb.

476
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,685
Give it to me.

477
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,232
With pleasure.

478
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,904
Sark activated the bomb.
I've got to defuse it.

479
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,077
OK, describe it to me.

480
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,084
All right. It looks sort of like a
VS-5 land mine, but with a timer attached.

481
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:57,497
We have 40 seconds.

482
00:38:57,587 --> 00:39:00,125
- Vaughn, find the power source.
- A battery, something like that.

483
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,421
All right. There's something here. It looks
like a cellphone wrapped in fibre optics.

484
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:05,878
- No, no, no. Don't touch that.
- He's right. It's a secondary trigger.

485
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,800
33 seconds.

486
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,466
OK, find the blue wire
attached to the screw

487
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:11,474
and then open up the valve
near the stem.

488
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,303
I did that. It's still ticking.
We have 14 seconds.

489
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,260
Listen. You're gonna short it.

490
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:17,770
Strip the black wire and the red wire
and then attach them together.

491
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:18,889
I don't know if
I'm gonna have time to do that.

492
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,391
No, you can do it. You can do it.
You can do it. You can do it, Vaughn.

493
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,360
You can do it. You can do it.
You can do it.

494
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:33,080
Plasma charge is secure.

495
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,741
See? Told you you could do it.

496
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,885
- You're an angel for waiting.
- Hey.

497
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,977
No problem. I've had good company.

498
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,512
How was Washington?

499
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,940
Awful. I'm happier now that
I'm home with you.

500
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,019
Me too.

501
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:10,656
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

502
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,823
Hello?

503
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:15,530
It killed you, didn't it?
Seeing him drop the gun for Sydney.

504
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,079
No, it isn't a good time.
Can I call you in the morning?

505
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:21,122
He's there with you, is that it?

506
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,332
Though he'd rather be with her.

507
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:28,587
You know, it's quite a charade
you two are engaged in.

508
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:31,465
I think we both know how dedicated I am
to this assignment.

509
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:34,557
If you have any issues,
take it up through the proper channels.

510
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:39,637
Don't mistake me.
It's not your dedication that I question.

511
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:44,316
We'll talk about this later.

512
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,561
Sorry about that.

513
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,314
Work is officially over.

514
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:58,739
What was that for?

515
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,453
I just miss you.

516
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:29,192
- I thought you'd be home by now.
- I was about to say the same to you.

517
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,776
The plasma charge.

518
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,947
It's in our hands.

519
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,621
Sark isn't.

520
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,498
The Covenant.

521
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,005
Have you had dinner?

522
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:55,044
If memory serves,
you always liked Michelli's.

523
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,973
I haven't eaten there since I was eight.

524
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:05,851
I do eat, you know.

525
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:14,491
I'd like that, actually.
