00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:08,528
<i>The first time I learned of Prophet 5,</i>

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,318
<i>my fiancé was gunned down
in front of me.</i>

3
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:14,682
<i>It turns out, he wasn't the first.</i>

4
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:18,473
<i>They killed anyone who got too close.</i>

5
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,555
<i>They'd infiltrated the highest levels
of governments</i>

6
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,833
<i>and the inner sanctums
of intelligence agencies.</i>

7
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:33,156
<i>They appeared to control entire sectors
of technology, finance, defense.</i>

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,054
<i>We believed they were run
by a group of Twelve...</i>

9
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,333
<i>whose power was everywhere and nowhere.</i>

10
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,482
<i>Because no one knew who they were...</i>

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,662
<i>until now.</i>

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,153
<i>I've lived with secrets all my life.</i>

13
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:50,797
<i>And I'm done.</i>

14
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:21,202
I don't believe
I've seen you here before.

15
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,773
Vodka martini, please. Dry.

16
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,622
<i>I've got visual confirmation.</i>

17
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,282
Copy that.
<i>I'm standing by.</i>

18
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,473
<i>- Got it.</i>
- Understood. Good work.

19
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,511
<i>Mr. Kheel, Ms. McMullen, of course.</i>

20
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,632
Your party is waiting. Right this way.

21
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,921
- This is Phoenix, do you read?
- Go ahead.

22
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,193
Kheel and McMullen,

23
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:01,882
I remember those names.
<i>They're in the Prophet 5 archive.</i>

24
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,742
Pulling it up now. McMullen and Kheel,

25
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,691
<i>You're right.
They're members of Prophet 5.</i>

26
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,943
- They're here.
<i>- Can you get their picture?</i>

27
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,812
I think so. I'll have to improvise.

28
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,142
- Don't risk blowing your cover.
- I won't.

29
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,793
<i>Outrigger, what's your status?</i>

30
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,270
- I'm in position.
- Copy, any sign of your target?

31
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:29,623
Standing by.

32
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:34,822
Come on!

33
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,021
Turn around.

34
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,503
Target acquired. I'm done here.

35
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,271
I got a nasty skin condition.

36
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,691
Trust me, you do not
wanna see me without my shirt.

37
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,463
It's not a...

38
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,921
it's not a pretty, uh, a pretty sight.

39
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:29,892
Ti flies in the old...

40
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,560
steam room.
Has it really been six minutes?

41
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:33,751
It feels like...

42
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:35,322
two.

43
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm gonna run.

44
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,551
Nice talking with you.

45
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:40,822
Sorry.

46
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,120
Son of a bitch.

47
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,562
Why do I always get the assignments
that involve hypothermia?

48
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:53,173
'Cause you're always late to briefings.

49
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,093
Damn it!

50
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,502
Visuals acquired.

51
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,232
I am really sorry...

52
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,821
Debbie.

53
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,690
<i>Phoenix, do you copy?</i>

54
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,760
- Phoenix here.
- I need to sign off.

55
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,881
- Can you handle this without me?
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

56
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,302
<i>- Good luck, Dad.</i>
- Likewise.

57
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,282
Excuse me... Would you mind?
It's for my granddaughter.

58
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,943
- Sure.
- Try to get the Capitol in the back.

59
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:37,753
Smile!

60
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,243
Excuse me?

61
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,813
What do you think you're doing?

62
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,873
Hey, I'm covering for Debbie.

63
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,181
She said she told you.

64
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:57,751
- Did she not clear it with you?
- No.

65
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,862
Okay, well, she said she did.
She had some kind of family emergency.

66
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,993
Her sister was like, sick.
The gross kind or something.

67
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,862
- Well, it's good of you to fill in.
- Thanks, I need the tips with rent and,

68
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:13,610
it's expensive down under.

69
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:17,561
Mate, we've got a situation down here.

70
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,132
Excuse me!

71
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,600
How did you say you knew Debbie?

72
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,170
Now we know who we're fighting.

73
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,370
Sync : Anyone, Sixe, Guilamu.

75
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,002
Now that we know who the Twelve are,

76
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,630
we've been able to fill in details...

77
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:02,241
none of which are reassuring.

78
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,173
Between them, these people wield
an enormous amount of power.

79
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:07,832
Their global reach is well... global.

80
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,803
Well, we know who they are now.
Why don't we just take 'em in?

81
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:12,571
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

82
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,570
When we make a move against Prophet 5,
it needs to be the right one.

83
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:18,772
We need to arrest them simultaneously
to avoid tipping them off.

84
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,253
Marshall, we need a program
to track the movements.

85
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:23,820
I want you to input the visuals
and data we have on the twelve.

86
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,232
Cross-reference everything
with international databases.

87
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:29,063
Okay, sure, that should just
take me a lifetime.

88
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,810
I mean, that's really...

89
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:33,373
No problem. I'll get right on that.

90
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:34,570
What about Sloane?

91
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,671
As of now, we're operating
under the assumption

92
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,151
that he's working for the Twelve.

93
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,602
We take them down, we get to him.

94
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,710
The Twelve have been searching for this
for a long time,

95
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,730
since before you were born.

96
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,511
Don't get too attached.

97
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:53,023
They're expecting it to be turned over.
I should get going.

98
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:57,472
Tell me, have you ever considered
what would happen if you did that?

99
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:02,421
Once Prophet 5 has the amulet,
their use for you,

100
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,040
for all of us,

101
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,630
would be limited.

102
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:09,082
Unless we find a way
of solidifying our position,

103
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,972
making ourselves less expendable.

104
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:13,181
That's a very bold move, Arvin,

105
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:16,680
trying to cut a side deal
with one of their top assets.

106
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,253
I'm well aware that you could walk

107
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,313
out of here and tell them
what I'm proposing.

108
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,943
You might curry some favor,

109
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,432
save your life,

110
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:26,600
temporarily.

111
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,132
But you won't.

112
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:31,820
You're like me. You have
good instincts for self-preservation.

113
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,802
I can vouch for the fact

114
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:36,402
that you will be
well-compensated for your efforts.

115
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,272
So does he come with the package?

116
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:42,683
I assume that means you're interested?

117
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,480
What do you have in mind?

118
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:59,182
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

119
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,673
You know, Isabelle's gonna be up
in like, two hours.

120
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,183
Yeah, I can't sleep.

121
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:13,181
Yeah, I can see why.
That stuff would give anyone nightmares.

122
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,462
The man that gave me the amulet told me

123
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,850
that what was inside
was the end of nature,

124
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,233
and that stars
would fall from the sky.

125
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:24,512
And that no matter what I did,
I couldn't stop it.

126
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:26,790
Well,

127
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,170
consider the source,

128
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,743
a prisoner in a maximum security
prison.

129
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,051
He recognized me.

130
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:36,621
He knew who I was.

131
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,621
Weird, yeah. Not really conclusive.

132
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:40,892
What if he's right?

133
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:42,670
He's not.

134
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,763
How can you say that
with everything we've seen?

135
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:53,231
"This woman, without pretense..."

136
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,021
That would be you.

137
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,660
"Will have had her effect,

138
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,471
"never having seen the beauty
of my sky behind Mount Subasio."

139
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,233
I mean, wordy and wrong.

140
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,963
All this talk about prophecy
and fate, you've disproven it.

141
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,281
You climbed Mount Subasio.
You saw the sky.

142
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:07,910
It's not just that.

143
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,700
I keep thinking about
all the people he's killed,

144
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,902
I mean, including his own daughter.

145
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,693
I know what it's like
to grow up without a mom.

146
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:25,097
I don't want that for Isabelle.
She needs me.

147
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:29,010
Which is why we won't let that happen.

148
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,270
You promise?

149
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:33,711
I promise.

150
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,721
Hey.

151
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,232
Your hair smells like fruit.

152
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:49,150
Mitchell threw applesauce
at my head this afternoon.

153
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,283
- I didn't get a chance to wash it out.
- Don't worry.

154
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,963
I find it very attractive.

155
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,360
You do realize I'm half asleep, right?

156
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:03,301
Perhaps I could inspire you to wake up.

157
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,460
Daddy?

158
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,380
Or perhaps you could go
check on Mitchell.

159
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:11,903
Right.

160
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,523
I'll be back.

161
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:19,961
- Turn off the light.
- Got it.

162
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,572
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,633
I didn't realize how late it was.

164
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,142
No, that's okay. I was...
I was up working.

165
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,652
- What's going on?
- Just in the neighborhood.

166
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,040
I thought I'd see if you were awake.

167
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,921
Which is ridiculous,

168
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:42,661
because it's not true.

169
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:43,803
I just...

170
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:46,023
I wanted to talk to you.

171
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:48,642
Come on in, please.

172
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,842
Do you, want something to drink?

173
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,533
What do you got?

174
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:56,871
Coffee.

175
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:02,210
You're not gonna give me some lecture
about drinking on school night, are you?

176
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:04,970
Not yet.

177
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,471
You're thinking about her, aren't you?

178
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,782
I wish I had done things differently.

179
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,563
Could've saved her.

180
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,081
But I didn't.

181
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:27,013
What happened to your wife...
it was a crime.

182
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,611
Korman pulled the trigger, not you.

183
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,343
Then why do I feel like I'm to blame?

184
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,691
Because you're a good man.

185
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:53,073
- Rachel, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

186
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,060
That's...
That's not why I came here.

187
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,662
No, I know. I know.

188
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,162
It's not a big deal at all.

189
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,551
- I mean...
- No, you know what?

190
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,083
- I should go.
- No.

191
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,200
Stay, and we'll talk.

192
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:06,513
Please.

193
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,331
I'm gonna get us that coffee.

194
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,273
What's taking you guys so long?

195
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,072
About what happen...

196
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,140
Where did you go?

197
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,262
It's been a while, hasn't it?

198
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,231
Where's Mitchell?

199
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:33,351
Where's my wife?

200
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,610
Your family's fine.
They're safe at home.

201
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,390
Although I imagine
they're sick with worry.

202
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,450
What do you want from me?

203
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,862
Rambaldi described
an underground cavern.

204
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:49,502
He gave a very precise description
of the stone formation inside.

205
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,433
- I want you to locate it for me.
- What?

206
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,771
You're familiar, of course,
with the U.S. government's

207
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,711
ground-penetrating satellite network?

208
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,613
I need you to access the system.

209
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:01,790
You're...

210
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:03,223
...tasking me?

211
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,803
What, you think you're still my boss?

212
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:09,512
Whatever you're doing is bad, okay?
I know that. It's like.

213
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,791
- End-of-the-world bad.
- This is not a request.

214
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,133
I will not help you.

215
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,202
Let me know when you persuade him.

216
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,183
What... are you doing?
What is that?

217
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:31,582
What is that?

218
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,783
Take it easy, okay?
Let's talk about this!

219
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:38,131
Please!

220
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,810
Thank you for coming.

221
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,471
I'm so glad you're here.

222
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,163
How are you holding up?

223
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:48,202
I sent Mitchell to my mother's.
I didn't want him to see me like this.

224
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,741
I mean, he wouldn't just leave.
I mean, you know him, right?

225
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,422
- He wouldn't do that.
- No, he wouldn't.

226
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,271
It just doesn't make sense.
I mean, he's...

227
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,571
...a game designer.
Why would somebody abduct him?

228
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,242
There's something you need to know.

229
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:06,343
Excuse me.

230
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,062
Marshall doesn't work
for a video game designer.

231
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,450
I'm at Rachel's place.

232
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,640
I got worried when she didn't check in.

233
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,011
<i>Door was open.</i>

234
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,140
<i>Wallet, keys, phone</i>
are still here.

235
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:22,553
That can't be a coincidence.

236
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:24,453
Get back to A.P.O. Alert the team.

237
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,962
We'll meet you there ASAP.

238
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm on my way.

239
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,291
But I worked for the C.I.A.,

240
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,051
the N.S.A. Why would he need to lie?

241
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:46,701
You have to understand, Carrie,
he was ordered not to tell you.

242
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,240
We all were.

243
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,933
He was trying to protect you.

244
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,882
We need to get back.
There's another situation.

245
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,252
I wanna go with you.

246
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,432
That's not possible.

247
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:58,782
Well, I can't just watch
from the sidelines.

248
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,403
And I bet that without Marshall,

249
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,883
your technical support
is severely compromised. I can help.

250
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,303
Please.

251
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,441
Okay. Grab your coat.

252
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,893
I've thought a lot about you
since the last time we saw each other.

253
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,130
I was hoping we'd meet again.

254
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:27,021
Of course, in my mind, it was...

255
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:30,210
...under much different circumstances.

256
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,882
Rachel, don't make me do this.

257
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,043
Is now the part where you tell me
this is gonna hurt you

258
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,752
a lot more than it hurts me?

259
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:45,943
I wish that were true.

260
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,210
Sloane did this.

261
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,383
He knows where we live,

262
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,561
where we work, how we work.

263
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:01,702
But the question remains: why?

264
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,231
To...

265
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:06,943
...disable our technical capabilities,
to distract us?

266
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, perhaps he needs
something from them.

267
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:11,883
And Marshall and Rachel?

268
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:15,940
You know he won't hesitate to kill them
once he gets what he needs.

269
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:17,711
I know.

270
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:22,441
You were right about him.

271
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:28,233
After Irina was extracted,
I was taken into custody.

272
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,532
I had to designate a guardian
for Sydney.

273
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:36,133
I chose Sloane.

274
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:40,201
In spite of everything he's done,

275
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:45,370
I believed that some part of him
was still the friend

276
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,763
I once trusted with my daughter.

277
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,213
Clearly, I was wrong.

278
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,123
Oh, my...

279
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,071
I thought you were...

280
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,532
I thought... Okay.

281
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,363
I guess that was a lie too, right?

282
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,830
It's complicated. I...

283
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:15,412
Anyway, what... can I do?

284
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,180
Marshall wrote a program to track
the Twelve's moves,

285
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,360
and I ran it through our standard
decryption program,

286
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,043
but he has so many security protocols...

287
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,251
- Can I?
- Yeah, sure.

288
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:31,881
You're in.

289
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,142
What was it?

290
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,041
"Moonglum of Elwhere."

291
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,832
Yeah, well, that was my next guess.

292
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,091
He's rereading all his favorite books

293
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,312
to get ready for when Mitchell
starts reading.

294
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:46,333
Anyway, so what else can I do?

295
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,693
Peyton, would you mind
giving us a moment alone?

296
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,360
So you want to see your family again,
don't you?

297
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,681
Don't be difficult.

298
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,312
Think about your son.

299
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:18,591
No, Marshall,
you're not cut out for this.

300
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:23,991
You know, I never liked you.

301
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:27,431
I tolerated you

302
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,023
because I had to,

303
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,331
you know,
because you were my superior.

304
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:34,741
And I was afraid of you.

305
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,990
And I saw how...

306
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,341
...twisted...

307
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:39,862
...you were.

308
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:45,362
But now,
I see you for who you really are.

309
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,070
You are a weak,

310
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,852
pathetic man.

311
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,270
You know, you're right.

312
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:56,491
I'm not cut out for this.

313
00:21:57,907 --> 00:22:00,133
But I am thinking about my son.

314
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:03,213
I want Mitchell

315
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,880
to look up to me,

316
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,101
to be proud of his dad.

317
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:13,131
Which is why
no matter what you do to me...

318
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:16,563
...I'll never help you.

319
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:25,011
You know what? I got...
a hangnail right there on my thumb.

320
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,333
You mind working on that one next?

321
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:37,882
Marshall's right about you.

322
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,750
I'm doing what needs to be done.

323
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:45,621
Does that help you sleep at night?

324
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:49,092
Eventually, Marshall or Rachel
will do what I ask.

325
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:50,310
No.

326
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:51,962
They won't.

327
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:54,820
- Why not?
- Because they have something you don't.

328
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:55,833
What?

329
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:59,553
Love, family, honor... take your pick.

330
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,081
That's why you'll never break them.

331
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,520
You're right.

332
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,730
I need to find another way.

333
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:15,320
- What about airports?
<i>- We've notified the F.A.A.,</i>

334
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,230
but I assume Sloane
would have other means.

335
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,830
I'm taking Isabelle to the sitter's.

336
00:23:18,835 --> 00:23:20,300
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

337
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:32,022
If you try anything, be advised,
it will end badly.

338
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,422
What do you want?

339
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,872
Talk to Marshall. He'll listen to you.

340
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:43,601
They didn't do what you wanted.

341
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,470
You have an opportunity
to save their lives.

342
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:48,530
I suggest you take it.

343
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,091
<i>Syd, oh, my God.</i>

344
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,420
Listen, find Carrie and Mitchell,
make sure they're Ok.

345
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:55,390
They're fine. Nothing is gonna happen...

346
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:56,662
<i>If anything happened to me,</i>

347
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,233
tell Mitchell how strong I was...

348
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,800
Make sure he's proud of his old man.

349
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,010
<i>Tell Carrie to move on, okay?</i>

350
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,743
and find someone else.
It's totally fine.

351
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:03,831
Marshall, listen to me!

352
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:07,851
Whatever Sloane is asking,
I want you to do it.

353
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:09,230
What?

354
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:12,042
Syd, no, I can't.

355
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:14,241
Whatever he asks.

356
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:16,251
Your life is more important.

357
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:18,733
Now before I hang up,

358
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,453
is there anything you want me
to tell Carrie?

359
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:25,422
Yeah, actually, I want you
to tell Carrie that I love her,

360
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:27,121
<i>and that I'll finish reading<i>

361
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:29,000
"Littlest Fish" to Mitchell
when I get...

362
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:33,951
You did the right thing.

363
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,391
Why are we here?

364
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:02,470
I told you I wouldn't help you.

365
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,883
Yes, but he agreed to,
and he needs your help.

366
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,173
Look, I know this is bad,
but we cannot do this!

367
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,283
We have to.

368
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:14,331
I spoke to Sydney. She understands.

369
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,232
Listen, Rachel, I'm gonna do this, okay?

370
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:21,012
And unless you help me leapfrog
the system, it won't work.

371
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:22,481
Leapfrog?

372
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:25,062
We have to make sure we're not detected,

373
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,730
or else they'll shut us out.

374
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:30,290
We're gonna need
to open a bunch of ports.

375
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,603
I wouldn't stay on any of them
for longer than 15 seconds each.

376
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:34,600
That's right.

377
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:36,583
15 seconds...
that's a good idea.

378
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:38,350
She's very bright.

379
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:40,601
Terrific. Get to it.

380
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,231
It was Sydney. She just
got off the phone with Marshall.

381
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,090
- What?
- He's fine. I'll explain later.

382
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:52,482
But he passed on a message for you.

383
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:55,472
He said he'd finish reading Mitchell
"The Littlest Fish" when he got home.

384
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:56,472
Rings any bell?

385
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,471
We haven't read him that book
in at least a year.

386
00:25:58,478 --> 00:25:59,331
What's it about?

387
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,913
It's about a goldfish
and some boy who's his friend.

388
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,212
Oh god, his name is Niles.

389
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,332
No... Noah!

390
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:12,420
N.O.A.A.: National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

391
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:14,510
They monitor weather patterns,
ecosystems...

392
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,511
...Using a state-of-the-art satellite
network.

393
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:18,562
Maybe Sloane's trying
to get them to hack in.

394
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,590
I can set up some trip wires
to monitor the hack.

395
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:23,583
If I can detect them,
I can pinpoint their location.

396
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:26,283
Well, whatever Sloane's making them do,
it's happening now.

397
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:27,321
I'll be fast.

398
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:30,620
Any progress?

399
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:32,022
They're close.

400
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:40,981
The firewall's flagging an insane amount
of network activity.

401
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:42,751
Someone's sending out signatures.

402
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,661
It's... It's Marshall.

403
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,481
He's intentionally triggering
the network security protocols.

404
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:50,133
Can you trace the location?

405
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:53,611
That's it.

406
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:56,773
Where is that?

407
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:58,271
Central Italy.

408
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:00,023
Zoom out.

409
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:07,901
I should have known.

410
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:13,121
What happens now?

411
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:14,782
Good work, as usual.

412
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,021
I'm narrowing it down.

413
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,532
Mexico. They're in Ixtapa.

414
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,280
I'll assemble a rescue team immediately.

415
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:28,260
I've convened the Twelve.

416
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:30,583
They're eagerly anticipating
our arrival.

417
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:31,713
The jet's waiting.

418
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:33,182
We should get going.

419
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,951
Perhaps we should reconsider
our plans for the prisoners.

420
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:39,372
Don't tell me you're getting
sentimental.

421
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,790
Or do you just have a thing for blondes?

422
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,271
It simply seems unnecessary, that's all.

423
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,651
This isn't open for discussion.

424
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:48,983
Eliminate them.

425
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:56,140
Where are they?

426
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,541
Do you think they just left?

427
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,043
Oh, my god, Rachel, what's wrong?
You having a heart attack?

428
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,100
Exposure to electricity?

429
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,781
I'm not having a heart attack.

430
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:10,032
What are you doing?

431
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:14,231
What is that, a garrote?
You carry a garrote?

432
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,431
It's an underwire.

433
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:17,740
Sometimes it pays to be a girl.

434
00:28:21,138 --> 00:28:22,133
Hey!

435
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:26,060
Listen, I have a family,
okay, and a child.

436
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:29,001
And I wanna have another one,
maybe even a girl.

437
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:39,650
Oh, my god, that was the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

438
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:42,092
Seriously, that was, like,
"Empire Strikes Back" cool.

439
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,691
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

440
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:49,331
Get down!

441
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,193
Oh, my god. Syd, thank you.

442
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,262
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

443
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:05,150
How did you find us?

444
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:07,251
Your wife, Marshall. Carrie found you.

445
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:10,672
Any sign of Sloane?

446
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:12,622
We checked the entire facility.

447
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:13,850
He's not here.

448
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:21,933
I think you should see this.

449
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,433
Marshall's program to track the Twelve

450
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:26,291
was designed to notify him automatically

451
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:28,353
should anything significant happen.

452
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,802
That's pretty significant,
if you ask me.

453
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,102
They're gathering.

454
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,402
Hey, dad, Marshall and Rachel are good.

455
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:41,073
They got to them. Marshall's safe.

456
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:43,471
Thank god.

457
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:44,992
<i>But Sloane, Sark</i>

458
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,822
and Peyton...
they're gone.

459
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:49,593
They're going to Zurich.
The Twelve are meeting there.

460
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:50,810
Sloane must be presenting them

461
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,950
with the information
Marshall and Rachel acquired.

462
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:54,952
Is it what we've been waiting for?

463
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:56,841
We can bring them all down.

464
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:57,840
<i>I know.</i>

465
00:29:57,935 --> 00:30:01,023
I'll alert our contacts,
have them assemble in Zurich.

466
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,871
<i>It's almost over.</i>

467
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:08,522
And then I told him that, you know,

468
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:10,823
he better move to my thumb or hangnail.

469
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,011
He didn't think Flinkman had it in him.

470
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,070
Yeah, I mean, you know,
he's such a jerk.

471
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,190
I could think of some other words.

472
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:19,181
You said you were mapping caves
in Italy.

473
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,823
- Do you have the coordinates?
- Yeah.

474
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:23,503
That's the other thing... we spent hours
hacking into the system.

475
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,932
And when he got what he wanted,

476
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,122
he was all cryptic, you know...
"I should've known."

477
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,122
What is that about?

478
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,231
He should've known?

479
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,843
Yeah, that's what he said.

480
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:32,813
Where in Italy? What region?

481
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:33,933
Umbria.

482
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,623
Mount Subasio.

483
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,152
Dad's team will take care
of the Twelve in Zurich,

484
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:41,080
but if they go after something
in Mount Subasio,

485
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:41,950
I'll beat them to it.

486
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,353
You were right, Vaughn.

487
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:47,220
I can't give in to this idea
that I'm powerless.

488
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,300
I can bring them down.

489
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:52,563
I know. I was just gonna say
I'll go with you.

490
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,141
Vaughn, over here!

491
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,731
You'll have to lower me.

492
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,793
You sure about this?

493
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:57,801
Yeah, I am.

494
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:13,971
I'll be tracking you.

495
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,123
You came.

496
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,352
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

497
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:32,051
The sound of one shot
would trigger a cave-in.

498
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,153
You're coming with me.

499
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:43,690
Remember when you were a little girl,
and you came to live with Emily and me?

500
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,851
I try not to dwell on it.

501
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:48,240
Oh, Sydney, you were so withdrawn.

502
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:49,840
Of course, we understood.

503
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:51,130
You had just lost your mother,

504
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,430
and your father was taken into custody.

505
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:54,791
Remember?

506
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,713
We tried to reach out...

507
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,700
but there was a time
when that was impossible.

508
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:05,783
So we lined the shelves of your room,

509
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:07,820
all of them, with stuffed animals...

510
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:11,531
hoping that that would comfort you.

511
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:16,883
And every morning, I would come
into your room to wake you up...

512
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:18,233
there they were,

513
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:20,951
<i>buried underneath your blanket.</i>

514
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:25,442
<i>You said there was a storm
in the middle of the night,</i>

515
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:26,910
<i>and it knocked them over,</i>

516
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:29,073
<i>and they were drowning...</i>

517
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,280
So one by one, you rescued them.

518
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:40,251
Even then,
I wondered when you would learn...

519
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,533
you can't rescue everyone.

520
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:54,770
I just received word from Zurich.

521
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,980
The team's taking up positions
outside the building.

522
00:35:57,028 --> 00:35:58,271
We'll be getting visuals soon.

523
00:35:58,278 --> 00:35:59,271
We got a problem.

524
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,670
I was going through what we got
from Sloane's safe house.

525
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,220
Look at this... It's a schematic
of the L.A. Subway system.

526
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:06,732
Wait a minute. Load-bearing
data engineering analysis?

527
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:10,341
He's mapping architectural weaknesses
of the tunnels around our facility.

528
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,812
Sloane's targeting A.P.O.

529
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,751
Clear the building.
Tom, Dixon, organize a search team.

530
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,250
Start sweeping the tunnels.

531
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:21,011
I want all civilians evacuated
from the subway.

532
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:22,073
How do we do that?

533
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,563
Call in a bomb threat.

534
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:32,412
<i>I know when you talked to Marshall
he gave you a message.</i>

535
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:33,951
But really, it didn't matter anymore,

536
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,983
because I had accounted for everyone.

537
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:38,091
What do you mean, everyone?

538
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,963
<i>Prophet 5, A.P.O...</i>

539
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,610
<i>I had to remove those obstacles.</i>

540
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:51,580
If you so much as touch
anyone else I love...

541
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:54,052
The time for threats has passed, Sydney.

542
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:58,772
Besides, even if I wanted to,
I couldn't stop it now.

543
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,772
Mr. Sloane couldn't make it.

544
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:06,890
He sent me instead.

545
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,203
I'm making sure
that this is going to happen,

546
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:17,791
that I'll see this through.

547
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:20,501
You, above all, should understand that.

548
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:22,652
There's no shying away from fate.

549
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,172
I don't believe in fate.

550
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:27,023
Be that as it may, I'm very glad
you're here, Sydney,

551
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,320
because I wouldn't want you
to be there when it happens.

552
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:32,010
What have you done?

553
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:09,020
I found it.

554
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,072
It's big.

555
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:18,601
I never wanted you to suffer
the way you did when you were a child.

556
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,010
The way you suffered
when you lost Danny,

557
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:23,843
when you lost Vaughn.

558
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,752
How much longer till we're evacuated?

559
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:29,811
<i>Rachel just radioed in.</i>

560
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,720
They need 5 more minutes
to secure the area.

561
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,830
Can you disable it?

562
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,610
Not without triggering the fail-safe.

563
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:38,020
But the timer...
<i>It's a quartz oscillator.</i>

564
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>I could slow it down,
buy them the time.</i>

565
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:42,341
Are you sure?

566
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:44,862
I've got liquid nitrogen.

567
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:46,740
I could freeze the mechanism.

568
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:49,920
Hitting it with nitro's
only gonna buy you 20 seconds.

569
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:52,703
Not if I stay here and keep hitting it.

570
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,130
All right, Tom, do what you can.

571
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:58,663
<i>But the second that timer
dips below a minute,</i>

572
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,062
get the hell out of there.

573
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:01,060
Will do.

574
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:25,943
I'm assuming you have the amulet.

575
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,440
Of course.

576
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:53,123
Sydney, I'm offering you a chance...

577
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:55,840
...to walk.

578
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:59,081
You know I can't do that.

579
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:03,961
The only person you can rescue
is yourself.

580
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,380
Jack,
<i>what's the status on the evac?</i>

581
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:23,541
The last of the civilians
just made it out.

582
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:25,821
Good.

583
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,223
Don't lose your 60-second window.
Get up top now.

584
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,220
Okay.

585
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,131
Will do.

586
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,440
Hey, listen...

587
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,673
can you patch me through to Rachel?

588
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:46,672
<i>Copy.</i>

589
00:40:48,037 --> 00:40:49,500
Tom, you need to get out.

590
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,641
<i>I wish there were more time.</i>

591
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,211
I would've asked you out.

592
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,091
I would've said yes.

593
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:35,191
Suggestions critics insults :
aliassub@gmail.com

594
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:47,683
The sky...

595
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:01,143
I'm sorry, Sydney, this isn't my choice.

596
00:42:01,178 --> 00:42:03,171
You're not allowed to see this.
