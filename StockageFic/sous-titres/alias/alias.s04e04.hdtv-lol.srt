1
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:35,187
My bird is missing.

2
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,332
It's "I lost my canary."

3
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,417
And try telling it to the woman in the cafe upstairs.

4
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:16,946
I, uh...

5
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:21,926
I've lost my canary.

6
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:24,703
You should have clipped its wings.

7
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,906
It's weird.

8
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:28,460
Are you cold?

9
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:30,110
I'm kind of cold.

10
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,285
It's probably nerves. It's not like I've ever sto--

11
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,411
  

12
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,318
  

13
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,822
Now, can I see my money?

14
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,237
As soon as you show me the weapon.

15
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:50,775
Yeah, um... funny thing about that.

16
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,371
The weapon...

17
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,775
might take a little while.

18
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,463
Only way I could smuggle it out.

19
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,400
I swallowed it.

20
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,755
Uh, we have company.

21
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,887
Single white male downstairs at the back.

22
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:36,728
What? What's wrong?

23
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,841
You didn't follow our safety protocols, did you?

24
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,879
What? Of course I did. Why wouldn't I?

25
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,677
You were followed.

26
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:48,787
I've got second white male.

27
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,253
I see another two.

28
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,479
Strike that. Three more.

29
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:53,323
Going to plan "B."

30
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:54,548
- What's plan "B"?
- Come on!

31
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,714
Come on, come on.

32
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,328
I can't make it.

33
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,745
You don't have a choice.

34
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,266
Anybody got a twenty on the last guy?

35
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:58,864
Come on.

36
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:07,936
Hey.

37
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:09,806
Hey.

38
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,663
God, you look awful.

39
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,594
Thank you.

40
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:20,868
Good morning.

41
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,012
You all right?

42
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,601
Yeah. You know.

43
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,362
It's not every day you see a guy shattered into a million pieces.

44
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,467
Yeah.

45
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,856
Two weeks ago, the CIA was contacted by an american ex-patriot named Derek Modell.

46
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:44,458
Mr. Modell, for reasons more pecuniary than patriotic,

47
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:49,480
stole a sample of a new biological agent from an arms dealer in Montenegro.

48
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:53,804
He called it Ice 5, and offered it to the agency for $10,000.

49
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,365
As you know,

50
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:58,022
mr. Modell failed to comply with any number of safety protocols we'd outlined,

51
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,774
and he was flowed and killed before the exchange could be completed.

52
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,860
Killed? He exploded like a frozen pinata.

53
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:08,326
We believe his death was caused by this biological agent he was transporting.

54
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,508
Are you saying this stuff turned Modell into a human popsicle?

55
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,872
Uh...

56
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:18,102
if I may, I might be able to -- if you're all curious -- elucidate.

57
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,357
Well, we know that this guy Modell,

58
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,015
he swallowed the sample to smuggle it out, kind of like a drug mule.

59
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,432
Based on some tests,

60
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:29,993
we found the sample in this medical container.

61
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:31,838
It was found in the van amongst the, uh...

62
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,731
Chunks.

63
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:34,856
Yeah. Chunks.

64
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,106
This was not meant to be swallowed.

65
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,090
It probably started leaking as soon as it got into his stomach.

66
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:44,984
And then when he was tackled, bam!

67
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:47,450
Complete rupture. Instant O.D.

68
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,582
When you say "instant O.D." You mean it instantly froze him?

69
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,190
Well, not exactly. It didn't really freeze him as much as freeze-dry him.

70
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,306
It crystallized him in seconds.

71
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:58,722
So the mission was a bust.

72
00:06:58,816 --> 00:06:59,950
So to speak.

73
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,128
Now this man Derek Modell

74
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:05,548
spent the last nine months as a relief worker at the hospital Sava in Montenegro.

75
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:08,965
We believe that ice 5 is being covertly developed there

76
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,938
by a man named Fintan Keene.

77
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,544
I haven't heard that name in a while.

78
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:15,249
That's because mr. Keene claims to have gone legitimate.

79
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,334
Seems to be all the rage among evil geniuses.

80
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:21,035
Fintan Keene is wanted by just about everybody.

81
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,738
But he's protected.

82
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,632
He runs his arms and drug op out of Montenegro,

83
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,288
taking advantage of its political instability.

84
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,041
You want us to take down Keene.

85
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:33,935
The director simply wants us to obtain a viable sample of Ice 5.

86
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,114
So, Sydney, we're sending youinto Montenegro

87
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,009
as a relief worker forthe U.K. branch of OMNIFAM.

88
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,523
I want you to understand this is not a tactical mission.

89
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:45,250
We go in, obtain the Ice 5, and come out.

90
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,854
I don't want anybody else getting this before we do. That's all. Good luck.

91
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,408
Is something on your mind, agent Vaughn?

92
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:02,804
No. Not really.

93
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,973
I'm not sleeping very well.

94
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:12,600
It's Lauren, isn't it?

95
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:17,499
I think I see her sometimes. Or...

96
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:23,232
I thought I saw her in the market in Algeria.

97
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,267
That ever happen with you?

98
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,113
Do I have visions of Lauren?

99
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,019
I don't know that many people who killed the woman they were married to.

100
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,152
I was just wondering if that's what happens.

101
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,569
It  did.

102
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,732
Now it doesn't.

103
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,888
I'm taking the last of the toothpaste.

104
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,924
It's okay. I'm going to the store later.

105
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,989
Do you know how excited I am that I'm not the only one going to the store?

106
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:57,899
Do you need anything?

107
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,744
No, I'm good, thanks.

108
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,001
You mind if I...

109
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,689
No,  go ahead.

110
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:17,305
Are these our mother?

111
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,498
There was a fire.

112
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,583
I lost all the pictures I had of her.

113
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:25,905
So I asked my dad if he had any, and he found those.

114
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,549
The only one she hadn't thrown out.

115
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,115
Is this you?

116
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,192
I don't know who the baby is.

117
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,869
I've never seen pictures of her like this.

118
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,655
Just the official stuff.

119
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,680
I haven't seen much.

120
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,128
It's Vaughn.

121
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,013
Be safe.

122
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,567
You too.

123
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,854
I hope you're not squeamish.

124
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,462
From time to time, they send me a squeamish one. It never ends well.

125
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:21,308
I'm not squeamish,

126
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,250
though most of my relief work with OMNIFAM has been administrative.

127
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,316
We'll fix that. Have you patching folks up in no time.

128
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,256
You're a doctor?

129
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:33,154
Nurse by training, doctor, janitor,and babysitter by default.

130
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:34,430
Sounds overwhelming.

131
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:37,516
Nothing a bit of bushmills and a few "hail marys" can't cure.

132
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,863
Phoenix is in play.

133
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:43,661
Copy that.

134
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,222
I know it's too risky, but I wish she was wearing a transmitter.

135
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:48,260
She will once they trust her.

136
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,711
Besides, it'll give you a chance to brush up on some of your old-school tricks.

137
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:55,930
Hey, a little respect for your elders.

138
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,253
No, I'm not happy.

139
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,243
You promised we'd have the test tube kits two days ago, and we're still waiting.

140
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:06,736
Tell you what.

141
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:11,439
Our cafeteria lucked into about 20 crates of fresh strawberries.

142
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,703
You have my kits here by dawn tomorrow,

143
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:19,170
and I'll cut you in for half the fruit.

144
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,171
Yeah, fresh as in...

145
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,538
not old or frozen.

146
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:28,782
You're amazing.

147
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,235
Thank you.

148
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:36,450
Okay then.

149
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,611
There's more work than we can do, so you need to pace yourself.

150
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,077
Be quick, but don't hurry.

151
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,730
I've gone through nine relief workers in the past six weeks.

152
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,052
I'd hate to lose another.

153
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,899
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

154
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,986
That, madame, is what they all say. Let's find out.

155
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:59,170
Poor old guy suffers from psoriatic arthropathy.

156
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:02,731
He needs to be greased from head to toe.

157
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,829
Welcome aboard.

158
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,575
There's no way I'd eat this. No way.

159
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,708
My kid would. Mitchell? He would eat anything.

160
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,793
He's already been to the emergency room twice.

161
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,544
He swallowed a quarter and a car.

162
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:22,437
But not a real car,'cause, you know, I mean -- well, huge.

163
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,610
- He's beautiful.
- Yeah, thanks.

164
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,455
I got a million of these pictures. I probably should update them.

165
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:30,388
You like that one? There's a funny story behind that, actually.

166
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,929
I gotta warn you right now, Nadia's immune to your cute baby story charm.

167
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,253
I'm not so sure.

168
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,550
Do you have any weaponizing scenarios for Ice 5?

169
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,777
The three obvious forms are liquid, powder, and gas,

170
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,270
but it really depends on a few things.

171
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,433
Difficulty of manufacturing, stability, intended use.

172
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:47,233
Right. I mean, is it designed for an evil empire

173
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:49,937
that wants to dump it in the water supply and freeze-dry an entire city,

174
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,643
or, you know, maybe for just one crazy assassin guy?

175
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,201
Put a couple drops on a hollow-tip bullet --

176
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,333
Either, it's a hot ticket.

177
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,609
We should target major players -- governments, large terrorist cells.

178
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,549
Then offer it for sale ourselves.

179
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,681
See who might be shopping for designer bioweapons.

180
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:02,552
Right. I'll put a list together.

181
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,547
You're married.

182
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:34,120
What  are you doing in here?

183
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,728
We're almost out of syringes.

184
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,954
I was searching for a purchase order.

185
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,178
  

186
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:53,206
  

187
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,478
  

188
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:55,768
What can I do?

189
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,414
Prayers never hurt.

190
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:03,493
What happened to him?

191
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:04,510
I don't know.

192
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,734
  

193
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:07,958
  

194
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,329
  

195
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:11,458
What did he say?

196
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:12,684
Car accident.

197
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,594
- We can handle it from here.
- I don't mind helping.

198
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,584
If you want to last here, you'll do as I say.

199
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,287
Get back to that supply room and finish what you were doing.

200
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,940
This area's off limits.

201
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:49,089
  

202
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,460
You can eliminate both the KTL

203
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,593
and the african global party from your list of potential Ice 5 buyers.

204
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,723
It's out of their league.

205
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,045
Everyone else seems good.

206
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,173
Thanks.

207
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,591
Jack?

208
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,554
I was wondering if you knew who this baby is.

209
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:08,744
Where did you get this?

210
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,287
Oh, it's Sydney's.

211
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:12,980
She gave this to you?

212
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,462
I found it.

213
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:16,309
I was hoping you might be able to tell me --

214
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,059
There's nothing to tell.

215
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:24,441
Sorry to, uh, interrupt. We got the uplink from Montenegro.

216
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:33,514
A soldier came in presenting the same frozen symptoms we saw in Algeria.

217
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:37,218
He was taken to a secure wing of the hospital by a nurse named Kiera MacLaine.

218
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:40,727
That's  M-a-c capital L-a-i-n-e.

219
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,622
She said she was from Glasgow.

220
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,451
- Is MacLaine imbedded with Keene?
- We don't know yet,

221
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,298
but Sydney said MacLaine definitely recognized the effects of Ice 5.

222
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,571
She's still at the hospital trying to learn more.

223
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,846
There's a strong military presence at the hospital,

224
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,643
but it seems to be in support of the staff. Nothing we can't handle.

225
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:59,158
Okay, MacLaine seems to be clean. Registered nurse, no criminal record.

226
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:02,386
For the last nine years, she's worked for relief agencies around the world.

227
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:04,185
We know Keene gives cash to the hospital.

228
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,554
Maybe she takes care of his men in exchange.

229
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,161
What do you know about this secure wing?

230
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:09,766
We think it's the research lab.

231
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,565
Blueprints indicate several interconnected rooms in the large ward.

232
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,317
The entrance is protected by a swipe card and a keypad.

233
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,334
We already have the access code,

234
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:18,847
but we need that card, which we'll get off MacLaine.

235
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:25,799
Come on, man, it's got to look real. Do it again.

236
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,217
Vaughn, I hit you.

237
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,444
Yeah, like a girl. Just hit me again. Come on.

238
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:36,733
One more time.

239
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,531
You can do better than that. Come on. One more time.

240
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,076
Damn it! Watch it!

241
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,153
What are you doing?

242
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,620
- Sorry, father.
- Just trying to help.

243
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,176
Let me take a look at that.

244
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,355
Maybe I should watch, see how you do it.

245
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,575
I was going to sew it shut right there --

246
00:16:58,668 --> 00:16:59,850
- Ah! Stop that.
- Sorry.

247
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:02,174
Go! I'll look after him.

248
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,879
Sorry. She's new. A bit eager.

249
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,891
I can't help but notice the fine cologne you're wearing, father.

250
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,472
Glenlivet, if I'm not mistaken.

251
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,885
- Is it that bad?
- Not at all.

252
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:37,162
Come here. I'll finish you up in the office.

253
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,859
It's a pretty nasty cut. Mind telling me how you got it?

254
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:06,213
Someone didn't like my last sermon.

255
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,202
Well, I've known a priest or two.

256
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,277
That sounds rather ominous.

257
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:16,068
But none that get into bar fights.

258
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,503
Well, I see my reputation precedes me.

259
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,691
I'm father Michael Lacott.

260
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,487
I'm new here at st. Cyrus.

261
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:29,467
Kiera MacLaine. Good to know you. I think.

262
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:31,164
I should also mention I

263
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,919
hear confession every week day from 4:00 to 6:00 at tavern Nikolai.

264
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,142
Why does that not surprise me?

265
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:45,581
When's the last time you went to confession, Kiera MacLaine?

266
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,962
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel.

267
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,211
About what?

268
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,035
A flirty priest.

269
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,515
I assure you my intentions are honorable.

270
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:02,757
Mostly.

271
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,539
You're not what I expected.

272
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:18,817
Is that your way of saying

273
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,667
"what's a nice catholic girl doing in a hellhole like this?"

274
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:24,633
Same as you.

275
00:19:25,846 --> 00:19:29,507
- I was sent here for my sins.
- It's not that bad.

276
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:36,156
Fintan. What are you doing here?

277
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,079
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

278
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:41,354
She's not real happy with me of late, father.

279
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:43,122
I see.

280
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:44,584
You two are married?

281
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:49,050
No. Your good book would frown up on that, wouldn't it?

282
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,551
- We had an agreement.
- We do.

283
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,967
But one of my men had a wee accident today.

284
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,480
I thought I'd spin by, pay my respects.

285
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,609
You treated him, right? So how's he doing?

286
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,359
I think you know.

287
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,717
You should be nicer to your big brother.

288
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,698
Isn't  that what the Bible says?

289
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,214
What, do I look like some kind of an expert?

290
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:23,343
Don't worry, Kiera. I'll be out of your way soon enough.

291
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,533
Your brother seems like a nice enough guy. What's he do?

292
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,753
You must be new here.

293
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,907
  

294
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,402
  

295
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,292
  

296
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,857
Not only has Keene developed Ice 5, he's testing it on humans.

297
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,702
I saw a roomful of test subjects.

298
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,882
I'm more concerned by the pressurized cannisters.

299
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,824
It means Keene's found a way to make it airborne.

300
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,812
Here are the photos Sydney took.

301
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,633
I thought the tanks were full of propane or liquid nitrogen.

302
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,147
Then I saw the cyrillic stencil.

303
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:31,518
Ice 5 released into a city-- the damage could be in the tens of thousands.

304
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:32,886
How many tanks in the lab?

305
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,095
I'd say 14.

306
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,228
We found a buyer in Damascus. That's what they're expecting.

307
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,645
And they want it fast. Less than 48 hours.

308
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,014
We have to shut Keene down.

309
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,240
I don't disagree, but you lack the manpower.

310
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:43,847
You aren't a tactical squad.

311
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,883
We can do it without a fight. We can use Kiera MacLaine.

312
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:50,392
After  we learned she was Keene's sister, we re-ran her info.

313
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,045
Her real name is Meghan Keene.

314
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,415
She's former IRA, as is her brother.

315
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,879
They were involved in several bombings in the early '90s,

316
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:00,821
including one that killed a father and two boys.

317
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,097
But MacLaine's conflicted. Has issues with her brother.

318
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:04,229
We think we can turn her.

319
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:06,553
She's the one person who could get Keene alone,

320
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,541
away from his men.

321
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,054
It could give us a chance to grab him without a fight, shut down the lab.

322
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:13,760
Have you determined how to approach MacLaine?

323
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,990
Yeah. In confession.

324
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:32,771
Thank you.

325
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,073
I'll have another one of these for my parishioner.

326
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,168
I don't know what I'm doing here.

327
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:10,905
I'm glad you came.

328
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:13,909
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

329
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:26,426
- Is it that bad?
- Is what that bad?

330
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,456
I don't know. You tell me.

331
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,928
I supposed I'm feeling a bit... trapped.

332
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,947
At the hospital?

333
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:40,029
Yeah.

334
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,714
Trapped by your brother?

335
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:47,811
I do this for a living. Not the drinking.

336
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,503
And it doesn't take a priest to notice

337
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:52,826
how angry you were when you saw him yesterday.

338
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:59,942
It's complicated. "Love the sinner, hate the sin."

339
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:02,024
Isn't that what they say?

340
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,007
Something like that.

341
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:10,041
A long time ago, he saved me.

342
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:12,807
I owe him.

343
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,834
But he scares you.

344
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,670
You don't know Fintan.

345
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,003
He's done some awful things.

346
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:27,608
We both have, I suppose.

347
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:31,404
You could always leave.

348
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:38,205
Like I said, you don't know my brother.

349
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,315
He can do it.

350
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:42,237
He can turn her.

351
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,299
I know what it's like to feel trapped,

352
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:49,652
to have a past you despise, that you can't escape.

353
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:52,139
We all have secrets, Kiera.

354
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,300
I was married -- for a short time.

355
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:02,210
That being your secret?

356
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,237
That being a part of it.

357
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:10,132
Now, obviously it was before I had the collar.

358
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:13,860
The woman I was married to betrayed me.

359
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:16,692
She betrayed a lot of people.

360
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:21,071
And when I found out what she'd done,

361
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:25,783
I let my hate for her consume me.

362
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:33,045
And I began to wish the woman I loved was dead.

363
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:40,335
I woke up every day imagining how I'd do it.

364
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:42,510
What was the best way.

365
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,690
What was the most efficient way.

366
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,225
I mean, it's all I wanted.

367
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,030
That woman was evil, and deserved to be punished,

368
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:01,811
so I killed her.

369
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:08,324
And although that woman was the worst kind of evil,

370
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:13,017
I also know that killing her was wrong.

371
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,707
I don't sleep much. I --

372
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,374
I mean, I can't close my eyes

373
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,612
without seeing it.

374
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,556
That -- that moment.

375
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,291
That look on her face.

376
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,426
She won't leave me.

377
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:43,674
She won't.

378
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,925
Forgiveness is a tricky thing, isn't it?

379
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:05,157
Even God can't do it if you won't let him.

380
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:15,186
I've never been able to say no to him -- to my brother.

381
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:18,644
I'm not alone in that, but...

382
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,476
it's my shame.

383
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:26,709
It's the one thing I can't forgive myself for.

384
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:32,666
I understand what it feels like to wish someone was...

385
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,224
I just wish there was a way out.

386
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:48,433
There are other ways

387
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:53,165
to keep him from having power over you, to make him go away.

388
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,613
You underestimate my brother.

389
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,309
Or maybe you underestimate me.

390
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:05,590
I know it doesn't feel like it, but you can leave.

391
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,430
- What are you --
- You deserve another chance.

392
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,512
I can't even think about doing something like that.

393
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:17,691
Why not?

394
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:21,056
When?

395
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,016
Tonight.

396
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,515
- Here.
- Just --

397
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:39,590
Freight manifests from our contact in Damascus.

398
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,994
Thank you. And that?

399
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,212
I thought you might know something about the picture.

400
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,045
Who the baby was.

401
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,964
Yeah. Well...

402
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:11,751
Your mother was a very private person, Nadia.

403
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:14,882
And as you know, my relationship with her was...

404
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,574
brief.

405
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:21,620
That's okay.

406
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,133
I just thought maybe you'd seen it before.

407
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,226
Thanks.

408
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:00,884
What are you?

409
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:03,403
S.A.S.?

410
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:04,726
MI-5?

411
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,666
I meant what I said. I can make your brother go away.

412
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,236
Well, whoever you are, you're sweet.

413
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,785
Kiera, I need you to listen.

414
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,905
Whatever your brother's done in the past

415
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,229
pales to what he's doing now.

416
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:23,667
I wouldn't know --

417
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,419
Yes, you do. You've seen it.

418
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,791
You know he's been testing it on your own patients.

419
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:29,447
I have nothing to do with that.

420
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:31,056
You're a party to it. That's enough.

421
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,091
There's nothing I can do about that.

422
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:35,036
Thousands of people will die if you don't say no to him now.

423
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:38,445
Do you want that on your conscience? Could you ever forgive yourself?

424
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:42,346
Who do you work for?

425
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,751
You've been afraid of your brother for too long.

426
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,976
Help me, and I swear I will protect you.

427
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,507
I can't wait to hear the details.

428
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,504
Did you really think my sister would betray me

429
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:12,163
for you after everything she and I have been through?

430
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,369
Nothing really surprises me anymore.

431
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:17,204
You'll discover that isn't true.

432
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,939
You know, the trouble with Ice 5 in its liquid form

433
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,434
is it's too unstable.

434
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,243
It's too hard to mass-produce.

435
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:34,716
I've made people drink it, breathe it.

436
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:38,265
I've applied it topically. I've mixed it into food.

437
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,394
The one thing I've never tried, though,

438
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:44,405
is to inject it directly into the brain.

439
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,570
Mainly because it's not cost-effective.

440
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,980
I think you should do it.

441
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:56,346
It's your fault he's here.

442
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,167
You hate him. You hate what he does.

443
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:15,012
Shut up.

444
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,319
I could have helped you.

445
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:19,011
I would have.

446
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:21,543
My sister may look like an angel,

447
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:25,296
but her heart is as black as yours and mine.

448
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:26,761
I don't believe that.

449
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,648
I know you want out.

450
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:31,446
Everything I told you was true. I can still help you.

451
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:33,288
You know it. You can feel it.

452
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,659
Show this fool he's wrong.

453
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:40,728
Inject it into his eye.

454
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,147
I want you to be the last thing he sees.

455
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:05,710
I don't know how you got in here, little girl, but it was a big mistake.

456
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:07,448
For...give --

457
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:12,702
- Forgive...
- Kiera...

458
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:16,438
You know I'm not really a priest. I can't do that.

459
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,077
No.

460
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:20,562
I --

461
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,338
I forgive --

462
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:29,106
I forgive you.

463
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,551
Fintan Keene's in custody and the Ice 5 has been acquired.

464
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,822
Sydney's safe. Our whole team made it.

465
00:36:16,962 --> 00:36:19,336
Good. Thank you.

466
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:21,591
May I see that photograph?

467
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,624
Irina told me years ago that this is a picture of her holding her niece.

468
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:49,924
She told me that holding this baby filled her with a longing and

469
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:52,725
a hope to have children of her own.

470
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:58,748
The next day, I asked Irina to marry me.

471
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:03,013
I wanted my child to be loved like the baby in this photograph.

472
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,309
Of course her story could have been a total fabrication.

473
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:14,338
Another one of her countless lies designed to draw me in.

474
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:18,775
But I choose to believe it was the truth.

475
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:25,668
When we had Sydney, Irina held her in this exact same way.

476
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,344
And I can only imagine that she did the same with you.

477
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,064
So, for me,

478
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:39,499
I choose to believe.

479
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:48,367
Well, then I suppose each of us needs to find our own sense of closure.

480
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:46,803
Listening to you talk to that woman...

481
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,040
I know.

482
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:05,882
I just wanted you to know you can talk to me whenever you want.

483
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,811
Thanks.

484
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,331
When we get back, maybe you should spend the night.

485
00:39:28,643 --> 00:39:29,443
Vaughn?
