1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,029
Previously on Alias.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,324
I got her. Blond hair, brown jacket.

3
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:08,243
Hi there!

4
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:10,429
How much does she know
about this operation?

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,745
Dean calls it "The Shed."

6
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,594
She was recruited two years ago,
computer specialist.

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,409
She's willing to give us everything.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,199
- What is it?
- We need some help.

9
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:22,156
You have to walk back into that office
and look everyone in the eye.

10
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:24,525
You can't let em see
that you know the truth.

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,403
Rachel? I need a prep report
by the end of the day.

12
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,577
Okay. I'll get right on it.

13
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:32,485
I think we may have a problem.

14
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:34,592
- What kind of problem?
- Rachel Gibson.

15
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,540
She's copying everything on my server.
Execute plan "B."

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,600
They set off an E.M.P.
They fried the electronics.

17
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:53,148
She's okay. She's going to be okay.

18
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,440
Thank you. Can I have the dice?

19
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,728
You guys seem a little wound up.

20
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,904
Let's loosen it up a little bit.
Come on!

21
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,103
Loosen it up! Get out the kinks!

22
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:57,458
It's that easy. If it's that easy,
I can't even help it. Bring 'em back.

23
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,500
That's right. There we go. Come on,
mama would love a new pair of shoes.

24
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,984
Tell your pit boss we need more money.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,833
We're feeling lucky tonight.

26
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,610
Ready?

27
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,080
How did I win?
I wasn't paying attention.

28
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,361
I can't even help it. I can't help it.

29
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:47,225
And it is that easy.

30
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:49,547
This is disgusting.

31
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:52,921
Can I help you with something,
Frenchman?

32
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,922
You're pregnant.

33
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:57,334
You should not be in a casino.
You should be at home.

34
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,671
Do you feel at home, baby?

35
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,693
We feel at home. Thank you.

36
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,918
You're gonna bet against me?

37
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,792
Well, good luck with that.

38
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,760
Don't give me that look, frenchie.
I warned you.

39
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:32,133
This table's gone cold.

40
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,356
Madame, could we please
have a word with you?

41
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:52,227
Sir, this is insane.

42
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,548
Do you have any idea who I am?

43
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:55,549
Sit down.

44
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,504
I will not. I've done nothing wrong.

45
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:02,986
Sit down.

46
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,807
I have seen some despicable
acts of cheating in my time,

47
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:13,323
but a pregnant woman using
her own baby to escape suspicion...

48
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,600
I don't know how you live with yourself.

49
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,053
What can I say, Sir?

50
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:20,498
I'm not like other moms.

51
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:28,237
Outrigger, I'm on my way to the vault.

52
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,977
Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault.
What's your status?

53
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,423
Sidewinder?

54
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,687
Sidewinder's gonna need
a little more time.

55
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,978
I'm at the vault. I need that key code.

56
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:01,616
Got it.

57
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:03,225
- Ready when you are.
- Go.

58
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:06,242
9-7-3-2-6-3-4-7.

59
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:14,096
I've got the package.

60
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,408
- I'll meet you to the front.
- All right.

61
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:38,311
This is Phoenix. We have the archive.

62
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,364
Any complications?

63
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:42,217
Well, I think I lost us about $900,000,

64
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,990
depending on the exchange rate.

65
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,675
Copy that. What's your location?

66
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,505
I'm approaching the ferry now.

67
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,554
Have a safe trip.

68
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:37,747
Hello?

69
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,169
You have something of mine.

70
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,374
Who is this?

71
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,990
I want my property back.
I want Mockingbird.

72
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:46,276
What?

73
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,310
You will have your people

74
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,062
deliver Mockingbird to me
within the hour,

75
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,194
or I will drop you.

76
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,872
There must be some kind of mistake.

77
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:53,623
I don't know what "Mockingbird" is.

78
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:56,413
- You're wasting time.
- Please, what is "Mockingbird"?

79
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,737
Rachel,

80
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,975
you should eat something.

81
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:16,814
You need to eat.

82
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,179
You need rest. The debriefing can wait.

83
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,191
No, it can't.

84
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,299
I know what you're going through.

85
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,875
You need to give yourself time...

86
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,876
It can't wait.

87
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,279
I'm held together by a string right now,
Ms. Bristow.

88
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,373
A week ago, I had a good job
working for the C.I.A.

89
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:41,794
Now I have the truth.

90
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:46,184
My job was a front for
a mercenary organization,

91
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:47,835
and my boss is a criminal,

92
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,683
and my coworkers are all dead...

93
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,493
because I got them killed.

94
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:54,483
It wasn't your fault.

95
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:57,562
They'd all still be alive
if I hadn't walked into that building.

96
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,773
Your boss, Gordon Dean...

97
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,053
he killed them, not you.

98
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:05,877
It doesn't change the fact
that every time I close my eyes,

99
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,278
I see their faces.

100
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:11,897
So I need to give you
everything I have right now,

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,500
because the sooner I'm finished,
the sooner this is over.

102
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,332
Rachel, first of all,
just don't call me "Ms. Bristow".

103
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,378
It's Sydney.

104
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:29,046
Secondly, your information
will go a long way

105
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,144
towards helping us find Gordon Dean.

106
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,694
We will get the people
responsible for this.

107
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,487
Then I'd better get back to work.

108
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:45,263
Oh, by the way, uh,
a name keeps coming up in your data...

109
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,441
"Mockingbird".

110
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:48,500
We don't have a base reference for it.

111
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,101
Sorry.

112
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,657
It's a briefing habit.

113
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,504
I take it for granted.
It's, um, my agency call sign.

114
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,442
It's me.

115
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:01,689
I'm Mockingbird.

118
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:33,036
I have an assignment
suited to your abilities.

119
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,691
I'll leave the approach
to your discretion.

120
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,836
I assume you're familiar
with the target.

121
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:42,616
I am.

122
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,643
You'll have our full resources
at your disposal.

123
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,489
You have resources?

124
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,655
Don't let the appearance fool you.

125
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:53,960
We're in the midst of a relocation.

126
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:55,522
I'll keep you updated.

127
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,116
I need money.

128
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,614
Where do we stand
on the satellite offices?

129
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,615
Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago,
they've all been abandoned.

130
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,837
We beat the C.I.A. by about an hour
at the St. Louis office.

131
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:10,928
They find anything?

132
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,201
Just extension cords
and surge protectors.

133
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,258
Alternate location
should be set up by day's end.

134
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,240
We've got the account transfers
ready across the board.

135
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,714
I just need your pass code
for the withdrawals.

136
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:26,848
God, you're paranoid.

137
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,313
That's why I'm still alive.

138
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:32,742
I got him.

139
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:33,908
I've been monitoring

140
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,743
Dean's bank accounts
based on your intel.

141
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:38,555
30 minutes ago,
he liquidated every single one of them.

142
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,679
Our infiltration in Prague
must have him concerned.

143
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,615
He's closing ranks,
covering his tracks.

144
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,861
Right, but not to worry,

145
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,300
because I'm a bit
of a master tracker myself.

146
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,273
I'm kind of like a Comanche Indian.

147
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:51,584
You know...
Comanche Indian who tracks data.

148
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,898
Anyway,
he consolidated all of his funds.

149
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,367
He deposited them
into one account designated...

150
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,368
1017.

151
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,877
It's the agency fail-safe account
in the Cayman Islands.

152
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,718
I set it up. 10/17 is my birthday.

153
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,797
Wait. Dean's money is all in one place?

154
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,240
If we seize his funds,
we can cripple his operation.

155
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,662
You won't be able to do it.

156
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,621
It's a trapdoor account.
It can't be hacked.

157
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,115
You have to be at the bank to access it,

158
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:20,694
and you need the prearranged responses
to Dean's protocol questions.

159
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:24,077
The only answer set is on Dean's server
in the Prague office,

160
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:25,494
which he destroyed,

161
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,234
I know how he works.

162
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,118
The only copy of his protocol
was in that building when he blew it up.

163
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,224
There's nothing left.

164
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:39,181
What?

165
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:42,741
Czech authorities have begun
their investigations into the bombings.

166
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:44,742
We've accessed their site inventories.

167
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:47,887
And they have catalogued
already several BR-46 servers.

168
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,995
That's them.

169
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,067
Marshall's designed
E.M. recovery software.

170
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:55,805
We can reconstruct the protocol.

171
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:57,368
Here's the problem.

172
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:02,536
The B.I.S. won't release their evidence
until they finish their investigation.

173
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,196
So I'm going back to Prague.

174
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,476
I need you to come with me.

175
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:12,530
- No. Absolutely not.
- Rachel...

176
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,680
You want me to dig
through that building?

177
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,944
If Dean transfers his assets
before we can access his account,

178
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,287
we lose him entirely.

179
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,748
I'm not going back there.

180
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,369
Those people are all dead because of me.

181
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,364
I'm not going to search
through their remains.

182
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:27,655
I wouldn't ask to do this
if there was another way.

183
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:30,987
Believe me, we need you to do this.

184
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,706
We need you to go back
into that building.

185
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,836
Mr. Sloane, my name is Boyd Harkin.

186
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,265
I'm special prosecutor to your case.

187
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,115
I'm required to inform you

188
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:11,757
that under
national security directive 115b,

189
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,754
you do not qualify for legal counsel.

190
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:15,056
I understand.

191
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,494
This is Deputy Director Miller,
Undersecretary Reeves.

192
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:20,021
We've spent the last few months
reviewing your case.

193
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,750
The Justice Department is prepared

194
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:24,197
to accept our recommendation
for your sentencing.

195
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:27,598
Before we rule, however,
we have a few questions for you.

196
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,781
- I'm prepared to cooperate.
- Good.

197
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:33,222
Mr. Sloane, a little over a year ago,

198
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,861
you signed a pardon agreement
with the Justice Department.

199
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,498
What were the terms of that agreement?

200
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,872
I was asked to oversee
a black ops unit for the C.I.A.

201
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,766
In exchange for my participation,

202
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:47,514
I received a pardon for a crimes.

203
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,859
Let's talk about those crimes.

204
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:52,839
Your record reads like

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,084
a veritable catalog
of illegal activity...

206
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:59,289
multiple counts of murder,
conspiracy, treason.

207
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,093
I have trouble understanding
how any pardon agreement

208
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,462
resulting in your freedom
could be justified.

209
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,905
If you will examin the record
of the previous proceedings,

210
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,591
you will find the charges against me

211
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:12,328
were carefully considered
before they were dismissed

212
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,291
as to whether the pardon itself
was justified.

213
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,996
I suppose that's a question
for the Justice Department.

214
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:21,086
Perhaps.

215
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,416
But since I have you
in front of me right now,

216
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,912
why don't we see if we can suss it out?

217
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Of course.

218
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,581
We're scheduled to meet
the emissary at 3.

219
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,122
Sydney should have
touched down in Prague by now.

220
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,333
Give her two hours
in and out of the site.

221
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:38,619
Should have plenty of time to spare.

222
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
We know what this emissary looks like?

223
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:42,387
No. He's got our descriptions.

224
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,129
He'll escort us from the beach.

225
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,310
Helps keep the bank's location secret.

226
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,245
If he tries to blindfold us,
he may have a problem.

227
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:52,030
I'm not in the mood
for blindfolds today.

228
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:53,935
Noted.

229
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:55,476
What do we do till 3?

230
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:57,871
We wait.

231
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:17,186
I can't do this.

232
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,081
We've got the easy job.

233
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:21,872
Once we access the protocol,
we feed it to Tom and Dixon.

234
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:24,399
They handle the heavy stuff.
We're out of there.

235
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:27,278
There's a reason
I wanted to work at a desk.

236
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,463
I don't like pressure...
or death, for that matter.

237
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:32,528
Listen to me.

238
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:35,726
I have to do unpleasant tasks
all the time,

239
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,075
and the best way to do it
is to become someone else.

240
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,812
Where are the B.I.S. badges?

241
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,980
I'm not Sydney Bristow.
You're not Rachel Gibson.

242
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,150
We're Czech Intelligence Terrorism Unit.

243
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,787
When we walk on that floor,

244
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,089
we outrank everyone else in the room.
Act like it.

245
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,452
Nothing in there can rattle us

246
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,406
because we see
this type of thing everyday.

247
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,998
We see this everyday.

248
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,987
We see this everyday.

249
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,767
Which way do we go?

250
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:37,642
Follow me.

251
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,158
It should be right here.

252
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,959
Let's get to work.

253
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:34,896
Excuse me.

254
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,438
Misters Taldash and White?

255
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,780
My name is Pierpont.
I'm here to escort you to the bank.

256
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,209
You're early.

257
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,343
I'm merely following
your account's protocol.

258
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:47,380
Is there a problem?

259
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,404
Of course not. Excuse me.

260
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,570
Yeah, this is it.

261
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,285
This is Mr. Taldash, room 440.

262
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,709
I'm going to have to cancel
my massage this afternoon.

263
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,131
I'm afraid I got my times mixed up.
Thank you.

264
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,912
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

265
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,524
That was Dixon. We don't have
as much time as we thought.

266
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:24,709
Oh, God.

267
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,900
It's okay.

268
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,786
It's okay. I'll just--
I'll deal with the server.

269
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,833
Go on.

270
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,245
I've got to get out of here.

271
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:40,522
Rachel.

272
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Rachel, look at me.

273
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:46,379
I'll handle the server,
but you have to tell me what to do.

274
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:48,661
You need the hard drive.

275
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,398
Which one?

276
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,777
Fifth. Fifth one down.

277
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:54,558
Get the computer ready.

278
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,408
Rachel.

279
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,181
So how far is the bank?

280
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,846
You've never been here before?

281
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,536
This is our first time in the Caymans.

282
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:14,747
Ah, well, you're lucky.

283
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,595
The bank's not far today.

284
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,386
We gave up our fixed location years ago.

285
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:29,451
Technology allows us a certain fluidity.

286
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,563
We find our clients prefer our business
remain mobile.

287
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,783
Our clients, as I'm sure you're aware,

288
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,045
are highly security-conscious.

289
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:43,924
Welcome to First Cayman Trust.

290
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,621
Hook it up.

291
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:05,649
Are the weapons necessary?

292
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,628
They certainly won't be
if you know your account's protocol.

293
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,999
Give me your hand.

294
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:17,999
Hook it up.

295
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,298
Gentlemen,

296
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,760
there are over 300 possible questions.

297
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,828
We've committed the answers to memory.

298
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,139
Our boss is highly security-conscious.

299
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,763
Of course.

300
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:40,078
Here we go.

301
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,532
"The select blood runs through..."

302
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,367
Do you need me to repeat the question?

303
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,368
No.

304
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,657
"The select blood runs through..."

305
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:01,836
"Rouquet's heart."

306
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,961
"Rouquet's heart."

307
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:09,139
"The future's history is written in..."

308
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:12,621
"The ink of the past."

309
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:13,897
What are these questions?

310
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,055
"The ink of the past."

311
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,987
"What the mirror reflects..."

312
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,273
"Lives eternal."

313
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:19,522
"Lives eternal."

314
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,079
"If there was never a one,
there was ever..."

315
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,400
- Oh, no.
- What?

316
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:33,899
The data's corrupt.

317
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:36,831
"If there was never a one,
there was ever..."

318
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,214
This was yours.

319
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:42,100
No. No, no. This was yours.

320
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,961
I've heard Dean say this before.

321
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:49,238
You had all the questions
that rhymed, remember?

322
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:50,711
Yes.

323
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,319
Gentlemen, I need an answer.

324
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,945
"If there was never a one,
there was ever..."

325
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:00,200
- "The twelve."
- "The twelve."

326
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,475
"The twelve."

327
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:04,973
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:06,910
Gentlemen, we're at your service.

329
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,730
Come on. Let's get out of here.

330
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,000
It's over. Come on.

331
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,249
Can I get you
something to drink, a cigar?

332
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,300
You know what? I'd love a drink.

333
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,575
Someone accessed the 1017 account.

334
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,763
They cleaned us out. We lost everything.

335
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,156
That's impossible.

336
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:45,683
They were on-site,
transferred from the Caymans.

337
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:50,000
No one can do that.

338
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:52,412
I am the only one with...

339
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,420
She's still alive.

340
00:22:57,598 --> 00:23:00,300
Rachel Gibson's still alive.

341
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,500
And they've got her in custody.

342
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,000
We need to get her back.

343
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,870
I'd like to turn
our attention to Omnifam.

344
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,483
For three years,

345
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:20,029
I ran a world relief organization
dedicated to humanitarian causes.

346
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:23,516
Which you used as a cover
for a genetic engineering project

347
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:25,609
that almost caused a global genocide.

348
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:28,848
Yes.

349
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:29,974
"Yes"?

350
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:31,899
Mr. Sloane, I just accused you

351
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,851
of attempting to murder
millions of people.

352
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,994
I was hoping
for a bit more than a "yes."

353
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,903
For years,

354
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,762
I was driven by a misguided attempt

355
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:44,509
to pursue...

356
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,200
a higher power.

357
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,001
I will not attempt
to deny my wrongdoings.

358
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:52,825
There is no reason to.

359
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:56,247
The government
has pardoned me for those actions.

360
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,200
However, I am reformed.

361
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:08,706
Two years ago,
I learned I had a daughter.

362
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,210
She has changed my life.

363
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,532
Since the moment I met her,

364
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,200
I have dedicated my every moment,

365
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:22,400
every action,

366
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,922
to atoning for my sins.

367
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,400
Mr. Sloane, four months ago
you betrayed your agency

368
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:33,891
and participated in a conspiracy
that caused the deaths

369
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:35,982
of thousands of people in Sovogda.

370
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,050
How exactly is that
atoning for your sins?

371
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,350
I did not betray my agency.

372
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,687
I was forced to go undercover

373
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:46,075
to establish credentials
with Elena Derevko.

374
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:49,428
And you should have in front of you
corresponding statements

375
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:50,617
from the agents involved.

376
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:52,039
Yes, I have the statements.

377
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,745
Your colleagues seem to have bought
your hollow justifications,

378
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:59,304
but I find your actions fit a pattern of

379
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:02,305
criminal behavior you have demonstrated
your entire life.

380
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,831
Time and again
you explain away your crimes

381
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,306
as some sort of necessary evil.

382
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:10,254
I find it shocking people continue
to believe your lies.

383
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:17,250
In truth, these proceedings
are a mere formality.

384
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:20,904
You will atone for your sins,
Mr. Sloane.

385
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,871
Only you don't get
to decide the punishment.

386
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:26,621
We do.

387
00:25:36,557 --> 00:25:38,662
Assuming the worst, it will happen fast.

388
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:41,965
You'll be immediately transferred
to a federal penitentiary.

389
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:45,358
It's doubtful we'll have a chance
to go over your affairs,

390
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:48,002
assuming they rule against you.

391
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,856
They're going to rule against me.

392
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,683
Thank you for getting Sydney and Marcus
to write statements on my behalf.

393
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,680
I'm sure that must have been
very difficult.

394
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,733
They volunteered. I didn't have to ask.

395
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,260
Well, thank them for me.

396
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,420
I want to give you
the power of attorney over Nadia.

397
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:13,995
Of course.

398
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,422
Promise me you'll do everything you can
to save her, Jack,

399
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,295
as if she were your own daughter.

400
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:26,250
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

401
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:29,782
He's scared.
The Cayman transfer was a success.

402
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,786
We were able to take
full control of Dean's finances.

403
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,000
As a result, he's getting sloppy,

404
00:26:36,183 --> 00:26:37,919
making uncharacteristic mistakes.

405
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,992
An hour ago, Echelon intercepted
a call Dean placed to Laurent Moreau,

406
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:45,851
a business associate Ms. Gibson
flagged in her debriefings.

407
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,111
You lost everything.

408
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,683
It's a setback.
We're moving forward as scheduled,

409
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,810
but I need to retrieve
my operations archives.

410
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,105
You're planning on
blackmailing yourself out of the red?

411
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:59,419
Where are the archives, Laurent?

412
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,742
Relax. They're safe at Rue L'Or.

413
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,684
I'll contact you Thursday
to arrange transfer.

414
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:05,183
Dean's going after his archives.

415
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,037
If we can beat him to it,
we'd have access

416
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,244
to Dean's entire operation.

417
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:11,059
They said they're being held
at Rue L'Or. Where's that?

418
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, looks like it's in Monte Carlo,

419
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:15,771
one of Moreau's fronts.

420
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,500
Hey, it's a casino.

421
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:22,062
What do we do
with all that money we seized?

422
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:35,703
Having trouble sleeping, Mr. Sloane?

423
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,311
I don't blame you.

424
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:41,639
You'd have to count a lot of sheep

425
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,134
to erase today's proceedings,
that's for sure.

426
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,143
I'm guessing

427
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,570
they're gonna put you away
for a long time,

428
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:54,279
which is just too bad, really, 'cause...

429
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:58,246
it'll be awful hard
to help that daughter of yours

430
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:00,089
from inside a federal penitentiary.

431
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,769
Of course, it doesn't have
to be that way.

432
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Huh, Mr. Sloane?

433
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:12,058
I work for some very powerful people.

434
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,953
My benefactors may be able to help
sway the committee's decision tomorrow.

435
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I see.

436
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,680
And I suppose that
these benefactors of yours

437
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,855
want something in return
for their help.

438
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,310
They would at that.

439
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,228
We need to tap into the fiber optics.

440
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:38,364
There's a maintenance station
in the parking garage.

441
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,320
Guard checkpoints are here and here.
They've got the garage locked down.

442
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,900
I can get into the parking garage.

443
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,950
Hey, guys, check this out.
Winner-- 7, every time. 7.

444
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,686
Marshall, you're not supposed to hit 7.

445
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,792
No, no, it's-- it--
it's supposed to hit 7, right? I mean...

446
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:53,812
See? Winner, 7.

447
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,746
You've got it backwards. She's right.

448
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:56,747
Really?

449
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,187
Talk to me about this vault.

450
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,498
The deposit boxes
are in electromagnetic tumblers.

451
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:03,558
Can we get around it?

452
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,559
It's on a systemic system. The mainframe
resets the pass codes daily.

453
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,612
I can get around it.

454
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:11,921
If it's an E.M. system,
I can decrypt the algorithm.

455
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,748
I just need access
to the building's network.

456
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:16,643
Can we do it from a remote location?

457
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:21,811
It's a segregated network.
I'd have to be there.

458
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,400
But... I'll go.

459
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:28,100
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

460
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:30,500
No, I-- I mean, I want to.

461
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:39,796
I had to dig through my friends,
yesterday, because of Gordon Dean.

462
00:29:40,623 --> 00:29:42,320
If I can help you stop him,

463
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:45,075
then that's what I need to do.

464
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,155
There's not a whole lot
that'll scare me.

465
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,300
Not anymore.

466
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:11,061
Tell your pit boss we need more money.

467
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,849
We're feeling lucky tonight.

468
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:34,076
Madame, can we please
have a word with you?

469
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,138
I need a piece of paper.

470
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,127
Here, have this.

471
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,125
Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault.

472
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:01,378
What's your status?

473
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,374
- They're ready for us.
- Sidewinder?

474
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,375
We gotta go.

475
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:07,814
Do you wanna come over here
and do the advanced binomial calculus?

476
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:10,709
'Cause I'd be more than happy
to stand there and watch.

477
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,138
Sidewinder's gonna need
a little more time.

478
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,243
I'm at the vault. I need that key code.

479
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:20,563
Got it.

480
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,795
I've got the package.

481
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,313
This is Phoenix. We have the archive.

482
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:51,627
- What's your location?
- I'm approaching the ferry now.

483
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,101
Copy that. Have a safe trip.

484
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,346
I don't know what "Mockingbird" is.

485
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,997
Please, what is "Mockingbird"?

486
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,740
I can't help you if you don't tell me
what you want.

487
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:40,162
Ms. Bristow, you're not exactly
in the position to play coy.

488
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,852
You know who I am.

489
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,815
Yes.

490
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:46,921
You know what I want.

491
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:50,376
You're not thinking this through, Dean.

492
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:52,251
If you drop me,
you destroy your archive.

493
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:53,904
The laptop's a fake.

494
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:55,649
There's nothing on it.

495
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,805
Where's Mockingbird now?

496
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,504
Ms. Bristow...

497
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,924
All right, all right, you win. Listen...

498
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,678
the C.I.A. has her
in protective custody.

499
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,766
She's... in a safe--

500
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:10,024
What?

501
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:12,649
She's in a safe house in Philadelphia.

502
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,149
Listen carefully.

503
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:18,136
Tell your people to deliver her
to the 30th Street train station.

504
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:20,300
They have exactly 30 minutes.

505
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,008
Sydney...

506
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,972
what's happening?

507
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:28,300
Rachel, hang on a sec.

508
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,068
I gotta call my dad.

509
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:35,828
Dean doesn't know Rachel's with you?

510
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:40,950
No. He's expecting the C.I.A.
to deliver her in exactly... 26 minutes.

511
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,489
Task the satellites.
I want full coverage of her area.

512
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,890
Sydney, if Dean calls again,
route it through us.

513
00:33:45,953 --> 00:33:47,637
Don't worry. We'll get you down.

514
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:48,956
You'd better.

515
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:52,153
Dixon, where are you?

516
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,152
We're en route. Five minutes away.

517
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:57,097
Approach carefully.
We don't know who's on the ground,

518
00:33:57,098 --> 00:33:58,328
but get to that crane.

519
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,231
Rules of engagement
are at your discretion.

520
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:01,375
Copy that. Almost there.

521
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:09,959
Rachel, how you doing?

522
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:11,861
I've been better.

523
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,235
How are you?

524
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,604
Oh, you know,
just another day at the office.

525
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,612
Hey, Rachel, look around back there.

526
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:22,665
Is there anything that might be useful?

527
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:26,000
Uh, well, there's a tire...

528
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,900
and a crowbar, and I have my purse.

529
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,803
- Are those helpful?
- No, not really.

530
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,677
How high up are we?

531
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,550
Oh, just...

532
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,727
a couple hundred feet.

533
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,352
Don't worry. I've been
in much worse situations than this.

534
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,739
You have?

535
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:57,478
Area's clear so far.

536
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:59,191
We're approaching the cab now.

537
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:05,551
It's empty.

538
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,585
Can you get to the controls?

539
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:11,022
Hang on.

540
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,596
He's got some sort of...

541
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:16,959
Uh-oh.

542
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,800
That was fast. Do it.

543
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:27,335
Sydney?

544
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:42,100
Pull your agents off-site, right now.

545
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,681
Outrigger, get out of there.

546
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:47,759
You're trying my patience, Ms. Bristow.

547
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,275
Any further deviations,
and I will drop you.

548
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:52,597
I want confirmation
Mockingbird's en route.

549
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,609
- What sort of confirmation?
- Have her call me.

550
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:57,457
What?

551
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,520
Dean's got the place wired.
It's all on remote.

552
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,152
If I can isolate the frequency,

553
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:03,851
I might be able to override
the crane's controls.

554
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:05,142
What do you need from us?

555
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:06,195
Just time. Just time.

556
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,770
Sydney.

557
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,592
I can't do that.
I can't call him. He'll know.

558
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:14,447
I'm a terrible liar.

559
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,467
That's why he wants me to call.

560
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:19,279
Rachel, this is easy.
This is just like in Prague.

561
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:20,832
You have to become someone else.

562
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,690
You have to become
the person you used to be.

563
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:24,583
All you have to do
is act helpless and scared.

564
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
I am scared.

565
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,848
Yeah, but you're not helpless,
not anymore.

566
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:34,200
Look... I've spent my life
dealing with men like Gordon Dean.

567
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,583
They all have a fatal flaw.
They always want power.

568
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,833
So you just fool 'em
into thinking they have it,

569
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,991
and you hit 'em
when they're not looking.

570
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,634
So what do I do?

571
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,658
Act terrified. Keep him on the phone.

572
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:48,272
We'll do the rest.

573
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:00,335
Hello.

574
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,714
They told me to call you.

575
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:04,706
Rachel. Where are you?

576
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:07,069
I'm in a van. I don't know.

577
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:09,024
They wanted me...

578
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:12,399
they wanted me to tell you that
they're doing everything you asked.

579
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,031
They're turning me over to you.

580
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,197
They won't tell me anything else.

581
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:20,370
What are you gonna do to me?

582
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,827
Just come in, Rachel.
We need to talk to you.

583
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:26,310
I didn't tell them anything.
I swear, I didn't tell them anything.

584
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:27,584
I believe you.

585
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:28,646
Marshall?

586
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,831
I'm almost there, almost there.
Just give me a sec.

587
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,121
Give me a sec. Almost there.

588
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,185
What are you gonna do to me?

589
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,025
That depends on how cooperative you are.

590
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,394
I'll do anything you want.

591
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,914
Please, Mr. Dean. Please.

592
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,025
I don't wanna die.

593
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:46,648
Rachel, plan "B."

594
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:49,317
What was that?

595
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,265
Kick the backseat as hard as you can.

596
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:52,422
Now, do it right now!

597
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:54,695
The crowbar.

598
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,005
She's in the car.

599
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:00,595
Give me your hand.

600
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:02,094
Drop 'em!

601
00:38:25,218 --> 00:38:28,200
Mr. Sloane, this committee
has reviewed your case

602
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,791
and is prepared to render its ruling.

603
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,030
Before we do so,

604
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,487
I'd like to reiterate for the record

605
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:40,331
my extreme disapproval
for tactics you have employed

606
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:43,776
while working under the auspices
of the United States Government.

607
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:46,277
Your compromised methodology
sullies the name

608
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:49,283
of every man and woman
who serves this country honorably.

609
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:55,800
However, while I may
detest your methods,

610
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,600
I cannot deny your results.

611
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,834
After careful examination of the facts,

612
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,364
this committee is forced to conclude

613
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,086
your recent actions fall

614
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,000
within the guidelines
of your pardon agreement,

615
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,900
and that, in truth, you have
this country's best interests in mind.

616
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,500
I find no cause for violation.

617
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,368
Arvin Sloane,
I hereby order your release,

618
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:24,988
effective immediately.

619
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:05,905
How can you people
sleep after something like this?

620
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,607
You just learn to take it
where you can get it, I guess.

621
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:18,030
It's never gonna be over, is it?

622
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,246
I'm gonna be with you awhile.

623
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,000
In custody, I mean.

624
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:34,575
You'll be with us until
it's safe for you to go home.

625
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,659
When will that be?

626
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:41,852
I honestly don't know.

627
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:46,008
Dean knows how dangerous you are to him.

628
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:50,000
We can't release you
until we've brought him in.

629
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:53,367
But it doesn't end with Dean.

630
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,028
No, it doesn't.

631
00:40:57,778 --> 00:40:59,093
It's never gonna be safe.

632
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,187
I guess we'll have
to bring 'em all down.

633
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,000
Every single one of 'em.

634
