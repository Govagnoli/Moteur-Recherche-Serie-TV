1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:03,813
Seven years ago,
I was recruited to work for SD-6,

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,649
which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:10,361
I was trained as a spy,
warned not to tell anyone what I did.

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,822
I thought I was working
for the good guys

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:16,408
until I told my fiancé about SD-6,
and they had him killed.

6
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,452
That's when I learned the truth,

7
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,705
that SD-6 is part of the enemy
I thought I was fighting.

8
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,876
Now, I'm a double agent, working
with the real CIA to bring down SD-6.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,881
My only ally is another double agent,
a man I hardly know. My father.

10
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:33,342
Rambaldi's become a priority.

11
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,052
We need that code.

12
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:39,098
We learned the K-Directorate agent
stole the key to the lock box.

13
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,559
It was Anna, wasn't it?

14
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:52,361
Obviously, we need the key
and they need the box.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,822
Six hours ago
I contacted K-Directorate

16
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:57,408
and we settled
on an arrangement.

17
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,244
You and Anna will meet
at a neutral location,

18
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,830
under cover of both agencies'
security forces.

19
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:05,082
Together you'll open the lock box.

20
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:21,932
Oh, my God!

21
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:39,241
Zero, zero, one, one, zero...

22
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,204
Zero, zero, one, one, zero...

23
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,682
- Did you get it?
- Did you?

24
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,814
Dixon, I may need transmission.

25
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,398
I've lost her signal.

26
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:14,193
- Zero, zero, one, zero. Get that?
- Got it!

27
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:17,780
- I'm giving SD-6 the wrong number.
- No. Give them what...

28
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm not giving the right sequence.
No way! Forget it!

29
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:25,204
Sydney, it's critical. Sydney, give
them the number! That's an order!

30
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,622
- An order?
- Yes.

31
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,458
We have to have a long talk
when I get back to LA.

32
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,090
- Dixon, I've got the code!
- Go!

33
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,135
Zero, one, zero, zero, one...

34
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:46,892
Zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero,
zero, one, one, one.

35
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:52,148
Just two ones... and...

36
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,906
One, one, zero, one. That's it!

37
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,409
One, one, zero, one.

38
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:08,789
You did good.

39
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:25,723
- You do not give me orders!
- Maybe I do.

40
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,684
- I could have misled SD-6.
- You're not thinking.

41
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,103
Stop talking for a second!

42
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:32,646
If SD-6 got a bogus code,

43
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,066
what happens when
K-Directorate get the right sequence?

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,110
They would think I made a mistake.

45
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:41,655
And Anna didn't? She'd have
given them the correct code.

46
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,117
They'd know it said Athens.
K-Directorate would head there.

47
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,495
SD-6 would have nothing
and suspect you!

48
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:52,958
We have to be very careful here.
Wildly, crazy-careful.

49
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:56,796
If SD-6 suspects you in the least,
it's over!

50
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,597
Anna's been the enemy
for three years.

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,851
In Berlin, I realised she wants SD-6
to burn almost as much as I do.

52
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:17,316
To the CIA, the only thing worse than
SD-6 getting critical information

53
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,485
is if K-Directorate gets it first.

54
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:23,823
Anna is still your enemy.

55
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,703
You're not into mysticism?

56
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:31,455
- Mysticism?
- Neither am I

57
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,584
but keep an open mind, it'll help.
The code was written in 1489.

58
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:38,629
The guy who wrote it
was some sort of Nostradamus.

59
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,589
His name was Milo Rambaldi.

60
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:44,510
This binary was written
by a 15th-century fortune-teller?

61
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:46,345
Why have I never heard of him?

62
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:49,890
His designs were so advanced,
they assumed he was insane.

63
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:52,601
On some drawings,
he made lists of numbers.

64
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:56,355
ID numbers of technology
not made until now. This year!

65
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,274
It's real! It's a hunt.

66
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,986
This man spent the last ten years
of his life on one project.

67
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,865
We don't know if it's a weapon,
a fuel source, a transport system.

68
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,616
Based on the little we know,

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,995
its technology is beyond
anything we have ever seen.

70
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,539
How's your wife? I forgot to ask.

71
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:17,334
Good. And yours?

72
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,254
Actually,
Emily's a bit under the weather,

73
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:22,131
but thanks for asking.

74
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:27,136
- Did you read the report?
- They found nothing.

75
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,390
This is Anthony Rossi,
transferring from Jennings.

76
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:35,561
He's working on the UCO file.
You met Marshall. This is Bristow.

77
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,771
I know your father.

78
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:40,566
We read the code you recovered.
We sent the team to Athens.

79
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,152
I just had a call from SD-3.

80
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:46,280
There was no evidence
pertaining to Rambaldi.

81
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:50,826
We were there first.
It turns out we made a mistake.

82
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:54,205
But... so did K-Directorate.

83
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:58,793
In our rush to decipher the Rambaldi
enigma, we misinterpreted the code.

84
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:01,712
It left us with two series of digits.

85
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:06,300
We assumed longitude and latitude.
He was using a compression scheme.

86
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,802
I should have seen that.

87
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:11,514
Instead of Athens, the team should
have gone to Malaga, Spain.

88
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,517
Which is... where you are going.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,188
There's a 500-year-old church
sitting on Rambaldi's coordinates.

90
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:22,024
- What am I looking for?
- We don't know.

91
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:26,028
The only clue we have are two words
that were part of the code.

92
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:29,657
- Sol d'oro.
- Golden sun.

93
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,046
I was hoping you'd come.

94
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:10,002
- You said nothing to Charlie?
- I needed to talk to you.

95
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:14,465
- It's a match book with a number.
- Yeah, Rachel, who 'loved tonight'!

96
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,300
- Ask Charlie about it.
- Yeah.

97
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,553
- What else can you do?
- Have you ever spied on anyone?

98
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:26,519
I know it's totally beneath me
but Charlie's been so distant lately.

99
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:30,731
When I ask what's wrong, he says,
"Nothing, baby, everything's fine."

100
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,441
You don't believe him?

101
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,985
He has law review in an hour.

102
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:39,031
- And you wanna follow him?
- So much, I cannot tell you.

103
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:43,577
I think spying on your boyfriend

104
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,372
is regarded
as a bad relationship precedent.

105
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:48,124
What if he's cheating on me?

106
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,680
- You're a really good friend.
- Yes, I know.

107
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:08,394
So this thing happened
with Will the other night.

108
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:11,230
- What? Did he come on to you?
- No. No.

109
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,067
I kissed him.

110
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,487
- What?! You kissed Will?
- I know, stop it!

111
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:22,575
We were in the apartment after you
left and we'd had all those drinks!

112
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:23,784
I don't believe it!

113
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:29,248
There he is. Start the car.
Start the car!

114
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:34,295
- No. Wait till he's a block away.
- Look at you, gettin' all into it!

115
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:40,009
- Everyone knows you wait.
- I don't know you wait.

116
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:40,968
You wait.

117
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,390
What's he doin'?

118
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:09,538
OK, I guess he's not goin'
to law review.

119
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,503
H-E-C-H-T?

120
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,214
You're certain? OK. Thank you.

121
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,424
I promise, I won't call you.

122
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:24,053
Danny's meant to be registered
at a conference in Singapore.

123
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,889
You said. Litvack wants
the Baptist Church copy.

124
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,975
I checked all the conferences,
he's not registered.

125
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,144
I know!

126
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,772
- Will Tippin.
- Hey, it's me.

127
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,442
- Hey. Hi. How'd your trip go?
- OK.

128
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:43,656
- Fine, thanks, how are you?
- Good, busy.

129
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:47,118
Listen, you don't feel weird
about what happened, right?

130
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,994
A little.

131
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,039
- Me too.
- We'll talk about that later.

132
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:55,417
Francie and I saw Charlie last night
with another woman.

133
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,879
- What? You're kidding!
- She spent the night at my place.

134
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:01,507
She's here now. She's sort of a mess.

135
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,592
- Oh, God!
- The bank called.

136
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:09,598
- I might have another trip.
- You take a crazy amount of trips.

137
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,435
Would you drop by later,
check she's OK.

138
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,186
Yeah, of course.

139
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,649
- Thank you. I should go.
- OK, go. I'll talk to you later.

140
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:25,781
That was Sydney. You're different
when you talk to Sydney.

141
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,324
Don't analyse me.

142
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:31,120
Can you get the number of the guy
who works for the airport?

143
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:34,123
What's his name? Luis Escorza.
What?

144
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:37,918
If you want me to do something
for you, you say, "please".

145
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,503
Please, Escorza! OK?

146
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,717
You know,
"please" is implicit, Jenny!

147
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:04,695
Dad!

148
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,992
- You've a meeting with Sloane?
- McCullough.

149
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,790
- Psych evaluation?
- Routine. Nothing I'm not used to.

150
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,875
Nothing I look forward to.

151
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,628
But such is the nature of the job.

152
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:29,220
So, Berlin. It worked out.

153
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:33,516
My meeting with K-Directorate,
we got the code.

154
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,351
That was smart.

155
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,853
Well, I should go.

156
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,189
I'll see you later.

157
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:43,776
Dad...

158
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:51,200
...could we have dinner?
How about Thursday?

159
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:54,745
Do you have plans?

160
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,543
No. Thursday. Dinner.

161
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:01,836
That'll be fine.

162
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:09,552
Analysis is working on the piece
she brought back from Spain.

163
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:13,681
This is not glass. We know that.
It's a synthetic polymer.

164
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:17,143
They believe it was made
at least 500 years ago.

165
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,437
Before we had synthetic polymers?

166
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,441
So the mystery continues.
Meanwhile we have another situation.

167
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:27,570
Last year's United Commerce
Organisation Ministerial Conference.

168
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:31,824
Some groups led planned attacks
against it. Zero Defence among them.

169
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:35,369
Word is, they will be at this year's
conference in Sao Paulo.

170
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,789
Luc Jacqnoud should be
in Morocco in 48 hours.

171
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,792
Isn't he in La Sante
for stabbing a police officer?

172
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:44,462
Released early.
He has ties to French justice.

173
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,465
Intel reports he'll be
in Morocco to meet a client.

174
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:50,259
- ID on the client?
- None. That's your job.

175
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,511
You're Kate Jones and Justin Burnell.

176
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:56,140
You're with Mindspring
Learning Tours, arriving Wednesday.

177
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,310
You are to monitor the meeting,
ID the client

178
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:03,189
and make sure whatever it is
Jacqnoud is up to doesn't happen.

179
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:07,026
- Is Mokhtar the contact?
- He's meeting you at the airport.

180
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:11,030
This is an Egyptian commando.
We recruited him two years ago.

181
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:12,364
Marshall?

182
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,244
How is everyone? Hi. Alright.

183
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:21,916
You're going in with the usual tech.
Camera, comm gear and sat' relay.

184
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,335
But this... this is new.

185
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,879
This looks like a normal purse,
right?

186
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:29,882
You would wear it
going out with your lady friends.

187
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:34,512
Put your feminine things in there.
But... parabolic microphone!

188
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:38,265
It has a laser transmitter
with a 300-yard radius.

189
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:43,270
I also added a low-frequency wind
filter to eliminate unwanted sounds.

190
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:46,941
Not that you're going to be in wind.
Probably not...

191
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:50,903
But if you were...
like a light breeze, like a...

192
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,116
or even something stronger,
like a gust. Like...

193
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:01,872
This? Nothing. Silent wind filter.

194
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,169
You feel lighter than air.

195
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:10,798
And as you continue
moving downward,

196
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:14,635
you feel more and more relaxed.

197
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,764
The escalator continues down,

198
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:22,143
and the closer you get to the light,

199
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:26,021
the more relaxed you feel.

200
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:29,984
The escalator seems
to continue forever

201
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:35,281
and you feel safe and... relaxed.

202
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:40,953
Still listening to my voice,
keep going,

203
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:47,418
and the farther you go,
the more comfortable you feel.

204
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,503
Completely safe...

205
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,966
...and comfortable.

206
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,851
It's only a matter of time
before I find out the truth.

207
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:10,191
- Jack?
- Just give me a minute, will you?

208
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:41,222
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's alright.

209
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,099
- You OK?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,354
We knew Jacqnoud was travelling.
We thought he was going to Bahrain.

211
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:51,357
We don't know why SD-6
is so interested in UCO.

212
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,358
Sure you're OK?

213
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:56,695
- Yeah, I just...
- Did you fight with your wife?

214
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,155
- My what?
- Your wife?

215
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,199
What wife? I... I have no wife.

216
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:04,829
No? There's a picture in your office.
You and that woman.

217
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:08,582
She and I are not remotely...
You thought I was married?

218
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,920
- I guess so. What's the big deal?
- Nothin'!

219
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:21,345
So... when you get an ID
on who he's meeting,

220
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,432
and details of that meeting,
call the usual number.

221
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:27,977
Hit the eight key.
We'll dead drop in the trash can.

222
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,398
Why did you ask me if I had a fight
with my girlfriend?

223
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:35,943
- I don't know. Did you?
- Huge!

224
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,615
Good luck in Morocco.

225
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,202
Thanks.

226
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,526
Look at you.

227
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:21,238
It's been a while.

228
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,867
Hello!

229
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,118
How've you been?

230
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,996
Busy!
Too many people with dangerous toys.

231
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,539
Any news on Jacqnoud?

232
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:34,251
A friend tells me he's meeting
a client today at a market place.

233
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:35,628
I've got a spot for us.

234
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,798
- Any word on the client?
- Big mystery. We don't know.

235
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:41,258
Come, I'm parked right over there.

236
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:44,553
Charlie has called my cellphone
six times!

237
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:47,223
- You still haven't seen him?
- No.

238
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:51,393
I want him to suffer. I'm not even
gonna tell him where I am.

239
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:54,355
How was Chicago?
Did you get there OK?

240
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:59,819
Yeah, Chicago's fine. Let me say
one thing, so someone's saying it.

241
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,737
There might be an explanation.

242
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,448
He got in a car with a woman
I've never met...

243
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:08,744
Just talk to him. Tell Charlie
what you saw. You owe him that.

244
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:12,039
Maybe... After he calls me
a few more times!

245
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:14,458
Call me if you need me, OK?
Love you.

246
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,168
Love you.

247
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,045
How's the view?

248
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,762
You wanna give this a test run?

249
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,686
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

250
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,730
- Jacqnoud just walked in.
- Who's he with?

251
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:40,651
Looks like he's solo.

252
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,570
You ready?

253
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:46,782
- I'm going shopping!
- Bring us back somethin', would you?

254
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,492
That's the plan.

255
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:27,364
- Are you picking this up?
- Yeah.

256
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,035
The mike's hot!

257
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,338
Do you have anything
bigger than this? Back there?

258
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't understand.
Don't understand you. Sorry!

259
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,395
The meet just got here.

260
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:08,280
Got him.
Mokhtar, do you know this guy?

261
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,951
I'm gonna try and get an ID
right now.

262
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,265
Nice to finally meet you.

263
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,851
Everything worked smoothly
getting here?

264
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:39,061
Yes, thank you.

265
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:40,729
Oh, merci beaucoup.

266
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,690
Merci.

267
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,319
How are we doing?

268
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:50,114
- You mean phase three?
- What were the results?

269
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,824
You'll be very happy.

270
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:55,953
Good. If Patel's to be our delivery
man, I'll need a piece tomorrow.

271
00:23:56,036 --> 00:24:01,500
As long as the financial arrangements
are made that shouldn't be a problem.

272
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:03,919
Bon. Salut!

273
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:12,636
- Damn. The bodyguard, I know him.
- What?

274
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,348
From Corsica two years ago.
The sonofabitch broke my arm.

275
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,654
Mokhtar, pack up.
We gotta get out of here.

276
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:48,714
- What's happening?
- Syd, get out of there!

277
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:59,642
- You. I know you.
- I'm sorry. Are you talkin' to me?

278
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,603
I think you remember me too.

279
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:13,572
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.

280
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:15,241
Tell me why you are here.

281
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:21,580
Or this time...
I do more than just break your arm!

282
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:50,693
He wanted to charge me $50!
That's too much.

283
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,462
Dixon!

284
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:12,423
Dixon! Do you copy?

285
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,603
Dixon?

286
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,127
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

287
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:16,779
We have to go.

288
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:46,100
- Hey.
- Hi.

289
00:27:46,183 --> 00:27:47,518
How was your trip?

290
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:51,647
- It was awful.
- Syd, I'm sorry.

291
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,232
What goes with Charlie?

292
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:56,444
I'm meeting him for coffee.
He knows something's up.

293
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:58,737
If he has no excuse,

294
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:02,283
if he... can't explain why
he was kissin' a whore

295
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:05,286
instead of goin' to law review,
I'm gonna kill him.

296
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:08,289
- Don't say that.
- She's on a rampage.

297
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:11,709
She wasn't gonna go out with him.
I forced her to call him. Hi.

298
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,294
Hi.

299
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:19,258
Let me ask you something.
Do you think it's gonna go alright?

300
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:23,929
I do.

301
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,689
Love you.

302
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:39,320
- See you, Will. Thanks
- Good luck.

303
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:46,452
- You look exhausted.
- Pretty good assessment.

304
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:51,248
So,
I was thinkin' about what happened.

305
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:55,961
You know...
That... you know, that kiss.

306
00:28:56,045 --> 00:29:00,257
Yeah. And I think
I figured out why I was so weird.

307
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:01,759
Why?

308
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:06,013
Well, because...
How often do you... you know,

309
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:08,641
do you kiss someone
that you're that close to?

310
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:09,767
I mean, never.

311
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:18,067
Anyway, I... I know that it's
awkward between us now, but...

312
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:25,074
...I think that I've figured out a way
for it not to be so awkward any more.

313
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:26,951
What?

314
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:41,924
OK, that didn't work, did it?

315
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:44,969
I have to go have dinner
with my father.

316
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,847
Ooh, well, I feel like an idiot.

317
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,640
No, don't. Don't.

318
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,517
Oh, my God, I feel...

319
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,978
Oh, my God.

320
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:04,947
Would you like to order, ma'am?

321
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,117
I'll wait, thanks.
I'm meeting someone.

322
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:21,505
Thank you.

323
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,633
Thank you.

324
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:32,349
So, you gonna tell me what's up?

325
00:30:34,477 --> 00:30:36,353
Do I have to start guessing?

326
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,023
- I saw you.
- Saw me what?

327
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,485
I saw you outside our house
with a woman.

328
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,236
What you doing? Watching me?

329
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,989
I don't have to answer.
What were you doing?

330
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,324
She's a friend.

331
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:52,453
A friend you went out with
instead of going to law review?

332
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:56,957
- Her name's Rachel, right?
- No.

333
00:31:00,711 --> 00:31:03,089
- I trust you.
- I give you reason to!

334
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:10,012
I am not gonna let you lie to me,
Charlie. Now, explain yourself.

335
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:17,603
Francie, I love you
and I'm not playing around.

336
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:20,606
We were just hanging out.
That's all.

337
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:23,651
Right. Hang out,
hang out with Rachel.

338
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,650
- Hello.
- Sydney. Sorry to call so late.

339
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:05,901
It's alright.

340
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:11,615
I won't be able to make dinner.
Work is... I can't get away.

341
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,827
- You understand?
- Of course.

342
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,037
Don't worry about it.

343
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:20,708
I'll just see you at...

344
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,711
I'll just see you.

345
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:27,047
OK. Bye.

346
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,251
I'm sorry to call you.
I just didn't know who else to call.

347
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:07,630
My father and I were
supposed to have dinner tonight.

348
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:11,592
For the first time since I was a kid.
I can't remember the last time.

349
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,766
He just didn't show.

350
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:23,562
He said he had work.
And he didn't have work.

351
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:28,150
This isn't just about my dad.

352
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:31,403
In Morocco, that man who died,
he was a friend.

353
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:36,408
He was a good man, who thought
he was fighting for the right side,

354
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,577
that he was working for the CIA.

355
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:42,331
He was lied to. And now he's dead.

356
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,627
I had his blood on my hands.

357
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:50,798
- Sydney.
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.

358
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,427
Like I don't even know who I am
any more, or what I'm doing,

359
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,555
or why I'm doing it.

360
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,778
You just threw your beeper
in the Pacific.

361
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,532
I know.

362
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:21,328
OK, listen to me.
There's something you need to know.

363
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:28,419
When you first walked into my office,
with that stupid, bozo hair...

364
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,966
...I thought you were crazy. I thought
you might be a crazy person.

365
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:39,054
But I watched you
and I read your statement.

366
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:45,519
And I've seen... I've seen how
you think. I've seen how you work.

367
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,439
I've seen who you are.

368
00:34:50,107 --> 00:34:53,068
In this job, you see darkness.
The worst in people.

369
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:59,283
And though the jobs are different
and the missions change

370
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:02,828
and the enemies
have a thousand names,

371
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,916
the one crucial thing,
one real responsibility you have,

372
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:12,213
is to not let your rage, resentment
and your disgust darken you.

373
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,929
When you're at your absolute lowest,
your most depressed,

374
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:23,099
just remember that you can always...

375
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,770
You know? You've got my number.

376
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:53,003
I put the recording you made
through voice print.

377
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:56,715
The man that Jacqnoud
is meeting with is Malik Sawari.

378
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,593
He specialises
in industrial demolition.

379
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:03,514
This is his latest innovation.
It's called the BLU 250.

380
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:07,518
Commissioned by a Swiss corporation
to blow out mountains

381
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:11,021
for high-speed trains.
There's a third piece.

382
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:13,691
- You will be very happy.
- Good.

383
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:17,611
If Patel is to be our delivery man,
I'll need the piece by tomorrow.

384
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:21,031
The man they're referring to
is Dhiren Patel.

385
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,659
The winner of the Edgar Peace Prize?

386
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,203
Patel is India's delegate to the UN.

387
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:29,290
A former President
of the Human Rights Commission.

388
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:31,375
He would not work with Jacqnoud.

389
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,378
- So what's the connection?
- Irony.

390
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:38,299
Jacqnoud is using Patel
to send a message to the UCO.

391
00:36:38,382 --> 00:36:41,010
- Which is what?
- Abolish the organisation.

392
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:44,597
We've traced half a dozen threats
to Jacqnoud.

393
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,185
This has it that this last act
will be his most violent yet.

394
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:51,937
You think he'll plant
an explosive on Patel?

395
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:57,693
I do. And I want you two to stop it.
You leave for Sao Paulo tonight.

396
00:36:57,777 --> 00:37:01,781
The job is to find Patel, recover
the weapon and safeguard the UCO.

397
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,783
Any questions?

398
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:29,558
- Any luck?
- I don't see Patel anywhere.

399
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:36,107
That's unusual. Buying
an international flight with cash.

400
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,903
He was travelling alone, right?
Excuse me?

401
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,865
Daniel Hecht
was not travelling alone?

402
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:54,458
- I have a 20 on Patel.
- Let's get him out of here.

403
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:03,300
- Something's wrong. He looks sick.
- Sick?

404
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:06,679
- He just went down.
- Does he have a drink?

405
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,223
- Yes.
- Get the glass.

406
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:15,938
Is he OK?
Did somebody call a doctor?

407
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,858
Excuse me. I'm a doctor.

408
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:21,152
- Can I help?
- Yeah.

409
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:36,792
Guess who's here. Sawari.

410
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:43,674
I tell you, if they bomb this place,
it'll be tomorrow at the opening.

411
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:47,845
Well, they fed Patel some kind
of powdered sedative compound.

412
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:51,807
It looks like a designer benzo.

413
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,187
Keep an eye on Sawari.

414
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:02,651
I'm following Patel.

415
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:07,239
Confirm something. The person
travelling with Daniel Hecht,

416
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:11,160
the name was Sydney Bristow?
Right? No? Are you sure?

417
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:14,622
OK, then, tell me who.
Just give me the name.

418
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:17,458
C'mon.
What about you owe me one?

419
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:21,629
Alright.
You remember my assistant, Jenny?

420
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,924
- No. The other one.
- What are you doing?

421
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes. Give me the name,
and she'll go out with you.

422
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:30,596
- No, she won't.
- She'll go out with you.

423
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,974
- Hold on a sec. Just say you are.
- I'm not...

424
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,852
- Please.
- Fine.

425
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:41,023
Hi! Yeah. OK.

426
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:43,692
I'd love to go out with you.

427
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,197
OK? Right, give me the name.

428
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:52,952
The person who was travelling
with Daniel Hecht. Yeah, I know.

429
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,289
Kate Jones?

430
00:39:58,749 --> 00:39:59,834
Kate Jones.

431
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:49,133
- There was any problem?
- Ready to go.

432
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:08,527
Sponge.

433
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:16,869
Scalpel.

434
00:42:57,553 --> 00:42:59,221
Careful with that.

435
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:03,684
- That's equivalent to 300lbs of TNT.
- Yes, don't kill us.
