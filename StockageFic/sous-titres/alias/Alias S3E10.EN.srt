1
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,130
Dr. Brazzel?

2
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,139
Yes.

3
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,943
Considering everything,
I suppose I was lucky.

4
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,937
I woke up in the bathtub.

5
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,524
The place was on fire.

6
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,026
I crawled out.

7
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,951
A few days later,
I woke up in the hospital.

8
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:50,037
The fact that I actually
wasn't dating Francie,

9
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,411
I thought
that was the number-one

10
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,373
most insane story of all time.

11
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,876
But yours actually tops it.

12
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:02,547
She survived.

13
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,380
Allison Doren.

14
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,761
The woman you thought
was Francie.

15
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,265
She's working with a group
called The Covenant.

16
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,638
We think they're the ones
responsible for kidnapping me.

17
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,222
For setting the fires.

18
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:26,490
You know, I've always thought
of myself as a pacifist.

19
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:31,993
The idea of taking someone's
life is just inconceivable.

20
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:36,285
If I had the chance
to kill Allison...

21
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:41,120
I never would have come here
if I didn't have to.

22
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,338
Are you kidding me?

23
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:47,293
Oh, my God, you're the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

24
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,182
I went to see a doctor.

25
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,845
He had this
sort of dream therapy

26
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,308
he thought might help me
remember what happened.

27
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:58,603
I was hoping you could
help make sense of it.

28
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,185
You were sitting
in my apartment.

29
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,683
There was a box
of cereal on the counter.

30
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,486
The box had a name
written on it.

31
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,149
Something I kept seeing
in the dream.

32
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,236
St. Aidan.

33
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,697
St. Aidan was a contact of mine

34
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:11,327
when I was an analyst
at the Agency.

35
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,820
Yeah, St. Aidan
was his code name.

36
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,112
What was his real name?

37
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,405
I never knew it.

38
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,374
An arms dealer
put me in touch with him.

39
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:19,871
Do you remember
how to contact him?

40
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,456
Yeah.
He would only meet with me.

41
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,958
You know, I can go in again.

42
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,543
- No, you're not.
- Well, maybe I am.

43
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,837
Assuming you can even get him.
He would only meet in person.

44
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:30,502
I've spent the last two years
of my life

45
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,804
pretending to be
somebody that I'm not.

46
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,267
It's not your fault.

47
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,261
You weren't sleeping with her.

48
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,475
When you made contact
with St. Aidan,

49
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,772
what was the protocol?

50
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,313
I'd dial a number.

51
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,405
An answering machine
in Bucharest.

52
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,616
When it picked up,
I'd dial a confirmation code.

53
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:58,325
I'd hang up and wait
for him to call me back.

54
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:00,950
Yes?

55
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,536
If you can, we need to meet.

56
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:05,374
Tuesday night, 11.00.

57
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,505
Same location.

58
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,472
Listen to me
very carefully, Doctor.

59
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,812
I need to know
what Sydney Bristow told you.

60
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,442
The brunette.

61
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,780
Wasn't she the brunette?

62
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:32,900
Yes.

63
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:34,238
She was the brunette.

64
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:36,950
You helped her recover
her memories.

65
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,206
Tell me what she found.

66
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,495
The morphine was very good.

67
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:45,457
Like the old days, when I --

68
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,584
Oh, but don't turn it off.

69
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,004
No.

70
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,209
Answer the question.

71
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,335
Well...

72
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,553
Answer, and then
you'll get more.

73
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,432
She said she fought herself.

74
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,190
And that she saw her friend.

75
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,066
She saw Will in her dream?

76
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,067
Yes.

77
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,527
The father.

78
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:16,242
He said he would call a witness.

79
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:22,581
No, he'd call
the Witness Protection division.

80
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,708
Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,871
Meaning Tippin's still alive?

82
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:31,875
Meaning I really need
some more morphine.

83
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,511
I've earned it, don't you think?

84
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:34,710
And I --

85
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,296
Yeah, but...

86
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,848
Not so much, because I could...

87
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,680
I could --

88
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,607
I could over--

89
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,185
O.D.

90
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,955
As you know, a number
of the cameras were shot out.

91
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,580
Those that remained functional
provided us

92
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,161
with only marginal images
of the men who took Sydney.

93
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,880
We ran the video
through our database

94
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,543
and came up with eight matches.

95
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,543
Two weeks ago,
one of those suspects

96
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,471
rented an A-Star helicopter
from a dealer in Austin.

97
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,177
Where he'd also recently
purchased a warehouse.

98
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,303
We went there, but the building
was only being used for storage.

99
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,683
Boxes of fishing equipment.
It was a dead end.

100
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:26,681
Fishing equipment?

101
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,067
Nice detail.

102
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,150
The bullets that The Covenant
used are untraceable.

103
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,818
The manufacturer hasn't actually
made these shells for 15 years.

104
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,707
Oh, I re-read your file.

105
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,490
I forgot.

106
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,120
You were captured by East German
Intelligence Agents.

107
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,499
1982?

108
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,545
Yeah, it wasn't your fault,
of course.

109
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,549
They'd gotten a tip that
the CIA was on their tail.

110
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,294
But you were unprepared.

111
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,335
No backup.

112
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,971
No resources.

113
00:14:58,055 --> 00:15:02,005
Still, you convinced them
your name was Aken Ostburg,

114
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,426
a history professor from Sweden.

115
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:05,803
They held you for two weeks.

116
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,222
Never identified you
as American.

117
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,855
That's impressive.

118
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:17,111
We are talking
about the fate of my daughter.

119
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:23,869
Where do you think she is?

120
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,614
Don't do this.

121
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:30,577
Where do you think she is?

122
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,088
Jack, Jack, let him go.

123
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,288
Get him out of here!

124
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:37,135
Take him into custody now!

125
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,553
If St. Aidan does show,
what am I supposed to tell him?

126
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,722
You've just been given
Code Six clearance.

127
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,567
That you want information
about The Covenant.

128
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,565
Last chance to bail out.

129
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,148
What, are you kidding me?

130
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,314
I love this stuff.

131
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,286
Based on my analysis
of the calls

132
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:13,129
The Covenant made about
trading the Rambaldi device

133
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,791
for Sydney, sir.

134
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,338
The voiceprint analysis
was unable to I.D. the voice,

135
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,802
because they were using

136
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:21,459
an anti-speech signal
parameterization device.

137
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:23,762
You're telling me
you've got nothing?

138
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,550
Well, at the moment, yeah,
I lack everything, sir.

139
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,266
We've got no way to verify
that it was The Covenant

140
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,684
making the demand for the trade?

141
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,565
You could say the fact
we can't confirm it was them

142
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,931
is confirmation it was them,

143
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,230
because it does look like
stealthy Covenant behaviour.

144
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,781
Sir?
Mr. Lindsey, one more thing.

145
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,278
Sorry.

146
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:48,656
Listen, I know I'm just the tech
guy, and I'm no one to you.

147
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:52,829
Well, Sydney Bristow
means a lot to me.

148
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,040
I just wanted your opinion.
Is she gonna be alright?

149
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,882
I am doing everything
in my power

150
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:02,004
to bring this to a safe
and swift conclusion.

151
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,341
You have my word.

152
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,257
Thank you.

153
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,563
Is he always this late?

154
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:17,730
We just might have
gotten blown off.

155
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,029
Mr. Tippin?

156
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,827
What happened to your hand?

157
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,506
Another time, perhaps.

158
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,298
Oh, my God, it's Lazarey.

159
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,672
It's good to see you again.

160
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,303
I wasn't sure you'd come.

161
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,131
I would not have come at all,

162
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:49,267
except money's something
I could use.

163
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,973
Well, I'll see what we can do
about that.

164
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,106
You should know I've been given
Code Six clearance.

165
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,485
And I need to know
about The Covenant.

166
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,895
Why are you asking me
about The Covenant?

167
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:02,771
I thought you --

168
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:05,321
How do you think I even know
anything about them?

169
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:06,903
Obviously you know something.

170
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:09,948
I cannot talk about Covenant.

171
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:12,870
Wait a minute. Excuse me.
Lives are at stake.

172
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,449
Yes, they are.

173
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,835
We have nothing further
to discuss.

174
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,546
Tell him Julia Thorne sent you.

175
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,790
Julia Thorne sent me.

176
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,714
No.

177
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,511
I don't believe you.

178
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,761
- Yell out the name Lazarey.
- Lazarey.

179
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:37,014
Tell him Julia told you
his name.

180
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,222
She needs to see him.

181
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,440
She trusts him,
but she's in danger.

182
00:18:40,528 --> 00:18:42,271
It was Julia Thorne.

183
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:44,355
She told me your name.

184
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,859
She needs to see you.

185
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,322
She trusts you,
but she's in danger.

186
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,623
Did they find it?

187
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:56,582
I don't know
what he's talking about.

188
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,994
Have they been to Graz?

189
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:00,997
I need to know.

190
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,555
Will, get out of there.
They're after Lazarey.

191
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:03,563
I can't make sense of it.

192
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,439
How we got to Lazarey.

193
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,321
What he meant.

194
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,565
What The Covenant wants.

195
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:12,697
But they don't kill Lazarey.
They tranq him.

196
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,945
They abduct him.
They wanted him.

197
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,040
Lazarey asked if they got it.

198
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,291
So whatever's going on,
there's a thing.

199
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,786
And there's someone else
who's trying to find it.

200
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,206
Things really don't get
more vague than that.

201
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,423
It's Sloane.
I mean, it's obviously Sloane.

202
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:33,137
Syd, you've been going over this
since the beginning of time.

203
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,504
You'll figure it out.

204
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,227
What makes you say that?

205
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,187
Because you're you.

206
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:57,154
Think that was the best move,
punching Lindsey?

207
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:58,872
Based on the comments
he was making,

208
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,081
it was obvious you and I
were going to end up here

209
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,410
no matter what we did,
whether I hit him or not.

210
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:05,793
I wasn't about to pass up
the opportunity.

211
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,207
We shouldn't have let Sydney go.

212
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,378
- Vaughn.
- What?

213
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,340
Sydney can no longer be
your primary concern.

214
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:14,711
What the hell's that mean?

215
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,096
I didn't bring this up
to start a petty fight.

216
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,138
The fact is, you and I
have something in common.

217
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:23,930
We've both suffered through
the death of the woman we loved,

218
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:27,061
only to discover
she was still alive.

219
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:31,482
I know it's hard,
but this isn't about you.

220
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:35,488
And I will not allow my daughter
to become your mistress.

221
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:39,486
If that's where you think my
concern for Sydney is headed,

222
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,325
you are more cynical
than I thought.

223
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,667
If lightning strikes and you
and I get to walk free again,

224
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:48,419
if you care about my daughter
as you claim to,

225
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,132
then push her away.

226
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,708
Be cruel if you have to.

227
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:54,463
Make her despise you.

228
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:58,505
Because your kindness
tortures her.

229
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,596
I can see it,
what it does to her.

230
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,099
And I won't have it.

231
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,654
You and Vaughn's wife
work together?

232
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,741
- Okay, how the hell did that --
- Let's talk about you.

233
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:17,368
A beautiful painter
lives in your building,

234
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:18,947
and you haven't asked her out.
Why?

235
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,285
Because Jonah's recovering from
a post-traumatic dating syndrome

236
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,167
after his last girlfriend
dumped him

237
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:28,040
by ramming a bayonet
into his lungs.

238
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,624
Let's go back to you.

239
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,087
Okay, you and Vaughn's wife.

240
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,255
Yeah.

241
00:22:33,344 --> 00:22:34,886
I hate her.

242
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,634
I mean, I don't.

243
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,929
She's nice.

244
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,799
- You hate her.
- Yeah.

245
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,308
That's okay.

246
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,520
But not 'cause of her.

247
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,934
It's just...

248
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,646
I still love him.

249
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,490
God.

250
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:59,574
That sucks.

251
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:03,328
You know, Will,

252
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,666
considering everything,
I think I'm pretty normal.

253
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,039
I'm emotional.

254
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:18,092
I try to be honest, but I've
never been a depressed person.

255
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,765
Until now.

256
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,228
I get it.

257
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,305
I mean, nothing has felt
the same this year,

258
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:29,141
and it's not just Vaughn.

259
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,605
It's you.

260
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,852
And Francie.

261
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:39,525
I don't know.

262
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,947
What?

263
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:45,036
I'm just alone.

264
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,330
Hey, it's okay.

265
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,044
It's okay.

266
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:16,984
Your target.

267
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,112
A government employee.

268
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,453
When and where?

269
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,329
When I know, you'll know.

270
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,206
Just when I was
beginning to believe

271
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,752
the glowing press about you
being such a humanitarian.

272
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,168
You're a smarter man than that.

273
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:02,065
Who are you?

274
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:06,866
You abandoned me as a child.

275
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:11,036
The vague memory I have of you,
you were physically abusive.

276
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,869
Later in life,
you left me $800 million.

277
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:16,252
Should I go on?

278
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,924
Hello, Daddy.

279
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,009
You were not grateful?

280
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,811
Your inheritance was not enough?

281
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,849
I know the truth,
and therefore I show no remorse

282
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,146
seeing you like this.

283
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:40,238
I was an apparatchik
by profession,

284
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:43,323
but a Romanov by blood.

285
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:46,490
So are you.

286
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:50,659
In part, that's why
I staged my death.

287
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,368
To give you the inheritance
that is rightfully yours.

288
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:57,297
That's wonderful spin.

289
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:02,927
You should know the inheritance
you hoped would buy my affection

290
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:05,847
now finances my employer.

291
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,507
The Covenant.

292
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,887
The Covenant.

293
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:15,597
They are true evil.

294
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:18,265
The man you were meeting with.

295
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,732
I want to know exactly
what you said to him.

296
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:23,151
Every word.

297
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,448
Pathetic.

298
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,372
I'll give you a moment.

299
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:45,009
To remember exactly
what you said.

300
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:54,683
I'll ask you one more time.

301
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:59,018
What exactly did you tell
the man you were meeting with?

302
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,692
You wouldn't do something
like this.

303
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:07,070
Not to your own father.

304
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,288
Oh, my God.

305
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:23,458
I know, it's weird.

306
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,876
I've been waiting to do that
for eight years.

307
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,168
No, no.

308
00:27:27,263 --> 00:27:29,469
What you said before.

309
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:31,760
About me being me.

310
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:32,800
I don't remember.

311
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:34,803
Lazarey asked if they have it.

312
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:36,603
"Have they been to Graz?"

313
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:40,354
Whatever it was that was hidden,
whatever he was talking about,

314
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:41,474
I obviously had it.

315
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:42,814
I must have had it in Graz.

316
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:45,608
Whatever I did, if it was me,

317
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,948
the choices I made
were my choices.

318
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,154
Oh, so if you had something to
hide, where would you hide it?

319
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:53,361
Exactly.

320
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,413
That depends on what it is.

321
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,619
Assume for a second
that it's information,

322
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,585
data, a video, something
that can be stored.

323
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:03,162
Well, if it's small,
it could be hidden anywhere.

324
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:05,048
Somewhere safe.

325
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,088
Well, when Lazarey spoke,

326
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,004
it didn't sound like
it was someplace protected.

327
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:09,760
I know.

328
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:13,181
That's why I'm thinking bank
or hotel safety-deposit box.

329
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:14,049
Well, how come?

330
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,930
Because that's where I'd put it.

331
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,141
Where would I hide something?

332
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,978
Wait a second.

333
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,573
What?

334
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:31,698
Hotel Verlustzeit.

335
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:42,206
We're going to Graz.

336
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,668
Hotel Verlustzeit.

337
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,241
Hello.
Checking in?

338
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:14,034
Yeah, of course.

339
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,907
I'm here, she's here.
We made it.

340
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,202
And you are?

341
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,962
We're the next big thing.

342
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,416
This way, please.

343
00:29:26,507 --> 00:29:28,630
This is one of
our finest suites.

344
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,672
Yeah, yeah,
it's not bad, not bad.

345
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:34,087
The bar is over there.

346
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:36,637
The gym is on the sixth floor.

347
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:39,347
Open 24 hours.

348
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,228
Of course you have a balcony.

349
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:45,229
Fantastic view.

350
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,893
That should be it.

351
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,528
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

352
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:52,564
Yeah.

353
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,283
Thank you for asking.

354
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,242
Yeah, you're a lovely
little man.

355
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,527
Thank you.

356
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,365
Sweetheart, two bottles?

357
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:00,405
Of what?

358
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,531
Champagne.

359
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,413
Four? Two?
Two bottles?

360
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,203
One's good.

361
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:07,170
One.
Alright.

362
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,000
We're gonna get
four bottles of champagne.

363
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:12,251
I'm gonna tip you
like I ordered five.

364
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,424
Do you know what I mean?

365
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,304
You do, don't you,
you cheeky bastard?

366
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,465
- Yes.
- Cheers.

367
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,352
What? What?

368
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:27,396
Come on, if we're gonna do this,
we got to be legit about it.

369
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:30,860
It was a little over the top.

370
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:31,895
Over the top?

371
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,270
I'm wearing seat covering.

372
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,073
There is no over the top.

373
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,317
Plus, I like champagne.

374
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:40,412
You keep forgetting,
I live in Wisconsin now.

375
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,788
I'm not squandering this.

376
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,165
Call up the on-screen checkout.

377
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,412
You have to admit,
my accent was pretty good.

378
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:50,794
It was like early Stones.

379
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,294
I thought it was Australian.

380
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:53,416
Shut up.

381
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,921
I was like, "Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,341
She's here.
We made it."

383
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,174
I mean, that's good.

384
00:30:58,265 --> 00:30:59,428
Take a look at it.

385
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:00,892
Right, that's enough.
Carry on.

386
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,265
Let's get past these firewalls.

387
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,938
Let's see if I was ever here.

388
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,150
We're in the system.

389
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,518
What are we looking for?

390
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:15,357
Long-term storage contracts.

391
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:19,827
The names of people who have
things in safety-deposit boxes.

392
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,166
Unbelievable.

393
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:30,916
Box 23.

394
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,130
Let's see if they have
a floor plan online.

395
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:36,341
What if they don't?

396
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:38,758
Think positively.

397
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:39,678
Here we go.

398
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,766
Subbasement, just past
the northeast corridor.

399
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:44,394
What about security?

400
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,222
I'm almost done looping
the surveillance cameras.

401
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:47,689
Let's move.

402
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,008
- I assume you're not primping.
- Not exactly.

403
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:29,098
Stand back.

404
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:47,282
What is that?

405
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:56,040
Sark's got it.

406
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,668
Go.

407
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,042
You can't.
You're not trained.

408
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:02,301
Go.

409
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:19,775
I guess we have
unfinished business.

410
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,566
This is for Francie.

411
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:24,296
We got to get out of here.

412
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:26,048
Let's go.

413
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:38,395
Set the time
and place with Lindsey.

414
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:40,028
I'm ready to be traded back.

415
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,980
Sydney, Lindsey's taken your
father and Vaughn into custody.

416
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:46,316
Dixon's in custody as well.

417
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,818
But we need to proceed
with this trade as planned

418
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:52,364
so that Lindsey believes you
were being held by The Covenant.

419
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,459
The Rambaldi device
is being delivered in San Pedro.

420
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,873
I've hired a team to pick it up.

421
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,500
They'll appear to be working
for The Covenant.

422
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,630
As soon as they've left
the area,

423
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:03,674
you're to drive yourself
to meet Lindsey.

424
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,884
You are never ending up
with the Rambaldi device.

425
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,929
I want it put inside the van
and taken directly

426
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:10,304
to the parking lot
at Hill Street and 9th.

427
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:12,469
I want the van to remain
visible at all times.

428
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,186
No one is to enter
or exit the vehicle.

429
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,560
Sydney, you have my word.

430
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,606
That's a relief.

431
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,442
Listen very carefully.

432
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:25,274
I need a favour.

433
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:26,315
Where are you?

434
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:28,448
Just listen and tell no one
about this call.

435
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:30,908
The Rambaldi device
being traded to The Covenant

436
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,870
is actually going to Sloane.

437
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,578
He needs to be watched from
the moment he gets the device.

438
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:38,585
Grab the feed from a satellite
that has a view of the trade.

439
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:39,785
Track their van.

440
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,371
Any suspicious stops,
anyone gets on or off,

441
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:43,842
have a team bring them in.

442
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:45,089
Alright, I got it.

443
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,799
Whatever the hell
you're up to, good luck.

444
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:01,147
Status?

445
00:36:01,235 --> 00:36:02,480
The Covenant's representatives

446
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,939
have taken possession
of the Rambaldi device.

447
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,575
Syd, I'm tracking the van.
The package is inside.

448
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:13,410
Copy that.

449
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,454
Follow the van
to the rendezvous point.

450
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,201
Anything unusual,
you let me know.

451
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:18,242
Roger that.

452
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:20,494
I'm heading toward Lindsey.
Wish me luck.

453
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:22,830
Sir, we have a 20
on Agent Bristow.

454
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:24,916
She's approaching the dock.

455
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,082
Bristow's arrived.

456
00:37:02,463 --> 00:37:05,998
On behalf of the government,
I want to say how relieved I am

457
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:08,380
at your safe return.

458
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,141
Seal off the perimeter now!

459
00:37:20,231 --> 00:37:22,188
- Shots from the west!
- Man down!

460
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,232
Stay down!
Stay down!

461
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:39,541
You murdered Robert Lindsey.

462
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,116
I think you already know
my response.

463
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,784
Let me guess. You don't know
what I'm talking about.

464
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,838
Not a word.

465
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,651
I did everything as you asked.

466
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:10,737
I followed your protocol
precisely.

467
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:16,657
This was your endgame
the whole time.

468
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:19,319
Now, you can go on
blaming me if you like.

469
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:20,957
Or you can accept the truth.

470
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:21,824
Which is what?

471
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,918
The deceiver was Lindsey,
not me.

472
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:26,415
His team might have thought so,

473
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,340
but apparently Lindsey never
gave us the Rambaldi device.

474
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,418
It was a setup.

475
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,550
I don't know how you did this.

476
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,728
But you're not gonna
get away with it.

477
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:46,815
I don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:18,346
It seems like everything
is falling back into place.

479
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,259
Thank you, by the way.

480
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,510
For everything.

481
00:39:23,604 --> 00:39:25,015
Yeah.

482
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,020
I got to go.

483
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:29,852
I'm meeting Lauren.

484
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:38,949
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what this means.

485
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:39,985
What is that?

486
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,155
What was inside the box.

487
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,240
It's human tissue.

488
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,080
Vital.

489
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,827
Still active.

490
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:52,542
Oh, and there was a name
etched inside the box.

491
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:56,302
Milo Rambaldi.

492
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:16,271
I've been looking for you.

493
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:17,990
You feeling alright?

494
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:19,653
Yeah.

495
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,328
Seeing Allison again.

496
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,080
Killing her.

497
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:30,042
You know,
I must have dreamed about it

498
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,335
I don't know how many times.

499
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:35,590
When you told me
that she was still alive,

500
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:38,084
I thought if I had the chance,

501
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:41,382
that ending her life
would be satisfying.

502
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,754
You know, there'd be closure.

503
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,759
It would be cathartic.

504
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:49,012
It's just as empty
as the dreams.

505
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:51,732
It's horrible.

506
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:55,685
There's no satisfaction.

507
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,238
There's nothing.

508
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,443
I know they talked to you.

509
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,406
Now that The Covenant knows
you're still alive,

510
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:05,907
you might want to move again.

511
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,703
Maybe somewhere
outside of the country.

512
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:10,335
No, I'm not gonna run anymore.

513
00:41:10,419 --> 00:41:12,661
I'm gonna stay in Wisconsin.

514
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,178
I don't know, maybe when I get
back, I'll ask out that painter.

515
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:24,054
We're gonna see
each other again.

516
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,773
Love you.

517
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,698
You too.

518
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,451
Yeah?

519
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,452
We never talked about that.

520
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,713
Yeah.

521
00:41:58,092 --> 00:42:00,417
I kind of like that.
