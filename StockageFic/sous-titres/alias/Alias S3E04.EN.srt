1
00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:02,802
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:05,515
If I'm to understand
what you're saying,

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:10,647
you have no idea where you've
been for the last two years.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,853
Now that Lazarey's murder
has been linked to The Covenant,

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,355
the NSC has convened
their own investigation.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,399
You think they know?

7
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,735
That you were the murderer?
Not yet.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,162
But they've just received some
footage apparently of the crime.

9
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:25,411
- How?
- Another camera.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,035
I'll do what I can to ensure
this remains our secret.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,038
Freeze there.
Blow up that frame, please.

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,459
Sure.

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,876
Not enough to make
a positive I.D., is it?

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,425
Give me 72 hours.

15
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,135
I think I can identify
this woman.

16
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,978
You kept your promise.

17
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,817
You said you would kill me.

18
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:55,278
You were my favourite.

19
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:58,779
You never broke.

20
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,154
Who the hell are you?

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,949
Why did The Covenant take
two years of my life?

22
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:15,041
There.
You see that?

23
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,461
No.

24
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:19,166
What do you mean, "No"?

25
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,590
Look there.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,471
He's saying "Jewel" or "Julie."

27
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:24,514
He could be saying
any number of things.

28
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,178
I have already
subjected this video

29
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:29,223
to the most intense scrutiny
available to the CIA.

30
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:30,096
Maybe "Julia."

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,811
If you want me to do
a re-analysis, I'll do it.

32
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,727
You have to stop
punishing yourself.

33
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,227
There's got to be
something in there.

34
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:37,903
Dad!

35
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,863
Sydney, no good
will come from doing this.

36
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,859
I committed a murder
I have no memory of.

37
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,621
- This isn't about punishment.
- I understand this haunts you.

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,198
Yes, it haunts me.

39
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,198
I lost two years.

40
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,165
I do not have
one memory of that time.

41
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,627
All I have is this.

42
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,704
That I killed a man.

43
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:57,379
I killed a defenceless man
in cold blood.

44
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,958
What was I thinking?
Did I know it was Sark's father?

45
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,544
What would compel me
to do something like this?

46
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,964
Did someone condition me?

47
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,882
If they did,
what else did they have me do?

48
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,596
I've been living with these
same questions for over a year.

49
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,145
We have no answers yet.

50
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,559
When you compelled the NSC
to release me from prison,

51
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:20,650
you told me that you'd done so
because you needed your father.

52
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,112
That you needed my strength.

53
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:26,784
12 months in solitary
would have an effect on anyone.

54
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:33,490
Something that allowed me to
stay focused was your strength.

55
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,042
Don't lose it now.

56
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,505
Hello?

57
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,972
Yeah.

58
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,883
I'll be right there.

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,933
That was Lauren.

60
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,266
20 hours ago in Cannes,

61
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,559
a 4-man team broke into
a French epidemiology lab.

62
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:58,976
The place did cutting-edge
vaccine research

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,739
into viruses like West Nile,
HIV, and Ebola.

64
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:02,854
What were they after?

65
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,238
They took four vials
containing strains of Ebola.

66
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:08,197
The fifth was damaged, infecting
one of the team members.

67
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,283
The man we're questioning?

68
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,365
Laszlo Bogdan,
a Hungarian national.

69
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,328
He's an expert in cracking
high-end security systems.

70
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,708
He's in isolation
at the Stafford Naval Hospital.

71
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,374
The French just handed him over?

72
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,668
They share our desire to learn
more about The Covenant.

73
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,918
Why did the NSC
want me in on this?

74
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:25,470
I wanted you.

75
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,678
Michael said you were the best.

76
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,361
Mr. Bogdan, can you hear me?

77
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:54,869
My name is Lauren Reed.

78
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,877
I work for the United States
government.

79
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:02,330
I've been sent here to find out
who you were working for.

80
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,085
Who is responsible
for putting you

81
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,668
in the condition you're in now.

82
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,716
Leave.

83
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,907
Mr. Bogdan.

84
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,867
I don't know
what your beliefs are.

85
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,115
If you have a faith.

86
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:40,452
If you expect that something
follows this life.

87
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,499
You might have none.

88
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:49,342
But if there is a chance
that there is something else.

89
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:56,600
That we face the consequences
of our actions in this lifetime.

90
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,980
Mr. Bogdan.

91
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,945
This is your last chance
to do what's right.

92
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:16,112
There's no one left to be afraid
of and no one to be loyal to.

93
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,781
There's only yourself.

94
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:25,962
Whoever it was
who stole this virus

95
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,214
that's eating through your body
needs to be stopped.

96
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,346
Please.

97
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:47,481
I never met
the man who hired us.

98
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:59,332
I cannot help you stop
the second job.

99
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,173
Agent Bristow
got Bogdan to admit

100
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,837
a second heist is in the works.

101
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,386
We believe the stolen samples

102
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,298
have been delivered
to The Covenant.

103
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,670
Bogdan says
they will not be used

104
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,177
until after this second job.

105
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,177
He said they were planning
to modify the virus.

106
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:19,301
Why is that?

107
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:22,100
We can assume what they've
stolen is a precursor agent

108
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,768
requiring further synthesis.

109
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:27,061
Okay, does everyone here
speak science?

110
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,027
- Yeah.
- No, Marshall, they don't.

111
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,236
I could help explain.

112
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,032
- That'd be great.
- Sorry.

113
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:35,490
Okay, well, what they nabbed.

114
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:37,785
Let's just call that
peanut butter.

115
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:41,324
You know, yummy, nutty, creamy
deliciousness on its own.

116
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:45,000
But if you mix something else in
equally tasty.

117
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:48,042
You know, perhaps <i>chocolat.</i>

118
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,166
Sorry.

119
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,802
They're most likely going after

120
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,804
the means to mutate the virus
to make it more infectious.

121
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,597
Ebola is a level-four pathogen.

122
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,841
That's the highest
classification.

123
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,215
How could it be any worse?

124
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:03,763
Well, they could make it
airborne.

125
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:07,306
And we have no idea what
The Covenant's endgame is.

126
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:12,194
No, but we do know who the team
is they hired for these jobs.

127
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,740
Simon Walker.

128
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,861
Point man on the Damascus
armoury job in '99.

129
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,029
The 2002 break-in at Vector.

130
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,664
Cold-blooded contract guy.

131
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,373
Only uses other freelancers.

132
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,329
This time his team included
Javier Parez.

133
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,120
Former lieutenant
in the Cuban Special Forces.

134
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,216
Munitions expert and
tactical advisor to the group.

135
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:34,709
Avery Russett, Acquisitions.

136
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,512
Vehicles, equipment, weapons.

137
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,515
Finally, Laszlo Bogdan.

138
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:40,763
Security.

139
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:43,853
Deceased as of 20 minutes ago.

140
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,512
We know there's another heist
in the works.

141
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,015
Mr. Walker will need
a replacement.

142
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,938
You want me to take
Bogdan's place on their team?

143
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,941
Walker's already been
picked up on Echelon.

144
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,065
We know he's in the market.

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,323
It's deep cover.

146
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,285
The risks are obvious.

147
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:02,613
But this is an opportunity.

148
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:04,332
The Covenant
will take possession

149
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,828
of whatever the team steals.

150
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
If you can place
a tracking device on that,

151
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,208
we believe it will lead us
to their centre of operations.

152
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,959
Walker's in Sevilla.

153
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,090
You will go in
as a freelance security expert.

154
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,637
Vaughn and Weiss, you're backup.

155
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,678
Lauren, I want you
to go see Sloane.

156
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:23,142
Have him use his contacts
to find out what they're after.

157
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,386
You'll leave in two hours.

158
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,740
- I'll come by after op-tech.
- Okay.

159
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:37,856
Oh, real quick.

160
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,946
The report you wrote

161
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,241
from the infiltration
on the C.O.G. bunker.

162
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,745
You didn't give any details on
the weapons that Sark was using.

163
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,074
No, but that's not really
the point of the report.

164
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,244
- Well...
- That's the point of the report?

165
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,910
It's not the point,
but it's important.

166
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,462
How? We broke into the bunker
and destroyed the facility.

167
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,220
Honey, you know how much
I depend on the details.

168
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,762
Who cares about the weapons?

169
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,389
I've been doing this
for a long time.

170
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,718
I'm asking that you be
more specific.

171
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,302
I've never gotten notes before.

172
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:07,011
The better you do your job,
the better I'll do mine.

173
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,606
It was a CZ-100 9 millimetre.

174
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,168
We can't risk them picking up
stray radio transmissions.

175
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,215
I'll be monitoring you
with a laser mike.

176
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:38,251
I'll be able to hear you.

177
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,467
You won't be able to
communicate with me.

178
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,257
- What's this?
- That's the tracking device.

179
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,722
Marshall put a transmitter
chip there on the back.

180
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,301
Now, assuming Simon
accepts you into the group,

181
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,804
you'll use that to tag whatever
you're gonna be stealing,

182
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,354
and we'll track it
back to The Covenant.

183
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:59,109
You know, peach isn't really
in this season.

184
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,609
I heard peach was the new green.

185
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,408
I thought beige
was the new green.

186
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,617
No, beige is the new peach.

187
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,661
Okay.

188
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,787
You've got a lot
of reading to do.

189
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:25,942
I'm losing the signal.

190
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,705
- I'm aiming the mike at her.
- I should have worn the ring.

191
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,326
Get over yourself.
No one aims a mike like I do.

192
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,850
Hello.

193
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,270
Hello.

194
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,820
It's good to see you, Julia.

195
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,245
Good to see you, too.

196
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,989
- Who the hell is Julia?
- Hell if I know.

197
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:50,951
It's not an alias
she's used with us.

198
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,946
There's no mention
of a Julia in her SD-6 files.

199
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,118
Which leaves the last two years

200
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,579
when she was supposedly
being held by The Covenant.

201
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,245
You think she was operational?

202
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,578
I think this guy
just called her Julia.

203
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,293
Where in the bloody hell
have you been?

204
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,708
Isn't that
the question of the day?

205
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:08,803
Oh, come on, look,
you could do better than that.

206
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,344
A girl's got to have
some secrets.

207
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:16,807
Alright, look, at least tell me
what's with the new look.

208
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,275
Well, I barely recognised you.

209
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,564
I hope you weren't disappointed.

210
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,060
No. No.

211
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:28,854
I missed you, Julia.

212
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,115
You know, I missed
working with you.

213
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,742
Why do you think I came back?

214
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,835
You're a right nutter, you are.

215
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,877
I heard about Bogdan.

216
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,635
Yeah, that was too bad.

217
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,885
You never met Bogdan.

218
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,301
No.

219
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,680
You'd have liked him.

220
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:02,060
I want to take his place.

221
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,400
As it happens,
we do have a job coming up.

222
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,108
But Bogdan was security.

223
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,312
I know.

224
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:15,904
What, no future in murder?

225
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,205
I'm a girl with many talents.

226
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:24,996
And I'm your man.

227
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,504
Tell us what you know
about Simon Walker.

228
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,138
We know he's on a job
for The Covenant,

229
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:35,049
but we don't know
what he's after.

230
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,890
This details the first of what
we believe will be two heists.

231
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,229
We think whatever The Covenant
has hired Mr. Walker to obtain

232
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,142
will, in some way,
augment the virus

233
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,641
that they stole
earlier this week.

234
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,653
I must admit.

235
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,736
I was concerned for you
when Sydney resurfaced.

236
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,613
I remembered seeing her
with Vaughn.

237
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:01,573
Their relationship reminded me
of my own with my late wife.

238
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:06,828
It was the kind of bond
that even death cannot sever.

239
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,375
Well, apparently I misjudged.

240
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:16,088
Whatever information you can
uncover will be appreciated.

241
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,100
Ms. Reed,
you shouldn't doubt yourself.

242
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,937
You are very good
at what you do.

243
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,143
Despite how you got the job.

244
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,152
What does that mean?

245
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,615
Well, I'll see what I can do.

246
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,163
Meet the fellas.

247
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:50,962
Avery, Javier, this is Julia.

248
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,426
Hello.

249
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,001
I can see why you
wanted her here.

250
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:57,922
There's no time for small talk.

251
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,724
Fine, then.

252
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,054
Are you ready?

253
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,472
For what?

254
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,107
Well, you used to say
you were ready for anything.

255
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,539
Let's go.

256
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:32,456
Princess Demetria is in town
on holiday.

257
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,757
How nice for her.

258
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:36,920
The Spanish royal family
is throwing a party

259
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:40,880
in her honour tomorrow night,
and in typical Demetria fashion,

260
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:45,684
she plans on sporting
a 150-carat diamond necklace.

261
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,646
It's a pity,
'cause it's up in the penthouse

262
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:51,184
with her right now,
gathering dust in a safe.

263
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,820
You want me to steal it.

264
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,146
Well, consider it
your interview.

265
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,110
I'd like to see you wearing
that diamond necklace.

266
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,240
Just the necklace, right?

267
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,920
You want me to steal
the necklace with this?

268
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:13,999
We have something else for you.

269
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:20,132
Well, look, they don't
trust you yet.

270
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:21,883
And I'm not sure I do, either.

271
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:28,470
The police should be here
in about seven minutes.

272
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,926
You really think
she's that good?

273
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:58,960
Oh, yes.

274
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:01,295
Well, she used to be.

275
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,274
No.

276
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,321
We should call them off.

277
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:22,071
We do, they'll know Syd's got a
tail. There's nothing we can do.

278
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:25,633
Sorry.

279
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,297
Whatever she just did, man,
she's good.

280
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:44,087
She is really good.

281
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,553
I had time for a swim.

282
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,894
Right. I have a meeting
in Paris tomorrow night.

283
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:03,733
We'll meet at the safe house on
Thursday, spec out the mission.

284
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:07,899
Here's a tech you'll need.

285
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,360
Well, welcome to the team.

286
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:20,369
I'll need to learn
how to crack an S-305 safe.

287
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:23,548
Weiss is on with Marshall.
They're prepping specs for you.

288
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:34,433
I know you think this op is too
dangerous for me to continue.

289
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,642
Yes, I do.

290
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,307
But that's not
what I was gonna say.

291
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,103
So, what?

292
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,390
I've never worked with anyone

293
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,522
who can improvise
better than you can.

294
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:48,899
But when Simon called you Julia,
you didn't seem surprised.

295
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:49,691
Vaughn.

296
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:52,192
No, tell me what's going on.

297
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,956
Look, I know
we're not where we were,

298
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,830
but before then, professionally,
we never kept secrets.

299
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,830
I'm still on your side.

300
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:05,132
You're right.

301
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:07,209
We're not where we were.

302
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:12,221
Trust me. I am doing you a
favour by keeping you out of it.

303
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:14,465
No, that is not
gonna work with me.

304
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,101
It's gonna have to.

305
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,466
I can't make a distinction

306
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:19,555
between professional
and personal.

307
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:21,307
This job took two years from me.

308
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,107
Everything is personal.

309
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:28,398
As much as I wish
I could trust you...

310
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,827
...the responsibilities
you have now require me not to.

311
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,153
Responsibilities?
What the hell does that mean?

312
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:38,204
What, Lauren?

313
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,374
Because she's NSC,
or because she's my wife?

314
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,785
Or is that distinction
irrelevant?

315
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,250
I'm not punishing you.

316
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,795
You think I am.

317
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,965
I'm not.

318
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:02,223
Somebody die?

319
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:09,521
I spoke to my contact.

320
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:14,110
By disabling the power, we're
gonna lure off-site security.

321
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,527
We have another problem.

322
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:18,996
What's that?

323
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,005
Vaughn's been
quizzing me about Julia.

324
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:33,589
I tried shutting down
his enquiry,

325
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,764
but apparently something you
said has made that impossible.

326
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,008
All I said was that
I couldn't talk about it.

327
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:40,679
Which has only piqued
his interest.

328
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,139
What piqued his interest was
hearing Simon call me Julia

329
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,853
and then kiss me
like his prom date.

330
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,568
I can't compel Vaughn
to stop being curious.

331
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,278
I don't need to remind you
of the consequence

332
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,735
if Lauren and the NSC
connect you

333
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:54,532
to the assassination of Lazarey.

334
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,776
They will subject you
to detailed,

335
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,827
invasive, and painful procedures

336
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,953
in the name of extracting
your lost memory.

337
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,578
Yes, all of that could happen,
and you know what?

338
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:07,203
At this point, I'm starting to
think that might be good.

339
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,088
Maybe I should've
let them hook me up

340
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:14,295
when I first got back,
find out what they could.

341
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:18,884
Because however painful
that would be,

342
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,727
it couldn't be
as painful as not knowing.

343
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:24,312
Yes, it can.

344
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,643
Okay, I figured out how to crack
that safe you have to crack.

345
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,273
I got this idea during
Carrie's last ultrasound.

346
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:32,773
Check this out.

347
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:33,979
You ready?
Okay.

348
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:38,700
Now, while the software
manipulates the voltage

349
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:40,993
to crack
the encryption algorithm,

350
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,322
this monitors
the locking mechanism

351
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,958
using imaging and audio cues.

352
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:47,119
It's like an X-ray
and stethoscope in one.

353
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:49,370
Once I rewire the keypad
and attach the probe,

354
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:50,579
the software will do the rest.

355
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,168
Shouldn't take longer
than a couple minutes.

356
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,918
I know what you're wondering.

357
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,125
Boy or girl, right?

358
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,382
Well, she won't tell me.

359
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,586
Marshall, I don't know.

360
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,056
She knows.

361
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,512
That's okay, 'cause
I've come up with a solution

362
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,759
to solve this predicament.

363
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:06,261
Unisex names. This is what
I've come up with so far.

364
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,107
Jodie, Sam, Alex,
Andy, Francis, Frank.

365
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,603
Could be with a "ph."
Phrank.

366
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,236
Randy, Terry, Jan, Don.

367
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,028
Ms. Bristow?

368
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:17,483
Director Dixon would like
to see you in his office.

369
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:21,745
Excuse me.

370
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:25,333
You know, I could
find out right now.

371
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,290
Touch me with that thing,
and you die.

372
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,412
- Do you know what this is about?
- No.

373
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:33,126
Your father showed me
your videotape.

374
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:38,091
What videotape?

375
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,014
The videotape that
clearly identifies Sydney

376
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,807
as the murderer
of a Russian diplomat.

377
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:45,099
Andrian Lazarey.

378
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,640
Your father has also informed me

379
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,723
that since your return,
you have conspired

380
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,516
to conceal this information
from both the CIA and the NSC,

381
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:56,648
because you were afraid you'd
be pulled off active duty.

382
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,070
Agent Vaughn, you weren't aware
of any of this?

383
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,953
No, sir.

384
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:07,911
I agree with Jack that your
complicity in Lazarey's murder

385
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,207
may not have been voluntary.

386
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:12,786
And seeing as you have
no memory of the incident,

387
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:14,838
it's premature
to pass judgement.

388
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,332
Sydney, Jack, if I find out

389
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:20,000
you've concealed any more
information from me,

390
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:23,382
you will feel the full weight of
this office bearing down on you.

391
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:26,559
That said, we're in too deep
with the current operation.

392
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:31,306
We can't allow The Covenant to
get their hands on bioweapons.

393
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,191
So you're going back in
as scheduled.

394
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:34,106
Yes, sir.

395
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,981
Given my discretion
to compartmentalise information

396
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:38,566
during an ongoing operation,

397
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:42,156
I'm withholding this
information from the NSC.

398
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,659
That means, Agent Vaughn,
that you are prohibited

399
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,452
from discussing any of this
with your wife.

400
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,617
Is that understood?

401
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,621
Yeah.

402
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,541
You want to tell me
what that was about?

403
00:26:57,634 --> 00:26:59,211
I thought we need to keep
this secret.

404
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,875
Yes, from the NSC,
which is what we've done.

405
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:04,889
You knew Dixon would order
Vaughn to keep this from Lauren.

406
00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:06,848
If the NSC found out,
I'd be pulled.

407
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:08,892
You would have come
to the same conclusion.

408
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:11,304
Maybe, yes, but I wouldn't
have acted on it.

409
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,189
The last thing I want
is to be responsible

410
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:15,397
for driving a wedge
between Vaughn and Lauren.

411
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:18,688
That is a concern
I do not share.

412
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,459
- How was Sloane?
- It was okay.

413
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:35,165
You're off?
Me too.

414
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:37,627
Aren't we the jet-set couple?

415
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,177
You were right. Details matter.
I shouldn't leave them out.

416
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:45,089
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

417
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:48,176
I miss you.

418
00:27:56,901 --> 00:27:59,227
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

419
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,609
She never went to Milan.

420
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,905
She was with him.

421
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,141
What my dad did.

422
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:43,067
I never wanted you to have to
keep secrets from Lauren.

423
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:50,745
Well, now I do.

424
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,833
And for the record,
I still think this is insane.

425
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:57,373
You're going back to a man who
knows you as a different person.

426
00:28:57,462 --> 00:29:01,412
If this were just about finding
The Covenant, I might agree.

427
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:08,091
But, Vaughn, I have to know
where I was, and who Julia is.

428
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,389
What I did.

429
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:19,226
The laser mike's in place.
You're good to go.

430
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:27,528
I'll talk to you
when this is over.

431
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:45,376
How was Milan?

432
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:47,176
We're good.

433
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,671
I got everything we need.

434
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,479
Just you and me?

435
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:03,776
Sit down.

436
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:08,648
So, tell me, Julia,
and don't be coy.

437
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:12,691
Before, when you disappeared,
where the hell did you go?

438
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:15,705
Why?
Did you miss me?

439
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,620
I did.

440
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:32,886
What did you miss?

441
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,682
Well...

442
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:39,854
you.

443
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:48,564
You had certain
specific qualities.

444
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,073
Like what?

445
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:04,746
The first time you saw me,
what did you think?

446
00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:11,423
Oh, you mean in Algeria?

447
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:22,355
Do you remember why we almost
died in that godforsaken place?

448
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:27,024
We couldn't keep our hands
off each other.

449
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:41,281
I thought to myself...

450
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,077
...now, there
is a very beautiful woman...

451
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:52,218
...who knows how to deceive.

452
00:31:54,973 --> 00:31:56,004
You never went to Milan.

453
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,474
No, man, you can't go.

454
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,219
I'm not going to just
let her die.

455
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,514
Tell me who the hell
you're working for.

456
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,764
I'm working for myself,
you son of a bitch!

457
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:06,103
Yeah?

458
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,603
Who's this?

459
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:12,025
That's my supplier.

460
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:14,107
Your supplier?

461
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,860
What's his name?

462
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:18,490
You lie to me again,
and I will kill you.

463
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:21,829
That's Michael Vaughn.
He's my supplier.

464
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,708
Oh, my God,
that's a picture of me.

465
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:26,830
What the hell?
What, you don't believe me?

466
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:30,207
No.
No, sweetheart, I don't.

467
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,264
Flinkman residence.

468
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:38,973
This is Vaughn.
Listen to me carefully.

469
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,632
I need you to upload
to Interpol database immediately

470
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,931
a criminal record with my name,
at least 20 charges,

471
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:46,351
all of them security-based.

472
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:48,896
Got it. Security stocks
or security alarm systems?

473
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:49,685
Alarm systems.

474
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:51,272
Why did you go to the States?

475
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:54,945
Because the system you're asking
me to disable is from Chicago.

476
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,738
That's Illinois.
That's the United States.

477
00:32:57,827 --> 00:33:00,532
Milan wasn't going to help us,
you freak!

478
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:04,366
That's your supplier?

479
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:06,083
Check his records.

480
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:08,327
Security is all he does.

481
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,046
Do a search
for a criminal profile

482
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,709
with security-related felons.

483
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,215
- A "please" would be nice.
- Please, my love.

484
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:20,682
Is Marshall able to do this?

485
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:21,798
Are you able to do this?

486
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,304
We're doing the best we can.

487
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:24,937
Got it.
Transferring now.

488
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:29,897
Just drag this over,
and change that.

489
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:38,611
Language, nationality,
height, weight.

490
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:42,656
Okay, almost there.
Hang on one second.

491
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,122
- Stop bouncing.
- Sorry.

492
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,156
Uploading.

493
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,958
And okay, done.

494
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,301
Babe.

495
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,258
Now I remember why I left.

496
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,610
She's good.

497
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,983
Okay.

498
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:23,741
We're hitting a storage facility
35 miles outside of Zaragoza

499
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,953
run by the Disease Control
Ministry.

500
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,914
Now, to get in,
we have to cut the power,

501
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,243
which is going to trigger
an off-site security response.

502
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:33,006
Gives us five minutes to get in,
get the package, and get out.

503
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,173
Our target's a biological agent.

504
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,845
Hello?

505
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,339
Good.
Yeah. Come in.

506
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:45,683
Take over.

507
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:48,802
Inside the vault, there's
a canister the size of a fist

508
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:51,518
which we'll transfer
into a portable cooler.

509
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:54,811
Now, keep in mind, once you open
the safe, you have one minute

510
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:57,275
to remove the canister
before it self-destructs,

511
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:00,033
which means the transfer must be
smooth and instantaneous.

512
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,607
The shift rotation's
been changed.

513
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:05,454
We'll have to adjust
our timetables accordingly.

514
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,290
But that shouldn't change
any of our plans.

515
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,662
Is your team aware of
the fragile nature of the item?

516
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:12,666
Yeah.

517
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:15,755
- By my calculations...
- Can I study these?

518
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:18,791
I know you're hiding something.

519
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,759
When you recover the item,
contact me,

520
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:23,846
and we'll exchange it
for the remainder of your fee.

521
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,805
Now, that's sporting.

522
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,434
Good luck.

523
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,098
I think I have
the information you asked for.

524
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,566
Good.

525
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,560
The second job.

526
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:39,819
What The Covenant
was trying to acquire.

527
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,949
It's an artificial pathogen.

528
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:45,283
If they combine this
with the virus they stole,

529
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,777
they will be able
to genetically tailor

530
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:51,573
a biological weapon
for specific targets.

531
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:53,993
A designer bomb
that would be effective

532
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,878
against only the people
they chose.

533
00:35:55,964 --> 00:35:57,755
Precisely.

534
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:02,546
I suppose I should
come clean with you.

535
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:04,262
That thing I said the other day.

536
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:08,843
The comment I made
about how you got the job.

537
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:13,261
I was referring to the Senator,
your father.

538
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:16,352
What about my father?

539
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:18,768
He knew how badly you wanted to
become field-rated,

540
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:21,435
and he thought
it was too dangerous.

541
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:23,689
So he made sure
it didn't happen.

542
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:30,951
But you knew that, didn't you?

543
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:35,243
I know what you're doing.

544
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:37,294
The way you manipulate people.

545
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,545
Don't do it to me.

546
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,989
It'll take me a minute
to hack into security.

547
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:10,113
I'm shutting the power off. We
have access to building three.

548
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:13,122
We have five minutes
before their guards show up.

549
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:30,257
Julia, you're up.

550
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:09,461
What's the problem?

551
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:11,429
Algorithm decryption
should have worked.

552
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:12,844
I'll need to map the circuitry.

553
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,393
- How long?
- I don't know.

554
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,719
You only have 30 seconds left.

555
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:25,355
I knew we couldn't rely on her.

556
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:28,317
Keep your mouth shut, and maybe
we'll walk out of here.

557
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,110
Julia, three seconds.

558
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,119
They customised the hardware.

559
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:46,168
Not exactly factory condition.

560
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:50,336
Nothing I couldn't handle.

561
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:10,237
Security will be here
in two minutes.

562
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:12,033
Let's go.

563
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,086
What's this?

564
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:34,263
Switching vehicles
in case we've been followed.

565
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:00,745
I have a little
surprise for you.

566
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:15,049
- Vaughn's missing!
- What happened?

567
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,298
I planted a mike.
I got back, and he's gone.

568
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:19,301
You're to meet Sydney
at the extraction point.

569
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:20,639
I am not leaving my partner.

570
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:23,398
A tac unit based out of
Barcelona has been deployed.

571
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:26,103
You will brief them
at the extraction point.

572
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,390
This is what I meant!

573
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:29,145
He's got CIA-issue equipment.

574
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:31,645
Simon, I swear to you,
this man is my supplier.

575
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,020
Not anymore.

576
00:40:33,116 --> 00:40:34,990
Come here.

577
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:37,156
Get rid of them both.

578
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:38,988
That's enough out of you!

579
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,832
Julia's with us. It's this
punter who's the problem.

580
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:45,249
Wait! Wait.

581
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:48,794
If he's been lying to me
all this time,

582
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:51,503
he's put me in danger.

583
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:53,253
I want to do it.

584
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:55,919
I want to do it.

585
00:40:57,974 --> 00:40:59,801
Get up.

586
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:17,326
You never should have
betrayed me.

587
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:39,384
Let's go.

588
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:49,186
Julia, let's move.
