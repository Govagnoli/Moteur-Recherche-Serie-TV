1
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,778
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,448
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,377
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,630
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:34,969
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:41,392
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,019
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,729
My father.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,109
I have this source
who told me about you.

13
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:55,739
I don't even know where he lives
or works, but he knows everything.

14
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:59,785
- I'm proud of you.
- What? Of me?

15
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,372
I've worked with a lot of people.
You make it look easy.

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,419
The Alliance knows
you pursued Khasinau.

17
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:12,673
They'll want to see evidence
that your priorities are in order.

18
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:18,304
Are you suggesting
that I allow you to kill my wife

19
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:21,182
to enhance my standing
within the Alliance?

20
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,439
You'll meet with Sark in Denpasar

21
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,193
disguised as a representative
from the Raslak Jihad.

22
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:37,490
I'll cover you from a safe distance
while you make a deal with Sark

23
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,950
for the counterfeit
Rambaldi solution.

24
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,708
Sydney, it's Dixon, he's here.

25
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,084
Hands in the air!

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,641
Take position over there. Cover fire.
I don't want Bristow hurt.

27
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,920
Sark's got the real ampoule.

28
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,756
I'm on him.
Head to the extraction point.

29
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:40,010
Cover me!

30
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,611
Freeze!

31
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:01,323
Turn around. Hands on your head.

32
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,087
I don't wanna hurt you.

33
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:20,843
Are you at the extraction point yet?

34
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,938
I've got the ampoule.
I need a 20 on Freelancer.

35
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:35,357
- Don't leave Sark.
- Where is she?

36
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,838
Go. Go!

37
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,405
Hello?

38
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:27,118
You said you were back on the story.
Why haven't you published?

39
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,370
I need something from you.

40
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:33,999
Tell your contact you want a meeting,
to take place at his discretion.

41
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,794
Why lead me to you,
knowing you'd flush him out?

42
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,922
He told you my name to prove
that my threat was a bluff,

43
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,968
that I'd never hurt Sydney even
if you continued the investigation.

44
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,220
I didn't think
you'd dare contact me.

45
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,472
I'll assume that's a compliment.

46
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,142
When you ask for the meeting,
he'll refuse.

47
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,060
- What do I say?
- You say...

48
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:55,813
I know something
you'll be interested in.

49
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,607
About the circumference.

50
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,444
- What is the circumference?
- Not your concern.

51
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,404
- I've got to know.
- No.

52
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,615
If he wants to know more,
he'll have to meet.

53
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,951
Look, just meet with me,

54
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:13,122
or find somebody else. I'm sick
of this cloak-and-dagger crap.

55
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:17,793
Very well, Mr Tippin, you'll be
contacted with instructions.

56
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:32,683
I'm sure I speak
for our distinguished friend from LA

57
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:36,896
when I say how much we appreciate
your coming on such short notice.

58
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,524
It reflects your understanding
that the business before us

59
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:45,154
is as difficult as it is vital to
the survival of our organisation.

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,283
I'm told you have some
prepared remarks. Please.

61
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,119
Thank you, Ramon.

62
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:57,792
Before I begin, should we wait until
all the other members have arrived?

63
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:00,169
That won't be necessary.

64
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:06,842
I feel rather awkward sitting here,

65
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:09,386
asking you to allow my wife
to die of cancer.

66
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,098
Arvin, the agreement is simple.

67
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:17,144
People with any unauthorised
information regarding SD-6,

68
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:20,981
or any SD cell, must be eliminated.

69
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,568
My wife is being eliminated.

70
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,780
By cancer.

71
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:30,574
The pending
bone-marrow-biopsy reports

72
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,078
will merely inform us as to
the number of days she has left.

73
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,081
Days she'll spend
in an SD-6 hospital,

74
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,042
where information can be contained.

75
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:46,340
Should you choose to intervene,
I will be forced to resign.

76
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:51,011
Something, I believe, you should
factor into your decision.

77
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,766
Now, in the past 12 years,

78
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,979
SD-6 has made for the Alliance over
$400 million in arms sales alone,

79
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:05,109
plus another 300 million from
transactions with Ineni Hassan.

80
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:09,113
In addition, we have acquired
more Rambaldi artefacts

81
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,740
than all the SD cells combined.

82
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:15,327
Your service to the Alliance
is unquestioned,

83
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,538
with one exception.

84
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:21,041
We know you had our colleague,
Jean Briault assassinated.

85
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,922
You know about Poole, don't you?

86
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:30,342
That's why he's not here.

87
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,347
You know that Khasinau
had him in his pocket.

88
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,476
Our former colleague has,
under duress,

89
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,353
acknowledged his connection
with Mr Khasinau,

90
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:46,984
and his manipulation of you that led
to Briault's unfortunate passing.

91
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,988
Faced with a breach
of this magnitude,

92
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,449
we have re-evaluated our position

93
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:56,911
regarding peaceful coexistence
with Khasinau.

94
00:07:56,994 --> 00:08:00,372
We know you have
advocated a war with Khasinau.

95
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:06,170
The Alliance is now fully prepared
to engage in such an action.

96
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:10,674
I am relieved and gratified.

97
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,263
He is an enemy
worthy of our combined resources.

98
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:20,768
You must have a vision of how
all of this is supposed to play out.

99
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:24,396
I'm assuming that your plan ends
in assassination.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,316
That's right,
assassination of Khasinau.

101
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,110
Then your plan must change.

102
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:33,656
If we abduct Khasinau,
or worse yet, kill him,

103
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:38,536
we will never have an opportunity
to learn what it is he is after...

104
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:43,916
...or how he works, or with whom.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,923
Put away your need for revenge.
Find out what you can.

106
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,968
Bring us substantial intel...

107
00:08:55,344 --> 00:09:01,475
...and we will take your wife's
situation under advisement.

108
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,540
Miss me?

109
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:32,173
- So, how was...?
- Palm Springs. Perfect.

110
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:35,676
- Right, the desert.
- I actually read a book.

111
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,762
- Did you go with anyone?
- Will and Francie had work.

112
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,307
It was good actually, being alone.

113
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,975
I needed time to decompress.

114
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,606
We've reacquired Khasinau's trail.

115
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,778
- We have?
- We apprehended Sark in Denpasar.

116
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,323
There was a second ampoule.
We intercepted a communiqué

117
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:00,451
detailing Sark's plan to buy it
from Raslak Jihad.

118
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,705
- Did you get the ampoule?
- No, Sark didn't have it on him.

119
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:15,549
I'm gonna read the op tech report,
catch up on what I missed.

120
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:19,178
Sydney.

121
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,599
For the record, I did miss you.

122
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,192
- Mr Bristow.
- Francie. I'm giving Sydney a ride.

123
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,194
Sure, come on in.

124
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:21,615
I've gotta go. Bye.

125
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,534
Bye, Francie.

126
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:28,247
Kretchmer briefed me on Denpasar.
It was a sloppy operation.

127
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,959
Your pursuit of your mother
is clouding your judgement.

128
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:36,172
At the moment, I can't protect you.
I haven't regained Sloane's trust.

129
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:40,217
He hasn't reinstated me to duty.
I'm not even privy to his briefings.

130
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:43,345
Then you haven't heard
that SD-6 got Sark?

131
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:05,159
While this might not seem
like a good day for you

132
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,869
you'd be surprised.

133
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:10,831
We have people here
trained in torture.

134
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:16,045
They are so good at what they do,
I sometimes take them for granted.

135
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:19,465
But I'm not in the mood for torture.

136
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,468
No, there's been enough torture
lately.

137
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:28,224
We've been curious
about your employer...

138
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,852
...Alexander Khasinau.

139
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:36,065
Well, you're in good company.

140
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:40,444
Yes, but we have you.

141
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,696
Indeed.

142
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:45,741
I need to find your employer.

143
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:52,915
You raise an interesting point.
Given my current state of affairs,

144
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:57,628
it doesn't seem as if my affiliation
with Khasinau is long for this earth.

145
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,465
We both know you're a clever man.

146
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,885
So we don't need to play games.

147
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,846
You're valuable to me.

148
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,598
You can help me find Khasinau.

149
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:14,937
I'm valuable to you, obviously.

150
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,693
I understand I am in no position
to demand anything.

151
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,195
But for the record,

152
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,741
I'm far more comfortable talking
over a glass of Chateau Petrus.

153
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,828
'82.

154
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,457
Why does he look guilty?

155
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,169
Ginger told Rod
that Gavin was Ruby's pimp.

156
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,588
Rod didn't know Ruby
was a prostitute.

157
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,090
- Who's Gavin?
- Ruby's father.

158
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:44,884
Right.

159
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,429
- Will?
- Hi.

160
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:54,685
What's...?
What happened to Ruby's dad?

161
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,563
Where are you?

162
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:00,608
I'm sorry.
I just got this work thing.

163
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,694
- Hello?
- Listen carefully.

164
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,822
I'm about to give you instructions
on where to meet.

165
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:08,491
Follow them to the letter.

166
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,165
Guess who just tore me a new one?
Devlin.

167
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:17,792
Now ask me why.

168
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,544
- Why?
- I took a bullet for you today.

169
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,923
He wanted to know
why you left Sark unsecured.

170
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:27,551
I said I told you to, I misread
the feed from the satellite,

171
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,261
I thought the team was near.

172
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:32,014
- Thank you.
- I lied to save your ass.

173
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,475
- You didn't have to.
- Partners do that.

174
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,269
- I said thanks.
- I don't want thanks.

175
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:38,562
I want it to stop.

176
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,357
Sydney's my responsibility.

177
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,151
I won't call your relationship
a crush.

178
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,196
- A crush?
- Whatever it is, it's affecting me.

179
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,991
If that sounds selfish,
I was hoping to retire fully vested.

180
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:00,918
I know you genuinely
care for her. I do, too.

181
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,505
But there is a line
we have been sworn not to cross.

182
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:06,632
We're about a mile past that.

183
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,389
I don't know how to be her handler
without making it personal.

184
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,558
Figure out a way.

185
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:35,536
I admit, I was only half-serious
when I asked for the Petrus.

186
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:41,125
I just assumed after what Khasinau's
done, sending men to this facility,

187
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,713
murdering some of your men,
that regardless of what I said,

188
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,090
you'd split my belly with a knife.

189
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:51,802
Do you think that's the kind of
activity the CIA engages in?

190
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,639
Not the CIA.

191
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,856
Khasinau sent you to Moscow
to negotiate with K-Directorate.

192
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:07,943
He trusts you. You know things.

193
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:10,654
I suppose I'd better know things.

194
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:15,493
However, to be clear, my employer
hardly tells me everything.

195
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:50,861
We will collaborate... you and I.

196
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:53,489
You will lead me to Khasinau.

197
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,199
Understood?

198
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:00,830
May I?

199
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:13,384
Understood?

200
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:16,470
Understood.

201
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,937
As it turns out, our Mr Sark
is a very cooperative young man.

202
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,275
We have received confirmation
for the intel he's provided thus far.

203
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,403
It seems that Mr Sark's
loyalty to Khasinau

204
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,989
disappeared when he was kidnapped.

205
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:37,116
So what's the move?

206
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,786
Sark won't contact Khasinau
until Thursday night.

207
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,458
They'll meet at a club in Paris
that Khasinau owns. You'll go there.

208
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,127
- Is this an abduction?
- No.

209
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:51,255
Khasinau is expecting the ampoule.

210
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:54,467
Sark says
Khasinau needs the solution

211
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:00,973
to read a document they believe
has text in Rambaldi's invisible ink.

212
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:04,852
This Rambaldi page
will be at the Paris location.

213
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:09,023
Sark will have a counterfeit ampoule,
which he will pass to Khasinau.

214
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:15,279
Your job is to steal this page
and replace it with a counterfeit.

215
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:19,283
Wait, I don't understand.
We've hunted Khasinau for months.

216
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:24,497
- I know you have a personal stake...
- You want us to go after a document?

217
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,916
Let's just get the son of a bitch.

218
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:27,833
Sydney.

219
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,963
No one wants Khasinau
more than I do. No one.

220
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,887
Sark has provided us
with detailed plans of the club,

221
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,473
its operation, location of the vault.

222
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,976
An employee of the club
will call in sick.

223
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,605
It's been arranged
for you to take her place.

224
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,776
Marshall will provide you
with the op tech.

225
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:58,823
How's your voice?

226
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:01,909
Why?

227
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,960
I was contacted.

228
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:12,002
- Followed?
- No.

229
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,131
- What precautions did you take?
- What you told me.

230
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:18,342
I didn't use my blinkers
and circled the block.

231
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:21,512
- What'd your contact say?
- He wants to meet.

232
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:24,765
Good. You'll be picked up
by armed men in a van.

233
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:28,477
You'll be blindfolded
and taken to another location.

234
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:32,148
- I know how that feels.
- They won't hurt you, they need you.

235
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:36,527
- They'll take me to Deep Throat?
- Or someone who works for him.

236
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:42,032
- A transmitter's in the lining.
- And if they frisk me?

237
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,577
It won't be detected.
What were the terms?

238
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,494
Terms?

239
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:48,789
- Time, place, oral or visual tell?
- It's a street corner.

240
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:51,792
- I'll be reading a local paper.
- When?

241
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,044
- Tomorrow, 7 pm.
- Where?

242
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:57,631
Paris.

243
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:06,432
Tell me my counter mission
is to grab Khasinau.

244
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,184
- It's not.
- It should be.

245
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,479
I'll be this close, and nobody
wants me to take him in?

246
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,939
SD-6 must not get
the Rambaldi document.

247
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:18,152
In transit you'll replace what Dixon
took from the vault with these.

248
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:21,864
- Just switch the pages?
- Yes, these are counterfeit.

249
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:28,245
- Do you have any questions?
- No, I do not.

250
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:34,502
- What's going on?
- Nothing, do you have any questions?

251
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:39,340
Yes, I wanna know what's going on
with you. You're not like yourself.

252
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:43,552
I'm fine, but I should go. Good luck.

253
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,222
Thanks.

254
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:58,526
I couldn't go through this
without you.

255
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,327
Dr Levin and I discussed
your pain-management.

256
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,663
Arvin...

257
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,753
I don't wanna be here...
in the hospital, when...

258
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,342
I wanna be home.

259
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,888
Promise me.

260
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,517
I promise.

261
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:24,069
Or say it's a friendship ring.

262
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:27,615
Showing platonic intimacy
between girls, or a guy and a girl.

263
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:30,659
Some say it's impossible,
but we're friends.

264
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:35,790
Right? OK, it's actually
a cardiac event recorder.

265
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:40,878
Khasinau's vault uses biometric
access, no code, no key, nothing.

266
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:43,005
This detects heartbeat signatures.

267
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:46,175
A unique one,
as Khasinau has atrial fibrillation.

268
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:52,306
You put this on his thorax,
or anywhere you might get a pulse.

269
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:59,105
It transmits the ECG data to Dixon's
cellphone, which fools the sensor.

270
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,816
Voilà! Open sesame.

271
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:22,503
- Take this.
- What's this?

272
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:26,048
A methamphetamine to counter
the Sodium Pentothal.

273
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:30,469
Sodium Pentothal? A truth serum?
They're gonna give me that?

274
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:33,264
- I would.
- Great.

275
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:36,308
Don't worry, I'll monitor you
the whole time.

276
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:42,231
- Is your cover story straight?
- They're gonna kill me, aren't they?

277
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:44,650
If they wanted that,
you'd be dead now.

278
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:49,864
They need you, as you know someone
who knows about the circumference.

279
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:53,367
I wouldn't let you do this
if I thought you'd die.

280
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,869
Great.

281
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:59,415
I can record your interrogator's
voice, possibly even your contacts,

282
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:03,419
if he makes an appearance.
Either way, we have a lead to trace.

283
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,691
- Mr Sark.
- Mr Khasinau.

284
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:32,239
I hear you have some troubles in
Denpasar? Good to have you back.

285
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,366
- Thank you.
- Yes.

286
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,667
Can I see the ampoule?

287
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:52,051
Shall we proceed to my office?

288
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:54,720
Make sure you keep
Khasinau at his table.

289
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:59,225
In case you have any thoughts of
warning him, I'd advise against it.

290
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:02,436
We'll be taking precautions.

291
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,941
- I took the liberty of ordering.
- Yes.

292
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:10,277
OK, good idea.
We celebrate your success first.

293
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:36,637
You...

294
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:44,353
Made me leave my happy home

295
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:46,647
You took my love

296
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,569
And now you're gone

297
00:25:52,486 --> 00:26:00,202
Since I fell for you

298
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:07,501
My life

299
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:11,922
Brings such misery

300
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:15,426
And pain

301
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:22,516
I know I'll never be the same

302
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:29,815
Since I fell for you

303
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:37,239
It's too bad

304
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:41,076
And it's too sad

305
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:46,624
But I'm in love with you...

306
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:51,712
Almost got it, Syd,
a couple more seconds.

307
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,138
Get in the van, Mr Tippin.

308
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:04,809
Alright, I got it,
I'm heading to the vault.

309
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,355
I...

310
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:17,154
Oh, I guess
I'll never see the light

311
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:24,245
I get the blues most every night

312
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,875
Since I fell

313
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:38,843
For you...

314
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:59,071
Sir, we have the young man
from Los Angeles.

315
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,031
Proceed. Come.

316
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:41,655
We're good, Syd, I'll meet you
out back in two minutes.

317
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,032
Your arm, please.

318
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:48,370
- So is it you I've been talking to?
- He'll be along shortly.

319
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:52,458
- First, we have questions.
- What's that? Sodium Pentothal?

320
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:57,004
Yes, so that our conversation
will go smoothly.

321
00:28:57,087 --> 00:29:01,383
Tell me, Mr Tippin, how did you
find out about the circumference?

322
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:08,557
- I heard about it.
- From who?

323
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,894
A name, Mr Tippin.

324
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:13,687
A name?

325
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,108
OK.

326
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,001
Oh, my God, what's going on?

327
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:38,629
How did you get here? Listen to me.

328
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,631
How did you get here?

329
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,800
- Will?
- I followed a story.

330
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:48,848
We have to move, come on.

331
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:55,646
- See you at the extraction point.
- Copy, meet you in 30 minutes.

332
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:03,404
Stop!

333
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:20,337
We're going out the front!

334
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,220
- Get down.
- OK.

335
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:56,040
- Get in!
- Jack! Thank God.

336
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,000
- He came in with you?
- Get down.

337
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:04,006
I need an identity switch
and cover escort. Three minutes.

338
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,966
- How could you?
- To protect him.

339
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,595
- Protect him?
- You don't understand our concerns.

340
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,764
Who the hell are you people?

341
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,852
This one has no field experience.

342
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:20,356
- Go with him, it's OK.
- Which part of this is OK?

343
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,234
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

344
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,151
Now!

345
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,364
Pay attention!

346
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:35,663
Your name is Patrice Lafond,

347
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:39,792
you were born in Nantes,
where you lived until you were five.

348
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,709
OK.

349
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:44,505
- How could you bring him in?
- He was looking into Danny's death.

350
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:47,883
I had to stop security section
from executing him.

351
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,093
Why didn't you say?

352
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:53,806
Someone, possibly in intelligence,
contacted him, very highly placed.

353
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:59,145
They've steered him to SD-6, told him
about me. We're tracking his source.

354
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,897
No-one from intelligence
was in that club.

355
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:06,444
Those people who interrogated Will,
they work for Khasinau.

356
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:10,739
He wants to bring down SD-6.
He tried and failed with Cole.

357
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:13,909
Articles would be less painful,
but effective.

358
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:15,744
You were using Will!

359
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:20,708
He was already being used. It's no
coincidence that he was chosen.

360
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,627
- What are you saying?
- For some reason,

361
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:26,756
Khasinau is trying to expose us.

362
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:45,149
You cannot tell anyone
about this. Not anyone.

363
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:51,155
Do you promise me?

364
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,285
OK.

365
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,376
I'll see you at home.

366
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:15,846
The Daniels are planning
to fly out to visit next week.

367
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:19,642
I think it's a good idea, sweetheart.

368
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:23,687
Bold of me to make plans
for next week, don't you think?

369
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:24,647
Come on.

370
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,442
Arvin, you have to keep
your sense of humour.

371
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,779
I suppose I do.

372
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,743
Are you there?

373
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:40,329
Yes, Emily, I am.

374
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:44,708
Listen, darling, I need to take
this phone call. Alright?

375
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:48,170
- See you soon, my love.
- Yes.

376
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:50,256
Yes, I will.

377
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:54,385
- Alain.
- Nice work in Paris.

378
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:58,556
You have deprived Khasinau
of a valuable prize.

379
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:03,185
- Yes, thank you.
- The Alliance has decided...

380
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:08,023
... due to your wife's illness,
her condition,

381
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,194
your request has been approved.

382
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:15,406
Your wife will be spared.

383
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,920
Base ops, this is Freelancer.

384
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,338
Freelancer?

385
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:47,229
Syd.

386
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:50,483
I wanna ask you something,
I need a straight answer.

387
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,276
Of course.

388
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,155
I know your arm is hurt.
How'd it happen?

389
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:03,287
I was hiking in the San Jacinto
Mountains, I lost my footing

390
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,333
and found myself in this rock-slide.
I gashed it pretty bad.

391
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,127
You should have told me.

392
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:14,590
We should let each other know
about our injuries. Full disclosure.

393
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,593
Full disclosure.

394
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:44,578
Sark must have tipped off Khasinau,
that's why his men came after me.

395
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:48,916
That complication notwithstanding,
the mission was a success.

396
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,751
But we lost Sark.

397
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:56,132
When Khasinau's team failed
to detect the tracking device,

398
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:59,051
he must have thought I was bluffing.

399
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:02,346
I was prepared for that possibility.

400
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,724
When he asked for a bottle of wine,

401
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:10,479
I had it laced with a non-lethal dose
of a radioactive isotope.

402
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:15,484
We have a geosynchronous satellite
in orbit to detect particle decay.

403
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:18,529
We have been tracking Sark
since he left the club.

404
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,283
Where is he?

405
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:26,120
On a transatlantic flight,
hopefully with Khasinau.

406
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:31,917
We don't now his destination yet,
but when he lands we'll send a team.

407
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,545
That's all, you can go.

408
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:40,092
Sydney, stay for a minute,
would you?

409
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:46,891
Emily told me that you visited her
at the hospital last week,

410
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,435
and you had a nice conversation.

411
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,147
Yes, we did.

412
00:36:55,524 --> 00:37:01,697
Some of things she said indicated
her awareness of what we do here.

413
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:07,369
Usually such a breach prescribes
a deliberate course of action.

414
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:09,705
You know that better than anyone.

415
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:14,585
Because she's not likely
to last the week...

416
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:19,840
...I was able to sustain a reprieve.

417
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,678
I'm glad.

418
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:29,558
Yes, I knew you would be,
that's why I wanted to thank you...

419
00:37:29,642 --> 00:37:32,144
for being
such a good friend to Emily.

420
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,898
And to me.

421
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:43,864
It was your duty to report Emily
to security section. You didn't.

422
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:49,245
That's more than I did for you.

423
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:55,626
You're not feeling
sympathy for Sloane.

424
00:37:55,709 --> 00:38:02,925
No. But it's the first time I've seen
him express regret for what he did.

425
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:08,055
He wouldn't hesitate to kill you
if he knew about this conversation.

426
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,473
You're right.

427
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:14,145
I read your debrief, so did Devlin,
we'll deal with the document later.

428
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:17,189
First you should know that...

429
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:22,027
Office of Securities is drawing up
a contingency plan to keep Will safe.

430
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,321
What kind?

431
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:27,241
Witness protection.
Worst case, recruitment.

432
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:29,118
- No.
- We have to cover it all.

433
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,579
- I don't believe it!
- It might not happen.

434
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:35,624
- You're not bringing him into this.
- He is in this life now.

435
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:41,547
He's my friend.
He is one of my best friends.

436
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,633
- I understand that.
- No, you don't.

437
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:51,265
You get to tell your friends
that you work for the CIA,

438
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:57,313
while I go home and look desperately
for a tiny moment to be honest in.

439
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:02,359
Now that Will knows the truth...

440
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:05,529
...he'll never trust me again.

441
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:12,703
You should have seen
his face in Paris.

442
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,332
Like he was looking at a stranger.

443
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,835
But he wasn't.
He was looking at you.

444
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:26,550
Maybe for the first time...
he was looking at you.

445
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,654
What is this place?
We're in the middle of LA.

446
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:48,989
You have places
like this everywhere?

447
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:53,202
I told you not to pursue this story.

448
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,704
I know you did.

449
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:58,916
Danny was killed because he knew.

450
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,836
Because I told him.

451
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,587
They were gonna kill me, too.

452
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:08,592
That's why you asked
for my sister's passport.

453
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,347
I know you have questions and...

454
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:17,810
...I would like to answer them.
But I can't.

455
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:23,482
I am so afraid you know
anything about me at all.

456
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:29,029
I went after the story because of
Danny. You didn't have any answers,

457
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:32,032
and I just couldn't stand that.

458
00:40:33,117 --> 00:40:36,704
It broke my heart. I wanted to help.

459
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:42,460
But you gotta know this,
I'm not gonna ask you a thing.

460
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:45,337
I am not gonna ask anyone anything.

461
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:48,716
You never have to worry about that.

462
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:53,304
You promise me. Because
Danny just left a message and...

463
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:56,223
Syd, I promise you.

464
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:58,184
Never.

465
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:01,937
I was thinking on the flight back,

466
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:04,064
what your life's like.

467
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:09,361
What you have to go through.

468
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:12,448
What you've had to keep
from your friends.

469
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:15,242
How hard that must be.

470
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,039
Syd, I don't love you
because of what you do.

471
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,417
Or what you don't do.

472
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,420
I just love you.

473
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,558
- Thank you.
- Thank you. You saved my life.

474
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:47,691
- Mr Sark has landed in Geneva.
- How long to get a team in position?

475
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:50,736
One hour. Do we have authorisation
to apprehend him?

476
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,030
Yes. You have it.

477
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:59,078
Hey, is there a food situation?
Any chance to get something to eat?

478
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:03,165
- Like a burger or something?
- I'm easy.

479
00:42:07,128 --> 00:42:11,590
- I'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
- It's OK, Doctor.

480
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:15,678
I apologise for being underprepared,
I just got the tests back,

481
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:18,055
I thought you'd wanna know.

482
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,897
The pain we suspected might
be a recurrence of the lymphoma

483
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:31,068
appears to be due to the rapid
regrowth of bone marrow elements.

484
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:35,156
That's... wonderful.

485
00:42:36,198 --> 00:42:37,450
Isn't it?

486
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:42,329
In fact, the lymphoma cells appear
to be decreasing significantly.

487
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,791
Emily, you're entering remission.

488
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,545
These are only preliminary tests.

489
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:54,133
Your blood panels
will tell us more, but...

490
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,676
Arvin.

491
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:05,352
Oh, God...

492
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:21,994
Alpha team in position.

493
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:30,044
Sloane wants Sark alive.

494
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:54,902
Nothing here but medical equipment.

495
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:59,907
Blood bags, pump...
Son of a bitch had a transfusion.

496
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:24,014
Yeah...! 30 minutes or less.
