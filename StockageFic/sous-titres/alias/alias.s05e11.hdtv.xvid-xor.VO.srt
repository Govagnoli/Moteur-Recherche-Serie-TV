1
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,286
What is going to happen with my family?

2
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,153
My orders are to deliver you
to the airfield.

3
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,221
I have no information beyond that.

4
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,588
Could you find out?

5
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:26,831
Wha...

6
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,231
What's happening?

7
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:29,898
Why are we stopped?

8
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,941
It's all right. We're on our way.

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,265
Oh! They're here!

10
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:50,379
- I'm going.
- God, they're here!

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,912
Charlie-Echo-One, this is Foxfire.
We're under attack.

12
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,563
Don't shoot!

13
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:09,917
I'm coming out!

14
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:17,478
Don't sh...

15
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:19,588
Oh, God! Ohh!

16
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,076
Irina...

17
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,760
You've compromised our agenda, Jeffrey.

18
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,712
No, I...

19
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:37,948
I didn't do anything.

20
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,353
This is all a mistake!

21
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,707
Okay, I'm sorry!

22
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:43,184
I'm sorry!

23
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,172
Tell me exactly what you said
to my husband.

24
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:48,485
Did you tell him about the Horizon?

25
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:49,837
No, of course not!

26
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:52,112
No! You have to believe me!

27
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,194
I swear!

28
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,494
I do believe you.

00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,514
Sorry to keep you waiting,
agent Bristow.

33
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:15,744
I know Langley's anxious to debrief you.

34
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:19,642
Is my baby okay?

35
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,252
Yes.

36
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:25,502
You're sure?

37
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,909
I can't imagine what you went through
on that ship.

38
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,426
But having said that,

39
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,648
the surgery they performed
probably saved the pregnancy.

40
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:36,898
You and your child are in great health,
agent Bristow.

41
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,034
Well, thank you.

42
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:41,682
And call me Sydney.

43
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,345
If you're going to deliver this baby
in the next couple of weeks,

44
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,375
we might as well
get to know each other.

45
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:48,380
Hi.

46
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,117
They told me you were done?

47
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:53,511
See you next week.

48
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,370
Is everything okay?

49
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:57,503
Yeah, I'm fine.

50
00:02:58,404 --> 00:02:59,659
Hey, can I borrow your phone?

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,195
- I want to get Marshall...
- the C.I.A. released your father.

52
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,107
They did?

53
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,284
Davenport confessed.

54
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:05,983
Apparently he cut a deal.

55
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:09,127
Your father wants to see us,
before you contact A.P.O.

56
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,415
Where is he?

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,690
Thanks.

58
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:17,138
Hey.

59
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:18,388
Hey, what's up?

60
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,886
- You want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,020
Rain check.
I'll... find you when I'm done.

62
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:28,859
...authority here is no way in question.

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,957
This is merely temporary...

64
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,663
Of course. I understand that.

65
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,710
Davenport and I came up together.

66
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,987
- I'm godfather to his oldest son.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:37,724
How were these people able
to corrupt him?

68
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:38,565
I have no idea.

69
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,839
Agent Tom Grace,
this is director Devlin.

70
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,620
The director and his team
will be auditing

71
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,037
our investigation of Prophet Five.

72
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,061
You'll assist him, please
with whatever he needs.

73
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,434
- Sure, of course.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,197
I'd, uh, for starters, like to see
all your sit reports and...

75
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,198
operation files.

76
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,746
I can get you the sit reps,

77
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,559
but we're performing diagnostic
on the computer network.

78
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,107
The files will take longer.

79
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,637
It's... it's just routine.

80
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,394
Who can provide me with
admin privileges to your access logs?

81
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:04,924
That's... Rachel Gibson.

82
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,543
She's over there.

83
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:08,094
Thank you.

84
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,319
What just happened?

85
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,412
He wants to review
the computer transmissions

86
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,471
to see if anyone provided Prophet Five
with Davenport's travel route.

87
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,783
He thinks the leak
came from this office,

88
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,289
and the phone logs
will reveal who it was.

89
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:28,116
Apparently so.

90
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,371
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

91
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:02,329
Okay, what's going on?
Why are we meeting out here?

92
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:03,736
Davenport's been killed.

93
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,664
His transport was ambushed.

94
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,984
That transport route was classified.

95
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,178
- The only people who knew...
- Were C.I.A.

96
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,278
You think Prophet Five has another mole
inside the agency?

97
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,279
It seems so, yes.

98
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,139
There's more.
As a condition of my release,

99
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,599
director Devlin is insisting
we suspend our investigation

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,859
of Prophet Five until Langley's
had a chance to review our findings.

101
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
We can't do that.

102
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,668
I agree, which means as long as Devlin
maintains a presence inside A.P.O.,

103
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,845
we have to stop documenting our work.

104
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,341
Operations will be compartmentalized
to senior staff only.

105
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,613
When I came to see you in the hospital,
you wanted to tell me something...

106
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,638
the reason Prophet Five abducted you.

107
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,023
When I was on their ship,
before the operation,

108
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,391
they performed some kind
of regression therapy.

109
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:46,333
They wanted me to remember a cipher...
Leo 47 Norte.

110
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,837
It was an entry on an Alliance
organization chart

111
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,456
Vaughn showed me years ago.

112
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,339
And did you give them the intel?

113
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,616
I changed the phrase.

114
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:55,617
That's good.

115
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,072
"47 Norte"?

116
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,346
That's a territorial designation.
It refers to France.

117
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:04,732
"Leo" designates a specific mission.

118
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,715
I'll review the Alliance archives.

119
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:08,580
Someone on that mission
might still be alive.

120
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:09,893
I want you on a plane to Paris.

121
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,808
Assuming I'm successful,
you'll be in position to act quickly.

122
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,565
Make contact with Renée Rienne.

123
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:15,694
Ask her to provide Dixon

124
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:18,048
with whatever documentation
he may need once he arrives.

125
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:18,879
Okay.

126
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,648
Then I want you to go home
and pack a bag.

127
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,456
- I'm moving you to a secure location.
- No.

128
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,841
- It's just temporary.
- Dad, don't be silly.

129
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,893
- I want to help.
- Help, yes, I know.

130
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,265
For now, you need to go underground.

131
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,716
Prophet Five abducted you.
We can't risk them doing it again.

132
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,860
Don't blame your dad, Syd.

133
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,813
He's only trying to protect you.

134
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,181
Yeah.

135
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:48,334
What?

136
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,009
Do you remember what Dean said?

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,298
That Prophet Five had plans for me.

138
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,951
They saved this baby for a reason.

139
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,700
Why?

140
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,252
I don't know.

141
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,220
Maybe that's why Jack wants you
in a safe house.

142
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:07,515
I can fend for myself.

143
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,920
But you're not just fending
for yourself.

144
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,272
You're fending for two.

145
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,803
And let's be honest, Syd.

146
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:16,467
Right now you waddle.

147
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,952
- I don't waddle.
- Oh, yes, you do.

148
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,082
I'll admit I may be a little less
graceful,

149
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,279
but I don't waddle.

150
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,807
You're right.

151
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,866
Actually, it's more of a teeter.

152
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,890
Hello, Sydney.

153
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,190
Mom.

154
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,007
You look beautiful.

155
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,610
I'm here now.

156
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,089
Everything is going to be fine.

157
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
Mom...

158
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,660
I am so glad you're here.

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,859
Believe me, there's no one else
I want to go through this with,

160
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:28,911
but...

161
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,722
it isn't safe.

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,469
- Sydney...
- No.

163
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,821
Mom, we're involved
in an investigation.

164
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,518
The C.I.A. Is everywhere.

165
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,404
- If they find out that you're even--
- I know about Prophet Five.

166
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:44,250
I know they abducted you.

167
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,387
That's the reason I've come.

168
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,593
They've been rumored
for over 30 years...

169
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,241
an organization so secret
most of us thought they were a myth.

170
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,611
Then six months ago,

171
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:02,729
a contact of mine told me
they'd become active again,

172
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:06,421
that after all this time
they'd finally found someone

173
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:11,016
who they believed could lead them
to what they'd been looking for.

174
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,894
The reason they came together--

175
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:16,807
to pursue something they call
"the Horizon."

176
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:23,683
You've never heard of it?

177
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,063
No.

178
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,603
Prophet Five believes you have.

179
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,923
They believe you know where it is.

180
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,540
What are you thinking?

181
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,460
When Prophet Five abducted me,

182
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,595
they tried to get me to reveal
information

183
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:46,394
about an old Alliance mission.

184
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,138
What was the mission?

185
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,733
Well, I don't know the details,

186
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:52,028
just the code name.

187
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,169
But dad is looking into it.

188
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,467
You told your father?

189
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,432
That's good.

190
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,237
How's Jack?

191
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:05,692
He's good.

192
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,139
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

193
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:13,552
I know.

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm so sorry.

195
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,190
It was an Alliance mission...

196
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,986
designation Leo 47 Norte.

197
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,592
"47 Norte," got it.

198
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,191
All Alliance files are backed up
on Langley's archives.

199
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:37,427
Can you do it without being traced
back to this office?

200
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:40,349
So Devlin can't find out about it?

201
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,844
Sure, I can use a proxy
to spoof the origin.

202
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,679
I love secret conspiracies.

203
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:52,454
You know, as long as
I'm a co-conspirator.

204
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:57,353
Okay, here it is.

205
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:01,012
Operation originating back in 1999,

206
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,982
coordinated by a Jean Bertrand.

207
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,817
Let me see if I can find him.

208
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:07,415
You know, back in high school,

209
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,174
we took apart
my calculus professor's car

210
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:10,723
and reassembled it in his classroom.

211
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,922
Actually, my friends did it.

212
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,904
I would have helped,
but they couldn't trust me.

213
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:16,240
Said I had loose lips, which is,
you know, ridiculous.

214
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:18,301
- Hey, Marshall.
- Uh, nothing!

215
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,571
We're not doing anything.

216
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:21,601
Yes?

217
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:23,919
The diagnostic on the server,
tell me when it's done.

218
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:24,993
You got it.

219
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,892
Thanks.

220
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,128
Good to see you, Tom.

221
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:29,517
That is unexpected.

222
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,646
I'll be there shortly.

223
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:33,801
Was that Syd?

224
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,372
Well, your voice-- it modulates a little
when you're talking to sydney.

225
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,570
Is everything okay?

226
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,318
What do you have on Bertrand?

227
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,514
Right. Secret.

228
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,969
Okay, latest intel
places Bertrand in Paris.

229
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,010
Okay, forward the intel to Dixon.
He's joining up with Renée.

230
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:53,111
Use tac-3.

231
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,396
I don't want it
going through A.P.O.'S servers.

232
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,441
Got it.

233
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
She still here?

234
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,910
Jack...

235
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,110
you look...

236
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,880
well.

237
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,856
I got your messages. I wanted to reply.

238
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,764
But I sensed it might be a C.I.A. trap.

239
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,490
Look at us,

240
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,245
about to become grandparents.

241
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,341
I'm doing my best to ignore that.

242
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,104
Did Sydney tell you?

243
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:42,671
I fear for her safety.

244
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:44,688
Yes, she did.

245
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:47,232
Did Dixon find out anything?

246
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,436
Not yet, but he's with a source now.

247
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,572
Bonsoir, Jean.

248
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:27,649
Thanks.

249
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:29,291
No, I'll take it from here.

250
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,052
That was Dixon.

251
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:32,910
He couldn't confirm what the Horizon is,

252
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,213
but we know
it's in a safe deposit box in Vancouver.

253
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,258
The Queen's bank.

254
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,900
We need to act fast.

255
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,982
Prophet Five has probably
figured out by now

256
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,732
I gave them the wrong information.

257
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,556
Yeah, that's a safe assumption.

258
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,750
We can't use A.P.O.

259
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,430
Devlin's men are everywhere.

260
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,096
If you're being watched, I can go.

261
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,296
I have contacts in Vancouver.

262
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:58,345
We'll go together,
retrieve the Horizon ourselves.

263
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,406
Can your contacts
make the travel arrangements?

264
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,465
Make 'em for three. I'm going, too.

265
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,534
I know what you're going to say.
You're worried about my safety.

266
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,373
It's a 3-hour flight, a bank.

267
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,197
- We'll be in and out.
- Sydney...

268
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,374
Listen, the Horizon is why
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

269
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,392
It's why they kidnapped me.

270
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:18,948
If we can get it before they do,
we can finish this thing, for good.

271
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,363
Make the arrangements.

272
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,110
Peyton!

273
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,043
We just got a message
from Irina Derevko.

274
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:38,494
The Horizon is in Vancouver.

275
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,377
She's on her way to retrieve it.

276
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,943
Assemble a team. We're going, too.

277
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:45,425
You question Derevko's loyalty?

278
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:49,495
No, I don't, but I'm not willing
to take the chance that I'm wrong,

279
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:51,343
now when we're this close.

280
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,431
Mr. And Mrs. Visconti,

281
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,152
my apologies but the bank is closing.

282
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,665
Perhaps we can find another time
to endow your grandchild's trust fund.

283
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,856
My daughter is never late.

284
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,524
It's that clown she married!

285
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,878
Of course, darling,
it's never our angel's fault.

286
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:18,935
Papa!

287
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:20,492
Mama. I'm sorry I'm late.

288
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,007
Sorry, sorry.

289
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:27,475
Where is Roberto?

290
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:29,095
He's not coming.

291
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:31,344
He says he doesn't want your money.

292
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:34,336
Papa,
it is his job to provide for our baby.

293
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:37,223
And how does he expect
to provide for my grandchild?

294
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:38,993
- He's a clown!
- He is an artist.

295
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,212
Brigitte, we agreed that the trust fund

296
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,000
would be a safety net
in case things don't work out.

297
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,670
But they will. We love each other.

298
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,007
Of course, the two of you will be
as happy as your father and I have been.

299
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,576
Let us do this for you.

300
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,577
Let us help.

301
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,075
Okay, for the baby.

302
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:03,875
Signore, we would be grateful if you
could assist us with the deposit now.

303
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:06,441
I'm sorry, but it's too late.

304
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:12,796
Here is a cashier's check
drawn on the trust account.

305
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,432
That is a very generous amount.

306
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,046
He said "no," my darling.

307
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:19,655
Bank Lissor is open until 6:00.

308
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,758
- Maybe if we hurry, we can...
- That won't be necessary.

309
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:28,239
It would be a privilege to help
you plan for your family's future.

310
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,913
I have a daughter myself.

311
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:34,031
Then you know that it's a parent's job
to take care of their children.

312
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:35,376
Mama...

313
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,286
Is now a good time for that rain check?

314
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,581
Yeah, sure. What's up?

315
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,521
I know about Alan Korman.

316
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:56,022
I know that you broke
into witsec to find him,

317
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,803
that he killed your wife.

318
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,798
Please promise me that you're not
going to do anything stupid,

319
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,711
that you're not going after him.

320
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,833
I already did.

321
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:11,503
I saw him last night.

322
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,265
I followed him to a parking garage.

323
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,960
I watched him get out of his car.

324
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,626
And then there he was.

325
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,388
I was 10 feet away from the man
that killed my wife.

326
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,491
Then I watched his wife
get out of the car

327
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,942
and their little son.

328
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:42,497
And I watched his life.

329
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,106
And then I just walked way.

330
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,807
I mean, killing him...

331
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:54,818
it's not going to bring back my wife.

332
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,759
No, it won't.

333
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:03,459
I should have told you about her.

334
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,548
I guess we just we get so comfortable...

335
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,990
keeping secrets around here.

336
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,406
And congratulations.

337
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,018
Thank you.

338
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,956
Papa, if Roberto finds out,
he'll be very angry.

339
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,957
Then it will be our family secret.

340
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,957
We'll find a place
to keep the trust documents safe.

341
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,341
Perhaps il Signore Moreau can help us.

342
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you have a safety deposit we can use?

343
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:36,893
Of course.

344
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,348
Everything all right, my dear?

345
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,459
Yes, it's just...

346
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,710
your grandchild keeps kicking me.

347
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,910
You had a very busy day.

348
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,636
Would you mind if our daughter
waited here?

349
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,083
Not at all.

350
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:51,626
If you'll follow me...

351
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:58,580
It's so sweet how your daughter
wants to please you.

352
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,131
She's our pride and joy.

353
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,054
I'm sure she'll be a wonderful parent

354
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:03,455
- to her own child.
- Thank you.

355
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,573
She has two such lovely role models.

356
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:13,831
Excuse me.

357
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:16,352
<i>Hey, Tom, I need your help.</i>

358
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,517
Hey, dad.

359
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,192
- What's going on?
- Backdoor into a secure database.

360
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,217
These are the files right here.

361
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,879
Yeah, I know.
Computers are tricky. You're right.

362
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,522
I'm going to put you on the phone with
our tech support. Her name's Rachel.

363
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,998
She'll be able to help you out. Hold on.

364
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:36,257
Hey, my dad's on the phone.
He kind of needs your help.

365
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:40,548
We've taken great pains to ensure
the security of this facility.

366
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:46,195
In fact, we pride ourselves on being
too careful with our clients' assets.

367
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,324
That's good to hear.

368
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,021
Rachel,
it looks like 512-bit encryption.

369
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:54,003
<i>I can open a port
if you need to run a program.</i>

370
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,301
That's okay. I think I got it.

371
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:00,910
What about emergency response?

372
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,632
If an alarm is tripped, how long before,
the authorities respond?

373
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,646
The building
has round-the-clock security.

374
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:10,823
Our drills place it at four minutes,
but to be honest,

375
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:12,358
it's never been activated.

376
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:13,459
Good.

377
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:15,436
Let's keep it that way.

378
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,011
Syd, we've got him.

379
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,143
<i>What's the box number?</i>

380
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,261
Wait. Hang on, dad.

381
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,239
Try this. 8438220.

382
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,769
Someday you have to show me
how you do that.

383
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,831
A magician never reveals her secrets.

384
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,947
- Be safe.
- Thanks.

385
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,974
Okay, dad, box 135.

386
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,433
I can't open it.

387
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:28,619
Why?

388
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,372
A countermeasure.
Looks like it's acid-based.

389
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,200
- Can you disable it?
- Not without the combination.

390
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,083
It'll destroy the contents.

391
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:38,951
I'll have to take it back to Marshall.
He'll be able to...

392
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:41,824
Peyton's here.

393
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,075
Talk fast!

394
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:50,724
They're here as backup.

395
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,863
You're working for them, aren't you?

396
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,183
Answer me!

397
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,509
That was you... on the ship.

398
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:01,922
Wasn't it?

399
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:04,439
Behind the glass.

400
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,899
You orchestrated the whole thing...

401
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:09,415
because you wanted this.

402
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,847
And when...

403
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,595
when you couldn't torture it out of me,

404
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:16,243
you came to me as my mother.

405
00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:18,724
I am your mother.

406
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:23,362
Call off your team right now.

407
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:25,631
- They're not my team.
- I don't believe you.

408
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,484
- Dad...
- You need to believe me.

409
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,969
'Cause if Peyton's here,
she's here to kill me, too.

410
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,309
She's going to be very disappointed,
because I'm about to beat her to it.

411
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:36,226
I thought I killed you once.

412
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,472
This time I'll be more thorough.

413
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:39,473
Hey, dad!

414
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,342
The baby's coming.

415
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,781
We have a problem.

416
00:23:56,597 --> 00:23:58,762
Devlin's men
are accessing our server logs.

417
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:00,968
They believe there's a mole
within A.P.O.

418
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:03,717
responsible for leaking
information to Prophet Five.

419
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,259
You think they're right?

420
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:08,162
No, I don't.

421
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:12,346
However, Sydney and Jack
are in the field without clearance.

422
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:13,817
I've been assisting them.

423
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:14,783
So have I.

424
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,054
Yes, I know.

425
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:19,762
I've already tried purging
the logs myself,

426
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:21,243
but the files are read-only.

427
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,033
I can do it.

428
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,972
I can crack the logs
and delete the entries,

429
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:29,031
make it untraceable,
but it will take a little time.

430
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:30,755
Then get to it right now.

431
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,470
You should sit.

432
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,101
Look, we need to get out of here.

433
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,516
What's their approach?

434
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:40,787
What?

435
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,164
Their plan, what is it?
How are they going to attack us?

436
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:46,185
I don't know. I already told you,
this wasn't part of my operation.

437
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:49,651
You want to escape?

438
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,710
Give me the Horizon.

439
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,050
- I'll tell them you're already gone.
- That isn't going to happen.

440
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:57,190
Jack, don't be stubborn.
The baby's coming.

441
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,956
I'm trying to help.

442
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,245
I'm giving you a way out.

443
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:15,961
Okay, I'm in.

444
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:18,138
We've got control of their system.

445
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:19,273
Can you see them?

446
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:21,921
The bank
has its own dedicated security feed.

447
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:24,337
If they enter any of the stairwells,
I'll see them.

448
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,981
Lock down the building. We're going up.

449
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,045
How were you going to do it?

450
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:33,207
Once you took the Horizon,
what was your extraction?

451
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,947
Look, they're coming!

452
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,381
How were you going to get away from us?

453
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,268
There's a helicopter.
It's waiting for my signal.

454
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,144
Does Prophet Five know about it?

455
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:50,958
The elevators will all be grounded.
It's four flights of stairs to the roof.

456
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,024
I can make it.

457
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:53,777
Move!

458
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:56,744
Peyton, I've got a visual.

459
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:57,773
Go ahead.

460
00:25:57,902 --> 00:26:00,839
They've just entered the main stairwell,
15th floor.

461
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,487
But they're not coming down.

462
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,143
<i>They're heading up.</i>

463
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,589
The helipad...

464
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,586
redirect those cameras
to exterior surveillance.

465
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:11,722
<i>I'm going to keep going.
I'm six floors behind.</i>

466
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:15,329
What's the signal to the helicopter?

467
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:16,588
A beacon.

468
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:19,151
It's in my bra.

469
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:25,776
Keep moving.

470
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,330
We're almost there.

471
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:47,713
I've got a chopper approaching inbound
from the northwest.

472
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:48,714
Damn!

473
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Out here.

474
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:15,915
Quickly!

475
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:46,947
This building has to have
a freight elevator.

476
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:49,013
- Sydney...
- If we hot-wire a junction box,

477
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,729
we might be able to restore
emergency power to one of the cars.

478
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:53,630
Even if we could,
they'll be waiting for us

479
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:56,081
- as soon as we override the elevator.
- We have to try.

480
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:58,568
We need to set up a defensive position.

481
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,971
I'm not interested in your opinion.

482
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:02,663
She's right.

483
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:05,013
Even if we could outflank them
down the stairwell,

484
00:28:05,014 --> 00:28:05,974
you wouldn't make it.

485
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,320
Here,

486
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,363
cover your mother.

487
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,085
I'll go down and take care
of Peyton and her men.

488
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,404
I'll be right back.

489
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,042
Whatever happens,
keep that pointed at your mother.

490
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:18,278
If she even blinks...

491
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:19,544
I'll shoot her.

492
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:23,414
Okay, I'm in.

493
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,880
- The logs are online.
- Have they found anything yet?

494
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:29,064
No, they're still working
on the tasking logs.

495
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:30,965
I'm going to start
with the comm entries.

496
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:31,810
Here we go.

497
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,495
This is Sydney's communication
from Vancouver.

498
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:37,782
And Paris,
this is Dixon's pbx communication.

499
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,108
Okay, I think that's it.

500
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:41,244
- Nothing else looks...
- No, there's one more.

501
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:43,944
I had to pull satellite imagery
for the building in Vancouver.

502
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:45,350
We'll have to delete that as well.

503
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:48,909
Time stamp should be somewhere
between midnight and 2:00am.

504
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,175
There.

505
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,856
"Tindle" isn't your log-in name.

506
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:56,798
No. My network account timed out.

507
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,736
I had to create a temporary one.

508
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,288
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean?

509
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:04,946
They're on the same page of entries.

510
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:07,477
That's them now.
If we delete this one, they'll see it.

511
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:16,702
- Devlin.
- It's me.

512
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,291
It seems you don't have
the latest server logs.

513
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,703
What's the time stamp
on your last entry?

514
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,681
Scroll to the end of the list.

515
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:30,015
10:37 this morning.

516
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:34,761
Okay, it matches up.

517
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:36,751
Sorry about the interruption.

518
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,233
Good work.

519
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,898
"The truth takes time."

520
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,805
That's what you said years ago.

521
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,461
Is this what you meant?

522
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:00,579
You like it to be simple.

523
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,580
It's never simple.

524
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,019
Did you put out the order
to kill Vaughn?

525
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:26,737
I'd known about his investigation
for a long time.

526
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,117
In sovogda I tried to warn him.

527
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,389
He didn't take my advice.

528
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:35,357
I fell for you.

529
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:38,625
Even dad fell for you.

530
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,061
But Vaughn never trusted you.

531
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:10,726
This is Alpha team. We're on 16.

532
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,511
We have a possible target.

533
00:31:12,982 --> 00:31:13,982
Copy that.

534
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:42,813
Alpha team, report.

535
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,418
Alpha team, do you copy?

536
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,366
Barker, where are you?

537
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,675
I just swept 17. Moving on to 18.

538
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Roger.

539
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,895
Finish up there and report in.

540
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,818
Exhale through your mouth.

541
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,868
- I'm only offering advice.
- Don't!

542
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,882
I know why you saved my pregnancy.

543
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,684
You want my baby, and I don't know why.

544
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,052
Frankly, I don't care.

545
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,759
I just want you to leave us alone.

546
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,329
You should know something, Sydney.

547
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,153
I never wanted to have a child.

548
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:32,246
The K.G.B. demanded it.

549
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,919
They knew it would ensure
your father's allegiance to me.

550
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:41,285
You were simply a means to an end.

551
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,075
And then when the doctor
put you in my arms,

552
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:48,150
and I looked at you,

553
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:51,807
so fragile,

554
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:55,733
all I could think was,

555
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:58,633
"how could I have made
such a terrible mistake?"

556
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,418
And at that moment,
I was sure of one thing.

557
00:33:04,643 --> 00:33:06,760
I couldn't be an agent and a mother.

558
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,397
I'd rather fail at one or both.

559
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:16,403
And I chose to fail at being a mother.

560
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:22,731
Give me the gun.

561
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,596
Syd, they're coming.

562
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:46,908
In time you'll learn

563
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:48,988
you can't do both.

564
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:50,546
Watch me.

565
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,064
The only reason I saved the baby
is because you're my daughter.

566
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:15,126
Now do exactly as I tell you.

567
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,604
Get in that chair.

568
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,181
This really is no place for you,
grandpa.

569
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,612
By the way, where's Sydney registered?

570
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,660
I'd love to get her a gift for the baby.

571
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,837
Sydney, don't push!

572
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:30,325
God, mom, I have to!

573
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,414
No, listen to me!

574
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,967
Don't push.

575
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,226
I know you want to,

576
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:38,292
but you can't.

577
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:39,883
Sydney, listen to me.

578
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,510
The baby is coming out backward.

579
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,886
What does that mean?

580
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,098
What is it?

581
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,567
Her muscles are locked.
She needs to relax.

582
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,721
The baby needs oxygen
if it doesn't come out right now.

583
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:53,837
Squeeze my hand.

584
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:56,020
This is important.

585
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,639
As hard as you can.

586
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,586
- Dad!
- Just keep breathing.

587
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:01,774
Breathe.

588
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:03,769
Okay, good.

589
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,012
In and out.

590
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:07,906
Okay, now again.

591
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:09,782
Look at me.

592
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:12,972
You can do this.

593
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,914
I can't, dad. I can't!

594
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:17,839
Yes, you can.

595
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:20,204
I don't want to do this here!

596
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:22,577
That's okay.
Tell me where you want to be.

597
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:24,373
I'm scared.

598
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,771
I know. That's why we're here
to take care of you.

599
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,725
Now tell me where you want to be.

600
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,972
I want to be on a beach.

601
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:32,054
That's good, okay.

602
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:33,437
Just go there.

603
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:34,857
Now tell me about it.

604
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:37,991
Vaughn is with me.

605
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:40,728
Vaughn is there, with you on the beach.

606
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:42,436
Good.

607
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:43,739
Vaughn is with you.

608
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:45,248
I miss him.

609
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:46,623
I know.

610
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:49,343
I know you do, sweetheart.

611
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,310
It's okay.

612
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:52,734
You're gonna be okay.

613
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:54,537
Okay now, Sydney, push.

614
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,473
Sydney, you can do this.

615
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,656
Now, again.

616
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,247
Push.

617
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:04,459
Sydney, as hard as you can!

618
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:08,619
Good!

619
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,102
You have a baby girl.

620
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,510
- She took the satchel.
- I know.

621
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,866
We'll find her.

622
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:50,942
Sweetie...

623
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:56,618
She's so beautiful.

624
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:07,613
<i>Listen to me very carefully,
Marshall.</i>

625
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,921
<i>Jack and Sydney are in Vancouver,
Queen's bank.</i>

626
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,505
<i>They need extraction.</i>

627
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:16,090
Okay, is this who I think it is?

628
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:19,752
Tell the team they'll need diapers.

629
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,939
I just spoke to Dixon.

630
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,549
He's in contact
with Europol and the S.V.R.

631
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,082
So far, nothing.

632
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:41,558
We'll find her, Sydney.

633
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,928
Would you like
to hold your granddaughter?

634
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:53,021
Yes, I would.

635
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,114
She has Vaughn's eyes.

636
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,116
Yeah, she does.

637
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,542
Dad...

638
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:29,593
I'll take care of it.

639
