1
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:02,311
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:03,687
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:08,196
Where the hell is my father?

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,290
Not a problem.
My loyalties are flexible.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,586
You got married.

6
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:21,081
I did.

7
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:24,379
You want to know how I am?
I am horrible!

8
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,463
Not because I lost you,

9
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:33,804
but because if it had been me,
I would have waited.

10
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,518
I chose to give information
to the CIA,

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,481
with which they were able
to dismantle

12
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,691
over two dozen terrorist cells.

13
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,194
I don't know how you convinced
the CIA that you're trustworthy.

14
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:47,616
Andrian Lazarey,
Russian diplomat.

15
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,909
I've never seen him before.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,997
This was from a hidden camera
that I placed.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,748
This is how I knew
you were alive.

18
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:02,711
No!

19
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,888
Okay, Sydney, the test is over.

20
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:43,025
If you were under the influence

21
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:46,229
of any valid brainwashing
technique, I'd know it.

22
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,148
As for your memory loss,
some forms of torture,

23
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,447
electroconvulsive shock therapy,
for example, can cause amnesia.

24
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:55,446
He was unarmed.

25
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,697
Dad, I slit that man's throat.

26
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,617
Your remorse is premature.

27
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,168
Without knowing
the circumstances,

28
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:03,079
you can't be sure
you didn't have just cause.

29
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:05,164
I know you don't want
the CIA to see this tape

30
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,830
to protect me,
but maybe they should.

31
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,301
They'll detain you indefinitely.

32
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,177
If they learn
you murdered Lazarey,

33
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:14,513
you won't be able to participate
in finding what happened to you,

34
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,974
which I need you for.

35
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,431
I don't trust myself
right now, Dad.

36
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,477
Maybe the CIA shouldn't, either.

37
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,437
Well, I trust you.

38
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,810
I'll keep looking into Lazarey.

39
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:30,354
Your mother may be helpful,
assuming she's still alive.

40
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,693
I haven't spoken to her
for a year,

41
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:33,859
but we established a protocol
for making contact.

42
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,446
I'll try and reach her.

43
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:40,199
For now, you deserve to get on
with your life.

44
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:49,664
Why does lifting heavy objects
mean I need one of those beers?

45
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,135
Chop-chop.

46
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,090
Maybe because you're
a slave to advertising.

47
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:56,507
Thank you.

48
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,304
Hey, was that a smile?

49
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,061
It's nice to see that again.

50
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:04,856
Yeah.

51
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,438
You sure you're okay with this?

52
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,695
I mean, you gonna be alright
living by yourself?

53
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,533
I just can't wrap my head
around it.

54
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:16,409
Francie's been dead
for two years,

55
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:19,531
but I feel like I saw her
a few days ago.

56
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,657
And now that Will
is in witness protection,

57
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,543
I can't even contact him.

58
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,954
All my friends are just gone.

59
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,336
Not all your friends.

60
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,347
This place isn't so bad.

61
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,844
Oh, come on.

62
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:43,553
Two blocks from the beach.
Are you kidding me?

63
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,850
And you got me as a neighbour.
Trust me, you're set.

64
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,685
Can I ask you something?

65
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,185
Yeah.

66
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,153
Vaughn's wife.

67
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,034
What's she like?

68
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:07,413
I don't know if you
really want to hear this.

69
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:14,340
When Vaughn heard
that you were dead, Syd, he...

70
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,594
he dropped off
the face of the Earth.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,795
I mean, literally, Syd.

72
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,515
He was out of the country

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,850
for six months,
and you need to know

74
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:27,388
that he wasn't cavalier
about moving on.

75
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,564
I could barely even convince him
to consider coming back.

76
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,734
He's thinking about coming back?

77
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,156
Well, don't worry about that,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

78
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,615
Because of me,
because I came back, right?

79
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,746
Weiss.
Yeah.

80
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,292
Got it.
We'll be right there.

81
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,384
At 1300 U.T.C., two agents of
the Central Intelligence Agency

82
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,682
were abducted in Berlin.

83
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,471
We claim responsibility
for this act of aggression

84
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,436
against the world's
remaining superpower.

85
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,196
Who we are is unimportant.

86
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:21,323
What we represent
is unimportant.

87
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:25,282
What we want is to be heard.

88
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,500
Within this audio file
are coordinates

89
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:33,296
Ieading to a designated
location.

90
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,255
Go there.
Retrieve the package.

91
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,583
Follow our demands.

92
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,469
The two agents,
Klein and Rotter,

93
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:42,127
were working undercover for us
at Leizig Aerospace.

94
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:45,639
We believe they were abducted by
a group known as The Covenant,

95
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:48,218
a loose affiliation
of Russian nationalists

96
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:50,602
comprised of former
Central Committee members

97
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,232
and retired KGB.

98
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:54,108
Though we know little
about them,

99
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:57,313
The Covenant seems to function
like an organised crime family.

100
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,520
Now, the pickup location

101
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:00,857
The Covenant specified
is a theatre in Munich

102
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,575
in the red light district.

103
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,368
Actually, it's an adult theatre.

104
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,363
I checked,
and today's feature...

105
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:08,698
A rough translation,
I don't speak German.

106
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:12,077
It's "Penile Code Part Deux."

107
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,913
If anybody cares,
I have the times.

108
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,208
I don't like sending someone
in alone to pick up the package.

109
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,008
It's doubtful they'd betray us.

110
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:22,011
Breaking their own rules before
we even know their demands

111
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:25,382
would result in a loss
of negotiating credibility.

112
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,886
I'll go.

113
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:29,052
I want to.

114
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,262
Run the op-tech with Marshall.

115
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:33,981
That's it.

116
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,944
Syd, stay a minute.

117
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,697
I'd rather send Weiss.

118
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,207
You're allowed time before
you jump back in with both feet.

119
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,794
The best way I can start feeling
normal is to act that way.

120
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:58,292
Dixon, I need this.

121
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:01,218
I'm allowing you to go,
but you should know

122
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,176
you're not the only
CIA operative

123
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,006
who's experienced lost time.

124
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:08,470
There's a group.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,347
Their next meeting's
at the end of the week.

126
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:29,528
I'm in the theatre.

127
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,366
We got you on fly-by,
Mountaineer.

128
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,000
Perimeter's clear.
No suspect signals.

129
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,282
We're on standby.

130
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,864
It's a box.
I'm sweeping it for explosives.

131
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,743
It's clean.
I'm gonna open it up.

132
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,288
Proceed with caution,
Mountaineer.

133
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,099
Oh, God.

134
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,104
What is it?

135
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:47,282
One of the agents.

136
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,703
Klein.

137
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,579
It's his head.

138
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,578
There's a piece of paper
wedged in his mouth.

139
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,208
Give me a sec.

140
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,461
It's written in Russian.

141
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,380
I have their list of demands.

142
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,296
The death of Peter Klein
is a great loss to this agency.

143
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:53,342
But keep in mind
his colleague is still alive,

144
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,591
and it's our job
to bring him home.

145
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,176
National Security Council
Director Robert Lindsey

146
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,394
will be coordinating with us.

147
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,309
As some of you already know,

148
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,686
The Covenant has agreed
to return our remaining agent

149
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,317
in exchange for the release
of Mr. Sark.

150
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,941
And I'm here to inform you
trading Sark for your asset

151
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,743
has been authorised by the NSC.

152
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:16,913
Wait a minute.
We can't just let him go.

153
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:19,620
To the best of our knowledge,
Sark's been bled dry

154
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:20,907
of every piece of intel
he knows.

155
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:23,291
The burden of criminal
justice notwithstanding,

156
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,502
he now has a value
only as a commodity in trade.

157
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,544
Without knowing why they want
Sark, how can we consider this?

158
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:32,502
We think we know why they want
him, so they can kill him.

159
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:34,257
Intelligence provided
by Arvin Sloane

160
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,721
indicates Sark may be
responsible for the death

161
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,220
of a high-ranking member
within The Covenant.

162
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,592
They may want revenge.

163
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,056
If your revenge theory is wrong,
we're setting a terrorist free.

164
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,145
To say nothing of the fact

165
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:47,104
that taking Arvin Sloane's intel
at face value is insane.

166
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,104
I'm aware of your history
with Sloane,

167
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,317
but if Director Dixon can trust
him, I think you can, too.

168
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,318
For the record, I don't.

169
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:56,317
I never will.

170
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,909
But I can't deny that despite
my feelings for Sloane,

171
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,122
he has provided us
with accurate intelligence

172
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,499
for over a year now.

173
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,039
I'm authorising the trade.

174
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,465
You and Weiss will escort Sark
to the exchange point in Mexico.

175
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,710
You'll leave in four hours.

176
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:14,964
Welcome back.

177
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:17,967
Since when did the NSC
become eager

178
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,470
to negotiate with terrorists?

179
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,553
Bob Lindsey has the White House
spin machine ready

180
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:23,437
to cover him if his actions
prove ill-advised.

181
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,563
- He's untouchable.
- I'd love to prove that wrong.

182
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,975
You've come close enough
in forcing my release.

183
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,896
While you're in Mexico
making the exchange,

184
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:31,316
I'm going to Zurich
to see Sloane.

185
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,775
He'll be expecting me, and
we should appear predictable.

186
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,454
I'll have that adjusted.

187
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,924
Where was I buried?

188
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,262
You were cremated.

189
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:01,101
Vaughn spread your ashes at sea.

190
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,735
So, if you guys didn't
understand what I said,

191
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:15,697
good luck on the quiz.

192
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,964
You're a French teacher?

193
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,726
Yeah.

194
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:50,145
I know that you're thinking
about coming back to the agency.

195
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:53,440
On the off chance
that your hesitation

196
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,531
is out of some courtesy
to me, I...

197
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:00,235
You can forget about it.

198
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:06,454
I mean, I can handle you being
there, so don't worry about me.

199
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:18,878
The other day you said I gave up
because I didn't have faith.

200
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,929
That somehow you didn't mean
enough to me.

201
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:25,220
- When I said that, I was...
- No, let me finish.

202
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,017
After you died,

203
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:34,485
I used to talk to you
like you were still around.

204
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:41,074
Literally out loud, whole
conversations about nothing.

205
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:42,953
The weather.

206
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,114
Should I get a new car?

207
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,742
Should I have another drink?

208
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:53,791
Then, one day,
you started answering.

209
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,590
I mean, I could hear you
in my head

210
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,382
Iike you were
right next to me, Sydney.

211
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,132
And although I knew I was a guy

212
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:08,262
who stayed up nights drinking,
talking to his dead girlfriend,

213
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,846
still I couldn't stop.

214
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,775
So before you tell me

215
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,776
you can handle
my coming back to the CIA,

216
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,151
there are two things
you need to know.

217
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:27,369
First is that I was so in love
with you, it nearly killed me.

218
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,910
And second...

219
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,794
...that I don't regret
moving on with my life.

220
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,925
The president of the World Bank

221
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,426
asked that you stop
by his table.

222
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,758
We received word
that he's willing to make

223
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,853
a sizeable contribution
to our cancer research.

224
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,516
His wife is a vegetarian,

225
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,810
so make sure
that she's attended to.

226
00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:58,695
Yeah?

227
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:04,194
Send him in.

228
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,157
I need you to excuse me.

229
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,378
A world relief organisation.

230
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:23,174
The sheer audacity
of your alleged turnaround

231
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:25,421
would be laughable
if you weren't so dangerous.

232
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:29,382
I was wondering when
you'd come to see me, Jack.

233
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:34,687
You don't really expect me
to believe you've changed.

234
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:39,445
I expect you to trust in the
consistency of my obsessions.

235
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:41,736
Jack, I pursued
the Rambaldi puzzle

236
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,981
across the world
for over 30 years.

237
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:47,990
It never occurred to me once
the artefacts were assembled,

238
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,666
that they would produce nothing
more than a message of peace.

239
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:58,335
Personally, I would have
found it anticlimactic.

240
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:01,175
That after expecting to assemble
a weapon of ultimate power,

241
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,884
you ended up with a revelation

242
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:06,504
you could have acquired
from a fortune cookie.

243
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,047
Always the atheist, Jack.

244
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,852
I've missed you.

245
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,938
I'll come to the point.

246
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:20,064
I believe you're responsible
for Sydney's disappearance.

247
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,609
Tell me why right now

248
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:24,939
and give her the peace of mind
she deserves.

249
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,405
In exchange,
I'll halt my efforts

250
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,285
to invalidate
your pardon agreement.

251
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:32,656
Jack, don't go digging.
You won't find anything.

252
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,038
I know you were imprisoned
for making contact

253
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,455
with your ex-wife.

254
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:39,379
You went to Irina Derevko
for help to find Sydney.

255
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:42,880
I wouldn't have believed
that you would ally yourself

256
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:46,799
with a woman whom you vowed
never to trust again.

257
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:51,182
So, if you're capable of having
such a change of heart,

258
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:55,016
why is it so hard
to believe that I am as well?

259
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,607
Because every morally
questionable thing

260
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,728
I've ever done
has been to protect Sydney.

261
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,729
You don't have the same excuse.

262
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,482
Really?

263
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,292
I investigated
Sydney's death, too.

264
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:21,877
This file contains
all the leads I pursued.

265
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,547
Mostly dead ends.

266
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:29,927
I'm hoping you will find
something in it that's useful.

267
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:35,222
I trust that you will look at it
before you dismiss it outright.

268
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,562
Should I take this
as your denial of involvement

269
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:43,976
in Sydney's disappearance?

270
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,362
Then you've made
the worst mistake of your life,

271
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:52,570
because I'm going to bury you.

272
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,308
Mr. Sark, I wanted a word
before you get traded.

273
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,137
Dear God.

274
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:20,521
It can't possibly be you.

275
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:24,391
Don't start this conversation
by acting surprised I'm alive.

276
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:27,902
Sydney, you know how highly
I regard your abilities

277
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,278
as an operative,
but even I didn't think

278
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,777
you were capable
of cheating death

279
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,441
once your remains
had been identified.

280
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:36,660
Which begs the question.

281
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,702
If it wasn't your body
they removed from the ashes,

282
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,702
whose was it?

283
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:45,128
I read the transcripts
of your confessions.

284
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:49,128
Including the fact that you
and a woman named Allison Doren

285
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:53,263
killed my friend Francie.

286
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:57,096
If you read my transcript, you
know how cooperative I've been.

287
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:59,311
I'll be glad to pay you
the same courtesy

288
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:02,350
if you simply tell me
what you're getting at.

289
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,397
That explosion in my apartment

290
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,568
was a cover-up to make the CIA
believe I was dead.

291
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,777
What I believe
is that Sloane abducted me.

292
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,524
I think you know why,

293
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,905
but you failed to mention that
in your confession.

294
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,200
If I am to understand
what you're saying,

295
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:21,578
you have no idea where you've
been for the last two years.

296
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,204
None?

297
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,798
Unbelievable.

298
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,503
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.

299
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:35,513
I'm just...
I'm speechless.

300
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:38,172
Sydney, if Sloane
had intended to abduct you,

301
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,723
I wasn't privy to it.

302
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,314
What if I said
I still don't believe you?

303
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,641
I'd say it'd make no difference.

304
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:51,942
In 24 hours, I'll be free,
and you'll remain in the dark.

305
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:57,155
See you in Mexico.

306
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:14,129
We've agreed to a location
in the Sonora Desert

307
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,928
as the point of exchange.

308
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,762
Each side is allowed
no more than a 5-man cover team.

309
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:21,760
Once the exchange is initiated,

310
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:25,637
Sark and Rotter will be
released simultaneously.

311
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:33,816
I assure you, this organisation,
The Covenant,

312
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:37,073
is as much a mystery to me
as it is to the CIA.

313
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,236
I can't imagine
why they'd want to trade.

314
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:41,701
You're about to find out.

315
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,491
My life's in danger, isn't it?

316
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,275
Base Ops, we received
a call signal.

317
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,618
- Should I confirm?
- You're authorised, Mountaineer.

318
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:30,289
Let's go.

319
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,758
We have a visual
on Agent Rotter.

320
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,631
Roger, Mountaineer.
Release the prisoner.

321
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,017
You're up.

322
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:13,415
We have incoming vehicles.
I'll need an ident immediately.

323
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:16,507
They're not ours, Mountaineer.
We're trying to get a visual.

324
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:18,502
If we don't finish this by the
time those vehicles get here,

325
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:21,133
The Covenant will
think it's a double cross.

326
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:30,017
There's a chopper inbound.
It's one of ours.

327
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:35,644
CIA operatives, this is
Sergeant Trask of Delta Force.

328
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,361
Put down your weapons.

329
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:39,404
This operation
has been countermanded

330
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:43,073
by order of
the National Security Council.

331
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,952
Take cover!

332
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:55,036
Sydney, report.

333
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,958
Delta Force showed up
out of nowhere!

334
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,544
Lindsey ambushed us!

335
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:01,340
Get me Bob Lindsey now!

336
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,180
Don't tell me to calm down.
You used my agents as bait.

337
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:13,308
I'm trying to reacquire your
agent without releasing Sark.

338
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,942
I'm sorry I didn't fill you in,

339
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:17,434
but I don't trust the CIA
to maintain secrecy.

340
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,691
You son of a bitch!

341
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,983
Yeah, can I get back to you?
I'm a little busy.

342
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,248
We're hit!
Loss in pressure!

343
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:50,266
Both of you!
Get in!

344
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:51,634
Come!

345
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,141
San'ko's getting away
with both of them!

346
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,966
Son of a bitch!

347
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,598
We should have gotten
that last hostage back.

348
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,559
Who the hell
do you think you are?

349
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,437
I'm gonna hold you accountable
if they kill him!

350
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:36,729
You're going to hold
me accountable?

351
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:38,560
What exactly
is the purpose of this?

352
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,609
To let you know
I will take you to the mat

353
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,273
every time you pull
something like this.

354
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:44,901
I am not impressed by the fact
you golf with the President.

355
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,482
What you did was moronic
and borderline criminal.

356
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:50,697
I am the director of
the National Security Council.

357
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:54,288
I can have you thrown in the
same cell your father vacated!

358
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:56,036
- Hell, it's still warm.
- Do it.

359
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,453
Give me an object lesson
in the abuse of power.

360
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,539
Show me how it's done.

361
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:04,499
If you're finished,
this is the men's room.

362
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,717
Who let you in?

363
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:22,312
Chateau Petrus.
1982.

364
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:23,732
Your favourite, no?

365
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,192
Have we met?

366
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:33,119
No, but you knew my brother,
Antony San'ko.

367
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,039
And I suppose this is
to be my last drink.

368
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,116
No.

369
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:41,418
Not necessarily.

370
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:43,629
I know the bomb you placed
in that vehicle

371
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:46,386
was not meant for him.

372
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,673
On the other hand,
it does seem that you owe me.

373
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:56,013
And what would that price be?

374
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:01,472
$800 million.

375
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:05,400
$800 million?

376
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:11,492
I have nowhere near
that amount in my nest egg.

377
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:16,324
In fact, Mr. Sark, you do.

378
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:40,392
Sydney, Vaughn's qualified
for reinstatement.

379
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:43,851
Until his field rating's
updated, he'll be on analysis,

380
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,980
but he's back,
effective immediately.

381
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,898
If there are
special considerations

382
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,742
either of you would like me
to take into account,

383
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,068
now's the time to speak up.

384
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:57,576
Welcome back.

385
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,243
Thanks.

386
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:01,782
Good.

387
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:04,669
Hello, Jack.

388
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,669
I found out why The Covenant
is interested in Sark.

389
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,875
At 10.00 this morning,

390
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:12,970
Sark walked into
the Thornton Bank and Trust

391
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:15,214
in the Cayman Islands
accompanied by Ushek San'ko,

392
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:17,929
a known operative
of The Covenant.

393
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:22,557
He was then led downstairs,
where he used his thumbprint

394
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:25,400
to access an executive vault.

395
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:30,146
Inside the vault
was a little over $800 million

396
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,149
in gold bullion.

397
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,777
More surprising
is that Sark had no idea

398
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:37,325
he was entitled to that money.

399
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:38,196
Entitled?

400
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,570
Eight months ago,

401
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,418
an interagency memorandum
reported the murder

402
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:45,456
of a Russian diplomat
by the name of Andrian Lazarey.

403
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,623
His murderer
has never been found.

404
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:50,123
However, a source of mine
has provided evidence

405
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,796
indicating he was a descendant

406
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,294
of the Romanov royal family
in Russia.

407
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:57,058
The money was in his trust
when he died.

408
00:28:57,142 --> 00:29:01,519
It went to Mr. Sark,
Lazarey's son.

409
00:29:05,358 --> 00:29:07,066
We tasked the satellite
to track the sedan

410
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,314
once it left the desert.

411
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,027
They were tracked
to a Frankfurt nightclub

412
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,070
known for selling
synthetic drugs.

413
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,817
Analysis thinks
it's a front for The Covenant.

414
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:16,779
Do we have reason to believe
the last hostage is still alive?

415
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,280
Yes, they're aware
he's the team leader

416
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,411
and has the highest
security clearance.

417
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:22,242
The information
they could extract

418
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,709
would be priceless
to our enemies.

419
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:26,367
His name is Otto Edel,
drug dealer.

420
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:27,411
He runs the club.

421
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:30,127
He'll know where
our agent's being held.

422
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:33,170
I want you to accompany
the hostage rescue team.

423
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:34,969
Actually, I had an idea.

424
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,261
Syd should go in
as a biochem major.

425
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:39,425
Harvard dropout,
totally spoiled.

426
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:42,091
Maybe she got kicked out because
she was synthesizing ecstasy

427
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:44,345
in her dorm room,
or maybe crystal, crank...

428
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,847
Fine.
Marshall, run the op-tech.

429
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:52,194
The CIA would have discovered
Lazarey's connection to Sark.

430
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,364
There was no added risk to you
in breaking the news myself.

431
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,941
Without that tape, the CIA
can't link you to his death.

432
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,744
This can't be a coincidence.

433
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,205
I'm responsible
for Lazarey's death,

434
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:03,163
and nine months later
The Covenant gets Sark released

435
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,164
in exchange for
his $800 million inheritance?

436
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:11,173
It's looking more likely they're
responsible for your absence.

437
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:14,424
Be it under duress
or by some other unknown means,

438
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:17,428
they compelled you to carry out
the assassination.

439
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,637
I'm scheduled to contact
your mother tonight.

440
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:22,013
Hopefully,
she'll be some help.

441
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,245
That's for him.

442
00:32:24,516 --> 00:32:28,644
You are very attractive
for a chemist.

443
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,970
Thank you for meeting with me.

444
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,438
I like to keep my options open,

445
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:38,103
although I doubt you can improve
on my little cocktail.

446
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:40,817
I can triple your sales.

447
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,196
Really?
How?

448
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:46,451
By making your drug
more addictive.

449
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:55,912
Take a look.

450
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,600
Very impressive.

451
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,513
Where did you learn your trade?

452
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,597
I was a biochem major
at Harvard,

453
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,481
not that they'll be asking me
to make

454
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:18,188
any commencement speeches
in the near future.

455
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:21,065
Their loss, my gain.

456
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:22,864
I need one litre
of your product.

457
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:25,867
Oh, just like that?

458
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:28,525
I'll chemically alter it
according to the specs you saw

459
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:30,281
and have it to you
within the week.

460
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:33,956
If you don't see demand go up,
you owe me nothing.

461
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:39,168
Somehow I would not mind
being indebted to you.

462
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:43,461
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

463
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:45,878
I will only be a moment.

464
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,149
This has a street value
of $50,000.

465
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,607
- Mind if I try it?
- Be my guest.

466
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:10,453
Of course, if I am going to let
you walk out of here with that,

467
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:14,203
I will need
some sort of collateral.

468
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,083
You understand.

469
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,494
I didn't bring any money.

470
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:25,085
I do accept
other forms of payment.

471
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,390
You've got an air bubble
in there.

472
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:34,717
Do exactly as I say,
or I push the plunger.

473
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:37,268
Where's the alarm terminal
that protects the subbasement?

474
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:38,021
Bitch!

475
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:40,349
Tell me where it is,
or you get an aneurysm.

476
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:43,230
Okay, down the hall.
First door.

477
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,981
But I only manage the facility.

478
00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:47,611
I do not know the codes.
I swear.

479
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:55,996
Mountaineer to Base Ops,
I found the alarm terminal.

480
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:57,247
I'll need a minute to hack.

481
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:58,877
Copy that, Mountaineer.
Blue team.

482
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:01,168
Do not breach until advised.
Alarm is active.

483
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:03,462
Copy, Base Ops. We're holding
outside rear entrance.

484
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,504
Once Mountaineer disables
the alarm, we'll proceed inside.

485
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,053
Copy that.

486
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,591
Mountaineer, your entrance
to the sublevel

487
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:16,639
will be through the last door
down on the north hallway.

488
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,102
Marshall, why does this cabling
run to the control room?

489
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,108
Looks like some sort
of filtration system.

490
00:35:23,611 --> 00:35:25,271
I've got the code.
I'm entering it now.

491
00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:26,526
What could it be used for?

492
00:35:26,614 --> 00:35:29,948
Could be a halon-based
fire-suppression system.

493
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:31,826
Sydney, stop!
You've got the wrong code.

494
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,237
The alarm will be triggered
by that sequence.

495
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,122
Remember the security system
in Nepal?

496
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:37,867
It's the same system.

497
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,533
Those numbers can be converted
into a password.

498
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,870
Read me the sequence.
Give me a pen.

499
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,380
746F70686174.

500
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:50,294
- Blue team, stand by.
- Copy that.

501
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:53,473
Okay, "top hat."
Try "top hat."

502
00:35:57,145 --> 00:36:00,181
Okay, it worked.
The alarm's deactivated.

503
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,730
Blue team, the system
is disarmed. Move in.

504
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,276
Copy that.

505
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:14,992
Blue team, I read two guards
at your 3.00.

506
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,460
Base Ops, guards down.

507
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:37,974
CIA!
Freeze!

508
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:52,313
Base Ops, I have the prisoner.
He's okay.

509
00:36:55,495 --> 00:36:58,330
You kept your promise.

510
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,535
You said you would kill me.

511
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:07,088
You were my favourite.

512
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:12,802
You never broke.

513
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,265
Who the hell are you?
What are you talking about?

514
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:22,970
Why did The Covenant take
two years of my life?

515
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:38,953
The last thing
I remember seeing

516
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,993
was the missile-threat warning
on my cockpit display.

517
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,789
Next thing I know,
I'm being lifted

518
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,329
by a special-forces team
out of an Iraqi hospital.

519
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:52,500
I still don't know what happened
in those 18 months between.

520
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:56,757
The hardest thing
is what I do remember.

521
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:00,597
My life before...

522
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:05,231
I can't seem to let go of it.

523
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:10,226
Even worse than not remembering
are the dreams.

524
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:14,446
I can't tell if they're part of
something that really happened,

525
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:19,194
or my mind trying to fill in
the blanks so I can get answers.

526
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:20,698
Thank you, Tom.

527
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:24,661
Well, we have
a new member today.

528
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:27,460
Welcome.

529
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:31,246
If you have anything to say,
we'll be happy to hear it.

530
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,629
Right now it helps
just to listen, thanks.

531
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:38,963
How long you been back?

532
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,844
A little over a week.

533
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:44,722
The dreams start yet,
nightmares?

534
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:47,106
No.

535
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,607
They will.

536
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:01,784
I appreciate that you think
it's good for me to know

537
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,576
that there are other people who
have experienced what I have,

538
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,658
but you cannot put me
into that group.

539
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:10,452
Look, I'm not gonna pretend that
it isn't hard losing Vaughn.

540
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,338
Do I still have feelings
for him?

541
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:13,538
Of course I do.

542
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,590
- But finding out that...
- Sydney.

543
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:18,295
This is Lauren Reed.

544
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:22,220
She's going to be our liaison to
the National Security Council.

545
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,968
I didn't mean to interrupt.

546
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,054
I'm sorry.

547
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,938
It's okay.

548
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,055
Really.

549
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:34,272
You had a conversation with
Bob Lindsey in the men's room

550
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:37,114
of the Federal Building in which
you made your distaste for him

551
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:39,606
abundantly clear.

552
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:42,903
I guess I did.

553
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,953
Well, he got the message,

554
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,827
because he decided to return
to Washington.

555
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,124
He's assigned Agent Reed here
in his place

556
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,833
to assist our efforts
against The Covenant.

557
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,081
She'll also be looking into
the murder of Andrian Lazarey

558
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:58,840
as part of a joint investigation
with the Kremlin.

559
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,924
If there's anything
I can do to help...

560
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:06,764
You should know, in addition
to being the new NSC liaison,

561
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:09,688
I'm also Michael Vaughn's wife.

562
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,730
Hi.
