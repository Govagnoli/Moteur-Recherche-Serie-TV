00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:04,485
Marshall counted 12 sources
that make up Prophet Five.

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:05,741
They killed Vaughn.

3
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:09,621
I'm not sure if I can do this, dad.

4
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:11,393
It's hard being without him.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,513
You've got an active one there,
just like mommy.

6
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:19,196
You're suggesting
that we abduct Sydney Bristow.

7
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:21,847
Prophet five has Sydney.

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,082
There!

12
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,073
This is field agent I.D.
Black, seven, niner, three, sierra.

13
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,767
Confirmation Foxtrot...

14
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,985
Repeat, confirmation Foxtrot One.

15
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:57,455
Status, M.I.A. I'm being held aboard
a cargo freighter, registry unknown.

16
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,983
Do it.

17
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,632
Organize a deck-by-deck search
and find her.

18
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:17,806
Damn it!

19
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,600
What did you find out?

20
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:27,243
I have confirmation that Prophet Five
is holding Sydney.

21
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:29,869
I believe they've had designs on her
from the beginning.

22
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,679
They knew precisely where and when
she'd be most vulnerable.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,225
They must have been tracking her.

24
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,465
Have they made any demands?

25
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:37,886
None. But whatever their intentions,
for now,

26
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:40,210
I have reason to believe
they need her alive.

27
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,662
Listen, Jack, we've seen Sydney
come through some bad situations.

28
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,226
Whatever you need, I'm here.

29
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:48,601
For now, contact everyone you know,
official or otherwise.

30
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:49,868
I'll do the same.

31
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:52,180
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

32
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:58,181
Mr. Bristow!

33
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,810
I just recovered a field transmission.

34
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,547
- It's from Sydney.
- Where is she?

35
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,660
This is field agent I.D.
Black, seven, niner, three, sierra.

36
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,938
Confirmation fox...

37
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,891
...repeat, confirmation foxtrot one.

38
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,824
Status, M.I.A. I'm being held...

39
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,428
- Held where? What happened?
- I don't know.

40
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:21,995
Looks like the file's
just corrupted.

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,767
I can't seem to pull 'em up.
You know what?

42
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,536
It's okay. I just need the tags
to triangulate the signal of origin.

43
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,445
Then I'll have the exact location
Sydney sent it from.

44
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,341
Wait a minute. You know what?
They're being deleted.

45
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:36,583
This doesn't make any sense.

46
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,863
It's like someone just wiped out
the archive...

47
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:39,872
Marshall, what archive?

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,286
- Whose system are you logged into?
- This must be wrong.

49
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:49,782
It's not wrong.

50
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:53,022
Gather everyone in the briefing room.

51
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:58,106
No, we haven't located her yet.

52
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,090
No, that won't be necessary.

53
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,412
Should we prepare to welcome company?

54
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,581
The transmission's been taken care of.

55
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,535
We've cleared the lower deck.
Still nothing.

56
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,786
Then why are you still standing here?

57
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,708
Moments ago, we receive
a field communication from Sydney.

58
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:41,593
>From the little we were able
to decipher,

59
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:44,315
it appears she's still being held
in the custody of Prophet Five.

60
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:47,644
However, before we were able
to resolve the entire transmission,

61
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,712
someone deleted it.

62
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:51,997
Someone at Langley.

63
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,348
Based on our current intel,
we already have reason

64
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:58,694
to believe that Prophet Five's network
has infiltrated

65
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,237
the intelligence agencies
of several foreign governments.

66
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:04,632
It now appears they may
have infiltrated our own.

67
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:08,868
Someone within the C.I.A.
did not want us to receive that message.

68
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,355
It's standard protocol
for all incoming signals

69
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,426
priority three and above

70
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:16,674
to be automatically backed up
on Echelon's comm. archive.

71
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,924
Unfortunately,
the only way to gain access

72
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,174
to this archive
is on the premises itself.

73
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,645
Not an easy task,
given security measures.

74
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,814
Wait, are you suggesting
that we break into C.I.A. Headquarters?

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,738
Yes.

76
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:33,172
Wouldn't it be prudent to consider
other possibilities?

77
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,712
Maybe the message was purged
accidentally.

78
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,984
We could ask Langley
for a copy of the archives.

79
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,862
I appreciate your concerns,
but at this point

80
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,664
we have no way of knowing
how deep this conspiracy reaches.

81
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,917
We can't risk tipping them off
to our agenda.

82
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,485
Effective as of this moment,

83
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:51,096
all information relating
to this task force

84
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:54,558
and its activities is to be strictly
compartmentalized

85
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,243
even from the C.I.A. Itself.

86
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:00,831
I understand what I'm asking
of all of you.

87
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:04,548
An action of this kind
could be considered treason.

88
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,723
Given that, if anyone feels
they need to take

89
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,165
a leave of absence,
you're free to do so,

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,858
No questions asked,
but now is the time to speak up.

91
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:25,988
All right then.

92
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,575
We're wheels up in an hour.

93
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,664
I want a visual inspection
of every container on that deck.

94
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:02,297
Post four, do you copy?

95
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,730
Post four, reporting in.

96
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,882
You tracked me with the radio.

97
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:10,882
Not really.

98
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,294
You're just predictable.

99
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:15,501
A woman in your condition,
shouldn't you be resting?

100
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,568
Thanks.

101
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:18,648
I don't plan on staying long.

102
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,202
Turn around. Give me your radio.

103
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Whatever.

104
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:27,165
But you should know
that no one's coming for you.

105
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,367
- We intercepted your message.
- Nice try.

106
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,130
My message didn't go through a relay,
but directly to my people.

107
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,482
That's not true exactly.

108
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:35,826
Technically, it went to Langley.

109
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,826
That's where it was intercepted.

110
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:42,318
You're bluffing.

111
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,882
If you really had an undercover asset
within the C.I.A.,

112
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,118
Why would you risk admitting it to me?

113
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,044
Because you're not
getting off this ship.

114
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:56,653
Dixon just called.

115
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:57,895
They're in position.

116
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,517
We're ready out here.

117
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,406
I'd like to welcome everyone

118
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,842
to the C.I.A.'s
new headquarters building

119
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:09,407
here in Langley, Virginia.

120
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:14,682
Comprising 1.1 million square feet
of space and resting on 258 acres,

121
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,281
this building was an expansion
of the original structure

122
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,559
completed in 1991.

123
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,589
Aside from the obvious human presence,

124
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,846
there are over
5,000 surveillance cameras

125
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,159
that watch over
very inch of the complex

126
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,048
and chemical and biological weapons

127
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,637
detection sensors
that monitor the air quality

128
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:34,805
as well as various other
state-of-the-art technologies that...

129
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,013
if we told you, we'd have to kill you.

130
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:41,094
Now if you'll follow me, you'll notice

131
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,281
the commemorative plaque
off to your right.

132
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,898
It honors the unsung
heroes of World War II,

133
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,282
the intelligence gatherers of the C.I.A.

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,403
Sidewinder, we're almost ready here.

135
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,589
Roger that.
Near security on my way to payroll.

136
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,896
Hi, I have an appointment
with human resources. Emily Higgins.

137
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,220
Right. Just need an I.D.

138
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,344
Sure. Sorry.

139
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,582
Job interview. I'M...

140
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:11,142
- I'm a little nervous.
- I'm sure you'll do just fine.

141
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,574
Please place your purse on the table.

142
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,195
Excuse me,
do you know where payroll is?

143
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,756
I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't allow
camera phones on the premises.

144
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,090
You can pick it up
at the security office on your way out.

145
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,903
Okay, thanks.

146
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,327
The third floor.
Elevator's to your right.

147
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:54,948
Sorry, there's a problem
with my check.

148
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:55,949
Yeah, just a sec.

149
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,343
Ma'am, I'm actually...

150
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,094
- I'm kind of in A...
- Name?

151
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,531
Thomas Grace.

152
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:05,592
it says here you're no longer
an employee of this agency.

153
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:09,095
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here.
I've had several back checks owed to me.

154
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,217
I never received them.

155
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,458
Well, our records show
that all your checks went out,

156
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,370
and they were cashed.

157
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:14,528
That's impossible.

158
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,601
It's usually the spouse
that cashes them.

159
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,657
I suggest you check with your wife.

160
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,031
Look, I'm sure if you check
your file again,

161
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,040
you'll see that you're mistaken.

162
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,186
Mr. Grace, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize..

163
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,570
maybe there's something I can do here.

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,655
Sidewinder, we're logging
in to the server now.

165
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:50,218
Look, I don't have six months
to wait for the claim to be processed.

166
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,155
- I understand, but...
- I've got a mortgage to pay, so

167
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:56,120
could you please just...
just help me out?

168
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,006
Connection's established.

169
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,282
Sidewinder, stand by
for the access code.

170
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,534
All right, I'll check
with my supervisor.

171
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,417
Maybe he can help clear this up.

172
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:22,107
Access code is Alpha, 7,
Delta, Lima, 22.

173
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,907
Copy that.

174
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,284
I've got access.

175
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,778
Outrigger, I'm approaching your 20.

176
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:31,909
Copy.

177
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:34,796
I'm going to need item number two.

178
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,784
And here's another one of our
display items.

179
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,785
It looks like ordinary pocket change,

180
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,480
but spies used devices like these
during the cold war

181
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,809
to smuggle tiny microfilm and messages.

182
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,319
You can only imagine
what's in use today.

183
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:00,687
Oracle...

184
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,346
<i>you're clear to the server room.</i>

185
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,935
<i>Call us when you get there.</i>

186
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,499
- She's in. I'm done here.
- Copy that.

187
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,352
Log out and move
to the rendezvous point.

188
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:15,292
<i>Affirmative.</i>

189
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:16,293
I'm on my way.

190
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,443
I'm at the server room.
Guards are in position.

191
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,318
Copy that.

192
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,632
<i>Stand by for the signal.</i>

193
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:29,691
Merlin, you're up.

194
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,936
Titled "Kryptos," this sculpture
was designed in part as a monument

195
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:37,128
to the code breakers who helped
crack the German Enigma cipher.

196
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,379
In fact, as you can see,
the sculpture is itself a code,

197
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,753
apparently a very good one.

198
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,165
To this day, no one has been able
to decipher the message.

199
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,898
- Now, if we move on...
- I got it!

200
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,911
Sorry, It just came to me.

201
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,697
I play a lot of Sudoku.

202
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,203
Excuse me, I'll just... if you could...

203
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,512
I'll tell you more.
The letters that are overlaid

204
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:02,637
onto the coding sections,

205
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:04,503
well, they act as a key to the cipher.

206
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:07,629
Based off that, you just need
to transpose the letters.

207
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:11,331
Right? That's all you need to do, see?

208
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:19,372
What's that?

209
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,931
Maybe they found out
I decoded the message. We should run!

210
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,061
- Take it down a notch, Hamlet.
- Please, everyone,

211
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,364
we need to move quickly to the exits.

212
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:27,942
Anthrax alert!

213
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,060
All report to deck.

214
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:34,067
I'm in.

215
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,031
I need the server number

216
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:38,168
- for Syd's transmission.
- We're looking for 8577.

217
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,615
8577. Copy that.

218
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,441
I found it.

219
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,497
I'm pulling the archive now.

220
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,104
Sydney's transmission
is time-stamped 9:55 A.M.

221
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,690
The archive's been purged.
The message isn't here.

222
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,906
Could you pull the hard drive?

223
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,131
We still can recover the data.

224
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,308
Okay, hold on a sec.

225
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,016
It's no good. The hard drive
is patched into the security grid.

226
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:37,975
If I remove the drive,

227
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,005
- it'll trigger the alarm.
- Pull the hard drive.

228
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,814
Langley will initiate a lockdown, Jack.

229
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,816
We'll never get them out.

230
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,228
Pull the hard drive now!

231
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,443
<i>I'll get you out.</i>

232
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,556
Make the call, Jack.

233
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:06,174
Excuse me.
I'm going to have to ask you

234
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,446
to hold it right here.
We're locking down the facility.

235
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:10,985
Four in the north corridor.

236
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:15,103
Sorry, everyone. It appears
we're having a minor security incident.

237
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:18,144
No one will be able
to leave the building just yet.

238
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,893
A lockdown?

239
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,521
30 seconds ago I got a call about
an evacuation due to an Anthrax attack.

240
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:28,189
There's a big difference.
Evacuation means everyone has to leave.

241
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,582
Lockdown means everyone has...

242
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,283
No, he's with the delegation.
I'm not gonna disturb him.

243
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,396
And what could I tell him?

244
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:34,519
I've got a great idea.

245
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,945
Why don't you get your facts straight
and then call me back?

246
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,214
Great.

247
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:40,271
Put in a call to state. Cancel my 4:00.

248
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:43,197
And I cannot believe this,
but I have to cancel my Pilates again.

249
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,276
Eric, it's Jack Bristow.

250
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,162
Sydney's in trouble. I need your help.

251
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,371
What?

252
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:54,871
Whatever you need.

253
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:07,586
Outrigger, you copy?

254
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:08,935
What's going on out there?

255
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,240
The building's locked down.

256
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,319
<i>Are you at the rendezvous point?</i>

257
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:15,083
I'm stuck in the witness protection
archives.

258
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,990
The door must have sealed
because of the lockdown.

259
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:20,553
Hold your position.

260
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:22,540
I'll see what I can do.

261
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,155
What is it?

262
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,420
Think he's here to arrest us?

263
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:33,696
He looks like he's coming to arrest us.

264
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,596
Ambassador Utland...

265
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,464
- Yes.
- How are you, sir?

266
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,211
And you must be Mr. Cornish.

267
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,214
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

268
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,450
I am, Eric Weiss.

269
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:43,586
I'll be your liaison.

270
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:46,919
I apologize for the security problems
that we're having today.

271
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,961
Please, it's not a problem.

272
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,372
I understand. These things happen.

273
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,958
And I understand you have a meeting
on the hill in 30 minutes.

274
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,962
I'm here to make sure
that you make that meeting.

275
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:57,668
Thank you.
I'll escort our visitors from here.

276
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,641
All right, Jack briefed me.
What's going on?

277
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,535
Tom's trapped in witsec records.

278
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,912
Rachel is still
in the Echelon server facility.

279
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,773
You know what, witsec records
is in the northeast corridor.

280
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,401
This should get you in through
the door,

281
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:09,939
and Marshall and I can handle Rachel.

282
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,608
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

283
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,902
Tom?

284
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,809
What were you doing here?

285
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,368
I got detoured.
I needed someplace to hide.

286
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,371
Come on, we need to move.

287
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:41,026
Okay, got it.

288
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,151
That's not good.

289
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,750
- Where is she?
- There.

290
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:47,525
Okay, what's her call sign?

291
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,961
- Oracle.
- Oracle, listen to me very carefully.

292
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,962
- Who is this?
- Right now I'm your superior.

293
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,776
I need you to do exactly as I tell you.

294
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:56,528
There's a guard that's about to go
right down the row that you're in.

295
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,282
I need you to turn left.
Make a left right now! Make a left!

296
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,456
Good, good, good. Okay, go straight.

297
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:04,454
<i>Keep going straight.</i>

298
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:07,670
- Weiss, look
- Okay, stop right there! Stop.

299
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,349
Marshall, how long
with that door?

300
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:12,402
Just give me 10 sec.

301
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,996
All right, when I say "go," run as fast

302
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,150
as you possibly can towards the doors
at the far end.

303
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:16,962
Don't stop.

304
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,211
We will have those doors open
by the time you get there.

305
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:20,598
- Okay, got it!
- Okay, go!

306
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,892
Sorry. I forgot to hit "enter."
Okay, now go.

307
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:48,838
How'd it go?

308
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
Not well.

309
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:51,400
Don't worry.

310
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,213
He's with us.

311
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,214
Eric Weiss.

312
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,089
Rachel Gibson.
Thank you for the help back there.

313
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,964
Oh, my pleasure.

314
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,716
Any luck with Sydney's message?

315
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,069
They wiped the backups.

316
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,715
We may be able to run data recovery
on this,

317
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:05,139
but if they went to all the trouble
of deleting the message,

318
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,594
I don't think they'd be careless enough
to leave any traces behind.

319
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,090
Better get a move on.

320
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:11,289
Take this tunnel to the end,

321
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,134
it leads at the southeast edge
of the complex.

322
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:15,566
I have to go back inside
to delete the surveillance footage.

323
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,464
Oh, if you hear anything
about Sydney...

324
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,107
- We will.
- Okay, and one more thing.

325
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,778
Next time, just call.

326
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:26,411
Care to tell me exactly
where we're going?

327
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,538
This ship has lifeboats.

328
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,539
We're taking one.

329
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,786
Good idea. You'll be spotted
the minute you step on the deck.

330
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:34,452
Not if you order your men
to search the lower decks.

331
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:37,753
Do it.

332
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,454
Get in there, go.

333
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:51,195
Make a sound, and you're dead.

334
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:01,146
Something's wrong, isn't it?

335
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:05,321
Move.

336
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,976
Whatever you say,
but you don't look so good.

337
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,830
Stop, stop!

338
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,146
Come on.

339
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:44,922
What is this?

340
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,292
Why is this here?

341
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:51,913
You have until three
to start giving me some answers.

342
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,001
One...

343
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,610
two...

344
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,915
Oh, no, no, no, no, you must not move.

345
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:41,399
What are you doing to me?

346
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Just be still.

347
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:46,939
The doctor is on the way.

348
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
What doctor?

349
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,678
Just tell me what's wrong.

350
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:54,031
Is something wrong with my baby?

351
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,040
I need to tell them you're awake.

352
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,385
You should be still.

353
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,704
Wait, please don't go.

354
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,808
- I will come back soon.
- Wait!

355
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:16,504
You can crack into this hard drive
and find Sydney's transmission?

356
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,738
Uh, cracking Langley's encryption
won't be a problem.

357
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,523
I wrote a program that can handle
anything under 512-bit encoding.

358
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,639
I can't seem to recover
Sydney's transmission.

359
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,989
Whoever wiped it
used a secure deletion program.

360
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,555
Basically, it rewrites
random junk over it hundreds of times.

361
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,402
Yeah, but the original data's
still there,

362
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:46,859
so it should be retrievable, right?

363
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,409
Well, yeah, if I had
an electron microscope

364
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,683
and two weeks, maybe.

365
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:54,197
I think we found something
in the hard copies of the server logs.

366
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,198
Check line 522.

367
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:56,808
Looks like an authorization tag.

368
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:57,758
That's what I thought.

369
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,876
Well, this tag has an "A.B." Prefix.

370
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,807
But that means
whoever authorized the deletion

371
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,808
of Sydney's transmission
had Alpha Black clearance.

372
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,318
What's alpha black clearance?

373
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,848
Alpha Black is the highest
clearance level within the C.I.A.

374
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,878
If Prophet Five has ties to the C.I.A.'s
upper echelons,

375
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:20,139
that would give them unlimited access
to all classified operations,

376
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,759
undercover agent rosters,
our entire infrastructure.

377
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:23,753
The good news is

378
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:26,888
that if whoever deleted Sydney's message
had Alpha Black clearance,

379
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:30,408
well, that narrows our list of suspects
down to just a handful of guys.

380
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:32,666
Only seven people
in the entire agency have it,

381
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,490
all of them division directors.

382
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:35,919
Aside from that,

383
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,175
the only other thing
that these guys have in common--

384
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,474
they were all assigned
a modified version

385
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:41,768
of the standard S.T.U.,

386
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:43,730
- A secure cell phone.
- What are you thinking?

387
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,119
Well, each cell phone
broadcasts a unique device I.D.

388
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:47,633
Now it took some digging,

389
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:50,240
but I was able to match
the Alpha Black authorization

390
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,289
code from the server
logs to the cell phone I.D.

391
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,390
Of the person in question.

392
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,444
So does that mean
we know who it belongs to?

393
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:57,513
Not exactly.
I mean, for security purposes,

394
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,051
Langley doesn't put names to numbers,

395
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:02,259
but if you can get within just 50 feet
of that person's cell phone,

396
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,357
I might be able to scan it
and see if it matches.

397
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:05,469
We'd have our guy.

398
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:07,659
We could divide into teams,

399
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,268
put all 7 of them
under surveillance.

400
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:10,419
That could take days.

401
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,067
Whatever Prophet Five
has planned for Sydney,

402
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:15,310
we can assume we don't have much time.

403
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,021
I have an idea.

404
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,839
- Gentlemen.
- Jack!

405
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,594
It's been a long time.

406
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,400
How's life underground treating you?

407
00:25:56,443 --> 00:25:57,465
Good,

408
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:59,168
always full of surprises.

409
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,422
I can imagine.

410
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,793
Can't say I miss it.

411
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:05,579
Scanner's hot.

412
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:07,739
Jack... we've got connection here.

413
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,028
So, Jack, you care to enlighten us
as to why

414
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:13,501
you called an operations meeting
at 8:00 on a Friday?

415
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:17,051
I didn't call you all here
for an operations meeting.

416
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:21,265
Given that all of you
have Alpha Black clearance,

417
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,016
most of you may already
be aware that A.P.O.

418
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:27,232
has been investigating an organization
known as Prophet Five.

419
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:29,468
What may, however, come as news to you

420
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,535
is we have reason to believe

421
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:36,157
that someone within our own agency
is in collusion with this organization.

422
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,354
Someone with Alpha Black clearance.

423
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:40,847
What have we got so far?

424
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,200
Four down, three to go.

425
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:44,717
Still nothing.

426
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,716
The reason I've gathered you all here,

427
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:49,305
if it isn't obvious by now,

428
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:53,789
only seven people in the entire agency
have this level of clearance,

429
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:56,765
and all of them are sitting
in this room.

430
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,244
Oh, come on!

431
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,583
Jack, this is absurd.

432
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:04,850
Are you suggesting that one of us
is working for a terrorist organization?

433
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,755
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

434
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:09,904
I got a match.

435
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,577
Jack, we've got a signal match.

436
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:13,477
One of you is working for Prophet Five,

437
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,721
and we have your number.

438
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:18,217
That's enough. This meeting's over.

439
00:27:18,251 --> 00:27:19,338
Go.

440
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,244
Jack, what in the hell are you doing?

441
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,547
Tell me where Sydney is.

442
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,837
Do yourself a favor. Stand back.

443
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,262
I'm going to give you one chance.

444
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:44,136
- Where are they holding my daughter?
- What the hell...

445
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,402
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:47,454
Wrong answer.

447
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,321
Stop, for god's sakes, Jack!

448
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,750
I sealed the doors!

449
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:58,874
Where she is?

450
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,176
You're crazy!

451
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,126
Answer me!

452
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:07,851
"the Athena"...

453
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,583
cargo ship...

454
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,203
Where is the ship?

455
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:14,748
The north Atlantic...

456
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:22,515
Did you get that?

457
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:23,664
We got it, Jack.

458
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:24,665
We're on it.

459
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,925
- What is that?
- Something to make you relax.

460
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,440
But...

461
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,137
Marshall, can you find the cargo ship
where Sydney's being held?

462
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:04,829
There are miles and miles
of ocean here.

463
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,305
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

464
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,466
What if you patched into the radarsat?

465
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,350
Overlay it on the optical feed.

466
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,609
Right. That's genius!

467
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:17,248
Okay, it looks like
multiple radar returns.

468
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,285
No, ignore those.

469
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:20,490
It's a commercial shipping route,
heavily patrolled.

470
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:22,495
They wouldn't run the risk
of random inspection.

471
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,496
Right.

472
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:25,195
There, that one.

473
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,654
It's in international waters.

474
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:29,713
A ship that size wouldn't typically
be that far out.

475
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:30,755
Got it.

476
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,053
- Hello?
- We have a hit.

477
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,972
Marshall's uploading the coordinates
to your onboard G.P.S.

478
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,076
You're clear to go.

479
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:41,077
Understood.

480
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,901
All right, let's move out!

481
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,292
What else besides abdominal pains?

482
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:57,678
Dizziness. Her complexion was pale.

483
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,191
Any trouble breathing?

484
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,201
Yes.

485
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,069
Hello, Sydney.

486
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:10,929
- You...
- I understand you've had some trouble.

487
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:13,554
Don't worry.
We're going to take care of it.

488
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,443
It's good you called me.

489
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,439
Let's take this off her.

490
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:22,188
You bitch.

491
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,882
What did you do to me?

492
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:29,036
My job as your doctor,
Sydney, nothing more.

493
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,647
I understand this must be hard
to accept,

494
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:34,942
but it would be much better
if you could just relax now.

495
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:50,279
Sydney I'm going to need you
to hold very still.

496
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,978
I have to draw a sample
of amniotic fluid.

497
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,475
You can go to hell.

498
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,803
Please, I need you to listen.

499
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,673
This is a delicate procedure.

500
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:02,112
Any sudden movements could risk
the health of your baby.

501
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,021
Please don't.

502
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:06,107
This might pinch a little.

503
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:34,928
Prep the room.

504
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,774
We need to start right away.

505
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,516
Sierra one, what's your status?

506
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,486
We're en route and closing!

507
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,984
E.T.A. 2300.

508
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,151
You're sure she gave us
the wrong information?

509
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,152
What if you...

510
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,058
no, I'm not doubting you.

511
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,353
I-I just don't see how that's possible.

512
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,185
What do you mean? How far out?

513
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:03,267
I'm not sure that gives us
enough time for what...

514
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:05,228
Of course.

515
00:33:05,728 --> 00:33:06,728
Yes.

516
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,471
I'll let you know as soon as it's done.

517
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:17,490
Our timetable's changed.

518
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,051
You're going to need to work quickly.

519
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,212
- We're just about to start.
- How long?

520
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,380
About an hour.

521
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:24,699
We've got about 40 minutes.

522
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:27,074
Let me know the second you're finished.

523
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,590
Please...

524
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:32,641
Just relax.

525
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,605
I'm going to take care of you.

526
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,516
I don't like this. Where are they?

527
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,365
They've probably taken
a defensive position below deck.

528
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,816
We'll split into teams.

529
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,852
You start clearing from the aft forward.

530
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,316
We'll come around the other side.

531
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:22,204
- Outflank them.
- Let's go!

532
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,610
Where is everybody?

533
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:53,894
It's all clear.

534
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,395
Bravo, we're all clear here.

535
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,459
They must have known we were coming.
The ship's been abandoned.

536
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:35,483
Not entirely.

537
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:37,503
What do you mean?

538
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:39,181
Come down to the infirmary.

539
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:54,963
Syd, are you all right?

540
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:55,964
I can't move.

541
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:59,216
Get the helicopter ready. We'll need
to medevac her out of here.

542
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:00,686
Dixon, is the baby okay?

543
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:02,911
It's going to be okay, Syd.

544
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:45,279
<i>I'm sure you're quite pleased
with Sydney's return.</i>

545
00:36:45,323 --> 00:36:47,723
<i>You, however,
made a grave error, Mr. Sloane.</i>

546
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:49,352
<i>You should have contacted us</i>

547
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:51,925
<i>the second your agency
identified our ship.</i>

548
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:55,926
If you recall, I tried contacting you
earlier regarding this matter.

549
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,753
- I was told...
- Don't play games with me.

550
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,962
<i>I am aware of your fondness
for power,</i>

551
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:02,361
<i>so I imagine this arrangement</i>

552
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:04,185
<i>is less than desirable for you.</i>

553
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:06,598
<i>If you value your own
daughter's life,</i>

554
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,023
<i>from this point on,
you are not to take a single action</i>

555
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:11,871
<i>without clearing it
with us first.</i>

556
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:14,651
<i>As far as you're concerned,
we own you.</i>

557
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:16,835
<i>Is that clear enough?</i>

558
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:20,083
Yeah, yes, that is perfectly clear.

559
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:23,149
<i>You may consider this a victory
right now,</i>

560
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,157
<i>but you should understand
every action has consequences.</i>

561
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:29,985
We'll be in touch soon.

562
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,826
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

563
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:43,050
You know that decryption program
I wrote?

564
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,933
Somebody accessed it
when I was out of my office.

565
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:47,930
We should tell Jack about the breach.

566
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,173
With all that happened...

567
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:51,271
I was able to recover the data
that was decrypted.

568
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:52,573
When you were in Langley,

569
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,515
tom accessed the witsec archives.

570
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,467
- Amanda Grace.
- Yeah.

571
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,190
Did you know he was married?

572
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:01,294
No.

573
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:06,602
This is the guy that did it.

574
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:07,685
Yeah,

575
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:10,450
I think that's who tom was looking for.

576
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:03,387
Hallo, Karl.

577
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:24,914
<i>Dr. Meither to C.C.U.</i>

578
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,743
<i>Dr. Meither to C.C.U.</i>

579
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,950
Sweetheart...

580
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm sorry it took me so long.

581
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,398
They just keep running tests,
but nobody's...

582
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:41,500
they won't tell me...

583
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,562
I know. They wanted to be sure.

584
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:47,112
And?

585
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,850
It's okay.
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

586
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,640
It seems there was a crisis
with your pregnancy

587
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:03,288
while you were on that ship.

588
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,401
Sydney, the baby's fine.

589
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,350
It's fine.

590
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,146
What they did to you on the boat,

591
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,788
you were suffering from something
called placental abruption.

592
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,498
They corrected the problem.

593
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,324
They weren't harming the baby.

594
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,799
They were saving its life.

595
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Why?

596
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,436
Why would they do that?

597
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,888
We're not sure.
We don't know what it means,

598
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:36,771
but I promise you,
we'll get to the bottom of it.

599
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:42,715
Oh, Sydney.

600
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:50,602
While I was on the ship, they...

601
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,475
they tried to extract information,

602
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:53,593
but I lied to them.

603
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,652
Not here.

604
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:59,851
Mr. Bristow, I'm sorry, sir.
That's time.

605
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,065
It's nothing.

606
00:41:06,026 --> 00:41:08,555
It's just a small matter
I need to tend to.
