1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,468
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:03,501
We're sisters.

3
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:06,133
How did you find me?

4
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,974
It wasn't just me.

5
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:12,261
It was your father.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,350
He's waiting for you.

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,395
Why is The Passenger important?

8
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,774
What is your daughter's
real value?

9
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,357
While I was searching for her,

10
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,690
I came across
an old Rambaldi text.

11
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:28,654
In it, Rambaldi prophecied
that there would be a person,

12
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,702
a Passenger,
who would be capable

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,030
of serving as
a direct conduit to him.

14
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,532
The text contained
a formula for an elixir.

15
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,002
If injected, would bring about

16
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,581
an altered state
of consciousness,

17
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,293
allowing The Passenger
to channel a message

18
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,755
rumoured to be the key...

19
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:47,054
...to Rambaldi's endgame.

20
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,511
Vaughn.

21
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:59,306
Sydney, The Passenger.

22
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,477
Did you find her?

23
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,361
Yes.

24
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,772
But she's gone.
She's missing.

25
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,823
Sloane took her.

26
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,517
At this moment,
we have no leads on Sloane

27
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,516
or Nadia Santos, my sister.

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,934
Unverifiable reports suggest

29
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,601
that shortly after
he betrayed us in Kamyshev,

30
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:48,235
Sloane boarded a plane
at the airport in Grozny.

31
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:50,198
But this was 20 hours ago.

32
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:52,112
By now they could be anywhere.

33
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:53,745
Have you been in contact
with Nadia's superiors

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,739
at Argentina's
Intelligence Directorate?

35
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:58,157
Yes, but they could only
provide us with background.

36
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,493
She was recruited six years ago.

37
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,121
She was educated
in language and trade craft.

38
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:07,216
The mission to Chechnya was
her first field assignment.

39
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:08,926
What about her life
prior to becoming an agent?

40
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,218
She was confined to an orphanage

41
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:14,675
in the San Telmo district
of Buenos Aires.

42
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:18,811
She had no known family
until now.

43
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:24,063
According to Sloane, Nadia will
be injected with an elixir,

44
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:25,730
some kind of fluid
that will enable her

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,688
to deliver a message
from Rambaldi himself.

46
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,914
That's good.

47
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,288
That's very good.

48
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,839
He's never divulged
the specifics of this message,

49
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,132
but he was willing
to risk everything,

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,174
his wealth, his legitimacy,
even his life,

51
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,008
to acquire it.

52
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,724
This is his endgame.

53
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,724
We have to believe that he will
kill Nadia in pursuit of it.

54
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:17,198
Sydney, I pray
that we get to Nadia quickly,

55
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:18,747
but given Sloane's intentions,

56
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,786
we need to be prepared
for all possible outcomes.

57
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,961
I know she's alive.

58
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,016
Please don't.

59
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,888
Nadia, my child.

60
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,648
I don't want to hurt you.

61
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,604
Then why are you doing this?

62
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:54,033
When Abraham was asked
to take his only child,

63
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,074
Isaac,

64
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:58,200
and offer him up to God,

65
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,782
he didn't hesitate.

66
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,407
And he took in his hand
the fire

67
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,328
and the knife.

68
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,884
And it was only then...

69
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,093
...that the angel came.

70
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:21,181
But Abraham had to be
willing to make this...

71
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,313
...unbearable choice.

72
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,896
I understand.

73
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,616
You do?

74
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,701
You're a man of faith.

75
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,828
Oh, my child.

76
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,914
My child.

77
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,133
How do you like it?

78
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,094
No!

79
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,687
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,889
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:12,851
My supply of Rambaldi fluid
has been compromised.

82
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,985
I need you to break
into a bunker.

83
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,781
Novgorod 21.

84
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,322
Secure more bottles.

85
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,447
You deliver within 24 hours,

86
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,081
I'll pay you $5 million.

87
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:29,504
I'll recruit a team immediately
and get back to you.

88
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:33,754
Go ahead.

89
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,918
Arvin Sloane just made contact.

90
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,336
Tell me where he's sending you,
and I'll double his offer.

91
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,138
The Echelon dictionary's
been updated

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,088
with the relevant keywords.

93
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,053
We'll continue to monitor
all intercepts.

94
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,519
Thank you very much.
Hey.

95
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,311
Hey.

96
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:49,354
I thought you were supposed to
stay in the hospital.

97
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,232
Yeah, I checked
myself out early.

98
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,144
Didn't they want to keep you
for observation?

99
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,394
I'm fine, really.

100
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:57,987
Look, whatever Lauren did to me,

101
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:00,067
I want you to know that
I take full responsibility

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,274
for what's happened.

103
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,614
I messed up.

104
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:05,456
And if you can't get past that,
I understand,

105
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,829
but will you try?

106
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,587
I don't know.

107
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,375
Will you at least
think about it?

108
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,840
Because it's all
I can think about.

109
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,122
Yeah, I will think about it.

110
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,506
I need to see you both
immediately.

111
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,306
Our SIGINT post in Manila
just intercepted

112
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:27,801
an encrypted telephone call
between Arvin Sloane

113
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,306
and a well-known
underworld fixer.

114
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,853
- Did we run a trace back?
- The route masking was too high.

115
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:33,519
Sloane requested
the fluid be recovered

116
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,943
from this bunker facility
called Novgorod 21.

117
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,272
I checked with my contacts
at Project: Black Hole.

118
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,035
They said the facility has been
inactive since the 1980s,

119
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,526
when it was the centre
for Soviet Rambaldi research.

120
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,028
If we penetrate the bunker,
we can plant a tracking device

121
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,163
on one of the vials of fluid.

122
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,495
Maybe that could lead us
to Sloane.

123
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:51,865
I'll have Marshall prep
the op-tech

124
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:54,535
for the two of you to execute
a tactical infiltration.

125
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,042
The facility
could still be guarded.

126
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,461
Where do we stand
on finding Lauren?

127
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,377
FBI counterintelligence
is going over

128
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,343
all Lauren's files,
phone records.

129
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,422
Have we brought our field
offices into the investigation?

130
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:06,350
Have you gotten DCI to sign off
on retasking Echelon satellites?

131
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:07,632
Vaughn, we're doing what we can,

132
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,767
but right now
the priority for this office

133
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,847
is finding Sloane.

134
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:36,504
Sloane got here first.

135
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,547
He might still be here.

136
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,098
They've got the fluid.

137
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,891
There's nothing left to tag
and no way to find Sloane.

138
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,554
We still have
a secondary protocol.

139
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,851
To retrieve all available data.

140
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:35,481
I'll start the uplink.

141
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,103
I'll try to collect a sample.

142
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,701
Marshall, I'm hacking
into the drives now.

143
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,162
Okay, picking up the signal,
Boy Scout.

144
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,714
I've got interference on K-band.

145
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,922
Bump it up one more frequency.

146
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,839
Any better?

147
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,382
No, not much.

148
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,136
There seems to be a signal
I can't account for.

149
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,846
Can you download the data?

150
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,261
Yeah, start sending now.

151
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,388
Are those video files?

152
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:19,514
Yeah.
At least 100 hours worth.

153
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,278
Can you open one?

154
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,483
That's my sister.

155
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,127
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no!

156
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,547
- What?
- There's a silent alarm!

157
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:48,918
They know you're there.

158
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,355
Sydney Bristow.

159
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,065
We meet at last.

160
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:59,948
A tranq gun?
How considerate.

161
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,372
Hurry. Take their uniform
and their I.D.

162
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,211
Who are you?

163
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,797
Your mother's sister.

164
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,881
Katya.

165
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,994
Let me take care of this.

166
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:21,787
Go.

167
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:42,717
This is just a sedative, Nadia.

168
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,482
So you can rest.

169
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,983
What you did yesterday,

170
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,354
destroying all the fluid
like that.

171
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:58,659
I want you to know
I was not angry with you.

172
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,163
I was proud of your courage.

173
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,836
Every Sunday at the orphanage
in San Telmo...

174
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,225
...they made us dress up
in our finest clothes.

175
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:25,515
They would have us
stand in line for hours

176
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,808
waiting to be chosen
by families.

177
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:32,192
I wouldn't do it.

178
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:38,075
I'd make myself filthy
and always frown.

179
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,196
I didn't want to be chosen.

180
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,451
Because I knew.

181
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:56,294
I knew that somewhere
my dad was looking for me.

182
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:02,970
And one day he'd come...

183
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:07,386
...to take me
away from that place.

184
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:18,066
If I had known
it was you I was waiting for...

185
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,947
...I would have cleaned up.

186
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,209
Katya saw Lauren and Sark
on a surveillance feed.

187
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,670
They acquired a canister
of Rambaldi fluid.

188
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,009
Eric, we need to get
that satellite retasked.

189
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,302
I understand,
but I want them found.

190
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,670
That's not good enough, Weiss!

191
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,308
I spoke to my father.

192
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:47,761
He's arranged for us to be
picked up by helicopter.

193
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,262
What were you doing
at the laboratory?

194
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,230
Like you, we received
intelligence

195
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,479
that Sloane had sent
a team there,

196
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:56,652
but by the time we arrived,
it was too late.

197
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:58,695
If Sloane is after the fluid,

198
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:02,197
he must be very close
from finding Nadia.

199
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,863
In the videotape,
when Nadia was a child,

200
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,070
she was drawing something.

201
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,490
What I assume
was Rambaldi's message.

202
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:12,538
If the message
was already relayed,

203
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,040
why is she valuable?

204
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,167
Your sister was taken away
from the laboratory

205
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,085
before she could complete
the message.

206
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,300
My father took her.

207
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,555
He hid her away to keep her safe

208
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,763
from people who were
trying to use her.

209
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,350
Are you trying to imply
something, Mr. Vaughn?

210
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,726
I'm just curious
why you're so eager

211
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,436
to find your long-lost niece.

212
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,398
I understand your wariness.

213
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,523
Try to remember
that I've risked my life,

214
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,818
that I compromised
my position with the SVR,

215
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,323
to save you
from certain execution.

216
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,533
My father told me you were
working with my mother.

217
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:52,871
I am.

218
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:54,241
When your mother
returned to Russia,

219
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,496
she was immediately
apprehended.

220
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,997
Her loyalties were questionable.

221
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:04,431
After a few months in gaol,
she gave birth to a little girl.

222
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:07,266
That girl was one day old

223
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,055
when she was taken away
from your mother.

224
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,810
The only reason I joined
the Russian Secret Service

225
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:17,682
was to help Irina
find her younger daughter.

226
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,936
For years we heard
nothing about her.

227
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,310
Every lead went cold.

228
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,398
But then recently we found out
that her father,

229
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:27,619
Arvin Sloane,
was also looking for her.

230
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,456
What is it, Sydney?

231
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,584
Sloane has her.

232
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:03,280
This is unexpected.

233
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,775
And unacceptable.

234
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,820
Nice to see you, too, Arvin.

235
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:11,161
We've recovered three canisters
of Rambaldi's fluid.

236
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,323
They're yours...

237
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,086
in exchange for a partnership.

238
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,373
I believe we've already
made that mistake.

239
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:22,958
You have The Passenger.

240
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,127
We now have the fluid.

241
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,339
What we are after is big enough
for all of us to share.

242
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:31,966
So what do you say?
For old times' sake.

243
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,471
What are your terms?

244
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,684
We've brought enough
for one dose.

245
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:38,144
The rest is safely in storage.

246
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,902
Once we know you do
indeed have the girl,

247
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,812
the rest of the canisters
will be delivered.

248
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,273
And of course we will need
to see a demonstration first.

249
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,984
We need to be certain that
the fluid actually works.

250
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:52,037
I see.

251
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,865
Now, I believe
the fluid contains

252
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:54,906
a stored memory.

253
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,114
A muscle memory.

254
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,617
This fluid you brought back
contains protein strains,

255
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,748
and when injected, the protein
moves into the cerebral cortex.

256
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,583
Theoretically, it could
trigger an individual

257
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,130
to execute a prerecorded series
of noncognitive actions,

258
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,303
Iike touch typing
or playing a musical instrument.

259
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,503
Drawing.

260
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:11,215
Exactly.

261
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,015
How dangerous is that process?

262
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,343
Well, the toxicity level
of that much protein

263
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,473
being forced into the cerebrum
would have harmful side effects.

264
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,023
Brain damage, maybe even death.

265
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,816
Have you been able
to identify the doctor?

266
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,601
No.

267
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:24,437
How'd the voiceprint
analysis turn out?

268
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:27,815
Not great, but I'll run it
again if you want.

269
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,610
Incredible.

270
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,708
I wish we could see
the doctor's face.

271
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,090
In the corner,
someone's reflection.

272
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,385
Can you enhance it?

273
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,512
Oh, my God.

274
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,609
We believe this man
to be Dr. Jong Lee.

275
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,853
According to files
recovered from Novgorod,

276
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,272
he was the lead scientist
in charge of conducting

277
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,240
Russia's Passenger experiments.

278
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,153
The NSA was able to use
electronic intercepts

279
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,703
to track Lee's
recent communication.

280
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:00,121
It appears he met with Sloane
in Zurich at least twice

281
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,121
in the past four months,

282
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,830
most likely to help him
procure Rambaldi fluid.

283
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,498
What about Lauren and Sark?

284
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:08,542
As of now, we have no evidence
linking them to Dr. Lee.

285
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,127
Their whereabouts
remain unknown.

286
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,045
If the satellites
had been tasked,

287
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:13,216
that might not be the case.

288
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:15,297
They were tied up
over a nuclear test site.

289
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,504
The D.O.D. wouldn't budge.

290
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,631
Because you didn't apply
enough pressure.

291
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:20,726
Vaughn, this is not the time.

292
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:23,766
Where is Dr. Lee now?

293
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,565
A Cuban bioweapons facility.

294
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,394
You and Vaughn
will head to Cienfuegos.

295
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,023
Find out everything you can
about The Passenger experiments

296
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:30,978
and where to find Sloane.

297
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:33,742
In the meantime, Jack, you will
work with Katya Derevko.

298
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,983
She's been investigating
Sloane's financials

299
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:38,568
in the hopes
of getting a lead on Nadia.

300
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:42,079
Could be something there
to tip off Sloane's location.

301
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,209
Vaughn, do you have a minute?

302
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:49,377
Yeah.

303
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,128
I know why you checked yourself
out of medical services early.

304
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,138
I know you're under
the impression you're fine,

305
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,216
that all you need to do
is hold yourself together

306
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,554
and bury yourself in work.

307
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:01,888
Get to the point, Jack.

308
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,603
My point is...

309
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:07,353
your rage is seething
under the surface.

310
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:10,858
I know because I've been there,
and I promise you

311
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:12,108
if you don't resolve this

312
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,857
as quickly and expediently
as you can,

313
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:16,486
it will spill over into
every aspect of your life,

314
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,149
including your professional
and personal relationship

315
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,111
with my daughter,

316
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,197
and I do not want you
endangering her.

317
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,208
I am doing my job
the best I can.

318
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:26,835
Do you have a better suggestion?

319
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,793
I suggest you focus your energy

320
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,707
into achieving closure
on this matter.

321
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,957
No one wants Lauren
in custody more than I do.

322
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:36,171
That's not the kind of closure
I'm referring to.

323
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:42,601
What's this?

324
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:45,223
This is the key
to my storage facility.

325
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:47,472
In it, you'll find
false identification,

326
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,732
unmarked and untraceable
weapons, contact sheets,

327
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,977
as well as disposal facilities

328
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:56,606
capable of dealing
with her remains.

329
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,531
That might be your way
of dealing with things.

330
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,650
It's not mine.

331
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:02,785
Keep it.

332
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,839
Sloane transferred 900,000
out of his Caymans account

333
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,546
five days ago.

334
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,632
Are the routeing numbers
traceable?

335
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,725
To Scotland, then Luxembourg.

336
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,850
Not after.

337
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,857
When Irina and Sloane
were having their affair,

338
00:22:31,943 --> 00:22:34,564
did you know about it?

339
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,229
It was one of her many secrets.

340
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:42,450
Hearing Irina talk about you...

341
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,072
it was impossible
not to be intrigued.

342
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:51,079
I find you sexy, Jack.
Deal with it.

343
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:54,421
What is Dayton Electrical?

344
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,667
I have no idea.

345
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:00,964
Sloane's made a large payment
to a Dayton Electrical.

346
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:02,763
The company subcontracted

347
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:06,681
to do work in Beijing,
Lyon, and Gambia.

348
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,430
And Chamonix.

349
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,016
That mean something to you?

350
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,980
Recently we arrested a woman

351
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,774
who did significant
electronics work

352
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,936
to secure a villa in Chamonix.

353
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,362
If this payment is for designing

354
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,488
some sort of security system
for Sloane,

355
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:24,149
she might know where he is.

356
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,868
This is Agent Jack Bristow.

357
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:29,744
Inform the detention facility
I will be there by 1400

358
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,372
to conduct an interview
with Toni Cummings.

359
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:34,668
If this works
and you find Sloane,

360
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,962
you will also find
Sydney's sister.

361
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,793
Oh, this will be
a great victory.

362
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:43,381
But it will be hard on you,
knowing what she represents.

363
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:48,016
If it was me, I wouldn't
want to go through that alone.

364
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,879
I said no disturbances.

365
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:11,389
I'm sure you can make
an exception for an old friend.

366
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:16,888
Remember me from Taipei?

367
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,312
Red hair.

368
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:23,238
You liked my teeth.

369
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,075
We know about
your experiments in Novgorod.

370
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,454
How much information
did you get from my sister?

371
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,574
Drawings.

372
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,242
Numbers.

373
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,708
Numbers?
What kinds of numbers?

374
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,122
What kinds of numbers?

375
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:44,250
She drew an equation.

376
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,917
Coordinates that would
lead to a place.

377
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,176
What place?

378
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:50,222
What are we
supposed to find there?

379
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,719
Rambaldi.

380
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,470
His body, his gravesite, what?

381
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:54,593
His consciousness?

382
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,846
Where's Arvin Sloane?

383
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,731
Sloane?

384
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:02,854
How should I know
where he could be?

385
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:11,992
Now, I know you can't feel
that, but you can see it,

386
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,539
and you can imagine
what it's gonna feel like

387
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,165
when I pour the rest
of this on you.

388
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,281
Vaughn.

389
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,590
You met with Sloane in Zurich.

390
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:28,512
It was only a charity function.

391
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,139
Don't lie to me.

392
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:32,679
He asked me...

393
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:35,437
about inoculations.

394
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,809
About The Passenger.

395
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:39,721
Where is he?

396
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:41,310
Vaughn.

397
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,559
I don't know.

398
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,693
Tell me where he is.

399
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,524
Please!

400
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:48,730
Vaughn, you can't do this.

401
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:50,319
Why not?
He would.

402
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,237
You're not him!

403
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,866
Tell me where he is.

404
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,741
If I knew...

405
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,373
I would tell you!

406
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,295
Wrong answer.

407
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:12,254
You designed

408
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:16,429
a lethal response security
system for Arvin Sloane.

409
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,761
You take everything
away from me,

410
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:20,978
and now you expect
a freebie in return?

411
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,560
I don't make promises.

412
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,984
Do you know how much being here
cuts into my market share?

413
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,689
Can't even get a lipstick
in this place.

414
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:29,944
Sloane is a fugitive.

415
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,195
Assist in his capture,

416
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:34,451
and a reduction in your sentence
may be considered.

417
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:38,247
I know what a player Sloane is.

418
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,583
Capturing him
must be a high priority.

419
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:46,378
If I help you get him,
I want out with time served.

420
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,008
So you know where he is?

421
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:50,465
I designed
a killer system for him.

422
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,131
But that was two years ago.

423
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:53,004
Where is it?

424
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:56,431
I only drew up the specs.
I didn't contract the job.

425
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:58,226
And I don't know
where it was built.

426
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,686
But you can find out.

427
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,977
I probably could.

428
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:04,520
Time served.

429
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:07,811
I'll have it put in writing.

430
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:09,940
Within the hour?

431
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:11,229
Within the hour.

432
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:12,071
Good.

433
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:15,408
Now, what do you need?

434
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,741
I spoke to Dixon.

435
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,410
He said Jack and Katya
might have a lead on Sloane

436
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,079
from Toni Cummings.

437
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,254
We may have their location
by the time we get back.

438
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:29,257
What you did to Dr. Lee
was unacceptable.

439
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,916
You wouldn't say that if I had
gotten something out of him.

440
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,847
What he knew or didn't know
is beside the point.

441
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:36,591
The point is, we're
trying to find your sister.

442
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,058
And if you had gotten
the answer,

443
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:39,637
it still
wouldn't have been okay.

444
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,138
Wouldn't you do anything
to get her back?

445
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:43,103
- You knew we had other options.
- Sydney, the man tortured you.

446
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,063
He tortured Marshall.
He tortured your sister.

447
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,278
This is about you.
And what I saw scared me.

448
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,619
Yeah, well, it scared me, too.

449
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:02,324
What I'm willing to do
to find her.

450
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:05,952
When I was with Dr. Lee,
all I could think about was,

451
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,711
if we get to Sloane,
we'll get to her.

452
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:13,124
Now, I want to find your sister.

453
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,053
But I need to find my wife.

454
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,473
Lauren cannot be allowed to get
away with what she's done.

455
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,054
Well, Lauren might.

456
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:25,478
And you have to be prepared
to deal with that.

457
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,572
So, you're trying to tell me

458
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:37,191
you got a gigajoule
from a gas generator?

459
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,112
Had to.

460
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,362
Can't have lasers without power.

461
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:44,576
Ah, you're very bad, yes.

462
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:49,750
Yeah, I've computed a list
of the equipment

463
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,753
that you specified.

464
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,418
Everything necessary
to build the security system

465
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:53,754
you designed for Mr. Sloane.

466
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,966
Now, my program here will
scan multiple databases

467
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:58,177
for any shipments of that gear.

468
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:01,349
Hopefully we can come up
with a delivery nexus.

469
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,184
How long did it take you
to come up with that?

470
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,433
My lunch break.

471
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:07,929
We get 45 minutes.

472
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,107
I want you.

473
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,779
Come again?

474
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,239
To work for me.

475
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:20,077
How much do they pay you?

476
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,118
How much?
A lot.

477
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,580
A lot a lot.

478
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:27,793
Work with me, and your base
will be $1 million a year.

479
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:31,546
That's a nice base.

480
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:38,176
The thing is,
I get really good medical.

481
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:41,466
And my little guy, Mitch.

482
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,764
Have I told you about him?

483
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:47,980
Well, he's also covered
under the CIA extension plan.

484
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,436
Aw, cute.

485
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:51,900
And to be honest with you,

486
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:54,274
I kind of like
working for the good guys.

487
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:55,904
No offence.

488
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,649
None taken.

489
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:04,450
Well, okay.

490
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,868
Looks like Mr. Sloane
built your system in Japan,

491
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,332
just outside of Kyoto.

492
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:13,330
When do we go?

493
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,297
Go?
No, no.

494
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,799
You were supposed to tell me how
to bypass the system from here.

495
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,505
Sloane had me give him
seven variables.

496
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:22,843
Now, I won't know
which one he used

497
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:24,890
until I have access
to the on-site junction box.

498
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:28,808
Okay, I totally understand,
but you're in gaol.

499
00:31:28,897 --> 00:31:31,601
On-site.

500
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,150
Yeah.

501
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:46,909
We're five minutes out.
Switching to whisper mode.

502
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,416
Vaughn.

503
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,707
I need to know that you
will stay on mission

504
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:55,792
to protect Nadia,
no matter what else happens.

505
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,270
What's wrong?

506
00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:14,729
It's what I was afraid of.

507
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,653
She's building up a tolerance
to the fluid.

508
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,694
She needs rest.

509
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:21,109
Or a stronger dose.

510
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,195
No.

511
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:24,110
If we overload the cerebrum,

512
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:27,119
her brain won't be able
to function properly.

513
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:28,580
She could die.

514
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:30,408
But we would have
the equation, wouldn't we?

515
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,160
Don't.

516
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,540
Don't push me, Julian.

517
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,464
You are wasting time
we do not have.

518
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:41,801
We have all chosen this path.

519
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,464
Arvin.

520
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:47,220
We have all made sacrifices.

521
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:50,226
I trust you are willing
to do the same.

522
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:20,213
This is Mountaineer.
We're on the ground.

523
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,135
Copy, Mountaineer.
Bravo is rollin' hot.

524
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:32,384
Bravo is in position.

525
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,100
Let's go!
Move! Move!

526
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:45,316
Weiss, we're proceeding
to the junction box.

527
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:54,240
You'll be okay.

528
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,619
I promise.

529
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,871
No, I won't.

530
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:09,636
I guess the angel isn't coming.

531
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:33,277
Arvin?

532
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:42,377
I'm so sorry.

533
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,467
I made a terrible mistake.

534
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:11,485
This will just take me a minute.

535
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,950
The deal's off.

536
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:16,280
If you go quietly...

537
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:18,699
you leave unharmed.

538
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:27,253
You remind me of my father.

539
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:29,585
When he learned
the CIA was close

540
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,597
to identifying me as Covenant...

541
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:35,885
he was willing to do
anything to protect me.

542
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,475
Even take the fall.

543
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:42,306
He loved me that much.

544
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,983
He's dead now,

545
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,731
because reaching this goal
is far more important.

546
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:03,001
I'm into the system.
It'll be down in 7 seconds.

547
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:06,254
- Bravo, stand by for go code.
- Copy, Mountaineer.

548
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:09,586
Get to the rendezvous point.

549
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:10,958
Got it.

550
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:12,465
Bravo Team, go.

551
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:34,701
You will regret this.

552
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:51,134
Vaughn, we got to secure Nadia!

553
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:52,250
I'm going after Lauren!

554
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,590
Vaughn!

555
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:07,397
Get away from her.

556
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,399
Sydney, please.

557
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,945
Now!

558
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:11,524
Now!

559
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:26,411
We've got to go now!
Go!

560
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,006
Freeze!

561
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:03,551
It's okay.
You're safe.

562
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,929
I promise he will never
hurt you again.

563
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:09,892
He protected me.

564
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:27,363
Your sister is listed
in stable condition.

565
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:30,578
The drawings and text you
recovered are in analysis.

566
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,045
We don't have every piece,

567
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,419
but I may have enough
to extrapolate a location.

568
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:36,416
I should know in a day or two.

569
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:38,253
The only blemish
on a job well done

570
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:40,670
is a debrief I received
from the tac team leader

571
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:43,800
indicating that an initial
failure to secure Nadia

572
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:46,727
provided Sloane
an opportunity to escape.

573
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,015
Is there anything to that?

574
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:51,727
No, there isn't.

575
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,322
I won't cover for you
like that again.

576
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:01,732
You violated mission protocol,
and you left me behind.

577
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:04,697
- Nadia saved my life.
- It was a judgement call.

578
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:06,496
I would never put
your life in jeopardy.

579
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:09,701
You saw a chance to get Lauren,
and you took it no matter what.

580
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:10,741
You didn't have my back.

581
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,958
We got Nadia.
That's what counts.

582
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,755
I understand
what you're going through,

583
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:21,710
what it feels like
to be betrayed.

584
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:25,589
You saw how my hatred
of Sloane consumed me.

585
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,091
Vaughn.

586
00:40:29,646 --> 00:40:32,812
You saved me from that.

587
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:36,434
From letting my anger turn me
into a different person.

588
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:39,861
And now it is my turn
to do that for you.

589
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:44,108
But you have to let me.

590
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:46,159
You have to listen to me.

591
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:48,037
You have to believe me
when I tell you

592
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:51,492
the person you are right now is
not the person you want to be.

593
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:55,830
I told you I didn't know

594
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,876
if we could figure
things out between us.

595
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:00,959
I still don't.

596
00:41:02,303 --> 00:41:05,174
But I do know that we
can't even begin to try

597
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,052
until you deal with this.

598
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,580
Jack.

599
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,329
Our concern with Nadia

600
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,209
has made Irina's affair
with Sloane

601
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:36,540
common knowledge around here.

602
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,705
That can't be easy on you.

603
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:39,794
If you want to talk...

604
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:41,922
I'm good, thanks.

605
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,850
For the record...

606
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:53,054
I can go through this alone.
