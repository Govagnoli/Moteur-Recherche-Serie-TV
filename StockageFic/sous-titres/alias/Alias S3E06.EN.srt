1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,379
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,346
Get in the van!

3
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:27,736
I could help you become
more powerful than ever.

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,488
You've told Bomani
you'd work for The Covenant?

5
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,242
Yes.

6
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:38,166
And now I'm telling you I'm in
a position to be a double agent,

7
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:42,299
working for The Covenant
but loyal to the CIA.

8
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:43,628
What is it, Sydney?

9
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:46,126
This is classic.

10
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,596
There.
You see that?

11
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,465
He's saying "Jewel" or "Julie."
Maybe "Julia."

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,474
What videotape?

13
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,432
The videotape that clearly
identifies Sydney

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,559
as the murderer of a Russian
diplomat, Andrian Lazarey.

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,110
I'm withholding this
information from the NSC.

16
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,401
That means, Agent Vaughn,
that you are prohibited

17
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:10,071
from discussing this
with your wife.

18
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,406
Is that understood?

19
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:12,694
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:19,290
Vaughn, I have to know
where I was and who Julia is.

21
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,122
What I did.

22
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,199
Hello, Sydney.

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,452
What do you want?

24
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,672
The Covenant
is about to make a move.

25
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,297
If you have intel, protocol is
you pass it through Lauren Reed.

26
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:14,470
She's your handler.

27
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:17,595
Well, Ms. Reed is very able,

28
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,178
but I'm afraid she cannot
possibly comprehend

29
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,440
the intricacies of serving
two masters simultaneously.

30
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,898
You were brilliant at it.

31
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:30,281
The way you would walk into
my office, look me in the eyes

32
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,525
and lie to me.

33
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,533
For me to succeed in my work as
a double agent for The Covenant,

34
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,580
I'll need your help.

35
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,244
Your needs don't concern me.

36
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:44,285
You'll find the details
on toureurope.eu.

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,503
It's encoded in the photo
of the Vatican.

38
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:51,383
Password is "Credit Dauphine,"
for old times' sake.

39
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,378
Clever.

40
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,270
I miss L.A.

41
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,901
I miss Emily.

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,110
I miss the friendship
with your father.

43
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:19,367
I miss your confidence
and trust.

44
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,411
Perhaps I can get it back
someday?

45
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,588
You will never have
my confidence and trust.

46
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:34,045
Or my father's friendship
and respect.

47
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,514
Ever.

48
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:43,598
You don't want any Weiss on ice!
Come on, buddy!

49
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,065
Alright, I wasn't ready.

50
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,234
Wait until I say
the words "I'm ready."

51
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,610
Hey! Hey!

52
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:56,992
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

53
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,786
My brother used to do this.

54
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,284
Do what?

55
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,748
Shut down like you're doing.
Get all quiet.

56
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,209
- That's not what I'm doing.
- He'd deny it, too.

57
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:11,631
And then he'd brood and
get mopey like you're doing.

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,797
Finally it got too much for him.

59
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,721
He had to tell me
what the problem was.

60
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,434
It's been 3 weeks since I found
out Sydney murdered Lazarey.

61
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,606
I've been lying to my wife
for 3 weeks.

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,520
Come on, man.

63
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,443
I know guys that lie to their
wives for longer than that.

64
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:32,232
You understand your brother
didn't like talking to you

65
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,065
because you say
stupid things, right?

66
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,779
Listen, you were ordered
not to say anything, right?

67
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,496
This isn't your choice.

68
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,241
And she was ordered to find out
who murdered Lazarey.

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,115
That's my point.

70
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,293
I'm engaged in preventing her
from doing her job.

71
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:51,004
She's gonna find out.
I mean, you know she is.

72
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,715
And that you're protecting
Sydney.

73
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,674
Yeah.

74
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,338
See where I'm going with this?

75
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,920
Well, this is why
people from the CIA

76
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,344
should not get married
to people from the NSC.

77
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,722
Don't poop where you sleep.

78
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,138
Thanks a lot.

79
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,344
Okay.

80
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,183
Alright, you know what?

81
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,101
That hurts.

82
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,446
This is where Lange will be.

83
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,531
I'll take care of it.

84
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:27,284
It must be done a certain way.
There is an extraction required.

85
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,627
I assume you've stamped out
the details.

86
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:31,994
Your partner's been briefed.

87
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,842
My partner?
I don't think so.

88
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:37,251
This is not a request.

89
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,338
Look, if you
don't trust me by now,

90
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,257
perhaps you should be
in business with someone else.

91
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,516
And you can tell that to San'ko.

92
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,063
We logged on to Tour Europe
and downloaded Sloane's intel.

93
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,194
The Covenant is after a device
that will give them access

94
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,655
to Russia's strategic arsenal.

95
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:03,614
It was designed by this man,
Robert Lange,

96
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,994
hardware engineer
for a German security firm.

97
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:09,665
Lange was approached by someone
posing as a Russian official.

98
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:13,287
They contracted him to design
a test for security flaws

99
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,290
in their nuclear command
and control system.

100
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,468
This guy, Lange, created
this really cool device.

101
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:22,004
Basically, take it to any
missile silo in all of Russia,

102
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,387
and it interfaces with
the launch-control console

103
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,682
and bypasses
all security protocols.

104
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,103
Initiation codes,
the commander's launch key,

105
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,854
irrelevant.

106
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,147
It's a skeleton key
for Russia's nuclear weapons?

107
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:36,069
Yeah, and to be honest,
I'm just a little bit jealous.

108
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,862
Did he deliver it
to The Covenant?

109
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,607
No, he discovered the man
who hired him

110
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,739
wasn't actually Russian defence.

111
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,819
Lange went on the run
to prevent The Covenant

112
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,240
from getting what he'd invented.

113
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,785
This is a picture
of what he used to look like.

114
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,452
According to Sloane's intel,

115
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,452
Lange has surgically
altered his appearance

116
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,252
to hide from The Covenant.

117
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:57,003
We know that tomorrow Lange
is scheduled to meet this man,

118
00:06:57,092 --> 00:07:00,211
Heinrich Strauss,
at the Club Delphi in Milan.

119
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,928
He's picking up
new identity papers.

120
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,848
Remember, Sloane's intel
came from The Covenant,

121
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:09,144
so obviously they're looking to
grab Lange and the skeleton key.

122
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,309
Sydney and Vaughn, you need to
get Lange before The Covenant.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,815
You'll leave tonight.
Marshall will go over op-tech.

124
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,987
Lauren, Sydney, I need a moment.

125
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,578
Given the current situation,
I need to make a change.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,085
I want you to take over
as Sloane's handler.

127
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:37,002
No. I'm sorry.
That is not a good idea.

128
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,082
While it's not my favourite job,

129
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,967
can I ask why
I'm being replaced?

130
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,048
It's not an indictment.

131
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:45,303
It's that Sydney is more
familiar with the players.

132
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,551
What players?
There's Sloane and Sark.

133
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:50,928
- That's it.
- No, there's another.

134
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:57,811
Sydney, Allison Doren is alive.

135
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,446
She's alive?

136
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,740
You can thank me later.

137
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:40,028
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

138
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:19,648
I truly thought you were dead
the last two years.

139
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,142
You have to start
at the beginning.

140
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:25,902
Or the end,
after the last time I saw you.

141
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,991
Will Tippin discovered
what had happened.

142
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,658
That his girlfriend
had been killed

143
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,905
and I had been doubled
to take her place.

144
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,407
He had to be eliminated.

145
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,039
What happened with Bristow?

146
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:47,590
When The Covenant found you,
you were both unconscious.

147
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,217
I can only remember that
in bits and pieces.

148
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,762
She came home.

149
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,729
I realised that she knew.

150
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:11,234
She aimed the gun at me.

151
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:16,279
The next thing I remember,
it was three weeks later,

152
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:20,586
and I woke up in a Covenant-run
hospital outside Marseilles.

153
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,836
It took me six months
to fully recover.

154
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,044
I've been working with them
ever since.

155
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:31,137
Were you behind them
extracting me from the CIA?

156
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,508
I wish I could claim credit
for that.

157
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,388
I only learned you were
working with us recently.

158
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,930
My tenure began shortly
after my father's murder.

159
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:48,354
They freed me in exchange
for my inheritance.

160
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,190
Who killed your father?

161
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,368
I don't know.

162
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,874
But I intend to find out.

163
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,926
Bristow should have to pay
for these scars.

164
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:16,138
She will.

165
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:22,731
I'm no longer Sloane's handler.

166
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,651
Dixon gave that job
to Sydney Bristow.

167
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:26,898
Good.

168
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,023
That frees you up to focus
on the Lazarey murder.

169
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,858
We have a source working
inside the Russian government

170
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,361
who's agreed to help us out.

171
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,732
They have the assassin's
identity?

172
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,401
Not yet, but apparently
they hold information

173
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,410
that could lead us to it.

174
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,325
Then why aren't they using it?

175
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,243
Lazarey is a Russian diplomat.

176
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,162
You'd think they'd want
that answer more than us.

177
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,333
The Covenant
doesn't want anyone to know

178
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,414
they're behind
the assassination.

179
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,298
And your source believes
their reach extends

180
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:50,961
so deep inside
the Russian government

181
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:52,463
that they can make that happen.

182
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:53,716
You leave tonight.

183
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:58,134
Any leak, and our source
could be compromised and killed.

184
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:01,804
No one from the CIA can know
about this,

185
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,055
including your husband.

186
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,821
Vienna.

187
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:15,026
Yeah, I know.
Surprised me, too.

188
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,075
For how long?

189
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:20,578
Well, you know how they go.
It's a NATO security briefing.

190
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:23,121
Two days at the most.

191
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,872
I'm surprised Lindsey reassigned
you to cover a briefing.

192
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,672
I know, but he said
he needs me there.

193
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,427
Couldn't exactly say no,
could I?

194
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:38,590
What about Milan?

195
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:44,184
Should be a quick turnaround.
I'll be back in a day.

196
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,066
When we get back,
when we're done with this,

197
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,529
we need to go away.

198
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,816
Desert?

199
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,951
Anywhere.

200
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,458
My superior indicated,
Mr. Tupikov,

201
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:11,333
that you have
some information for us.

202
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:14,546
How does a British woman
become an American spy?

203
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:17,043
I'm not a spy.

204
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:20,970
And though I grew up in London,
I was born in the United States.

205
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,060
Now that you know my life story,
I have some questions.

206
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:27,728
Your government's running
a probe into this.

207
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,770
I would think you want to bring
closure to your investigation.

208
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,892
Why come to us?

209
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,564
I explained this
to your superiors.

210
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:36,146
I want to hear it for myself.

211
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:43,408
Andrian and I were colleagues

212
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,665
since our time together
at St. Petersburg University.

213
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,747
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:50,540
I have, for some time now,

215
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,457
suspected the existence
of a mole,

216
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,541
whom I believe is still loyal
to The Covenant.

217
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,508
This is a file
of digital recordings,

218
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,504
all of which chronicle
hundreds of phone calls

219
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:03,935
made or received by our deceased
diplomat, Andrian Lazarey.

220
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:08,386
Perhaps the murderer can be
traced through these calls.

221
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,018
I trust you will see justice
done for my murdered comrade.

222
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,352
Where can I contact you?

223
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,278
You can't.

224
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:23,239
We never had this conversation.

225
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,967
So, that camera Marshall gave us
is a miniaturised X-ray camera.

226
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:41,635
How much you want to bet
this thing's leaking radiation?

227
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:51,433
So we're looking for Lange.

228
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,692
Yeah, the camera's supposed
to I.D. his plastic surgery.

229
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,944
It will transmit images
back to my PDA

230
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,156
that Marshall programmed
to identify fractures,

231
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,236
scar tissue, or implants.

232
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,452
Anyone who's been
under the knife.

233
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,786
You okay?

234
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,795
Is it Allison?

235
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:25,888
Since I learned that she's
alive, I just keep wondering...

236
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:28,264
does she still look like her?

237
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:31,389
Does she look like Francie?

238
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:38,904
Because if she does, as much as
I know I should keep her alive

239
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:42,938
to maybe try to figure out
the last two years of my life,

240
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:50,369
all I'll want to do is kill her.

241
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,413
Heinrich Strauss.

242
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:59,377
He's the man providing Lange
with identity papers.

243
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:03,631
As we speak, he's getting drunk
in the club.

244
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:05,381
I'll keep an eye on him.

245
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,093
The camera's in the stone.

246
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,097
Do you mind?

247
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,181
No.

248
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,290
Thank you.

249
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,959
Let's go.

250
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,174
Let's go.

251
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,022
Okay, we're looking for someone

252
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,766
with massive
facial reconstruction.

253
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:59,314
Lange's about 5'10", 170 pounds.

254
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,229
How's the camera working?

255
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,444
The video's linking up now.

256
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,660
Signal strength's at 100%.

257
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,031
I'll start looking for Lange.

258
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:14,163
Hey, check out
that guy to your left.

259
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,044
Buy me a drink?

260
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,143
Nothing.

261
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:37,773
I love this song.

262
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,609
Okay, nothing there.
Keep moving.

263
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,186
Oh, check out the guy
with no rhythm.

264
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,365
No, only a nose job.
Not enough to be Lange.

265
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,797
Chin implant at 3.00.
Collagen lips straight ahead.

266
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,718
Okay, those breasts are real.

267
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,924
- Should I get my nose done?
- Maybe a little tapering.

268
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,057
Get the bump removed?

269
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,351
Whoa, wait.
Go back.

270
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,597
Go back to your left.
2.00.

271
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:20,971
- There?
- Yeah, yeah.

272
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,609
Hold it.
Just like that.

273
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:26,229
Okay, nose, chin, cheek lift,
eye config.

274
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,114
That's Lange.

275
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,902
And there's Strauss.

276
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,112
He just got his identity papers.

277
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,455
Someone has a laser sight
on him!

278
00:18:48,553 --> 00:18:51,340
Vaughn, Allison's the shooter!
She's up in the balcony!

279
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,759
I'm on my way!

280
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,398
Wait, Lange!

281
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:04,108
Don't move!

282
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,076
Lange ran out!
I'm pinned down!

283
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,158
Vaughn, where are you?

284
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm on the balcony.

285
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,965
- Do you see her?
- No, she took off.

286
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,262
- I'm going after her.
- I'm going after Lange.

287
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,277
Hello.

288
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,930
Sydney, she went down
the elevator shaft.

289
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,431
She has Lange.

290
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,227
- What floor is she on?
- The basement.

291
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:01,351
- Why didn't she kill me?
- Maybe she likes you.

292
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:04,353
- Weiss, I'm serious.
- So am I.

293
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,230
Come on, she lived with you
for months.

294
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,225
She doubled herself
as your best friend.

295
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:11,069
Maybe in that time, she actually
started to like you.

296
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:12,269
I can see that happening.

297
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:13,941
It was like she needed
to keep me alive.

298
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,071
I know this sounds weird,
but it felt like

299
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,701
she had been ordered
not to kill me.

300
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:19,328
Well, that's lucky.

301
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,405
I want to know how she survived
your fight two years ago.

302
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:22,873
You shot her three times.

303
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:25,745
- So, she took this guy's tooth?
- She took the guy's tooth.

304
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,294
Just when you think the world
can't get weirder.

305
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:28,161
- Hey.
- Hey.

306
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,879
Have we checked the records
to see what's strange

307
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:30,913
about his teeth?

308
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,174
Langley cross-checked all files.
They had nothing.

309
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,511
- But then Lauren was a genius.
- Genius isn't quite what I was.

310
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,388
What did you do?
I miss all the good briefings.

311
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:41,467
Lauren realised we had
Lange's X-rays,

312
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,766
and we could use them to figure
out what was in his tooth.

313
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:46,605
The X-cam, Marshall's necklace.

314
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,729
We used it to see
who had plastic surgery.

315
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,023
- I took the pictures myself.
- Nice.

316
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,684
I have a meeting with the NSC.

317
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,773
I'll walk you out.

318
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,076
Vaughn's right.

319
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,201
The question isn't
why she didn't kill you.

320
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,661
It's "how come she's still
alive at all?"

321
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:06,030
Maybe Allison's a werewolf.

322
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,126
Maybe the only way to kill her
is with a silver bullet.

323
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:10,161
Yeah.

324
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,915
Okay, if you look here,

325
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:15,126
this is Lange's jaw
before his tooth was removed.

326
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:18,302
If we look here,
that looks like a normal filling

327
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:19,847
that one would have
after having a cavity.

328
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,802
Get it filled, too much sugar
and not flossing...

329
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,684
which I do every day,
twice a day.

330
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:26,394
But upon further examination,

331
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,895
I actually magnified it
over a thousand times,

332
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:32,853
and it's actually an RFID chip.

333
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:36,443
Now, RFID stands for
radio frequency identification.

334
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:38,109
Flinkman, you know
what would be great?

335
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:38,697
English.

336
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:41,535
Oh, right. I forgot.
You're not that astute.

337
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,197
Okay, what can I...

338
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,364
Oh, you guys are familiar
with the "quick pass" things

339
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:47,615
you'd use at gas stations.

340
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,414
Come on the key chains.
Actually, I think I have one.

341
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,077
Need a visual demonstration.

342
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:54,964
You know,
this little thing right here

343
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,709
that lets you pay
for your gas at the pump.

344
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,043
Then you don't have to use
your credit card...

345
00:22:59,137 --> 00:22:59,753
- Marshall.
- Yeah?

346
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,257
We're familiar with those.

347
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,755
Lange has something like that
in his tooth?

348
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,258
Sort of, although it doesn't
work at the gas station.

349
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,345
Though, if it did,
it would be wicked cool.

350
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:11,605
We believe Lange used this
to open a high-security lock.

351
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,351
Yes, and I believe Lange kept

352
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:15,352
this missile-launching device
locked up

353
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:17,687
and used this tooth
to open the vault.

354
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,069
Or briefcase.
This device could be anywhere.

355
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:22,151
We have to assume The Covenant
has the location.

356
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:25,280
As far as we know, they could
have the device already.

357
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,830
Sloane's our man
in The Covenant,

358
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:29,832
so I assume
there's a plane waiting.

359
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,328
How do I know
what I'm looking for?

360
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:37,630
I've supplied you with the time
and date of Lazarey's murder.

361
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:40,469
Screen all calls made
in the weeks leading up to it.

362
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,961
We think the killer
is someone he expected.

363
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,680
Was Lazarey killed
by a man or a woman?

364
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:45,762
A woman.

365
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,388
It'll take awhile to filter
all these calls.

366
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,977
Calls with a red flag, run them
through voiceprint analysis.

367
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,185
Maybe we can make a positive
I.D. on one of these callers.

368
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,107
Sydney Bristow
to see Arvin Sloane.

369
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,403
<i>Ja,</i> he's been expecting you.
Right this way.

370
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:08,577
Yes, of course, Mr. Secretary.

371
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:12,081
I will. I'd be happy to speak
with the delegation from UNESCO

372
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,624
at their convenience.

373
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:17,038
Just let me know.
Thank you.

374
00:24:17,132 --> 00:24:19,290
Give my regards to Nani.

375
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,507
Yes. Bye.

376
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,005
Sydney, I was very pleased

377
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,135
when Dixon said that
you agreed to be my handler.

378
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:28,390
It was an assignment,
not an agreement.

379
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:32,011
The way a janitor doesn't
agree to clean a toilet.

380
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:36,348
But as your handler, you'll do
what I say when I say.

381
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,937
I select your assignments.

382
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,269
I design your missions.

383
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:43,898
I control you,
not the other way around.

384
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:47,242
Is that what you
used to let Vaughn do?

385
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:49,366
Control you?

386
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,282
The intel you provided
was accurate.

387
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,248
The Covenant is in pursuit
of a device

388
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,122
that will give them access
to Russia's strategic weapons.

389
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:58,086
You failed to get Lange,
didn't you?

390
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,964
Lange is dead.

391
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,042
The Covenant has an access code

392
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:05,136
we assume will open a vault
that contains this device.

393
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,344
I see. And you know
the location of this vault?

394
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:10,137
No, but Sark and Allison do,

395
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:12,931
and you're going to get them
to give it to you.

396
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,978
Allison.

397
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:20,270
I was wondering
when Allison would resurface.

398
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,945
I'm sorry, Sydney.

399
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:27,325
I can only imagine
that seeing Allison

400
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,080
must be very painful for you.

401
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:34,121
You will set up a meeting
with Sark and Allison.

402
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:37,210
You'll explain that their travel
plans have been compromised.

403
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:39,964
You'll offer assistance
in revising their arrangements.

404
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:41,875
And pass the information
on to you?

405
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:45,252
That won't be necessary.
You'll be wearing a wire.

406
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:50,138
And if they discover
that it's a setup?

407
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:54,437
Then I get to hear them
kill you.

408
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,149
I went through the disk.

409
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,860
There were 300 calls, and about
12% of them were encrypted,

410
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,026
including this one
from the day before the murder.

411
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,494
Yes, this is Andrian.

412
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,989
Hello, it's me.

413
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,954
- Hello.
- About the stock transfer...

414
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,954
So I trust that you've located
a safe place to park the asset.

415
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,325
I have.

416
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,793
When would you come by
to discuss the particulars?

417
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,459
Can you make time
tomorrow at 3.00?

418
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,219
Of course. I look forward
to seeing you then.

419
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:28,758
That has to be the killer.
He was murdered at 3.15.

420
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,305
I ran it through analysis.

421
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,098
The woman's voice
has been altered.

422
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,346
Can you restore the original?

423
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:36,389
No, it was altered
at the source.

424
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:39,266
I was able to access
the Russian telephone exchange.

425
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,895
- So you can do a trace.
- I already did.

426
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:45,270
See, whoever placed the call
did an amazing job.

427
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,530
They routed to Lazarey's PBX
via a defunct satellite network,

428
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:51,701
through the Internet,
VOIP gateway,

429
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:55,072
and over a landline at a secure
telephone at this address.

430
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:55,995
London.

431
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,407
34 Trenton Place.

432
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,877
Knightsbridge.

433
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:01,835
A company called
K.N.G. Microtech.

434
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,377
Good job.

435
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,232
I found the office
where the phone call originated.

436
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:34,196
It's been empty for some time.
I spoke to the leasing agent.

437
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:35,283
According to their records,

438
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:37,945
this office was leased
a year ago, November 24th.

439
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,832
A 4-year lease paid in advance.

440
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:42,325
- Was there a name on the lease?
- Yes, there was.

441
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,911
I believe she's the person
who killed Lazarey.

442
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:48,042
Her name is Julia Thorne.

443
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,141
I feel like a field agent again.

444
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:01,387
Do you have a 20 on the targets?

445
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:04,186
I've never told you about
my time with the agency, have I?

446
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,390
Yes or no?

447
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:08,439
I was very patriotic once.

448
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,403
No one's asking.

449
00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:13,109
Here they are.

450
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:16,610
Mr. Sark.

451
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,533
Allison.

452
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:23,916
You're looking well.

453
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,876
I look like someone else.

454
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:29,501
When you hired me
to undergo gene therapy,

455
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,796
you promised you could
reverse-engineer the process.

456
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:35,805
Ah, but Sydney Bristow
destroyed the technology

457
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,555
that would have allowed us
to return you.

458
00:28:39,644 --> 00:28:41,601
I'm sorry for your loss.

459
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:44,642
You indicated it was
important we meet.

460
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,775
The CIA is onto you.

461
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,733
My sources tell me
the agency knows

462
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,856
that you extracted
an RFID chip from Mr. Lange.

463
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:55,780
The plane that you chartered
is under surveillance.

464
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,116
As counsel to The Covenant,

465
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:01,827
I suggest that you move up
your timetable.

466
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,624
If you let me know
where you need to go,

467
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,537
I'll have a plane waiting
within the hour.

468
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,751
- He's lying.
- Allison.

469
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,837
No, she's a wonderful
judge of character.

470
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,417
Sydney Bristow found you
in Milan.

471
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:17,964
If I were a betting man,
I'd say she'd find you again.

472
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,099
I'm simply here to help.

473
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,558
There's no way
Sark's gonna go for this.

474
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,191
We're going to Bulgaria.

475
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:30,518
The device is in a vault
in Sofia.

476
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:33,019
What did I tell you?
This is the best plan ever.

477
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,356
I can get you there first thing.

478
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,481
Tomorrow morning.

479
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,607
Done.

480
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:40,362
Then our business here
is complete.

481
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:43,658
Ask them where I've been
the last two years.

482
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,419
I'll call you as soon as
the arrangements are complete.

483
00:29:46,503 --> 00:29:48,709
Ask them, or I'll send
feedback through your comm

484
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:52,047
so loud they'll hear it
and know you're wired.

485
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,422
At which point they'll kill you.

486
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:57,049
Sucks being a double agent,
doesn't it?

487
00:29:57,138 --> 00:29:59,345
You know, Allison,
I'm thinking...

488
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:01,757
Seeing you again,
I'm reminded of the things

489
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:03,844
that happened
over the past two years.

490
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:05,846
I'm curious.

491
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:08,940
Have you and Sydney Bristow
crossed paths?

492
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,023
Why?

493
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,684
I heard you had an opportunity
to kill her in Milan

494
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,571
and that you didn't take it.

495
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:17,815
The Covenant asked me not to.

496
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:20,530
Really?
Why is that?

497
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,119
They want to retrieve something,
something in her memory.

498
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,959
Something she saw?
Something she experienced?

499
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:29,795
I don't know.
I'm as curious as you are.

500
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,631
Something you saw.
What the hell is that?

501
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,831
I have no idea.

502
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,588
- We've been over this.
- I know.

503
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,349
The NSC techniques to recapture
my memory are invasive.

504
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:42,843
Invasive is too benign a word.

505
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:44,393
We're talking
about surgical procedures

506
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:46,600
that could leave you
with permanent brain damage.

507
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:49,060
Allison said The Covenant
wants to access something I saw.

508
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,355
And we'll discover
what that is in time.

509
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:56,151
Dad, I am walking around with
a secret in my head so fantastic

510
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,481
that Covenant operatives have
been ordered not to kill me.

511
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,235
- I need to know what that is.
- I understand.

512
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,615
But we're not doing it
like that.

513
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:05,076
How do you propose we do it?
I'm losing my mind!

514
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:08,949
I just got off the phone with
our N.I.S. Iiaison in Sofia.

515
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:10,787
Once Allison's plane lands,

516
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,955
you and Vaughn will coordinate
with local authorities

517
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:14,672
and track her to the vault.

518
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:17,331
We'll wait until she retrieves
the device, then apprehend her.

519
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:20,594
- I understand.
- You leave at once.

520
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,388
- Is there a problem with that?
- No, there isn't.

521
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:28,431
I'll go over op-tech
with Marshall.

522
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,976
I want you clear
on the rules of engagement.

523
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,184
Yes, I know.

524
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,735
Allison is another link
to The Covenant.

525
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:40,483
She is part
of our larger agenda,

526
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:42,568
and as such,
is not to be killed.

527
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,823
I want her dead.

528
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:45,110
What?

529
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:48,787
The order from Langley is
to bring her in dead or alive.

530
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,496
She killed my wife.
She killed your best friend.

531
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:54,457
So I look at this
as an opportunity.

532
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,914
The only reason I hesitated
before was I hoped

533
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,334
that she might
have information for you.

534
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:04,046
But now that we know
there's no hope for that,

535
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,631
I want that bitch dead.

536
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:16,853
You want to track Allison,
right?

537
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:19,780
Well, I came up with
a solution to that problem.

538
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,616
The chip inside Lange's tooth,
it uses a frequency signature,

539
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,159
and that's how it
unlocks the vault

540
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,868
that contains his
missile-launching device.

541
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:27,614
You explained this.

542
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:30,161
Now, this thing will
hone in on the frequency

543
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,535
and lead us to Allison, and
she will lead us to the device.

544
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:36,664
Oh, however, I wasn't really
sure exactly the frequency

545
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:40,884
that the chip transmits on,
so I covered a broader spectrum.

546
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:44,338
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No. No, not really.

547
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:45,841
Alright, kind of.

548
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:49,846
It might be set off by microwave
ovens, so I would steer clear

549
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:52,142
of pancake houses of
the international variety.

550
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,641
Got it.

551
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:56,519
See, the Eprom chip
isn't finished burning,

552
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:57,724
so it's gonna be a while.

553
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,479
Well, let me know
when it's ready.

554
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,144
Actually,
can I ask you a favour?

555
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,731
- Sure.
- I don't know if you've noticed.

556
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:07,743
But I'm not that smooth
around the ladies.

557
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:10,201
In fact, I'm a little awkward.
Let's face it.

558
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,532
I mean, you got the looks,
I got the brains.

559
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,829
I wanted to propose to Carrie,
so I came up with an idea,

560
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,328
and I was hoping you
could give me some feedback.

561
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:20,083
I've got the looks,
you got the brains?

562
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:21,883
Tell me what you think,
and be brutal.

563
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,083
Just be honest.

564
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:26,428
Don't hold back or anything.

565
00:33:26,514 --> 00:33:27,843
Okay.

566
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:31,762
<i>You're the micro in my chip</i>

567
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:34,426
<i>The giga in my byte</i>

568
00:33:34,522 --> 00:33:36,479
<i>I think about you, Carrie</i>

569
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,769
<i>Every morning, noon, and night</i>

570
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:41,604
<i>Morning, noon, and night</i>

571
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,190
- That's...
- Carrie!

572
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:47,615
<i>We had sushi</i>

573
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,296
<i>I'll protect you,</i>
<i>can't you see?</i>

574
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:09,057
<i>Carrie, marry me</i>

575
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,884
I love you.

576
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:13,803
I love you.

577
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:23,814
No good?

578
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:27,149
- I think she's gonna say yes.
- Really?

579
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:29,815
'Cause of the rock-jam song?

580
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:32,616
Maybe in spite
of the rock-jam song.

581
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:34,248
Alright.

582
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:37,416
Alright.
Oh, hey, your thing's ready.

583
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,915
Thanks, Marshall.

584
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,917
Rock 'n' roll!

585
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:54,343
Sloane put Allison on the ground
20 minutes ago.

586
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:55,846
We have a visual.

587
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:58,345
There she is.

588
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:00,559
What is that place?

589
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,394
It looks abandoned,
like an old hotel.

590
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:04,692
- Do you have an address?
- Yeah.

591
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,021
14205 Beckerman.

592
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:08,989
I'll tell the pilot.

593
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,032
Put us down
near 14205 Beckerman.

594
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,743
Roger that.

595
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:14,738
What kind of range
does this have?

596
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,242
Marshall said
it should track the signal

597
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,040
Allison's using for 50 yards,

598
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:21,542
but he also said it could be
set off by microwave ovens.

599
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:24,037
- That's great.
- Yeah.

600
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,227
Do you have a signal?

601
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:42,476
Allison's in there, or someone's
making microwave popcorn.

602
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,486
Let's go.

603
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:13,336
Where is she?

604
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:16,005
Hold on.
Upstairs.

605
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:25,979
She's 30 feet down on the left.

606
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,130
We can't track her
without the chip.

607
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:56,261
I'll go this way.

608
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,306
Okay.

609
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:18,162
- She's in the west stairwell.
- Copy.

610
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,179
Well, this is familiar,
isn't it?

611
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:40,845
I was thinking
about this last night.

612
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,180
I couldn't sleep.

613
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,556
If I follow my orders,
if I don't kill you,

614
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:47,475
you're gonna kill me.

615
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,524
Sorry about Francie.

616
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:52,316
I was just following orders.

617
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,777
Once I'd been doubled,
I had to take her place.

618
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:58,698
We did, like, 80 dinners.
We're a huge success.

619
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,860
Hello?

620
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:05,575
Mom, I'm gonna have to put you
on hold for a second, okay?

621
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,118
Oh, my...

622
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:09,956
Move into the kitchen.

623
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,048
- You're me.
- I am now.

624
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:31,149
Mom, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

625
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:32,231
I had nothing against her.

626
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,728
She just was a casualty
of circumstance.

627
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:37,658
Don't blame yourself. There's
no way you could have known.

628
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:39,818
Just like when you recovered
Rambaldi's journal.

629
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,738
You had no idea
it contained a formula.

630
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,324
What are you talking about?

631
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:46,830
A formula for a medication
that would ultimately be used

632
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:48,578
to help heal my wounds.

633
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:54,506
So, yeah, you almost killed me,
but then you also saved my life.

634
00:40:01,409 --> 00:40:05,454
I shot her,
and we got the device.

635
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:09,157
I know what you wanted,
but she had a pulse.

636
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,081
Where is she now?

637
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,041
They've taken her to a hospital.

638
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,207
Civilian ambulance?

639
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,428
Yeah, with an armed guard.
Why?

640
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:26,507
I'll call about
getting her extradited.

641
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:28,677
I want an update on her
condition as soon as you get it.

642
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,264
Okay.

643
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:32,312
Good work, Syd.

644
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,356
Thank you.

645
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,173
The Rambaldi book.

646
00:40:58,258 --> 00:41:00,831
Do you remember a formula
for a medication?

647
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:02,718
No.

648
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:07,225
We've got to find
that ambulance.

649
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:14,394
You sure this is the route
they would take?

650
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:16,107
This is the only way
to the hospital.

651
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:18,066
There is no other.

652
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:51,431
Wait, this makes no sense.

653
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,927
If Allison had backup,
they would've been at the hotel.

654
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:56,643
I don't think she needed backup.

655
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,690
What do you mean?

656
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:02,732
I think she did this herself.

657
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,316
The paramedics said
she barely had a pulse.

658
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:06,696
I know.

659
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,991
She did this, Vaughn.

660
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:14,241
She did this.
