1
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:30,517
I'm in.

2
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,248
Hey. There's a cab waiting outside.

3
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:21,338
She wouldn't let me drive her to the airport.

4
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:22,902
Is everything okay?

5
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,653
The Lisbon police called.

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,456
It's safe for Sophia to go home.

7
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,165
Oh, that's great.

8
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:30,734
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you.

9
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:36,528
Look at the two of you.

10
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,803
Such beautiful and smart women.

11
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,750
Before I make a fool of myself...

12
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,390
Promise you'll come back.

13
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,910
Nadia, for you, anything.

14
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,867
Oh, hey. Vaughn, could you sign this?

15
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,713
It's for Weiss. His grandfather died.

16
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,066
Yeah. Actually, can I do it in a little bit?

17
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,488
I need to ask Jack something first.

18
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:19,863
Oh, sure. No problem.

19
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:23,381
Where you going?

20
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,175
Well, I thought I'd go with you to get Mr. Bristow to sign this while we're in there.

21
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,263
You know what? Actually I need to see him alone. It's kind of personal.

22
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:28,873
Oh.

23
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:33,338
Uh, since when can you tell Mr. Bristow something you can't tell me?

24
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,758
This is something I need to ask Jack.

25
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:37,186
If you were Sydney's father, I could ask you, but you're not.

26
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:38,657
No, I'm not.

27
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:43,667
I still don't understand what me not being Sydney's father has to do with you --

28
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,335
Understand now?

29
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,542
Oh, my god.

30
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,723
Hey, man, congratulations. That's fantastic.

31
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:51,267
Thanks.

32
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,736
I'm sure Mr. Bristow's gonna be thrilled.

33
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:54,525
Really?

34
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,047
I'm just hoping he doesn't shoot me on the spot.

35
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,542
  

36
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:02,681
  

37
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:06,096
  

38
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,328
  

39
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:11,114
As if weapon-grade Anthrax grows on trees.

40
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:13,322
What is it?

41
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,485
Oh, if this is a bad time, I can --

42
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,524
No, please.

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,328
After dealing with that chechnyan lunatic for the past couple of hours,

44
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,041
whatever business you have will be a welcome relief.

45
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,309
Well, we've, um...

46
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,356
I know you're a man who --

47
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,966
I know you're a man who respects tradition. As do I. And --

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,868
Please get to the point, agent Vaughn.

49
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,655
I'm gonna ask Sydney to marry me,

50
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,693
and I'd like your blessing.

51
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:52,685
Perhaps you believe my recent illness rendered me less coherent than before,

52
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:58,311
or that my cognitive faculties have been somehow dulled or diminished.

53
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,714
Allow me to clarify the facts for you, agent Vaughn.

54
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:06,766
While I've come to believe you're not as useless as I first imagined,

55
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:10,078
I still don't feel you have --

56
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,204
Everyone please remain where you are. This is a warranted search.

57
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,354
May I see that?

58
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,316
We've been authorized to confiscate all relevant materials.

59
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,437
It's been signed by director Chase.

60
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,918
- Where's your sister?
- What?

61
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,962
I expect your full cooperation.

62
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,568
- If Nadia's in some kind of trouble --
- Where is she?

63
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,560
In the shower.

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,352
Stand down, agent Santos.

65
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,778
What's this about?

66
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,902
Men are dead, things are gone, and you've got some explaining to do.

67
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,619
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

68
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,195
Does anyone else use it or have access to it?

69
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,044
- No.
- Not even Sydney?

70
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,375
I said no. Sydney has her own laptop.

71
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,935
- She also has --
- An assault rifle,

72
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,310
a 12-gauge shotgun,

73
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,680
four handguns,

74
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,057
two tazers, and a...

75
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:54,565
secret drawer of knives.

76
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,240
Let's start with the knives.

77
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,235
Let's start with you not wasting my time.

78
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,782
Director Chase says men are dead.

79
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:02,918
What men? What does she think Nadia did?

80
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,919
We know you overrode the DSR security system tonight.

81
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:06,482
What?

82
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,813
Alarms on an access door were deactivated.

83
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:11,670
We traced the override command to your laptop.

84
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,622
And you just told me that you're the only one who uses it.

85
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,624
Yes, but I didn't do it.

86
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,138
We also have evidence that tonight's incident

87
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:22,851
isn't the only one that leads back to you and this laptop.

88
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:39,959
We have clearance.

89
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:47,733
- A micro transmitter?
- In the medallion.

90
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:51,823
- When did she give you this?
- A few weeks ago.

91
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,757
Why would Sophia do something like that?

92
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,259
It would help explain why several missions were compromised.

93
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,306
I personally investigated Sophia Vargas when she first arrived.

94
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:05,345
Prints, background -- everything came back clean.

95
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,999
Well, somebody tapped into agent Santos' laptop.

96
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:12,087
And because of it, five agents are dead and several Rambaldi artifacts are gone.

97
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,989
I don't believe it. I won't.

98
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,222
Why would she do this?

99
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:17,167
I think our clue lies in what was stolen.

100
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,637
You're  reaching for straws, Jack.

101
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,582
Am I?

102
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:22,518
Who else would be capable of pulling this off?

103
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,508
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,882
Elena.

105
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,337
You think Sophia Vargas is connected to Elena Derevko?

106
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:37,053
No. I think Sophia Vargas is Elena Derevko.

107
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,042
Arvin and I have been searching for her for months.

108
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,936
I believe she found us first.

109
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,931
Has been using us to achieve her own end.

110
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:46,789
You  mean the journal of Vaughn's father, Sloane Clone --

111
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:48,401
McCullough, everything.

112
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,012
- It's been Elena all along.
- Oh, my god.

113
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,040
You're saying it's all a lie?

114
00:07:56,077 --> 00:08:00,661
That she spent all these years, all this time, so she could steal some Rambaldi artifacts?

115
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,551
She is a Derevko.

116
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,735
Her sisters possessed that same single-minded purpose.

117
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:08,157
If Jack is right,

118
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,466
if Elena has gathered Rambaldi artifacts,

119
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,038
her final step would be to assemble them.

120
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,503
We can't let that happen.

121
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,341
She never made it to the airport.

122
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,529
The cab dropped her off a few blocks from our house.

123
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,566
Have Marshall check traffic cams in the area.

124
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,906
I already did. I've also notified the FAA to check flight manifests,

125
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,031
and I updated train and bus stations with her current I.D.

126
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,553
Good. We will find her.

127
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:12,010
I brought her into my house. This is my fault.

128
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,343
No, Nadia. It's mine.

129
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,586
It was my obsession with Rambaldi that pulled you into this.

130
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,006
It's my mess.

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,395
It's my responsibility to clean it up.

132
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:27,003
I can only imagine how hard this must be for you -- the betrayal.

133
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,663
I'm just glad we found her.

134
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,935
That I know the truth.

135
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:32,777
Yeah.

136
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:38,111
So, if Elena has all the Rambaldi pieces, there is only one place she can go.

137
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,535
- To see Lazlo Drake.
- Yes.

138
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,433
I'm on it.

139
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,124
Nadia?

140
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,890
We'll find her. I promise you.

141
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,591
I will end this.

142
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,529
I don't understand.

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,915
Why are we in China when I already told you Rambaldi's sphere of life is buried in Siena?

144
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,280
Because I need answers to a few final questions.

145
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,010
Lazlo Drake is the only man in the world who can provide that.

146
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,930
  

147
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:21,748
  

148
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:26,024
Before he went into hiding, Drake was a professor of european history.

149
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:30,171
He built his reputation on the single most important discovery of his life --

150
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:33,088
a manuscript.

151
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:37,580
In effect a template describing how Rambaldi's creations were to be assembled

152
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,279
in order to bring forth his final prophecy.

153
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:46,731
Just know that we're going to make the world a better place,

154
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,250
and we need Drake to do it.

155
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,568
- Professor Drake, my name is...
- Arvin Sloane. Yes.

156
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:56,951
You know who I am?

157
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,669
How could I possibly not know of you, Mr. Sloane?

158
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:04,005
Your appetite for all things Rambaldi is almost legendary.

159
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:06,001
This is my daughter Nadia.

160
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,032
My god.

161
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:13,417
I am honored to meet you.

162
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:14,673
Thanks.

163
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,409
Lovely.

164
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,350
Please.

165
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:33,127
You have no idea what it is like to be in your presence.

166
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,878
It is like meeting the virgin Mary.

167
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,323
- What do you mean?
- Drake, you know why we're here.

168
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:41,655
You have collected the sphere of life.

169
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,838
No, not yet, but we know where it is.

170
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:48,949
If it is not in your possession, we have nothing to discuss.

171
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:52,189
You have the only known translation of Rambaldi's vademecum --

172
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,429
instructions for how the pieces fit together. I need to know.

173
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:01,014
That is information I will share with whomever has all the artifacts in his possession.

174
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,003
Your visit is premature, Mr. Sloane.

175
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:06,483
I suggest you come back when you have retrieved all the items,

176
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:08,765
including the sphere.

177
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,023
You will come back, too, won't you?

178
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,868
I would like that.

179
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:20,145
Nadia, I wonder if you would let me speak to the professor alone.

180
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:26,459
I never thought I would see, let alone touch with my own hands,

181
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,732
a living embodiment.

182
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:34,239
- My daughter is not an artifact.
- So protective of her?

183
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,661
She is my daughter.

184
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,046
You brought her on this journey for one reason --

185
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:42,740
only she can retrieve the sphere of life.

186
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:47,481
Only she knows its secret location.

187
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,621
You know that.

188
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:57,344
I didn't come this far to quit.

189
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:05,084
This is it.

190
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:33,183
Rambaldi wrote that a man would come and discover the true meaning of his work,

191
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,140
and in doing so would change the world.

192
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,632
I always wanted to be that man.

193
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,481
It's made of glass.

194
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,080
Think of it.

195
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:31,730
You and I are the first ones to set foot in here in almost 500 years.

196
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,850
Do you have any idea how many lesser people have dreamed of this moment?

197
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,127
And only you can complete this.

198
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:42,964
What?

199
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:48,862
Nadia, this is the part of the journey that I can't take.

200
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,758
You  have to bring the box.

201
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,583
I don't understand.

202
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,018
Rambaldi had a role for you to play.

203
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,382
I need you to do this, Nadia.

204
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,977
I need you to bring me that sphere.

205
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,381
Nadia...

206
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,818
we can change the world.

207
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,596
Go.

208
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,177
Go.

209
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:39,958
Have faith, sweetheart.

210
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:52,902
Yes.

211
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,453
Now, Nadia, bring the box to me.

212
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,057
You lied.

213
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,163
It was not about peace.

214
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,796
Nadia, I am your father.

215
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,556
You will go back there and bring me the box.

216
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,895
You get back there. I want that box.

217
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:35,050
You think you can control this power, but it's poisoning you. Don't you see it?

218
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,452
You don't have to do this. Please.

219
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:41,538
Let's just walk away, you and I, together.

220
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:44,310
Coward!

221
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,498
Please, let's just go.

222
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,249
I don't need you.

223
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,790
He chose me.

224
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:17,635
See?

225
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:05,921
You're still here.

226
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,350
Try not to talk. You've lost a lot of blood.

227
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,460
I didn't think that you would be here after I --

228
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:16,323
You're my father.

229
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,349
I'm going to get you out of here.

230
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:24,365
Thank you.

231
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,059
That shard of glass in your chest --

232
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:30,475
when I move you, it might kill you. I need to pull it out.

233
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:31,669
Okay.

234
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:50,244
Who's Lazlo Drake?

235
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:54,594
He is the self-appointed gatekeeper to Rambaldi's endgame.

236
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,957
For Elena to complete her plan, she will have to contact him.

237
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,924
He has what amounts to the instruction booklet.

238
00:18:60,000 --> 00:19:01,586
I'm sorry, maybe it's only me, but

239
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,744
what do you mean when you say "Rambaldi's endgame"?

240
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:06,170
I mean, what is it? Is it a scenario, a weapon?

241
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:08,932
In Elena's hands, most likely an apocalypse.

242
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,448
Which is why we need to get to Lazlo Drake before she does.

243
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:16,513
Drake's completely off the grid. The manuscript has made him a target.

244
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:18,253
He never stays in one place too long.

245
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,392
We saw him in China. He could be anywhere.

246
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:22,826
If Drake's gone underground, he needs a source of income.

247
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,395
That's the path I've been pursuing.

248
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,636
Greyson Wells, billionaire financier.

249
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:31,724
Organized crime, money laundering. CIA's been watching him for years.

250
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,490
He's also the man who financed most of Drake's early research into Rambaldi.

251
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,926
If they're in communication, he might know where to find Drake.

252
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,824
Agreed. Coordinate with ops. Draft up a plan to approach Wells.

253
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,086
I'll start preparations to talk to Lazlo Drake myself as soon as we have his location.

254
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,745
I believe you're forbidden from participating in cases involving this particular subject matter.

255
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:54,079
- Agent Dixon has a point.
- Yes, I'm aware of the agreement.

256
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,790
- But I have a history with Drake.
- So does Nadia.

257
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:59,742
I'm sure Nadia would agree that her presence would only complicate matters.

258
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,004
He's right.

259
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:03,739
Drake will talk to me.

260
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:06,454
If we approach this tactically, his security force will respond.

261
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:10,047
We cannot let this turn into a firefight. Our timetable is too critical.

262
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,274
Proceed as instructed.

263
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:18,210
Once you have a location on Drake, you'll relay it to director Sloane.

264
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,144
That's it, people. Be safe.

265
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,578
Don't touch the fur.

266
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,244
All right, you may touch the fur.

267
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,258
Once.

268
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:13,637
Please let me know if there is anything in particular

269
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:14,948
that you would like to see.

270
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:17,944
Ahh. Very good.

271
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:20,181
Platinum Liana.

272
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:26,179
Fully paired with the flawless brilliance.

273
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,745
Can be worn as either a bracelet or an anklet.

274
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,096
Put.

275
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:44,269
What do you think, ankle or wrist?

276
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,451
Well, to be honest, I've always found anklets to be a bit vulgar,

277
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,923
though admittedly you are making me rethink my position.

278
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:56,780
I think I'd have to see it on your wrist before I gave an informed opinion.

279
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,955
Do.

280
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,434
Something wrong?

281
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:24,963
It appears we have a mutual interest.

282
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,013
So it seems.

283
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:42,732
Hmm. Better as a bracelet.

284
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,695
Will you allow me to buy it for you?

285
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,601
You trying to impress me?

286
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,567
Well, that depends. Is it working?

287
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:57,589
Sweetheart, it's not your money I'm interested in.

288
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:01,916
I'm going with you to see Drake.

289
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,204
This is not your call, Sydney.

290
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:06,123
It is now. I have his location. I'll go alone if I have to.

291
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,759
Well, he's not gonna talk to you.

292
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,439
Then I suggest you get on a plane.

293
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:13,077
Solana airfield outside Mexico City, 0800 hours.

294
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:16,084
I'll be there when you land, and we'll go see Drake together.

295
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:23,007
Thank you.

296
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:46,428
Well, all the parts are pretty generic.

297
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,523
I mean, it'd be really difficult to track where it came from.

298
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:51,221
Sorry.

299
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:52,058
It's all right.

300
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,428
I  just feel stupid I trusted her.

301
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:58,727
Hey, I don't blame you. I mean, she was like family.

302
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,941
You know, but don't put this on yourself. I mean,

303
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,551
hell, I trusted Sloane for six years before I found out he was evil.

304
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:06,598
You know...

305
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,945
not that he's evil, per se...

306
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:15,565
We have a long history together.

307
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:20,702
Look, we're gonna find this Sophia/Elena woman person.

308
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,115
Your dad's totally on it.

309
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,667
This is a reckless course of action.

310
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:43,616
Try calculated.

311
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,077
I'm not letting you meet with a man who's gonna tell you how to put the Rambaldi contraption together.

312
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,237
That's ridiculous.

313
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:51,060
I had everything I needed last year, and I gave it up. You know that, Sydney.

314
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,342
You didn't have everything.

315
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:54,492
You're putting yourself in danger by coming with me.

316
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:55,781
I know what I'm doing.

317
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:57,145
I just hope you do,

318
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,776
because I swear if this is about you and your twisted beliefs --

319
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,375
Do you have any idea what Nadia's been through?

320
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:02,944
Betrayed by the woman who raised her.

321
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,389
I would never do anything to put her in any more pain.

322
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,256
I'm here for one reason alone --

323
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,444
to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.

324
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,555
I wish I could believe you.

325
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:32,341
Looks cozy.

326
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:44,263
Elena got here before us.

327
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:55,343
It's Drake.

328
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,183
He's dead, isn't he?

329
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,232
If I didn't have to rendezvous with you, I would have been here hours ago.

330
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,654
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have to be here at all.

331
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,448
What are you doing?

332
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,301
See if you can rewind the feed.

333
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:08,465
Here, let's start over again at the beginning.

334
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:12,072
I have to admit, I did not think it would be you.

335
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,168
You thought Arvin Sloane would have all the artifacts.

336
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,792
He nearly completed the work once before.

337
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:19,678
And failed.

338
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,502
He threw it away.

339
00:27:22,358 --> 00:27:24,124
And for what?

340
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,701
The girl.

341
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:30,544
Do you have a secure facility to assemble everything?

342
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:34,452
I do. A factory outside of --

343
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:40,210
I'm sorry, Sydney. I'm so sorry.

344
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:51,509
Sloane tranqued me. That bastard knocked me out before I could get Elena's location.

345
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,167
Are you all right?

346
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,982
I saw this coming, and he still beat me.

347
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:56,207
Sydney, are you sure you're okay?

348
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,395
Dad, I'm okay.

349
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,930
I'll notify director Chase. We'll find him.

350
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:02,392
Agent Dixon.

351
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,486
Why didn't you stop Sloane when you had the chance?

352
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,435
I understand your reaction.

353
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:13,012
You just opened the door to temptation and let Sloane walk through it?

354
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:13,958
End of discussion.

355
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,913
Hey...

356
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,636
This man's taken lives.

357
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,617
I did what I thought was best.

358
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:32,053
I know.

359
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:41,232
In spite of all this, it's good to see you.

360
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:44,639
Yeah.

361
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:58,418
- Weekends aren't enough.
- Tell me about it.

362
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:04,945
Yes?

363
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,905
I had an idea, but you're gonna hate it.

364
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:08,722
You want me to talk to your aunt Katya.

365
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,104
How did you know that?

366
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,488
First you said I would hate the idea, and you're correct.

367
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:14,775
Second, I arrived at the same conclusion myself.

368
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:16,587
We're at a complete impasse here.

369
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,974
Time is running out, and she's the only Derevko we have.

370
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,841
Call your afterwards.

371
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,382
Lock the door behind me.

372
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,371
Is that look on your face supposed to be intimidating?

373
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:34,683
You forget, Jack --

374
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,435
I've seen your tender side.

375
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,561
I need everything you know about Elena's operations -- right now.

376
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:42,007
What makes you think I know anything?

377
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,444
Call it an instinct.

378
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:47,165
Do you intend to torture me?

379
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:48,719
If I have to.

380
00:29:50,217 --> 00:29:53,365
While I know that would be enjoyable for both of us,

381
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:57,858
I should warn you, I have quite a bit of stamina.

382
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,029
But you already know that about me.

383
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,641
What do you want, Katya?

384
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,095
Full pardon. Immediate release.

385
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,281
- I don't have that authority.
- You'll find a way.

386
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:12,371
If the information you provide leads us to Elena,

387
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,169
I will do everything in my power to procure your freedom. You have my word.

388
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:18,827
If you're here,

389
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:21,729
my sister must be pursuing aggressive action.

390
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,892
What has she done?

391
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:25,793
She broke into the DSR, stole a cache of Rambaldi artifacts.

392
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:29,589
She has been acquiring artifacts for several years now through her front.

393
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:32,707
- Her front?
- Don't look so surprised.

394
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:35,158
It has been happening right before your eyes.

395
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:37,850
The Covenant.

396
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,884
See? I knew you could do it, handsome.

397
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:44,307
Elena ran the Covenant? That's impossible. We dismantled its operations.

398
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,147
No, that's what she wanted you to believe.

399
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,127
You took down a straw man.

400
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:51,533
Elena's agenda's always been the same. It's always been Rambaldi.

401
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,973
- How do we stop her?
- You are asking the wrong sister.

402
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:59,990
Irina spent the last few years of her life tracking Elena.

403
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,183
She was determined to stop our sister from enacting her endgame.

404
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,166
And she would have done it, too, but...

405
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,782
you had to go and put a bullet in her head.

406
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,472
I was set up.

407
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,777
Elena put a hit out on Sydney, framed Irina for it.

408
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,288
Oh, I see.

409
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,759
So you executed my sister on a misunderstanding.

410
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,639
Oh, then all is forgiven.

411
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:29,739
Don't stand there pretending you're a patsy. You're too good at what you do.

412
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,238
If you pulled the trigger, part of you wanted to be manipulated.

413
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:39,378
I can help you find Elena, but unfortunately

414
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:42,341
I cannot tell you how to stop her.

415
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:45,255
Thanks to you, that hope died with Irina.

416
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,639
Sydney, listen carefully. Elena Derevko is in Prague.

417
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,024
Her base of operations is a decommissioned chemical facility south of the industrial zone.

418
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:02,361
And Katya knew that? She just gave you that location?

419
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,373
No, Katya never just gives anything.

420
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:07,668
But she tied Elena to the Covenant, knew she worked out of Europe.

421
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,380
Marshall and Vaughn were able to pinpoint her exact location

422
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:13,722
based on declassified KGB files and some thermal satellite imaging.

423
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,261
And you think we can trust her?

424
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,223
She's a Derevko.

425
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,549
I need you to get on a plane and rendezvous with Dixon and Nadia at Ruzyne airport.

426
00:32:21,634 --> 00:32:23,678
The cargo terminal. They have your ops plan.

427
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:24,869
I'm on my way.

428
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:54,822
My men think you're here to kill me.

429
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:56,669
You should hire smarter men.

430
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:05,734
You walk in, unarmed, and surrender yourself.

431
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:12,429
You're not the most convincing of assassins, so let me guess.

432
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:15,344
You're here to offer me a deal.

433
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,342
I know what you're trying to do.

434
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,919
I can help.

435
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:21,698
Thank god.

436
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:24,277
You're wise enough to see my value.

437
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:27,979
There's no one on this Earth who knows more about Milo Rambaldi.

438
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:30,923
I'd heard you reformed.

439
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:34,069
I suppose I've been born again.

440
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,773
Perimeter security has been disabled. Phoenix and team are on the move.

441
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,874
Copy, Phoenix. Director Chase has authorized shoot to kill.

442
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,469
Copy that.

443
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:52,631
Okay, now, we have the facility on thermal satellite.

444
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:54,412
Looks like there are about 40 people inside.

445
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,565
The blueprints we acquired were accurate.

446
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,542
There are three main areas to secure.

447
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,649
Understood.

448
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:02,524
- Sydney, be careful.
- Copy. Let's move.

449
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,768
The prisoner, right?

450
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:05,660
Come on.

451
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,045
Yes, of course. I'm bringing her down.

452
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,871
Transferring prisoner.

453
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:36,481
I was as surprised as you are.

454
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:37,517
Drop your weapon.

455
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,695
No, Marcus, drop yours.

456
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,152
I said drop your weapon, Sloane!

457
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,332
I got 'em. Pinpointing a location.

458
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:55,973
They're at the loading dock. East side of the building.

459
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,111
Put your weapon on the ground.

460
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,971
I warned Sydney. I warned all of you not to do this.

461
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:02,291
I mean it.

462
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,571
Please, Marcus, it's too big now.

463
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:07,573
You can't stop this. Only I can.

464
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,054
- You'll have to trust me.
- Trust you?

465
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,233
Get out of here now.

466
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:34,709
Outrigger, report.

467
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:37,991
Outrigger, report!

468
00:36:49,232 --> 00:36:50,231
Time to leave.

469
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:13,230
Dixon!

470
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:18,145
Evergreen to base. We need an emergency medical extraction.

471
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,525
We have a man down. Repeat, we have a man down.

472
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:21,790
Dixon.

473
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,189
If anything changes, you call me.

474
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,359
Did you have any idea she and Dixon...

475
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:04,977
No.

476
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,298
But then I tend to miss those kinds of details.

477
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:11,109
What are you talking about? You're the master of details.

478
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:11,976
Really?

479
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,293
I've gone over the details a thousand times in my mind.

480
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,198
Each one added up to the same conclusion--

481
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:24,062
that your life was in danger and your mother was the lethal threat.

482
00:38:24,645 --> 00:38:26,310
Dad, we've gone over this. You don't need --

483
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:29,192
I've lived my life trusting in the veracity of details,

484
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:32,665
and in doing so I lost sight of the one thing I know to be true.

485
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,897
Your mother would never hurt you.

486
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:40,262
She was ready to shut Elena down, and I killed her.

487
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,694
- She was our only hope.
- That's not true.

488
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:47,553
We can stop them.

489
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:49,419
I know it.

490
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,759
You and I may disagree on a lot of things,

491
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,648
but I never question your motives.

492
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,903
You always have my best interests at heart. I know that.

493
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:05,060
How's Nadia feeling?

494
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,253
I don't think she's feeling much of anything right now.

495
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:22,052
How could you let Sydney and Nadia follow?

496
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,565
Everything is proceeding as planned.

497
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:26,559
You talk the talk,

498
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,811
but I'm still not convinced you've returned to the fold.

499
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:37,438
We'll see if you have what it takes to finish the journey.

500
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:49,958
How's Dixon?

501
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,650
The same. Sydney and Nadia are there now.

502
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:58,855
You asked me a question earlier that I didn't get a chance to answer properly.

503
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:00,331
I'd say the answer was loud and clear.

504
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,672
We're more alike than I care to admit, agent Vaughn.

505
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,268
And I realize now that in disapproving of you

506
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:08,793
I was only hating my own limitations.

507
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,009
I wasn't asking myself what would be best for Sydney.

508
00:40:15,507 --> 00:40:18,682
If you honestly believe that you can make my daughter happy,

509
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:23,035
then by all means you have my blessing to marry her.

510
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:29,289
Okay then.

511
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,072
You always knew my father would do this.

512
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:44,414
I hoped he wouldn't.

513
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:50,337
Despite everything, I really believed that he chose me.

514
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,826
You must think I'm pretty foolish.

515
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,206
Of course not.

516
00:40:55,944 --> 00:40:56,838
He's your father.

517
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:01,743
Agent Bristow, agent Santos, he's asking for you.

518
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:15,261
Dixon?

519
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:18,034
We have been so worried about you.

520
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:22,378
Before I saw Sloane...

521
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:27,327
I saw a prisoner...

522
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:30,386
shackled.

523
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:35,836
Syd...

524
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:41,879
it's your mother.

525
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,236
She's alive.

526
