1
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:10,266
- Who are you?
- It's a pity you'll never know.

2
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:17,853
Sloane is part of this.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,260
He works with Prophet Five.

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,052
This is my chance to stop him.

5
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:23,510
We were expecting
to hear from you sooner.

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,233
I ran into a few complications.

7
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:26,513
And Sydney?

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,011
She's dead.

9
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,414
Langley can't know what Sydney's doing.

10
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,300
We should continue to act
on the assumption

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,702
that Prophet Five has moles
inside the C.I.A.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,453
Contact Michael Linz in Berlin.

13
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,967
He'll send the body back.

14
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,051
I'll get right on it.

15
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:42,962
Come with me.

16
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,371
Anna's dead.
Sydney seized the opportunity

17
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,800
to infiltrate Prophet Five.

18
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,573
Sydney's presenting herself as Anna?

19
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:49,721
Do you think that's wise?

20
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,640
It was Sydney's call.
I wasn't consulted.

21
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:52,633
What's your status?

22
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,282
We'll be up and running in a minute.

23
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,711
Sydney embedded a tracker into the chip
that Anna was tasked to retrieve.

24
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,300
We'll be able to follow her from here.

25
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,531
We suspect Prophet Five
had intended for Anna to do

26
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:04,951
some task only Sydney could perform.
Learning what that is

27
00:01:05,026 --> 00:01:07,182
may be an opportunity
to determine their endgame.

28
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,853
- That's if they believe Sydney is Anna.
- I know.

29
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:11,260
Patching Vaughn through.

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,940
<i>Vaughn, can you hear me?</i>

31
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:16,172
You're clear.

32
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,231
Where is he?

33
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:20,543
Hamburg. He and Sydney uncovered
a storeroom of information...

34
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,930
material that Vaughn
and Renée Rienne's fathers gathered

35
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,561
during their investigation of Prophet 5.

36
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:25,542
You'll join Vaughn.

37
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:28,191
Transmit the documentation back here
for analysis.

38
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:29,493
Vaughn, it's Dixon.

39
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:31,170
It's good to hear your voice.

40
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,111
You, too.

41
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:33,110
I'll see you soon.

42
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:34,421
<i>Marshall, how we doing?</i>

43
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,421
I'm triangulating the coordinates.
Just give me a sec.

44
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,122
You know, I cried at your funeral.

45
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,892
- Sorry about that.
- No, no, thank you.

46
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,601
I need a good cry now and again.

47
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,090
Okay, tracker's hot.

48
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:53,891
Got her. There she is.

49
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:57,880
<i>She's on...</i>

50
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,473
Tiergartenstrasse.

51
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:06,233
I have the chip in hand.

52
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,651
Of course. We're en route now.

53
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:15,372
Our superiors were quite pleased
with your performance.

54
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,972
You seem surprised.

55
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:18,790
Not at all.

56
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,010
Your reputation's well-deserved.

57
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:24,283
To the great Anna Espinosa.

58
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:27,751
"Great" seems a little strong,
doesn't it?

59
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,480
Don't tell me you're getting modest.

60
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,492
It's this body.

61
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:36,380
I have this uncontrollable urge now
to act like a girl scout all the time.

62
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,681
Well, let's get you back to Zurich

63
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,011
before you start trying
to sell me cookies.

64
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,863
I'm sure our superiors are eager
to get their hands on that.

65
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,090
This?

66
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,252
This is an inconvenience.

67
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:51,802
Nothing more.

68
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,940
- What just happened?
- I'm not sure.

69
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,293
I think the tracker crashed.

70
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,302
Crashed? What does that mean, crashed?

71
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,102
- We've lost Sydney.
- Marshall, find her!

72
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,863
I can't. I think it must've fritzed out.

73
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,170
Patch into a traffic cam.

74
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,822
Do something! Just find her!

75
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,201
Don't worry, I'm on it.

76
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,171
Okay, I got her.

77
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,540
<i>They're headed south on A7.</i>

78
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:22,673
The airport.

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,013
Marshall, I'm on Doverkamp,
headed east. I need directions.

80
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:30,353
Wait, give me a sec.
Left at the next intersection.

81
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,041
You're closing in.

82
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,732
Marshall, I'm gonna need
a green light in a hurry.

83
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,610
Easier said than done.
It's all in German.

84
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,481
- Anschlag?
- Grun. Green.

85
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,383
Shall we?

86
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:26,511
You finished the translation of page 47.

87
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,682
"The circle will be complete,"

88
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:32,901
"when the chosen one
finds the rose in San Cielo."

89
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:34,991
Congratulations, Mr. Sloane.

90
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,070
Thanks to your work,
we're closer than we've ever been

91
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,573
to comprehending Rambaldi's
greatest mystery.

92
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:43,700
You understand the meaning
of the deciphered message?

93
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:45,442
Enough to proceed.

94
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,171
However, I do have one concern.

95
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,053
Rambaldi's prophecies
have always taken into account

96
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,502
the smallest variables.

97
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,780
This is a man who predicted events
hundreds of years before we were born.

98
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,172
The rose in question is indeed unique...

99
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,810
as unique as Sydney herself.

100
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,122
What is unclear, however,

101
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,263
is whether Anna Espinosa,
posing as Sydney,

102
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,190
is  able to complete the task.

103
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:13,371
Well, then I guess you've got your work
cut out for you.

104
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:20,253
After you.

105
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,380
Sloane's here.

106
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:29,943
Of course.

107
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:33,050
You didn't think we'd dispose of him
this soon, did you?

108
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,521
I  hear your mission was a success.

109
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:40,011
I suppose I should offer you
congratulations.

110
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:41,323
Thank you.

111
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:44,131
Did you encounter any complications?

112
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:46,072
Just one.

113
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:49,091
But I've dealt with her
once and for all.

114
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,513
We should celebrate, Arvin.

115
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,332
Sydney Bristow is dead.

116
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:59,933

Transcript: Raceman
www.forom.com

118
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,531
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?

119
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,153
So this is why you needed her.

120
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,232
Or should I say me?

121
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,653
In his prophecies, Rambaldi referred
to Sydney as "the chosen one."

122
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,582
He foretold that she would bring forth
his final works.

123
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,353
And you really believe that...

124
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,811
that a man who lived 500 years ago

125
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,940
had intentions for Sydney Bristow?

126
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,861
Excuse me.

127
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,960
I may be mistaken,

128
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:01,551
but I always believed you
to be a follower of Rambaldi's works.

129
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:04,563
Only when it suits my checkbook.

130
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm not someone who'd guide my life
by some perverted sense of faith.

131
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:16,380
But as long as I have to look like this,
I might as well make some use of it.

132
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,642
What does Rambaldi want me to do?

133
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,102
Retrieve an artifact from San Cielo...

134
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,752
A monastery outside Rome.

135
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:31,302
Monastery? That sounds fun.

136
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,753
Do I get to wear a habit?

137
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,792
I think I've told you
all you need to know for now.

138
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,633
We leave within the hour.

139
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:42,623
Does this mean you're sending me
to my room?

140
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,262
There's a change of clothes for you
upstairs.

141
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:47,261
Second door on the left.

142
00:07:56,116 --> 00:08:00,003
Sadly, he did, yeah. Can you imagine
what happened when they got home?

143
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:01,523
Could I steal you for a sec?

144
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,532
The new encryption module
for the comms...

145
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,673
...think my math is wrong.

146
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,367
Go ahead. I can handle this.

147
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:08,240
She'll be back in a second.

148
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,463
Didn't Langley just convert
all of our comms to...

149
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:14,991
This isn't about the comms.

150
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,811
Marshall, what's going on?

151
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,990
Last week, when Sloane infiltrated
the network,

152
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:22,571
I built a bot to monitor the servers,
you know, flag any abnormal activity?

153
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,072
This morning a message came through
this office without any I.D. Tags.

154
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,623
Intended for Allen Korman.

155
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:30,681
Korman?

156
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,103
- You mean the guy that...
- Yeah, him.

157
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,020
I mean, why would Tom be contacting
a guy who killed his wife ?

158
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:37,211
So, I did some digging.

159
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,570
Travel itinerary.
Korman's flying into L.A. Tonight.

160
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,233
This doesn't make any sense.

161
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,230
Look, I talked to Tom myself.

162
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,693
He said he came to Korman
to confront him,

163
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,193
but when he saw Korman with his family,
he changed his mind.

164
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:53,163
Rachel, Korman doesn't have any family.

165
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:54,732
I checked.

166
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:57,570
Tom's been lying to you.

167
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:00,870
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you first, but...

168
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:02,421
I have to tell Mr. Bristow.

169
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,930
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we have to.

170
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:06,630
Look, you said it yourself...
The contact is anonymous...

171
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:07,790
Tom is not a bad guy!

172
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:10,143
- How do you know that ?
- Because I know.

173
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,162
Look,

174
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,663
just let me check into it first.

175
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:18,991
Give me 24 hours.

176
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:22,992
I promise, if we don't have an answer
by then, we'll go to Jack together.

177
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,801
All right. 24 hours.

178
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,422
<i>Hey, it's me. I don't have much time.</i>

179
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,871
- Where are you?
- Zurich. An estate, highly secure.

180
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:03,973
Sloane is here.

181
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:07,770
- What is he telling you?
- That page 47 references San Cielo...

182
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,193
A monastery outside Rome.
We're going there.

183
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,562
Where are you?

184
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:15,181
Right now, in your kitchen,
playing with Isabelle.

185
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,591
You are?

186
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,960
<i>How is she?</i>

187
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,321
Happy.

188
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:23,683
- Dad, did she just...
<i>- Giggle? Yeah.</i>

189
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,721
Apparently, I'm funny.

190
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,243
She hasn't done that before.

191
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:30,180
That was a first.

192
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:33,860
Of which there will be many.

193
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,873
<i>I know.</i>

194
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,931
I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.

195
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,370
If you learn anything more...

196
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,631
<i>I have to go. Tell Isabelle I love her.</i>

197
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,620
You  ready?

198
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:54,502
Hey.

199
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,061
Hey.

200
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:01,531
You're shorter than I remember.

201
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,060
This is all regarding Prophet Five?

202
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,712
This entire bunker contains
evidence of...

203
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,791
mysterious  deaths, assassinations,
car bombings,

204
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,860
all of them involving people
who were investigating Prophet Five.

205
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:19,502
They basically killed anyone
who got too close.

206
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:21,023
But they didn't get you.

207
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,050
No. They might have, if not for Jack.

208
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:25,863
When I was in the hospital,

209
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,911
he convinced me that Prophet Five
wouldn't rest

210
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,530
until they killed me, and that I was
in no condition to fight back.

211
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,180
How'd he manage it?

212
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,500
Sodium morphate.

213
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,681
It slowed down my body functions
to a point that mimicked death.

214
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:41,881
Apparently, I spent four hours
in a drawer at the morgue

215
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:45,500
waiting for Jack's contact reach me
to administer the antidote.

216
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,780
Then a couple days of traveling
before I made it to Nepal.

217
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:54,332
You know, it's funny, it's the 1st time
I ever felt Jack accepted me.

218
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:58,883
Or else, he manufactured
a very elaborate scheme

219
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,271
to postpone your wedding
to his daughter.

220
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,352
I have something for you.

221
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,000
Fortunately,
she looks more like her mother.

222
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,122
Yeah, she does.

223
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,122
Dixon, thank you.

224
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:29,813
Yeah, Jack.

225
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,311
Of course.

226
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,582
We'll contact you when we arrive.

227
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,493
Jack's sending a team
to box all this up.

228
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,132
Sydney's en route with Sloane.

229
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,460
We're gonna provide backup.

230
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:41,782
Where are they headed?

231
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,001
Rome.

232
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,500
Well...

233
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,712
I made our arrangements.

234
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,863
Your contact will be meeting you
on the ground.

235
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,702
He'll provide you with access
to San Cielo.

236
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,871
No more than I need to know.

237
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:11,913
Well,

238
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,410
I am sure you have questions.

239
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,690
So do I.

240
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,502
Tell me...

241
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,133
How did it happen?

242
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,543
How did I kill Sydney?

243
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:30,371
Why do you care?

244
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,800
Sydney was a remarkable agent.

245
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,951
I imagine it wasn't easy.

246
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,593
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.

247
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,400
She was just a person...

248
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:51,801
who deserved nothing more
than to be shot in the back...

249
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,041
and so she was.

250
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:58,942
The Chosen One.

251
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,441
She died just as easy as anyone.

252
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:06,940
I see.

253
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:09,751
Well, thank you.

254
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,010
We'll be landing shortly.

255
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,610
I know what you have planned
for Anna after this mission is over.

256
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:35,470
You have reservations?

257
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,501
Oh, no.

258
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:42,323
I want to be the one who kills her.

259
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,281
You smell nice.

260
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,373
So we looked into
the monastery San Cielo.

261
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:17,430
- You're sure about that name?
- Yeah, why?

262
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:20,830
Marshall couldn't find any record of it.

263
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,832
I'm  meeting someone inside the O.T.B.

264
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:25,070
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.

265
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:28,452
I saw a picture of Isabelle.

266
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,082
I don't know how we do this anymore.

267
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,391
We do it the way we've always done it.

268
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,272
It's the only way to keep her safe.

269
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:39,821
We end this.

270
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,672
Okay.

271
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,390
Dixon and I will have your back.

272
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:52,033
If anything happens,
we're gonna pull you out.

273
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,733
So who's this contact?

274
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,641
Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.

275
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,052
Syd, be careful.

276
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:25,480
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

277
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:29,352
If you want my advice,
take Tokyo Rose in the third.

278
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:30,653
It's a sure bet.

279
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,442
Julian, last time I saw you,
it was at Venice...

280
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:38,990
where, as I recall,
you betrayed me to the C.I.A.

281
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,402
They took me into custody.

282
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,352
And yet, Anna, here you are.

283
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,540
Looking better than ever.

284
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:53,150
That's, for a year spent
in a federal holding facility.

285
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,093
Now what was that one for?

286
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:05,851
I'll get back to you.

287
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:07,871
Right.

288
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:11,002
So what are you drinking?

289
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,702
Did you find him?

290
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,051
The Cardinal?

291
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,020
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

292
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,981
I'm gonna give you to "three"
to start talking.

293
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,131
Not here.

294
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:56,822
Somebody might be watching.

295
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:10,650
I didn't lie to you.

296
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,311
Korman killed my wife.

297
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,013
But the order came from somebody else.

298
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,503
The closest I've gotten is a name...
The Cardinal.

299
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:21,183
Well, you two seem to be pretty chummy.

300
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,151
He works freelance.

301
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:25,462
We did a job once...

302
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:27,301
deep cover op.

303
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,460
He doesn't even know my real name.

304
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,711
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.

305
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:37,493
She was a schoolteacher.

306
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:41,061
She wasn't a part of this life.

307
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,401
If somebody wanted to hurt me,

308
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,493
why didn't they just come after me?

309
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:48,453
And Korman knows?

310
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,593
He does now.

311
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,991
He found The Cardinal.

312
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,510
What does he want?

313
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,453
- Money?
- His car...

314
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:00,150
it was seized
when he turned himself in to witsec.

315
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:02,012
You could've told me, tom.

316
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,720
I would've kept it to myself.

317
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,813
No, I couldn't have.

318
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,622
I've spent four years,

319
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:10,333
and this is as close as I've got
to an answer.

320
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,052
I couldn't trust anybody.

321
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,503
If I hack into the federal database,

322
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,443
I should be able to find the car.

323
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,880
I couldn't ask you to do that.

324
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:29,912
You didn't.

325
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:44,930
It's Sark.

326
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,331
The contact?

327
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,650
Yep.

328
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,981
Better the enemy you know...

329
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,590
She can handle Sark.

330
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,322
Another?

331
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,483
Perhaps you shouldn't.

332
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,052
We're on the clock.

333
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,490
We are.

334
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:10,811
Here I thought we were just
catching up on old times.

335
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:15,120
Well, in that case, maybe it's time
you fill me in on the plan.

336
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,020
What has Sloane told you?

337
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:19,103
Just  that our target is San Cielo.

338
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:21,492
Well, that's not entirely true.

339
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,653
The rose that you're suppose to acquire,

340
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,213
if you're to believe page 47,

341
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:28,683
is being held in a facility
known by Rambaldi as San Cielo.

342
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,421
The rest of the world now refers to it

343
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:32,510
as La Fossa maximum security prison.

344
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,931
We're breaking into a prison?

345
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,930
According to Sloane, Milo Rambaldi,

346
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:41,080
in the days leading up
to his execution, was held there.

347
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:44,781
He believes he hid the rose
in the northwest isolation wing.

348
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,231
The text specifies
that only the Chosen One

349
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,332
can obtain the item in question.

350
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,203
I guess you'll have to do.

351
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:18,880
An explosion?

352
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:23,751
I suggest you take cover.

353
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:58,382
Wait, this is your plan
for getting us into La Fossa?

354
00:21:58,768 --> 00:21:59,761
Yes.

355
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:00,810
Grazzie.

356
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,740
Follow my lead, will you?

357
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:44,751
Have you been able to access
the prison's internal network?

358
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:47,743
Not yet. Vaughn and Dixon
are moving through the sewers now.

359
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:51,153
Right here--prison internet connection
runs out through a junction box.

360
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:52,561
It should be vulnerable.

361
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:54,310
Merlin, you there?

362
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:55,803
<i>Yeah, Vaughn, go ahead.</i>

363
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,963
We're about 70 meters in.
Still no sign of the junction box.

364
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:01,062
You're almost directly
under the switch room.

365
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:02,761
- <i>You should be close.</i>
- Got it.

366
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,291
It's a standard IP-X node.

367
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:06,151
<i>Good. You should be able
to splice the line</i>

368
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,542
- <i>and access the surveillance feeds.</i>
- Doing that now.

369
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,582
<i>Do it quickly.</i>

370
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,082
I don't like the idea Sydney being

371
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:14,010
in a maximum security prison
with Sark as her backup.

372
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:42,513
Being my friend
will make your time more pleasurable.

373
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:49,570
Lucky for you, I won't be here for long.

374
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:53,150
Otherwise, I'd pull out your tongue
and choke you with it.

375
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:28,483
You realize we just broke
about a half dozen federal laws.

376
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:32,542
Unless they moved it, Korman's car
should be right down this aisle.

377
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,111
Look, just stay low,
check for V.I.N. Numbers.

378
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,823
You ready? Let's go.

379
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,221
This is it.

380
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:54,511
This shouldn't take long.

381
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:56,290
Can I help?

382
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,713
Yeah,
just keep an eye out for the guard.

383
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,662
Is there any particular reason

384
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:14,522
you're connecting
the carburetor to the intake tube?

385
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,872
This is the carburetor?

386
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:17,232
Yeah.

387
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,413
Maybe, uh,
I should keep an eye out for the guard.

388
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:26,321
All right. You should be tied in now.

389
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,091
Yeah, we're hot.

390
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:29,352
<i>You getting a picture?</i>

391
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:30,541
Copy. It's coming through.

392
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,900
See if you can isolate
the women's block.

393
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:37,080
Wait a minute. Was that...
was that the women's showers?

394
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,362
No, that's men.

395
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,661
Definitely men.

396
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:42,011
There she is.

397
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,571
Wait a minute. She's in isolation.

398
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,451
You think that's part of a plan?

399
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:49,940
We have to hope so.

400
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:58,691
Hold him down.

401
00:25:58,836 --> 00:25:59,693
This is gonna hurt.

402
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,472
Marshall, what happened?

403
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,213
- Did we lose the signal?
- I don't know.

404
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:22,281
Everything just went wacky.
We've been kicked out.

405
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,773
Looks like somebody else
is trying to hack into the system.

406
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:25,793
Sark.

407
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,431
Is there any way to regain our tap?

408
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:28,783
We have to keep track of her.

409
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,571
You could look for the alarm lines
and then

410
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:32,810
<i>try to cross-wind 'em
and get a Von Eck signal.</i>

411
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:34,400
Know what he's talking about?

412
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:35,403
50%.

413
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,352
This is it.

414
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:16,762
Sark, where are you?

415
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:30,031
I've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

416
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,651
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

417
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:40,940
I can't imagine confusing you
with anyone else.

418
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:47,000
As difficult as this must be
for you to understand...

419
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,102
I know you.

420
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:52,902
We've never met.

421
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:55,620
No. We haven't.

422
00:28:57,526 --> 00:28:58,931
We don't have much time.

423
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,180
Come with me.

424
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:05,981
I'm not going anywhere with you
unless you tell me who you are.

425
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:18,583
"The circle will be complete
when the chosen one finds the rose."

426
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:27,522
I am the rose.

427
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,931
Now...

428
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,523
if you will come with me...

429
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,460
And, Mr. Harvey, how can I help you?

430
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,020
You have two suspects in custody

431
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:49,561
who are wanted fugitives
from my country,

432
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,621
and we would like
to have them extradited

433
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:53,463
with your permission, of course.

434
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,840
Then I'm afraid we have a problem.

435
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:57,232
Why is that, sir?

436
00:29:57,387 --> 00:30:01,420
These two have committed crimes
on Italian land,

437
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:07,300
and I cannot possibly release them
before their first judicial hearing.

438
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,561
But you could release them

439
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:12,050
if you got the permission
of the general prosecutor,

440
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:13,171
Adriana Micelli.

441
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,101
Well, yes, of course.

442
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,311
But signora Micelli...

443
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:22,653
Mrs. Micelli is expecting your call.

444
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,222
Pronto.

445
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:40,110
Signora Micelli, Buongiorno.

446
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,851
Well...
looks like we may be almost there.

447
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,852
I was supposed to meet her.

448
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:53,912
Who?

449
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:55,311
My wife...

450
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:58,921
night she died.

451
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:04,773
It was our half-year anniversary.

452
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:08,531
I was gonna pick her up at work...

453
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:11,392
take her out to dinner.

454
00:31:14,436 --> 00:31:16,461
But contact called.

455
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:19,803
I never made it.

456
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:25,013
I was working five investigations,

457
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,442
and maybe I screwed up,

458
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:30,922
got my stories confused.

459
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:36,223
Or maybe somebody from my past...

460
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:39,883
revenge.

461
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:44,083
I don't know.

462
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:47,722
You'll find out so enough.

463
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:52,833
Thanks for doing this.

464
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:56,412
Honestly...

465
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,613
this is the closest thing I've had

466
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:02,012
to a night out since I joined the C.I.A.

467
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:09,591
You want to hop in and give me some gas?

468
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,253
Who did this?

469
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:56,251
You don't need me to tell you.

470
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:01,033
He told me you'd be coming.

471
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:05,592
All I had to do was wait.

472
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:28,082
This is yours for the time being.

473
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,361
What is it?

474
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,843
His greatest gift...

475
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:48,341
and also his greatest curse.

476
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,442
Meaning?

477
00:33:50,538 --> 00:33:56,101
What you hold in your hand is simply
a defiance of the natural order...

478
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:04,510
The end of nature itself.

479
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,991
Some very bad people
want what's in this amulet.

480
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:13,153
I can't stop them
if you don't tell me what it is.

481
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:14,943
You don't understand.

482
00:34:16,058 --> 00:34:17,670
You can't stop them.

483
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,160
You don't know me very well.

484
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:28,223
You're more charming
than I could have imagined.

485
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:32,291
I used to believe as you do,

486
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:35,433
that there were decisions to be made.

487
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:40,821
But in the end, it's just fate.

488
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:44,460
It's out of our hands.

489
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:48,471
And now it's just a matter of time.

490
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,773
A matter of time until what?

491
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:56,240
Until the stars fall from the sky.

492
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,153
Until the end of light.

493
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,970
You have gotten what you came for.

494
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,990
The guards will be making rounds soon.

495
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,353
You need to go.

496
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:13,152
Will you be all right?

497
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:17,561
I'm not a part of the battle to come.

498
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:19,870
Go.

499
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:29,591
Dixon, I got her.

500
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,151
I'll call you back.

501
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:36,202
Looks like she's heading back
to the women's block.

502
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,303
She must have got what she came for.

503
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:40,300
Maybe she's headed for extraction.

504
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,331
Good luck with this one.

505
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:47,483
He's all yours.

506
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,280
Thank you.

507
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:55,330
Where's Anna?

508
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,552
Anna won't be joining us.

509
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:07,991
Were you successful?

510
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:12,522
Tell me, Anna...

511
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,250
Did you retrieve the rose?

512
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:20,241
There was nothing there.

513
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:24,421
I don't believe you.

514
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:41,550
Sydney deserved better
than an anonymous bullet.

515
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:47,220
You didn't even have the courage
to face her.

516
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,060
At least I look you in the eye.

517
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:56,353
Marshall, talk to me!

518
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,890
There's a grate to the iso ward
about 30 yards ahead of you.

519
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:01,590
He'll never make it in time.
We need to distract Sloane!

520
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,163
Marshall, the surveillance feed
they're tapped into,

521
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,021
can we use it to get into
security controls?

522
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:10,202
Marshall, hurry!

523
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:13,733
Got it.

524
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:20,781
I don't die that easy.

525
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,113
Sir, we've had a breach.

526
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,830
You better get out of here.

527
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,642
Stay in your cell.

528
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:33,953
Stay back!

529
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:44,780
You okay?

530
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:47,202
Yeah, let's get out of here.

531
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,180
Thank you.

532
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:07,481
Why was the hit ordered on my wife?

533
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:11,221
If I tell you, you'll never let me
walk away from here.

534
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:12,233
You have my word.

535
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:14,962
I don't believe you.

536
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:17,593
Go ahead.

537
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:19,841
Shoot me.

538
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:23,200
First, tell me why she had to die.

539
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,393
Truth is, she was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

540
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:31,230
I don't understand.

541
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:35,103
My information said
you were picking her up at her job.

542
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,643
I was waiting
t the bottom of the stairs.

543
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:40,672
You were supposed to be with her.

544
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:42,943
It was a mistake.

545
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,480
She died because I thought she was you.

546
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:50,311
I'm going to disappear now.

547
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:52,360
If you come after me, I'll know.

548
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:55,501
And I'll do what I set out to do
four years ago.

549
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,072
This is pretty amazing.

550
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:37,860
Have you ever seen anything so perfect?

551
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,073
No.

552
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,080
You did good.

553
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:51,002
Thanks.

554
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:54,463
You're gonna be just like your mom,
aren't you?

555
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:55,462
Oh, I hope not.

556
00:39:56,557 --> 00:40:00,650
I hope she's a doctor or a teacher

557
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:03,843
or just anything that does not involve
wearing a wig.

558
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:09,033
I don't know. I think she'd look
pretty cute in a little pink wig.

559
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:11,533
Maybe not.

560
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:19,023
You okay?

561
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:20,821
Yeah, it just...

562
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,573
I'm still a little sore, I guess.

563
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,512
We came so close, Vaughn.

564
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,212
Sloane and Prophet Five...

565
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,691
They're still out there.

566
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,290
Hey, I thought we agreed
tonight it's just us, okay?

567
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:47,801
Oh, my God.

568
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,173
All right, the snoring... it kills me.

569
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,610
Hello?

570
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:13,732
<i>It was you, Sydney.</i>

571
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,162
<i>Of course.</i>

572
00:41:15,277 --> 00:41:17,501
<i>How could I have ever thought otherwise?</i>

573
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:19,792
<i>I saw it in you the first time we met.</i>

574
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,760
<i>You're a survivor... just like me.</i>

575
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:25,501
</i>And now thanks to you,
I have everything I need.</i>

576
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:30,300
