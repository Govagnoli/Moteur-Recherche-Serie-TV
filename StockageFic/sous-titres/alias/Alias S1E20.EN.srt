1
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:05,523
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:10,486
Seven years ago, I was recruited by a
secret branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:14,490
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,701
When the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,418
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,630
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:34,677
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:38,722
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,517
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,563
My father.

13
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:57,366
- Do you value your life?
- Of course I value my life.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,119
Your actions would
indicate otherwise.

15
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:08,043
Listen, Jean, this business we have
to discuss is extremely sensitive.

16
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,504
What is it?

17
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,890
I know this has been difficult
for Arvin. My illness.

18
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:26,937
I look just like everyone else,
and I usually feel that way.

19
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,106
The fact is...

20
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,110
I won't be alive next Christmas.

21
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:37,698
Remember the vial of liquid
that Khasinau wanted?

22
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:42,411
We used it on the blank page.
It exposed Rambaldi's hidden text.

23
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,247
I've booked you on a flight
for tomorrow night.

24
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,626
- It'll be our last mission.
- Noah...

25
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,795
Let me prove to you that it can work.

26
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,503
I heard about Noah.

27
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,465
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,014
Hit the bag.

29
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,934
I killed a man.

30
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,565
Someone I cared about.

31
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,281
He was an assassin. If you hadn't
killed him, he'd have killed you.

32
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,825
Maybe. But I was the one
who forced the fight.

33
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,910
Hicks was a bad guy.

34
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,832
That's it. Push.

35
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,168
Nice combination.

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,508
But the truth is, it affects me,
never knowing who to trust.

37
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:22,219
Learning to expect betrayal,

38
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:27,099
plotting and secrecy
and hatred and anger.

39
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:32,313
It's becoming a part of me.

40
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,816
I am becoming what I despise.

41
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,197
I tell myself that I got into this
to bring Danny's killers to justice.

42
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:46,410
The truth is
I'm more interested in revenge.

43
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,913
I thought I could stay in control.

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,833
It's just gotten so twisted,
like with Khasinau.

45
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:57,671
The one goal I have is to find him,
so that I can find my mother.

46
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:03,636
But if I do that, if I can find
his trail and track him down,

47
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,971
it'll strengthen SD-6.

48
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,351
I got into this to bring them down,

49
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,647
and now I feel like
I'm on their side.

50
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:38,003
This is the world of SD-6
when we started, remember?

51
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,553
And here is what it looks like today.

52
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:55,354
And this doesn't even
take into account Badenweiler,

53
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,731
or stealing page 47
from Sloane's vault,

54
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:01,444
or the way you kept Khasinau
from getting that ampoule.

55
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,029
These are incredible
accomplishments.

56
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:11,120
Khasinau is out there somewhere.

57
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:15,332
- Yes.
- My mom is out there.

58
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:21,881
We will find them.

59
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,971
I have to go to class.

60
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,852
Wait.

61
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,326
Take care of yourself.

62
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,286
Thanks.

63
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,168
- Where was it?
- Behind the fridge.

64
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:03,172
- You say you saw it?
- No, I heard it scratching.

65
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,257
I'll go and get some traps.

66
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:09,887
No. We need a professional.
A hit man. Rats breed hourly.

67
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,055
Hello?

68
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,308
You disappoint me, Mr Tippin.

69
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,435
It's Litvack.

70
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,482
You have enough to publish.
You have nothing to fear.

71
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:26,320
I was kidnapped. The lives of people
I care about were threatened.

72
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,948
It's a bluff,
to scare you off the story.

73
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,534
It worked. I'm off it.

74
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:44,255
Just go away. Don't call me again.

75
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,883
Don't call anyone else again,
unless you want more people to die.

76
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,011
- It was Jack Bristow.
- What?

77
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:54,974
What was Jack Bristow?

78
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,352
Hello?

79
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,058
- We have rats.
- What?

80
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,561
In all likelihood. Possibly mice. Hi.

81
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:42,229
Hi.

82
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:46,400
- Mice isn't better than rats.
- They're rats, and they're huge.

83
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:49,153
The exterminator's coming.
Could you be here?

84
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,156
- No. I've got work.
- I have to cater a lunch for 30.

85
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:57,244
- I don't live here.
- Why are you here?

86
00:07:57,328 --> 00:08:00,790
- You don't pay any rent.
- Is this attack on Will?

87
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:03,083
Please, just do this for us.

88
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,755
OK, fine. I'll do it.

89
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:11,383
Rats are clever.
You have to out-think 'em.

90
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,552
You can't just leave out cheese.

91
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:17,598
You have to leave stuff they want.

92
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,934
It's the only way they'll come out.

93
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:22,520
Otherwise you're wasting your time.

94
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,731
I can't believe
I didn't think of this before.

95
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:29,485
- We can make Khasinau come to us.
- What are you thinking?

96
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,447
- The vial. The Rambaldi solution.
- The one the CIA has?

97
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:38,202
That's why he had a team break into
SD-6. He wants that solution.

98
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,622
With respect to Khasinau, I'd like to
suggest a course of action.

99
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:45,209
Quickly. I'm got a meeting
with the review team from NIC.

100
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:50,881
Remember the ampoule we got from
SD-6 that allowed us to read page 47?

101
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,052
I suggest a black-market sale,
third party.

102
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:58,305
Khasinau still thinks
that vial is in the SD-6 vault.

103
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,435
So we say there's another one.

104
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,313
Can we make him believe that?
Have to make it sound legit.

105
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:09,733
I know how. Last year
Sloane sent a team of agents

106
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:14,196
into the art museum in Algiers,
after a minister donated a collection

107
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,741
that Sloane believed
might contain Rambaldi artefacts.

108
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,828
- Why don't I know about this?
- The mission failed.

109
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,997
The agents were caught.

110
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,168
Before they could even be
questioned, SD-6 had them killed.

111
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:33,841
Say there was a break-in
at that museum this week.

112
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,010
It would be widely publicised.

113
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:39,263
Khasinau would start to hear
rumours of what was taken.

114
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,475
Including rumours
of an existing second ampoule.

115
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:45,478
Are you suggesting
I approve of theft?

116
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,438
We'd just be borrowing them.

117
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:52,026
We'd return everything we steal
after we make contact with Khasinau.

118
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:54,487
The whole point is to get noticed.

119
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,448
We? You're proposing to go with her?

120
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:02,119
I know I'm not a field agent, but
Agent Bristow will need back-up.

121
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,662
She trusts me.

122
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:07,958
We plan to go in as insurance agents,
offering to lower their premiums.

123
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,670
We'd inspect the security system
before we commit any coverage.

124
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:14,507
I downloaded the mission specs.

125
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,259
Alarm types at the museum,
activation points,

126
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:19,345
blueprints, everything.

127
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:22,139
This is our best shot at Khasinau.

128
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,475
Do it.

129
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:28,229
- You'll deal with the op tech?
- I'll take care of it.

130
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:32,233
I have to stop by the hospital.
Emily, she's not doing well.

131
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:38,781
Sick from the chemo. We heard that
from the bug in Sloane's study.

132
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,159
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,662
Thanks.

134
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:48,082
Could I get the number
for Druzinsky's Pest Control?

135
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,167
It's D-R-U...

136
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:53,254
Let me just get a pen.

137
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:59,885
Hold on just a minute.

138
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,763
Go.

139
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,932
323...

140
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,686
Naturally, the guy shows up. Sorry.

141
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,816
How are you doing?
Where's the problem?

142
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,696
We've got rats over here,
behind the refrigerator.

143
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,865
Let me see your rats.

144
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:32,126
Gnawed wood. Droppings.

145
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,840
These are rat droppings.

146
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,220
Kiill 'em, please.

147
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,973
You got kids?

148
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,434
No.

149
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,854
Household pets? Dogs? Cats?

150
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:54,690
Hello?

151
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,318
What? No, I don't have any pets.

152
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,112
Then I'd skip traps
and go right to baiting.

153
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,576
This will be your only warning.

154
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:17,087
Sydney.

155
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,929
I don't know if you feel well enough
to eat these, but total contraband.

156
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:27,181
Thank you.

157
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:34,063
I'm so sorry
you have to go through this.

158
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:37,066
Sydney, tell me something happy.

159
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,235
Happy?

160
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,823
I've got the week off from work.

161
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:49,370
Which is nothing, considering your
husband owes me 50 comp days.

162
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,997
I've been working really hard lately.

163
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:57,628
- Can I give you some advice?
- Please.

164
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:02,258
When you look back,

165
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:07,430
family, your friends,
that's what matters.

166
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,224
Work, your job,

167
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:13,394
it won't seem that important.

168
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:21,152
Even your job. Even working for SD-6.

169
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:32,872
I know you can't talk about it.
I wouldn't have mentioned it, but...

170
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:38,085
I know how easy it is
to lose perspective on things.

171
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:42,673
And I don't wanna see that
happen to you.

172
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,014
When did Arvin tell you?

173
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:55,227
He didn't. Over the years
I'd overhear things,

174
00:13:55,311 --> 00:14:01,275
find clues that he never really left
the world of intelligence.

175
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:08,532
And I know he keeps me
from the truth to protect me.

176
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,203
To keep me from worrying.

177
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,921
My only regret is not being able
to tell him how proud I am.

178
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:52,326
- I'm good for two minutes.
- It's Emily. She knows about SD-6.

179
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:55,955
- I'm just worried...
- I know. It's too late.

180
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:58,749
Your conversation was recorded.

181
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,545
- The Alliance knows?
- Yes.

182
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:03,504
And?

183
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:07,550
Information about SD-6
must be treated like a virus.

184
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:10,719
There is only one response.
Containment.

185
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:11,846
What did she say?

186
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,348
Sloane won't let them kill Emily.

187
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:19,270
A decision won't be made until Sloane
meets the head of Alliance security.

188
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,523
He's the only one
who can save her now.

189
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:56,849
The time off I asked for last week,
I'd still like to take it.

190
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,190
Would that be alright?

191
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,654
- Where are you going?
- The desert.

192
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,866
Yeah.

193
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:17,203
Of course.

194
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,039
Thank you.

195
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,833
The desert.

196
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,690
We need to test your security system.

197
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:51,654
See how it operates during
a shutdown of your generator,

198
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,865
heating, electrical
and ventilation systems.

199
00:16:55,825 --> 00:17:00,162
Once we're in, you inspect
the alarm and exhibition space.

200
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:03,165
I'll handle the shutdown
with this frequency jammer.

201
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,960
It'll keep the cameras off
for three minutes.

202
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,420
180 seconds is all you've got.

203
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,841
Shut down the primary generator.

204
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:37,575
He says the generator's always kept
the security monitors online before.

205
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,952
When I close
the ventilation system...

206
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:44,874
The turbines and shaft shut down,
allowing me access to the vault room.

207
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,460
Now shut down the ventilation.

208
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,691
Take the heating system offline.

209
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:04,995
The vault room is located
through a shaft on the east wall,

210
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,164
67 feet below the main level.

211
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,303
According to the documents, the vault
is a third generation Hanvalova.

212
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:26,642
Careful. It's full of explosives,
in case this doesn't work.

213
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:31,272
This should crack the safe and
short the circuit for two minutes,

214
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:35,776
giving you time to get back to the
main level before the alarms go off.

215
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,873
And electrical.

216
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:57,590
- What's going on?
- I agreed to a systems analysis.

217
00:19:57,673 --> 00:19:59,759
Mr Algosaibi's president
of the museum.

218
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,636
- Not to a shutdown.
- We are testing the system.

219
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,348
- Everything is OK.
- He's ordered the power restored.

220
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,851
My partner and I flew in from Paris

221
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:12,146
because we were assured
we could make competitive offer.

222
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:14,732
We must run a thorough analysis.

223
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:23,699
When it's offline, essential services
go down, including fire protection.

224
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,118
That is a risk I cannot take.

225
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:31,874
I will file a formal complaint
with the legal department.

226
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:37,880
Take him. Find his partner.
Show them the way out.

227
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:36,147
- What's going on?
- We're being kicked out.

228
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,816
I didn't finish my analysis. Did you?

229
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:41,944
Barely.

230
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:01,839
- Give me more details than that.
- No details.

231
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,008
You were kidnapped

232
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:07,094
by a man who turns out to be
someone you know's father?

233
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,388
- What is this?
- An article I've written.

234
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:14,143
Do this for me. Keep it sealed
and don't mention this to anyone.

235
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:17,062
Don't open it unless
something happens to me.

236
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:20,858
If something happens to me,
you gotta publish it.

237
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,987
Why would something happen?

238
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,240
Because I'm gonna go see
my kidnapper.

239
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,242
You've become insane!

240
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:34,955
I can write a story that might raise
questions, but it won't put him away.

241
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,708
Publish it.
That's your insurance policy.

242
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:42,129
Then I'll never get his cooperation.
There's gotta be some bigger story.

243
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,340
I wanna find out what it is.

244
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:51,639
Abby, you've gotta promise me
you're not gonna open it.

245
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:56,102
Promise me I won't have to.

246
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,337
There are a few things
we need to talk about.

247
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,634
And you scare me, so I'd rather
talk about them in a public place.

248
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:30,928
Can I have a beer, please?

249
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,222
You want to talk to me? About what?

250
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:36,559
Let's start with Sydney.
Does she know?

251
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:39,186
I don't know
what you're talking about.

252
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,189
Does she know
that you kidnapped me?

253
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:45,734
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

254
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,239
Thanks.

255
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,408
No, I don't.

256
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,036
I wrote a story.
No one's seen it yet.

257
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,457
But if I die,
it's gonna get published.

258
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,295
It's a story I don't even
wanna work on any more.

259
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:09,925
- Will, you seem very upset.
- I am.

260
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:17,558
Cos it won't go away. This source,
who told me about you, won't let it.

261
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:20,144
I don't even know
where he lives or works.

262
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:25,232
So you can't beat it out of me,
but he knows. He knows everything.

263
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:28,986
He gives me hints and clues,
and he's never wrong.

264
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:34,575
I don't know if you work for SD-6,

265
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:39,246
or if you're responsible for
the deaths of Daniel Hecht and Kurtz.

266
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,250
I don't know if you're protecting
Sydney, or if she needs protection.

267
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:47,922
But tell me what you know. Convince
me you put Sydney's interests first,

268
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:53,427
that in some sick, bizarre twist of
fate, you and I are on the same side.

269
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:56,806
My concern for Sydney
is not yours to judge.

270
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,357
Convince me by helping me
put a stop to what's going on.

271
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:15,116
And in return I'll help you
find out who my source is,

272
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:20,454
because I got a feeling that
he's somebody you'd like to meet.

273
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:44,437
Thanks, Ethan.

274
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:49,525
There's been a breach. Our entire
operation could be compromised.

275
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:51,694
- What's the source?
- Best guess?

276
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:56,240
A whistle-blower within the agency,
with access to Omega-17 files.

277
00:25:56,323 --> 00:26:00,077
He's been talking to a reporter.
Put counterintelligence on it.

278
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,496
They should tart with Steven Haladki.

279
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,999
- Haladki?
- He fits the profile.

280
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:09,378
Agent rising in rank, opposed
to company policy regarding SD-6.

281
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:13,382
Efforts to change policy thwarted,
so he takes it out of the building.

282
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:15,134
That's a big charge.

283
00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:18,012
The source is putting
Sydney's life at risk.

284
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:20,723
Haladki filed a report
on the prophecy.

285
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:24,810
You had him at gunpoint to find out
if the bureau was holding Sydney.

286
00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:29,356
Yes. Then I used that information
to hold other FBI agents at gunpoint

287
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,567
in order to free her
from a witch-hunt.

288
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,279
- You need to get CI on this tonight.
- I want you to stop.

289
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:41,869
I hear your concerns and I'll choose
how to respond to them myself.

290
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:48,167
You're a good agent, but lately
I find your methods reprehensible.

291
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,214
If I hear of one more instance
of you acting off-book, you're done.

292
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:07,478
I sent flowers to Will to thank him
for baby-sitting our rodents.

293
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:10,481
What do you think
the card should say?

294
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:14,485
- I had sex with someone.
- Seriously.

295
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,156
What?

296
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,242
When?

297
00:27:22,576 --> 00:27:24,662
About a week ago.

298
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:29,083
- When were you gonna tell me?
- I know.

299
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:33,546
It was Noah Hicks.

300
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:37,216
I know how you feel about Noah.

301
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:42,972
- Did he just call you up?
- No. It was a business trip.

302
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:47,017
We just picked up where we left off.

303
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:50,020
How is he?

304
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:54,483
He is...

305
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,572
It didn't end well.

306
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:02,992
I'm not surprised.
He was never good enough for you.

307
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:08,164
Anybody who'd dump you like that
doesn't deserve a second chance.

308
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,250
- People change.
- No, they don't.

309
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:14,378
What if I started
dating Charlie again?

310
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,547
I know.

311
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,303
You're really down about this.

312
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,472
A little.

313
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:30,269
There's nothing to be down about.

314
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,272
It's over.

315
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,610
I just wanted to let you know.

316
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,991
Maybe you're right. Maybe I am
being a little too tough on Noah.

317
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:47,369
If he calls, I'll try and be nice.

318
00:28:54,627 --> 00:28:57,963
Get me the last profile
on Edward Poole.

319
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:03,803
Sure. Right away. It's a pop-up book.
I'm making them. Clears my mind.

320
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:07,431
Feel free to dock me
any amount you feel is... Here.

321
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:09,642
This is interesting.

322
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:12,311
When he came in
he was carrying two phones.

323
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,688
- Can you locate them?
- Yeah.

324
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,982
- There.
- Good.

325
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,485
I have one phone number on Poole.

326
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:21,946
I ran a tap on it
but I couldn't find...

327
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:26,742
any leads on Khasinau.

328
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:30,913
I can probably track down
the second one.

329
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,833
Just get me
the other number right now.

330
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:47,179
Let me begin by saying
I know how difficult this is.

331
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,849
- If there was any other way...
- My wife is dying.

332
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:51,225
I understand.

333
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:53,978
- She has lymphoma.
- Yes.

334
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:59,442
We have both video and audio.
This isn't an issue of confirmation.

335
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:05,114
No. This is an issue of decency.

336
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:10,578
- The time and date have been set.
- She is my wife.

337
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:21,213
I am not just going to sit back
and allow you to eliminate her.

338
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:29,305
When I first came into the Alliance,
my closest friend was Jean Briault.

339
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:36,771
He took me into his confidence.
He guided me. He was my mentor.

340
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:41,150
But when Briault was murdered
at point-blank range,

341
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,736
I didn't ask any questions.

342
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:46,113
I didn't talk of decency.

343
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:55,164
Jean Briault was my friend too.

344
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,794
His murder was a tragedy.

345
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:06,592
I'm just trying to prevent another.

346
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:10,638
The Alliance knows you disregarded
the policy and pursued Khasinau.

347
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:15,559
They're going to want to see evidence
that your priorities are in order.

348
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,402
Are you suggesting I allow you to
kill my wife to enhance my standing?

349
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:37,248
Thanks.

350
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,359
I work in intelligence.
That is all you need to know.

351
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,611
So the bank's a front company?

352
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:10,531
We meet when and where I decide.
Never contact me.

353
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:15,536
When you say intelligence, you mean
SD-6. It's some off-the-books...

354
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,040
We go after the source first.
Everything else comes later. Clear?

355
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:24,211
Does Sydney know?

356
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:27,715
Jack, is your daughter
a part of this?

357
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:29,550
No, she's not.

358
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:33,095
- Now, are we clear?
- Yes.

359
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:36,265
Do you have a way
of contacting your source?

360
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:38,809
I have a transmitter. It's a pin.

361
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:42,062
I found it in a box of stuff
belonging to Eloise Kurtz.

362
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:43,272
What?

363
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:47,151
I planted that pin on Eloise Kurtz.

364
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,738
Of course. Nevil said
it was government issue.

365
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:55,242
You hired her to play Kate Jones
so she could lie to me.

366
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:57,203
And when she said too much...

367
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,999
- You had her killed!
- I did not kill her.

368
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:05,002
I bear some responsibility
for her death, as do you.

369
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,630
Focus, Mr Tippin!

370
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:10,966
Do as I instruct,
or more people will die.

371
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:17,014
Why don't I contact Deep Throat
and insist upon a meeting?

372
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:20,309
He told you about me.
He'll know it's a setup.

373
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:25,356
Contact him. Tell him you know I
kidnapped you and you are terrified.

374
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:28,275
Then tell him
you are back on the story.

375
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,612
This meeting never took place.

376
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:52,716
Edward Poole was a friend,
a visitor to this office,

377
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,344
a former operative with Ml6.

378
00:33:55,428 --> 00:34:00,057
Recently I was shocked to learn that
he has become an ally of Khasinau.

379
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:04,353
I asked Marshall to see if he can
come up with any leads. Marshall?

380
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:06,564
Thanks. This is really good.

381
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,819
- You've seen the news?
- Perfect, right?

382
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,195
So far so good.

383
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:16,657
- Have you contacted the broker?
- I stopped in Lisbon.

384
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,826
I said I was hired by the robbers.

385
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:21,495
- Who?
- Splinter group of the Raslak Jihad.

386
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:24,248
- How much did you ask for?
- 10 million.

387
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:27,918
I gave him the SAT phone and told
him to stick to our agreed window.

388
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:31,797
Good. My father's disabled
the SD-6 satcom intercept.

389
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,676
There's no way Sloane can
find out about this transaction.

390
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,766
We've intercepted signals between
Poole's phone and the com tower.

391
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:45,102
From that we were able to set up
a wire tap on his STU.

392
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:47,855
Secure Telephone Unit.

393
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:54,236
Then we were able to get Khasinau's
number and run a tap on him.

394
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,405
We heard from the broker.

395
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,619
Mr Khasinau is willing to pay double
our asking price in diamonds.

396
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:05,831
- Is Khasinau gonna meet us?
- No. He's sending Sark.

397
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:09,877
This is a conversation picked up
between Khasinau and Mr Sark.

398
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,090
You'll recall the ampoule stolen
from us on behalf of Khasinau.

399
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:17,510
We believed there was only
one ampoule in existence.

400
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:21,639
This conversation indicates
the existence of two.

401
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:25,935
It says Sark and a splinter group
of the Raslak Jihad have agreed

402
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:29,230
on the number of men each side
can bring to the meeting.

403
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:33,818
Each side has one principal and
two backups located in the market.

404
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:37,446
If they bring two, we bring four.

405
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,200
When you meet, you'll be able
to test each other's merchandise,

406
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:44,453
which is why we need
to give him the real solution.

407
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:46,705
After he confirms it's authentic,

408
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:50,334
switch the vial with
an identical one containing water

409
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:53,045
and an isotope
we can track via satellite.

410
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:57,383
When Sark brings it to Khasinau,
he'll be bringing us along as well.

411
00:35:57,466 --> 00:36:00,428
Our pursuit is incomplete
without that ampoule.

412
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:07,059
To recover it, you are authorised to
use all necessary force. Understood?

413
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:10,146
- Yes.
- Good. You leave tonight.

414
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:15,943
- Sark might've seen you in Moscow.
- He won't recognise me this time.

415
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:18,779
You saw what he did there.
And in Hong Kong.

416
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:23,242
If you're suggesting we bring someone
else in, no way. This is my op.

417
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:25,786
OK. We leave for Denpasar tonight.

418
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:05,785
Hi. I don't know if you can hear me
or not, but I've thought about it.

419
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,789
I'm back on the story.

420
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:15,878
Dr Richardson,
report to nuclear medicine.

421
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,141
Hi.

422
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:41,153
How do you feel?

423
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:46,450
Better... now that you're here.

424
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:52,998
Dr Levin stopped by earlier.

425
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:56,293
He said the biopsy's
scheduled for next week.

426
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:02,883
Sweetheart. It's gonna be OK.

427
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,554
We have to believe that.

428
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,472
Yeah.

429
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,105
You are so beautiful.

430
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,315
I know. I must look wonderful.

431
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,364
Hold me.

432
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:41,964
I am so proud of you.

433
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:14,789
- What have you got?
- Sark's in place.

434
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:16,165
How many men?

435
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:19,293
One inside and one at the gate
next to one of ours.

436
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,670
- He stuck to the plan.
- So far.

437
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:24,465
If anything changes, we're ready.

438
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:39,855
After you test the merchandise and
make the switch, go separate ways.

439
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:04,213
We agreed that neither side
would have the advantage.

440
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:07,716
- That is the agreement.
- You have not lived up to it.

441
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,220
You can see me. I cannot see you.

442
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,806
You know who I represent.

443
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:19,145
According to the broker, you are
affiliated with the Raslak Jihad.

444
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:22,398
A noble cause, to be sure,
and a group I respect

445
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:26,944
for its dedication
to the principles of ancient Kuntao.

446
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:30,990
When I learned of this,
I volunteered for the assignment.

447
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:36,078
Because I'm quite familiar with
the Kuntao use of the latajang.

448
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:44,378
If you are who you claim to be, your
skill with it should be unsurpassed.

449
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:47,214
Sydney, stick to the plan.

450
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:54,722
The agreement was clear.
We meet and trade.

451
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:58,184
We will, if you are
who you say you are.

452
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:00,269
Is he asking you to fight?

453
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:03,147
I've told my guard to stand down.

454
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,399
If you want the diamonds,
do the same.

455
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:07,109
Don't do this.

456
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:12,782
Sydney!

457
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,163
Sydney!

458
00:41:57,034 --> 00:42:00,871
- Excellent.
- Let's test the merchandise.

459
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:04,417
Let's.

460
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:43,164
Sydney, it's Dixon. He's here.

461
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:52,131
Both guards are down.
I repeat, both guards are down.

462
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:55,593
I am satisfied. Do we have a deal?

463
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:02,141
He's at the gate. Make the switch.
I repeat, make the switch.

464
00:43:02,224 --> 00:43:05,978
- Enough! Either we have a deal...
- Yes, we have a deal.

465
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:09,273
Hands in the air!

466
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:17,072
Where's the vial?

467
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:24,955
I said, where is it?
