1
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:19,527
These are serious people,
and they want you dead, today.

2
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:24,202
You air that allegation
or anything remotely like it...

3
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,843
This conversation's over, Maureen.

4
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,891
She claims that Keith
murdered the boy who raped Nicole.

5
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:34,091
David, you can't seriously think
that our son might be a killer?

6
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:40,842
This guy is not waiting for me, so you
better shoot me or help me, but decide now.

7
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,845
- Put down the gun. Now!
- I'm putting down the gun.

8
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,685
- Now! Now!
- The gun's going down.

9
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:54,125
- How do you know my name?
- Time's up.

10
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,602
I know more than that.

11
00:00:56,693 --> 00:01:00,845
- If you ever wanna see your daughter again...
- What do you know about my daughter?!

12
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,491
- Mom, come get us.
- What's wrong? Are you at the party?

13
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:08,724
There was no party. They made us say that.
Mom, you gotta come now!

14
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:09,484
Kim!

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,042
You're with me now. Be good,
you'll be back at the mall in a day or two.

16
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:22,843
Be bad, you won't. Clear?

17
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:31,726
- Please tell me what happened.
- A girl was hit by a car.

18
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:35,692
- Ma'am, do you know where they took her?
- St Mark's is closest.

19
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,605
- Was she alive?
- She didn't look good.

20
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,684
Go. Go, go, go.

21
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:28,284
Doctor, she's prepped.

22
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,964
- Here we go.
- OK.

23
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,009
Can we bring Maureen down here
to assist on the closing?

24
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,084
- On my count.
- All right.

25
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,444
Lift.

26
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,765
- I want two large-bore IVs.
- Yes, Doctor.

27
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,650
- 14.
- I'm on it.

28
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,883
- Let's get 'em prepped.
- She's out.

29
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,404
Excuse me. Hello?

30
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,572
Hello?

31
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,928
Hello? Excuse me. Hello?

32
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:23,210
Excuse me. There was
a teenage girl in an accident.

33
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,242
- A teenage girl in a traffic accident.
- I'll be right with you.

34
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:33,090
- We just called. There was a traffic accident.
- Certainly. You have our fax number?

35
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,926
- Excuse me.
- Thank you. You're welcome.

36
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:39,210
Doctor, did you get the message
about the heart seminar?

37
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,284
- Yes, I did.
- There was a car accident.

38
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,729
- Sorry. My shift starts at four. I just got here.
- Please help me.

39
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,725
- A teenage girl, traffic accident.
- The name?

40
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:52,930
- Kimberly Bauer or Janet York.
- B-a-u-e-r. Y-o-r-k.

41
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,528
No name listed. Just a Jane Doe.

42
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,172
- Well, maybe...
- Hey! You can't go in there!

43
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:13,646
Oh, my God. Janet.

44
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,004
I'm sure you're gonna find Kim.

45
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,811
- Hello.
- Honey, it's me.

46
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,804
Jack, I've been trying to reach you.

47
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:39,124
- Have you found Kim yet?
- No. We're at St Mark's Hospital.

48
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,410
- Hospital?
- Kim's friend, Janet, was in a car accident.

49
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,848
- And Kim?
- I don't know. She tried to call me.

50
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:47,322
She was in a panic, like she was in trouble,

51
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,973
and I tried to get her,
but we were stopped by a cop...

52
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:52,442
Teri, Teri, Teri, calm down.

53
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,445
- I'm losing my mind. I need you here.
- I know, sweetheart.

54
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:59,651
I'm gonna get there as soon as I can. Where
was Kim when she called the second time?

55
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,248
I... I don't know. She was... uh...

56
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,405
North Hollywood.
It sounded like she was being chased,

57
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:09,166
and then when we got there, she was gone.

58
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:12,882
- Kim's friend, Janet. Let me speak to her.
- She's in surgery.

59
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,771
Surgery? Is she gonna make it?

60
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:18,162
- I don't know.
- Listen to me, Teri.

61
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:20,608
What I'm trying to do
right now is to find Kim.

62
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,685
Stay where you are,
and I will get there as soon as I can.

63
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:28,403
What do you mean? I've been trying to find
Kim. I've been out all night trying to find Kim.

64
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:33,408
Teri, I'm gonna explain it to you later, OK?
You're gonna have to trust me.

65
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:36,132
Teri? Honey, I love you.

66
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:40,485
I promise you,
we're gonna get through this, OK?

67
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,729
I love you too, Jack.

68
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,646
I'll get back to you
as soon as I know anything.

69
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:06,685
Yeah, she's here. They say
the other one's dead. Don't worry. I will.

70
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:12,288
OK. Change of plan. Drive to the compound.
You'll get your money there.

71
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,170
- No problem.
- Use a different route.

72
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:17,370
- I don't want us to look like a caravan.
- Right. OK.

73
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:23,650
- Let's just split.
- Are you crazy? We have 20 large coming.

74
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,248
- I don't like it. This guy's psycho.
- You're forgetting something.

75
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,893
Last month? Phoenix? You owe me.

76
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,771
So let's get the money, then split. All right?

77
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,407
Mm-hm. This is fine, Patty.

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,806
We'll finish it after the breakfast. Still got
a couple of hours to grab some sleep.

79
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,202
Only if you do.

80
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,284
I made mochas.

81
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:02,364
Hey. I thought you were down.

82
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,324
I'm up. I couldn't sleep.

83
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:10,809
The polls open in less than three hours...
Mr President-To-Be.

84
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:15,491
- Heavy on the caffeine for me. Patty?
- Nothin' for me. Thanks.

85
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,564
- Mom?
- No.

86
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,885
You look exhausted.
Go to bed. That's an order.

87
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,450
All right. Promise you'll wake me
if you need anything?

88
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,603
- Absolutely.
- OK.

89
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:35,168
- Night.
- Good night.

90
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,004
David.

91
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:46,046
You won't say anything
to Nicole about Keith, will you?

92
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:50,570
We don't even know whether Maureen
Kingsley's going to go forward with the story.

93
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,325
- I have to, Sherry.
- Why?

94
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:57,043
Because the press is gonna get a hold of this,
whether it's today, tomorrow or next week.

95
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,012
- Nicole should be prepared.
- I thought you said Carl would take care of it.

96
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:05,132
He'll do what he can, but I don't want her
to suddenly hear something on the news.

97
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:07,852
- She'd be devastated.
- She's so happy right now, David.

98
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,493
We've gotta take it one step at a time.

99
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,564
Dad, it's ready.

100
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:29,448
Dad, I've figured it all out. Even if we lose
Orange County, we're still gonna win.

101
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,728
If we win Ventura by a ten per cent margin.

102
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:35,692
No. Even seven.
It's all right there in last night's poll.

103
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:39,405
You make it look like
there's nothing to worry about.

104
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:42,530
That's because there is
nothing to worry about.

105
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,131
- Mm. Dad...
- Nicole...

106
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,249
- No, go ahead.
- No, no, no. You first.

107
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:54,453
I talked to Suzy and Rachel Brenner. They're
flying out. I invited them to the victory party.

108
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,923
My Lord. I haven't seen them
since you all were in high school.

109
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,925
Well, we're gonna see them tomorrow.
Actually, tonight.

110
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:04,085
Ah, that's great. What were you gonna say?

111
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:07,004
Nothin'.

112
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:10,963
- CTU, this is Myers.
- Mason looking overyour shoulder?

113
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,887
No. He ended the lockdown
as soon as he found out where you were.

114
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,884
Be careful. He'll come after you.

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,727
I'm at the precinct. They've got a ring
around the suspect. I need help.

116
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:24,692
Get Ryan Sealey over at District.
Say it's about Palmer and I need an override.

117
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,764
OK. I'll take care of it.

118
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,972
Damn it.

119
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:49,327
Tony, I'm still off the net. I need a contact
number for Ryan Sealey at District Two.

120
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,964
Sure.

121
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,523
You still pissed off about the lockdown?

122
00:09:56,613 --> 00:10:00,128
Jack's never gonna trust you again,
and I'm not sure I will either.

123
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,886
You don't trust me, but you trust Jack?

124
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,612
Come on, Nina. He's been lying.

125
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:10,050
He's been hiding things from us.
It may be OK for you, but it's not OK for me.

126
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,487
Do you have the number?

127
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,804
Thank you.

128
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:32,412
Sorry, but this guy killed a cop.
I won't interfere with booking protocol.

129
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:36,327
I told you - you'll get a call from Ryan Sealey,
our liaison to the PD's office.

130
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:39,803
Until then, you can have my badge,
my gun, and I will not interfere.

131
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:42,851
- But I need to see that man now.
- What can I tell you?

132
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,642
- Fine. Where's your lieutenant?
- He checked out. Midnight.

133
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,486
But if he was here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

134
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:55,170
Sergeant, the cop that was killed tonight,
Officer Hampton. Did you know her?

135
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:00,527
- I knew her.
- I'm investigating a federal case.

136
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:04,288
She was helping me.
Do you want her death to be in vain?

137
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:09,332
Please forget about the damn chain
of command. I need to see this man now.

138
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,290
Just for a few minutes. Please.

139
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,808
Where's the suspect?

140
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,884
Move him to room two.

141
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,244
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

142
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,690
Hold it, Sergeant.
This man's under my authority.

143
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:17,605
We shouldn't have let him take her! There's
two of us, one of him, and we got a gun.

144
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:22,005
- You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr Gaines.
- No? Just on girls?

145
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:26,211
If you had the hots for her,
then you should have done something.

146
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,449
I just don't want her to get hurt.

147
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:33,128
Get real, dude.
She saw our faces. She saw his face.

148
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,647
She's not walking. She never was.

149
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:40,363
- You think he's gonna kill her?
- Maybe he already has.

150
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:45,802
Rick. Dude. Come on. It's ten grand apiece.

151
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:50,330
All right? We just wanna get paid
and get going. Forget Kimberly, man.

152
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,449
She's history.

153
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:07,045
Listen, till you can tell me what you were
doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh,

154
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:11,092
- I'm treating you as a prime suspect.
- Why would I kill my only ally at the agency?

155
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:15,405
You tell me. Why'd you blow the whistle on
your own agents, and try to blackmail me?

156
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,371
Because you were
withholding vital information.

157
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:23,368
I was following orders. I realise that's
a concept you may be unfamiliar with, Jack,

158
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:27,332
but it's something that some of us
actually do take seriously.

159
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:33,766
Through there is a suspect who is connected
with the people who want Palmer dead.

160
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:34,763
How do you know?

161
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,163
Walsh and Baylor died because
they got information that led me to him.

162
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,290
And if you interfere now
and something happens to Palmer,

163
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:46,970
you'll be seen as impeding this investigation
cos of a grudge against me, so cut the crap.

164
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,051
How do you wanna play this?

165
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,844
I'll talk to him myself.

166
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:03,643
Look, you're lucky I haven't already
put you in cuffs. Just sit down.

167
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,491
- Gaines.
- Have you heard from him?

168
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:18,044
No. I'm gonna be calling him in about
15 minutes. He should be done by then.

169
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:23,682
I've got the girl and we're on our way
to the compound right now.

170
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,764
Gotta go.

171
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,524
Stop, please.

172
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:59,323
Listen, I don't have time
for this, you understand?

173
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,203
- Maureen, it's David Palmer.
- Senator?

174
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:25,444
- I'm sorry to wake you.
- Oh, no, no, that's OK. What's up?

175
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,764
- The matter you called about earlier.
- Mm-hm.

176
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:32,209
- We need to talk about it.
- OK. Um... let's talk.

177
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:36,650
Since we're just a few floors apart,
I was thinking maybe we could get together.

178
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:40,885
- OK. How about I meetyou in the lobby?
- No, no. The lobby's too public.

179
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,090
The conference room on the third floor -
I'll have it opened.

180
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:47,722
Ijust need about ten minutes to get dressed.
How does that sound?

181
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,532
- Yeah, that's good.
- I'll see you in ten.

182
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,604
- Thanks, Maureen.
- Sure.

183
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,322
And those are the only places
you know they were?

184
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,846
Yes.

185
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:05,767
What about this boy, uh, Dan,
who works at the furniture store?

186
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:09,289
We don't know anything about him,
but the store owner's a Mr Nowrasteh.

187
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,762
I have his number in here somewhere.

188
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,123
Here you are.

189
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,204
Excuse me.

190
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:23,884
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. Is Janet out of surgery yet?

191
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,533
Yeah. The police showed up.
We're talking to them now.

192
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:29,127
- Anything new?
- No. How about you?

193
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:33,570
I'm at the Van Nuys police station. Someone
here knows where the girls were tonight.

194
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:37,851
- You mean one of the police officers?
- No. They picked him up in North Hollywood.

195
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,889
- I think he saw Kim.
- Who?

196
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:42,487
- I don't know. A man.
- Well, what did he say?

197
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:47,203
I'm waiting to talk to him. You've gotta talk to
Janet as soon as she gets out of surgery, OK?

198
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,124
I know. I know, I know.

199
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:52,486
I'll call you as soon as I can. I gotta go. Bye.

200
00:16:58,213 --> 00:17:00,522
So what did he say?

201
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,810
He says he won't talk to anybody except you.

202
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,969
So, can I go in?

203
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,208
Yeah.

204
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,284
Thank you.

205
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:30,885
My colleague said
you only wanted to speak to me.

206
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,642
Well, here I am. And guess what?

207
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:38,806
- Right now, you're speaking to everyone.
- What the hell is he doing?

208
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,848
- I thought we were going to talk alone.
- You killed a cop.

209
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,889
What you need to do right now
is start telling me the truth.

210
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:50,283
It was self-defence. You were chasing me.

211
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:52,684
What's he saying?

212
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,770
Go to hell! I'm done talking.
Get this guy outta my face!

213
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,565
- You've got nothing. I want my lawyer!
- Settle down.

214
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,644
- I'll take him.
- Come on.

215
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,645
I want my phone call. You've got nothing!

216
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:17,409
- I want my phone call, now!
- Jack. Great job.

217
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:21,291
- He knows something.
- So are you gonna beat it out of him?

218
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:25,286
What's the plan, Jack? Hm? What's the plan?

219
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,364
Take a walk.

220
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,008
- Bauer.
- Is this line safe?

221
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,812
- Tell me about my daughter.
- Not till you get me out.

222
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:15,681
- How do you know where she is?
- I heard some guys talking. Guys I work with.

223
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,606
- What guys?
- All you need to know is they have her.

224
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,446
- They're gonna call me in 20 minutes.
- Where?

225
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,001
- Back where you first saw me.
- San Fernando Road?

226
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:27,927
Yeah. But if I don't answer, they'll know
something's wrong, so get me out.

227
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:31,608
- I don't know if I can.
- I'm the one chance you got to find her.

228
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:34,526
I'm not there for that call, the chance is over.

229
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,604
Better think ofsomething fast.

230
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:53,212
- CTU. This is Myers.
- Hey. It's Jack.

231
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:57,332
The suspect's name is Penticoff.
He's expecting a call in 20 minutes

232
00:19:57,413 --> 00:20:00,052
at 18166 San Fernando Road.

233
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,045
I need you to trace all available public lines.

234
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:11,205
- I see water lines, utilities, no phone lines.
- Keep looking. He said he'd get the call there.

235
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,365
Wait. There's a pay phone
halfway down the block.

236
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,483
- And it's in service.
- Set up a trace.

237
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:20,531
- There's not enough time for a warrant.
- Forget the warrant!

238
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:24,322
If they're expecting Penticoff,
they'll hang up when they hear your voice.

239
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:27,689
- They won't. They'll hear Penticoff's.
- Did Mason get him out?

240
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,765
- No.
- So what are you planning? Ajailbreak?

241
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,484
Jack?

242
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:37,564
Set up the trace.

243
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:05,689
Bauer's behaviour is far from
representative of this agency's work.

244
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:10,767
Whether you like it or not, we have to be
involved, because this is bigger than...

245
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,006
Hey. Are you the officer
that interviewed Penticoff?

246
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:20,972
- No, I just transferred him to a holding cell.
- I still need to see him.

247
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:23,487
- You Bauer from CTU?
- Yeah, that's right.

248
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:28,764
Look, the cop that he killed,
she was my partner, you understand?

249
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,011
- I'm sorry.
- I heard you went off on him before.

250
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,642
I want him to go down for it,
which means a clean bust.

251
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:41,169
- No more extracurricular activities.
- Understood.

252
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,086
All right. But I've got the access card.

253
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,888
Now, you can go in with me...
or you don't go in.

254
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,848
I'm fine with that.

255
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,287
- Keep him away from me.
- Just a few more questions.

256
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,365
No more questions without my lawyer.

257
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:18,002
- Who are you working for?
- Are you deaf?

258
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:21,005
I said no questions without my lawyer.

259
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:24,123
- Your lawyer can kiss my ass.
- Oh, yeah?

260
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,408
- Who do you work for?
- Hey, hey! Back off!

261
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:29,007
- Get your hands off of me.
- He killed my partner!

262
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:32,563
- I know. I was there. Where were you?
- What?

263
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,971
Where were you
when your partner really needed you?

264
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,206
Hey!

265
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:45,409
Get him outta here!

266
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:51,204
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- He's crazy. I'm filing charges.

267
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:58,805
You oughta get yourself under control, Bauer.

268
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,932
What's going on? I'll take care of it.

269
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:31,767
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.

270
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:40,366
I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to wake you.

271
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:43,845
- I wasn't asleep.
- I thought you might like some coffee.

272
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,924
Thank you.

273
00:23:56,613 --> 00:24:00,162
- She'll turn up.
- How's Janet?

274
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,926
Um...

275
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:07,124
They're relieving some pressure on her spine.

276
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:11,163
But she's gonna be OK.
At least, that's what they say.

277
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:13,448
Of course she will.

278
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,204
Any news from Jack?

279
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:21,410
No. As far as I know,
he's still out looking for Kim.

280
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:26,009
Well, that's good. You said he has
resources the police don't have, right?

281
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:35,244
Even so, um...

282
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,768
I imagine you wish he were here.

283
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,404
Hands out, please.

284
00:24:56,293 --> 00:25:00,081
- Turn around.
- Oh, enough. Maureen's an old friend.

285
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,483
- It's all right. He's just doing his job.
- Thank you.

286
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:06,087
Your ID, ma'am.

287
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,164
Would you excuse us?

288
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,647
How long have we known
each other, Maureen?

289
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,327
Come on, Senator. That's not fair.

290
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:19,449
No, I'm just saying.

291
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,127
You, me, my family.

292
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:24,204
We made a journey together,

293
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:27,171
from local politics to where we are now.

294
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:31,132
We helped each other along,
because we cared about the same things.

295
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:34,285
- I know that.
- Have I ever lied to you?

296
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:37,046
- No.
- Embarrassed you?

297
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:40,170
- No.
- Then why are you doing this?

298
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:44,492
Senator, I wish to God
that I didn't get this information.

299
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:48,483
- But we're talking about murder.
- A rumour.

300
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:54,162
Started by my enemies, of whom,
as you well know, I have many.

301
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:58,565
That's what I thought too, at first. But...

302
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:01,084
Please. Go on.

303
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:05,926
- You know I can't tell you my sources.
- Come on, Maureen.

304
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:09,005
We're not in court here. I'm just an old friend,

305
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:12,290
with a career and family
that you just may destroy.

306
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,483
You owe me that much, at least.

307
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,484
OK.

308
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,010
Two sources.

309
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,086
One, a man named George Ferragamo.

310
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:31,371
He was your son's therapist for four years.

311
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:34,004
He came to me with the story.

312
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,763
And the second source?

313
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:44,887
The boy who raped your daughter, then
threw himself off the balcony - Lyle Gibson?

314
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:50,127
His autopsy showed that he had cuts and
scratches that pointed to "a violent struggle".

315
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:53,682
Nicole tried to fight him off.

316
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,002
Yes, that was the explanation.

317
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,802
But an hour later, an African-American
teenage boy went to an emergency room,

318
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:03,487
one block away, with similar injuries.

319
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,643
The name here says Edward Johnson.

320
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:11,011
The handwriting where
he filled out the form and signed his name?

321
00:27:12,973 --> 00:27:14,964
I had it analysed by an expert.

322
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:19,327
It's your son's.

323
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:36,405
I don't give a damn about your expert.
My son never killed anybody.

324
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:40,452
- Senator, I would never...
- You do what you have to do, Maureen.

325
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,365
Just be prepared to accept the consequences.

326
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:12,842
.. truth in the rumour that the Pentagon
wastefully dumped military supplies

327
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:16,050
costing millions, perhaps billions,
oftaxpayer dollars

328
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,806
in the years since the Vietnam War started.

329
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:21,532
The spokesman, who declined
to be interviewed on camera,

330
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,525
states only that "in the hurly-burly ofwar

331
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,491
and the constant movement
ofperimeters and people,

332
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,246
one must expect that
there would be a certain amount

333
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,291
ofacceptable loss
ofsupplies and armaments. "

334
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,322
Hey, Dad.

335
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:51,524
Somethin' wrong?

336
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:54,164
I guess you'll have to tell me.

337
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:08,767
The night your sister was raped, did you have
any contact with the boy who raped her?

338
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:12,361
- What?
- You heard me.

339
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,803
I... I don't believe this. I mean...

340
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,808
What brought this up all of a sudden?

341
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:23,442
I mean, let's just leave that
all in the past where it belongs.

342
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,524
I'd like to, believe me.

343
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:29,848
But, as it happens, I can't.

344
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:39,688
What did you do that night, after you
found out that Nicole had been attacked?

345
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:42,082
The truth, now. All of it.

346
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:47,125
I don't think you have a right to ask me that.

347
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:55,565
- You don't think I have the right?
- No, I don't.

348
00:29:56,253 --> 00:30:00,769
See, this thing happened.
Somebody had to deal with it.

349
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:03,651
But you were in Chicago
givin' a speech, or New York...

350
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:06,372
We'll deal with
my shortcomings as a father later.

351
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:10,128
Now I wanna know what you did after
you found out your sister had been raped.

352
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:14,092
- And I told you. I'm not gonna answer.
- You will answer me!

353
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,408
I apologise about Bauer.

354
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:44,372
But I'd really appreciate it
if we could handle this internally.

355
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,808
I got no problem with that.

356
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:50,806
Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal
colleagues are through with Penticoff,

357
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:54,681
- I'd like to process him into the system.
- Why are you here? I thought you left.

358
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:58,846
I'm not leaving till Penticoff
is behind bars without bail.

359
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,288
The computer says you left five minutes ago.

360
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,523
All right, guys, we're on the move.

361
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,244
Damn it!

362
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:12,206
I got this notice in the mail this afternoon.

363
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:15,524
Actually, it was yesterday afternoon.

364
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,604
Kimberly was failing algebra.

365
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:23,603
It was the second notice. She intercepted
the first one and threw it away.

366
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:27,882
When she got home, I was so mad at her.

367
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:40,082
I guess I accused her, and I...
I said things to her I shouldn't have said.

368
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:43,609
There isn't a parent in the world
who hasn't been there.

369
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:49,561
Last night, when I told her good night,
she wouldn't even acknowledge me.

370
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,166
I actually had the thought that I'd be...

371
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:56,926
I'd be so glad when she got out of the house.

372
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:05,888
When Janet wakes up, she'll know
where Kim is and then we'll find her.

373
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:08,043
- I just hope it'll be that easy.
- It will.

374
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:11,011
But why wasn't she with Janet?
It doesn't make any sense.

375
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:14,608
- Maybe she got freaked out by the accident.
- We should've waited.

376
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:16,843
- We should've waited.
- No, no, no.

377
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:21,961
We were right to come here.
All we had to go on was the ambulance.

378
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,362
We had to follow up on it.

379
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,764
Listen, whatever happens,

380
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:35,931
I'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim.

381
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,964
You have my promise.

382
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:43,844
Thank you.

383
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,803
Come on, Davis, we need that uplink.

384
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,922
He says we oughta have a picture by now.

385
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:58,085
W-7 satellite was in the southwest sector
when Bauer helped Penticoff escape,

386
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:02,963
so, with luck, we'll be able to pull up some
visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location.

387
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,328
- That's it.
- Here we go. All right.

388
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:09,167
Davis, the link's up.
Now I gotta get a back trace.

389
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:12,126
This is the roof of the building
from 200 miles up.

390
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:14,647
About how long
would you say since they got out?

391
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:17,486
I don't know. Seven or eight minutes?

392
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:22,089
OK. Davis? I wanna go back ten minutes,
and give me stills at 30-second intervals.

393
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:26,007
Look for two men
exiting the building together.

394
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:28,561
As often minutes ago...

395
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:31,213
- 30...
- There they are.

396
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:35,250
- OK, you can speed it up.
- All right. Speeding up.

397
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,729
- Slow it down now.
- You got it.

398
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:40,804
You got a mark on that car?

399
00:33:43,573 --> 00:33:46,292
- Coming to you now.
- All right.

400
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,805
Where are you headed, Jack?

401
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:19,852
- All set?
- All set.

402
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,208
- How much time do you need?
- A few seconds.

403
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,088
- Who are these guys?
- I told you. I don't know.

404
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:29,768
They tell me what to do.
I do it, they pay me. That's it.

405
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:32,651
It's ringing.

406
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,405
- Yeah?
- I'm not showing anything.

407
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:35,608
Yeah?

408
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:40,323
- It's a cellphone.
- We're screwed. I don't know the frequency.

409
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,325
- I'll get back to you.
- Jack?

410
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,132
- Yeah?
- It's Gaines. There's a change ofplan.

411
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:50,446
Nothing you can't handle. Taped to the back
ofthe phone is a set ofkeys with a remote.

412
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:55,606
- Got 'em.
- It's for a parked car on Avenue 26.

413
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,845
Nevada plates, 782NOF.
Find it with the remote.

414
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,493
There's a body in the trunk. Get rid ofit.

415
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:05,164
- What does he mean, body?
- I don't know.

416
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:07,847
- Whose body is in the trunk?
- I don't know!

417
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,324
Walk in front of me.

418
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:29,166
Come on.

419
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:47,489
Kneel up against that wall and interlock
your fingers behind your head. Now.

420
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:50,203
Don't move.

421
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,724
Oh, my God.

422
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,447
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, we had a deal.

423
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,728
Shut up.

424
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,532
- Put him in the car.
- Hey! Hey!

425
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:25,251
Bauer!

426
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,643
That's pretty quick work, George.
Trackin' me on a satellite?

427
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:33,204
- I'm takin' you in, Jack.
- He had evidence on the Palmer hit.

428
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:35,682
That's why I broke him out.

429
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:42,172
- So who was this?
- I don't know yet.

430
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:49,722
You're havin' quite a night here,
aren't you, Jack?

431
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,812
Why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on here?

432
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:57,205
Unless you want me to throw you
back to the cops? They're ready for you.

433
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:03,446
There are people within the agency
that are supporting the Palmer hit.

434
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:06,525
That's why Walsh and Baylor were killed.
They found out.

435
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:09,047
The truth is, I thought you were a part of it.

436
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,647
I apologise if I was wrong.

437
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:15,442
George, as crazy as this sounds,
you're gonna have to trust me.

438
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:20,687
This is gonna look very bad for us
if something happens to Palmer tonight.

439
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:29,451
- So what's next?
- I need to take the body down to CTU,

440
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,683
and try and make an ID.

441
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:34,810
I'll go grill Penticoff,
get what I can outta him.

442
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:38,968
- We never had this conversation, right?
- Right.

443
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:44,047
I'll be at District. OK. Call the precinct,
tell 'em we've recovered Penticoff.

444
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:03,446
- What have we got?
- Body. Male. Badly mutilated.

445
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,445
I need a positive ID now.
Who's our best forensic?

446
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,172
- Perry Tanaka.
- Get him. I'll be there in ten minutes.

447
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,732
- I'm on it.
- OK.

448
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:19,850
- Yes, Doctor.
- Clamp, please.

449
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,969
Hello?

450
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,965
- Hey. It's me.
- Jack, did you find out anything?

451
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,726
- Maybe. I'm not sure yet.
- What have you been doing?

452
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:32,771
- I'll be there in 20 minutes. I'll explain then.
- All right.

453
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,402
- Janet out of surgery yet?
- No, not yet. She should be soon.

454
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:39,212
Good. It's really important I talk to her.

455
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:43,332
I know it sounds cold, sweetheart,
but she's our only link to Kimberly.

456
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:46,644
Hang in there, honey.
I love you. I'm on my way, OK?

457
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,724
OK.

458
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:07,284
(bird flies off

459
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,324
Just be cool.

460
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:33,089
We'd like our money now,
if that's like, you know, OK.

461
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:40,762
Well, just so we're, like, you know, clear...
what happened to the other girl?

462
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:43,845
Janet? It's like I told you. We had to kill her.

463
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:47,528
My people say someone
fitting her description

464
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:50,525
was taken to a hospital
near to where you were.

465
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,808
How do you explain that?

466
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:58,169
Well, the thing is...

467
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:03,327
Maybe, uh, she wasn't quite dead.

468
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:09,362
Well, I'll tell you, Dan,
you're either dead or you're not dead.

469
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,092
There's no such thing as sorta dead.

470
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:13,925
Here. Let me show you.

471
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,084
No!

472
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:25,407
You've just been promoted.

473
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:29,044
Congratulations.

474
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:56,526
We're losin' her. We've lost pulse.
She's gone asystole.

475
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:58,604
Start compressions now.

476
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,284
What's going on?
