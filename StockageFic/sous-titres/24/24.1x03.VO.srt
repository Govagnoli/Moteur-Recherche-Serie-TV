00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:19,526
Kim got an email this morning from
Janet York. They might be out together.

2
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:24,004
- You're going to the valley with Alan York?
- I'm starting to worry. Can't you get here?

3
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:26,971
I don't have time to explain.
Very bad things are happening.

4
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,442
Our daughter is missing. That's pretty bad.

5
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,445
My dad is a government agent.

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,525
If I'm not home in the next half-hour,
he'll be all over this.

7
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:38,207
- Time to call Mommy.
- Go to hell!

8
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:39,931
Call your mom!

9
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,971
The firstAfrican-American
with a shot at the White House.

10
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,362
Palmer has left the suite. He is exposed.

11
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:50,366
We have a very high confidence that
there will be an attempt on his life today.

12
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,563
A 747just blew up
over the Mojave Desert.

13
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,087
You look just like Martin Belkin.

14
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,928
- So when do I get the ID?
- Soon.

15
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,293
There may be an element inside the agency

16
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,604
involved with the hit on Palmer.
Don't trust anybody.

17
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:22,164
I'm gonna go ID 'em.

18
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:31,481
Take this card. Give it to Jamey.
She'll match it to a computer.

19
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:34,292
Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent.

20
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:42,287
I got a match on the card.
It came from Nina's computer.

21
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,121
Authorisation?

22
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,443
Bauer, 4393, CTU.

23
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:28,768
- OK, we're on it.
- Get back to me as soon as you get a match.

24
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:41,488
- Bauer.
- Jack, I talked to her.

25
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,605
Thank God. What'd she say?

26
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:48,129
- She and Janet went to some party.
- So are you gonna pick 'em up?

27
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,681
- I don't know where she is. She wouldn't say.
- What?

28
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:55,289
Well, I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid,
but she sounded... different.

29
00:03:55,373 --> 00:04:00,083
I don't know. She told me that she loved me
before she hung up. That's not Kim.

30
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,529
She knows she'll get grounded.
She's trying to reduce the sentence.

31
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:07,606
Yeah, you're probably right.
How are you? Are you OK?

32
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:11,652
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Look,
is that guy York still with you?

33
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,921
- Yeah, he's gonna take me home now.
- Shouldn't you wait by Janet's car?

34
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:19,085
Who knows what shape the girls
are gonna be in when they get back?

35
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:22,563
Well, no. Alan doesn't seem
to think that's necessary.

36
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:26,407
- Why don't you put Alan on the phone?
- Jack, don't do this.

37
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:29,212
- Teri, just put him on the phone.
- OK.

38
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:33,765
Alan, my husband
would like to speak with you.

39
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,565
- Hi, this is Alan.
- Alan, Jack Bauer.

40
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,929
Can't thankyou enough
for helping out with this.

41
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:46,484
- I'm just glad the girls are with each other.
- Me too. Look, I'm stuck at work.

42
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:47,562
Yeah. Teri said...

43
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:51,885
I would appreciate it if you would hang out
at the store and wait for them to return.

44
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,761
Uh, I don't think they're gonna be
back here for at least a couple of hours.

45
00:04:55,853 --> 00:05:00,802
It's a pretty rough neighbourhood and I'd hate
for there to be a problem when they return.

46
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:03,327
- Sure. We'll stay.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:05,488
Thank you.

48
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,925
You gotta be kidding me.
We had a deal, Mandy.

49
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:13,689
You promised to get Belkin's ID in exchange
for $1 million. Now she wants to double it?

50
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,209
- She doesn't know how this works.
- No, this is your fault.

51
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:22,083
- You should never have involved an amateur.
- If I'm such an amateur, how...

52
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:28,123
- I'm just trying to get us more money.
- There is no money. Not any more.

53
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:32,092
Ira, don't turn this into
something else. I will fix it.

54
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,684
What?

55
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,723
No, we don't have it yet.

56
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,281
Yes. No, of course.

57
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,891
I will get back to you as soon as we're ready.

58
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,172
Talk to her. Explain what I do.

59
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,325
- I will, but our deal stands.
- Take care of it!

60
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,612
I need to get out of here, my friend.

61
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:18,412
It'll just be a little longer.

62
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:34,285
We've been getting death threats ever since
my husband announced his candidacy.

63
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,969
- What is different about this one?
- I'm not privy to that kind of information.

64
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:44,808
All I can tell you is that my unit is only called
in when the threat becomes more serious.

65
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:47,566
Then why did you let him
walk out on his own?

66
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:49,962
We will find him, Mrs Palmer.

67
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,403
I, uh, I'm sorry.
We're grateful to have you here.

68
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:01,328
- He's not in the lobby. I looked everywhere.
- You shouldn't leave the suites.

69
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:05,531
- Let these men do their jobs.
- There's a coffee shop a few blocks down.

70
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:10,050
- I bet he wanted to be by himself. I'll get him.
- No, Keith. You're not going anywhere.

71
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,011
Secret Service knows this city
a lot better than we do.

72
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,527
- I'll be right back.
- I'm sorry, son.

73
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,411
- We need you to stay here.
- Why?

74
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:22,168
We treat a threat on a candidate's life
as a threat to the entire family.

75
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,608
We need to protect you as well.

76
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:26,331
Keith...

77
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:29,572
Your father's going to be fine.

78
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:00,370
- Yeah?
- Gaines. I need an update on the Bauer girl.

79
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:03,172
Everything's copa. We're just waiting for you.

80
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:07,087
- I'm running a little late.
- We're not going anywhere.

81
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,051
That's right, you're not.

82
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,205
She's in a lot of pain, man.
I think you broke her arm.

83
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:17,889
Think so? Should we take her
to the hospital and get some x-rays?

84
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:22,124
Gaines is running late. I'm gonna
smoke another j. You want one?

85
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,204
Sure.

86
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,601
My arm... My arm...

87
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,161
Dan, please. She needs to see a doctor.

88
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:47,768
- At least give her something, man.
- I'm not wasting my stash on her.

89
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:53,410
So, what, is Dan the boss
and you do everything he says?

90
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,283
Thought I told you...

91
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,048
Don't press me, man.

92
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,202
I should never have used you.

93
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,528
You're gonna give her that?

94
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,922
Want me to take away the pain or not?

95
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,445
Hey.

96
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,412
Hey, man, this is a private lot, homey.
You gotta pay to park here.

97
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:19,246
I see. And you're the attendant?

98
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:24,124
That's right. And it's gonna cost you
a hundred dollars. So deal it up.

99
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:37,171
You that dude! Uh, Palmer.

100
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:40,609
- No. That's not me.
- Yeah, it's you. It's him!

101
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:44,003
Yo, this guy's running for president, dog.
I seen him on TV.

102
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:47,726
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

103
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:51,886
Yeah. So what you gonna
do for me, Mr President?

104
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:56,447
See, that's your problem.
You want everyone else to do the work.

105
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,203
What are you gonna do for yourselves?

106
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:02,729
See, man? All y'all, y'all got the same rap.

107
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,451
Keep going like this...
and you'll be dead in five years.

108
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,524
- Man, like you know my life.
- More than you think.

109
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,886
Whoo!

110
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,045
Yeah!

111
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,124
Whoo!

112
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,208
- CTU. Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

113
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:11,012
- Jack, where are you?
- About a block away.

114
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:15,564
I need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's
passenger breakdown and put it on my desk.

115
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:18,611
Wait for me. I wanna talk to you,
but not in front of the others.

116
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,685
- Sure.
- Great. I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

117
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:53,971
Keep working. Has Division responded
to the two dead agents yet?

118
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:56,521
- Yeah, they're picking them up now.
- Good.

119
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,361
- Anyone we know?
- Someone we know.

120
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,841
I'm afraid it was Richard Walsh.

121
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,731
I'm sorry, Jamey,
I know what he meant to you.

122
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:11,446
What is going on? Is this
anything to do with Palmer?

123
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:16,323
That's what we gotta find out. Look,
I don't have time to go into all the details,

124
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:20,611
but I've got to put you in a difficult position.
You're the only person I can trust.

125
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,649
What do you mean?

126
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:27,329
Walsh said we've got a problem on the inside.
He told me to talk only to you.

127
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:35,724
This is the key card I sent you. On it is
pertinent information to the hit on Palmer.

128
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,169
How long is it gonna take you
to pull all the data off it?

129
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,132
Depending on the kind of encryption,
it could take hours.

130
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,329
Palmer's day starts at six.

131
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,124
I need it before then.

132
00:14:54,933 --> 00:15:00,326
One more thing. I need to be certain that
it was Nina's computer that burnt that card.

133
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,563
Why?

134
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,803
Because if it was, she's dirty.

135
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:09,213
I'll need a few minutes
alone at her workstation.

136
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:11,284
Fine. You got it.

137
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,762
Did you cut yourself?

138
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:19,403
- Yeah. What are you working on?
- I gave Nina the passenger list.

139
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,882
I'm cross-checking everything else we've got.

140
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:24,328
Good. I'll be down in a sec.

141
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:38,043
- So why were you at Dunlop Plaza?
- I had a meeting with Walsh.

142
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,886
- Is that the passenger list?
- Yes.

143
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,770
Anything unusual?

144
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:46,766
There's one red flag. A man in first class.
His information is inconsistent.

145
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:50,641
- I'm trying to piece it together now.
- Good.

146
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,962
I don't wanna tell you how to do your job,

147
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,443
but not letting me know where you are,
holding back information...

148
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,172
How can I help you without you letting me?

149
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:11,008
Do you think that it's possible

150
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:14,927
that someone from within the agency
is behind the hit on Palmer?

151
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,685
Anything's possible. Do you have a lead?

152
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,927
No. Not really.

153
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:28,571
No.

154
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,690
Why do I feel like
you're not telling me the truth?

155
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:38,330
If you've got something, tell me.
I'll work it up with you.

156
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:40,404
No, I'm...

157
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,762
I'm just thinking out loud.

158
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:46,048
OK. Fine.

159
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,241
Is there anything else?

160
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,766
No.

161
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,804
Actually, there is.

162
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,288
Are you seeing Tony?

163
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,164
Why?

164
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:12,570
Is it serious?

165
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,689
What is this, Jack?

166
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:18,561
What do you want to know? Am I over you?
Why are we talking about this now?

167
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,963
I'm trying to understand why
he's been giving me such a hard time.

168
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,692
Yeah, well, I can't answer that for you.

169
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,124
Hold on.

170
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:37,405
- Yeah?
- I confirmed it.

171
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:41,406
The file on the key card definitely
came from Nina's computer.

172
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,444
OK. Thank you.

173
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,684
It's Division.

174
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,004
They want the passenger breakdown.
Please send it to them.

175
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,084
Sure.

176
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:05,848
By the way, your wife called.

177
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,291
- Bauer.
- This is Data Services.

178
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,331
- You called in a thumbprint an hour ago?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:32,325
We checked every database we have. Nothing.

180
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:35,849
Either this guy doesn't exist
or his identity was wiped offthe record.

181
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,924
Thank you.

182
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:55,528
- This is gonna work out better for both of us.
- I don't care, Bridgit. Where is the ID?

183
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:59,891
This is not some secret I'm keeping
from you. This is for both of us.

184
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,409
- Do you wanna get both of us killed?
- They hired you to blow up a plane.

185
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:07,451
Another million dollars
means nothing to these people.

186
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,845
You're wrong. Money is the only thing
"these people" care about.

187
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,808
Let's do it anyway.

188
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:20,682
You know he can't hurt us.

189
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,924
Baby...

190
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,973
Nobody can hurt us.

191
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,043
One million for you,

192
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,246
one million for me.

193
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,127
Don't you like the way that sounds?

194
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:56,764
OK.

195
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,324
We're gonna do this your way.

196
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:04,007
Great. OK, let's tell him.

197
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,971
No. It'll be better if I do it myself.

198
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:13,401
You're always looking out for me.

199
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:26,924
- What happened?
- Do you remember anything?

200
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:29,163
Yeah.

201
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:33,690
We were at the furniture store...
dancing... Where's Dan?

202
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,968
Shh.

203
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:38,124
Dan broke your arm.

204
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:41,046
He didn't break my arm. Dan likes me.

205
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,964
Yeah, look at it.

206
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:44,930
Ow... My arm...

207
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,290
OK.

208
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,364
Come on.

209
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,610
Listen to me. This is serious.
We're being kidnapped.

210
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:58,287
We need to escape. Can you walk?

211
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,653
- I guess.
- OK. Come on.

212
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,611
Get ready. When I say "go", we go.

213
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,845
Go where?

214
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,163
Just stay with me, OK?

215
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,813
You gotta understand this, OK?

216
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:22,124
We could die if we don't
get out of here. Hold my hand.

217
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:27,246
Go.

218
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:33,247
Hey!

219
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,006
- Hey!
- No! Get back here!

220
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:41,048
- We gotta get them.
- Hey!

221
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,732
- Catch them!
- I am!

222
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,407
This is your fault!
This is what I was talking about!

223
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:51,085
Shut up!

224
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,730
- Get back here!
- We gotta get them. They can not get away.

225
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,691
This is good work.
Keep me informed. Thank you.

226
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:01,764
- Certainly.
- Thanks, Jack.

227
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,564
Shut the door.

228
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:12,162
- Are we saying Nina's a traitor?
- Not yet. We need to know more.

229
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:15,290
Should I shut down her confidential access?

230
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:19,525
No, that'll slow everything down. There's
gotta be some kind of explanation for this.

231
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:22,491
Right now what I really need
is the data off that card.

232
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:27,044
But aren't we obligated to seal off
her channels with this much evidence?

233
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,727
Look, you were seeing her, weren't you?

234
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:34,602
- That is none of your business.
- I think in this case it is.

235
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:42,128
Yes. When my wife and I were separated,
yes, I was seeing Nina.

236
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,205
- Did you say anything you shouldn't have?
- No.

237
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,164
I don't think so.

238
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:55,451
I trusted her... with everything
that was coming through here, but...

239
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,931
- Fine. Shut down her access.
- OK. What's she working on?

240
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,164
- 747 passenger list.
- Good. That's not on a secure socket.

241
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,051
- I can do it without her knowing.
- Good.

242
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:14,004
- Jamey?
- Don't worry, I won't say anything.

243
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,404
Thank you.

244
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,924
Gotta get them.

245
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:43,491
- Hey, get outta here.
- Where'd they go?

246
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:54,286
- Ah, forget it.
- Aw, come on, man. Come on. Don't.

247
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,807
Hey, come back! Scumbag.

248
00:23:57,213 --> 00:24:00,762
You just cost me 50 bucks!
You're gonna pay for this.

249
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:06,643
- Word up.
- Did you see two girls run past here?

250
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,927
- Yeah, I seen 'em.
- Which way did they go?

251
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:15,167
- Who are they?
- Did you see 'em or not?

252
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:23,406
They went down Central.

253
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,448
Check it out. I'll look around here.

254
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:29,448
- Yeah?
- It's Gaines. How's it going?

255
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:33,606
- Everything's fine.
- Change ofplan. We meet at a new location.

256
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:35,923
Just let me know. I'll meet you there.

257
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:41,243
- We need to get to a phone.
- No, you need to pay up.

258
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,604
Is this real?

259
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:05,603
Thank you very much.

260
00:25:57,373 --> 00:26:00,285
- What couldn't wait till morning?
- Maureen Kingsley called.

261
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:02,762
Said she had some new information.

262
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,212
David, you got me out of bed
at 2am. What did she say?

263
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:09,569
She said the Gibson boy,
the one who... raped Nicole,

264
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,689
didn't commit suicide.

265
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:14,333
That he was thrown out of the window.

266
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:18,288
So, he was thrown out
of a window. Who cares?

267
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:20,603
She said it was Keith!

268
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:26,451
She's gonna publicly
accuse my son of murder.

269
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:33,523
- OK, there's a couple of ways to handle this.
- It's a lie, Carl.

270
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:36,411
It's dirty politics and I won't stand for it.

271
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:41,686
My family lived through that nightmare
and I won't put Nicole through it again.

272
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:44,890
- And Keith? Keith couldn't...
- This bastard, Hodges,

273
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,851
he waits till the day of the primary
so you can't respond.

274
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,652
- I don't care what day it is. It's a lie...
- I know.

275
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:55,682
But we can't pretend today isn't important.
I'll put a lid on Kingsley until the polls close.

276
00:26:55,773 --> 00:27:01,131
- We win the primary then take it from there.
- No. We find the source, make them recant.

277
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:06,048
Oh, I'll figure out where this is coming from
and I'll cut it off, but, David...

278
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:11,451
We go back years. You have your principles,
you don't compromise, blah blah blah.

279
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,765
That's why I love you. But you knew
the gloves would come off. Well, they are off.

280
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:18,242
That's why you have me.

281
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,131
Go back and forget about this.

282
00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:23,204
I'm on it.

283
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,932
I can't let them throw my son to the wolves.

284
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,527
David, I'll take care of it.

285
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:35,321
- Is that you?
- Yeah. You better get lost.

286
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:38,568
Call you in an hour.

287
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,767
It's OK, fellas.

288
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:47,401
I'm fine.

289
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:09,164
Dammit.

290
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:17,371
Janet, let's go back to the front
and wait for them to leave.

291
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,448
- They're not on Central.
- Keep looking. We gotta find 'em.

292
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:26,048
OK, I'll take the side streets.
They're around here somewhere.

293
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,523
Gaines just called me.
We gotta find them!

294
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,491
- You're in my space.
- I'm sorry. We'll leave.

295
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,211
- Is there a phone around here?
- No.

296
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,524
What are you looking for?
You wanna score some dope?

297
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:54,492
We need to get rid of those guys. Is there
any way you can help us get to a phone?

298
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,768
You want me to help you?

299
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:02,647
What are your little
designer jeans worth? 500 bills?

300
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:06,571
And those kicks, like another, what, 25?

301
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:15,010
You wanna trade places with me for a while?

302
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:20,406
Wanna turn some tricks while I go snuggle
with your daddy in the Hollywood foothills?

303
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,964
Go away.

304
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:43,722
We've been kidnapped. I don't know...

305
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:46,202
Her arm is broken.

306
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,451
Those guys are still out there.

307
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:58,482
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

308
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:04,082
Well, is there any other way out
besides the front door?

309
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,490
- But if we just...
- "But" nothing. Get out!

310
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:11,804
Go!

311
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,686
How long have you been playing me?

312
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:45,651
- Playing you?
- Playing me.

313
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,644
What are you doing?

314
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:51,126
- Why don't you tell me about this?
- Tell you what?

315
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:55,047
You loaded this card
with intel on the hit on Palmer.

316
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,250
I wanna know who you work for
and who you smuggled this card to.

317
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,289
You're delirious.

318
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:03,092
- Who are you working for?
- I work for you.

319
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:05,687
Who are you working for?

320
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,333
- Who are you working for?!
- I work for you!

321
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,564
Whoever programmed this card
is involved with the hit on Palmer.

322
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:14,247
This came from your computer.

323
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,445
I don't care where it came from, I didn't do it.

324
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:25,047
And I can't believe that you think I did.

325
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:40,368
There it is. One million in your account
in addition to what we already agreed on.

326
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:42,284
Where's the ID?

327
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:44,648
Let's get it.

328
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:47,770
- No, just the three of us.
- And why do I trust you?

329
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:51,088
Because you want the ID.

330
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,248
I'm gonna miss you, Mandy.

331
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,921
- How's your arm?
- It's OK if I don't move it.

332
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,004
Then don't move it.

333
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:59,485
I know you're in here.
I can smell your perfume.

334
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:04,687
Where are you?

335
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:07,241
This is starting to piss me off!

336
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,808
He's gonna be ready.

337
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:34,809
Hey, I'm telling you, you know, I saw him
work out yesterday. He looked good.

338
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:36,884
He's gonna be ready.

339
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,567
- Excuse me.
- Let me call you back.

340
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:45,172
- You looking for something?
- Please, help us. These guys are after us.

341
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,403
- What guys?
- I'll pay whatever you want.

342
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,007
Just get us out of here.

343
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,166
- Let's see the money.
- I don't have it on me right now.

344
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:56,689
But when you get us home,
my parents will pay whatever you want.

345
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,128
Sorry, I run a cash-up-front business.

346
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,971
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Janet.

347
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,763
Look, can we just
use your phone at least? Please?

348
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:14,523
Come here!

349
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,889
Go! Take the phone and run! Go! Go! Go!

350
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:21,564
Go!

351
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,765
Run!

352
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:35,402
- It's cool, man. It's cool.
- Run!

353
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:58,249
Is this right?

354
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,643
- What?
- They just posted a memorandum.

355
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,928
Richard Walsh is dead.

356
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:08,011
That can't be. I mean,
he was just here an hour ago.

357
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:10,402
That's what it says.

358
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,324
Oh, my God.

359
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,168
Can you find out what happened?

360
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,847
Jack's got me working on something.

361
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:33,888
Can you open up a socket
on the terminal? I'll check it myself.

362
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:37,891
Sure.

363
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,964
Thanks.

364
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,166
- Farrell.
- I need you up here now. Do you have it yet?

365
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:56,882
- Almost. Another couple of minutes.
- Soon as you're done, come up.

366
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,370
Thank you.

367
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:10,247
That job this summer - you in?

368
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,650
Yes.

369
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,722
OK, Jonathan, you're done.

370
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,328
You had no choice.

371
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:06,730
The key card was definitely programmed
on Nina's computer. Login time was 10.14pm.

372
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:10,245
Looks like the next 20 minutes
were spent gathering data,

373
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:15,885
and then another seven to burn it into
the key card. Logout was 10.41, January 14.

374
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:20,364
It specifies which files were accessed.
If you want details, there are two screens of...

375
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:22,728
Wait a sec. What was the date?

376
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:27,125
- January 14, a couple of months ago.
- Second weekend in January, Jack.

377
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,204
That's all I got.

378
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:34,005
Thank you, Jamey, that's all I need right now.

379
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:45,852
That was the same weekend that
we were in Santa Barbara together.

380
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:56,211
So someone from this office has hacked
your login code. They're in your system.

381
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,807
- You were way off on this one, Jack.
- I'm sorry...

382
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,123
How could you?

383
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:34,043
- Division.
- It's Tony Almeida at CTU.

384
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:37,125
Look, you'd better get down here right away.

385
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:42,569
Jack Bauer needs to be
relieved of his command.

386
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,209
- Hello?
- Mom, you gotta come get us.

387
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:03,286
- What's wrong? Are you at the party?
- There was no party. They made us say that.

388
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:06,410
- Who?
- These guys. We're in North Hollywood.

389
00:40:06,493 --> 00:40:08,051
- Behind...
- Platt's Auto Body.

390
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,283
- Platt's Auto Body.
- They're coming!

391
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:12,728
- Mom, you gotta come now!
- Kim! Kim!

392
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:14,644
What's going on? Teri?

393
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,088
- 911 emergency.
- My daughter's in trouble.

394
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:21,451
She's in North Hollywood behind
Platt's Auto Body. Someone was chasing her.

395
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:29,204
Come on, Kim.

396
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:45,007
No... No... No!

397
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:48,005
No, look at me. Look at me!

398
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:50,891
Oh, God! Oh, God!

399
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,445
No!

400
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,684
- I told you to chill! Why didn't you listen?
- Let go of me! No!

401
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,764
- Shut up!
- No!

402
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:03,005
- What about her?
- Forget her. Let's go.

403
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,084
- Come on!
- No! No!

404
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,922
Come on. Let's keep moving.

405
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:15,366
Shut up!

406
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,492
