www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

3
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,960
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

4
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,542
They've detected
another firewall breach.

5
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,400
- There's been another attack?
- Not yet,

6
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,182
but they believe
the CIP device is being utilized.

7
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:27,109
We have to assume
Dubaku is initiating another attack.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,257
- Madam President.
- What is it, Tim?

9
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,113
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

10
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:34,742
It's from Colonel Dubaku.
He's demanding to speak with you.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,703
The deadline for your forces
to begin their withdrawal has passed.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,913
Go to the window.

13
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:40,826
<i>See what you have done.</i>

14
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,709
<i>Comply with my demands
within the hour,</i>

15
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,878
or 10,000 more Americans will die.

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,385
- She's on her way up.
- I'll call you when it's done.

17
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:54,762
Mr. Taylor, are you okay?

18
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,061
Audio forensics
cleaned up the recording.

19
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,653
<i>Walker is extraneous.</i>

20
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,591
<i>Kill her before you get here.</i>

21
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:16,477
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.
There's nothing here.

22
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,507
All right. Fine,
help Janis coordinate with NSA.

23
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,660
I'm sorry about Renee.
She was a good agent.

24
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:22,790
We don't know that she's dead yet!

25
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,403
I've devoted my life to the Bureau
and you just expect me to believe

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,558
that the entire government
has been corrupted.

27
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,133
Not all of them. Until we find out who,
we can't trust anyone.

28
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,955
And the four of you
really think you can stop this?

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,180
We have to.

30
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,847
It's as simple as that.

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,474
Dubaku wants you and your wife.
That's the deal.

32
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:42,601
You're asking us to risk our lives

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,520
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands.

34
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,147
Listen to him, Ule.

35
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,440
But how can we trust this man?

36
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,721
Because he has no reason to lie.

37
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:53,628
- How are you doing, Tony?
- All right.

38
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,822
Where's Emerson?

39
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,949
He's dead. You want Matobo or not?

40
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:06,970
You got what you came for.

41
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,878
Now, get the hell out of here.

42
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:10,755
Did everything go smoothly?

43
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,146
We have the Matobos,
that's what matters.

44
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,092
I heard about the planes
on the radio.

45
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:17,970
The White House
still has not complied.

46
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,890
- What do you intend to do?
- Exactly what we promised.

47
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:21,932
We're ready.

48
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,841
- Where's the target located?
- Kidron, Ohio.

49
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,979
- Population?
- 30,000.

50
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,560
- Casualties will be high.
- Begin.

51
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,495
Larry.

52
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:46,545
We think this is the truck
the Matobos were abducted in.

53
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,581
- Where was this image taken?
- Near Northwoods Airfield.

54
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,869
- Were you able to track it?
- Not beyond this sector.

55
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,934
But they were heading east
on McKinley Avenue.

56
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:58,010
Make sure the vehicle ID is disseminated
to all search teams and local agencies.

57
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,586
Larry, I think I found something.

58
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:01,925
I've been working NSA,

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,767
trying to back-trace the CIP attack
that took down the two planes.

60
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,714
And I found a code fragment

61
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,980
which I think could be residue
from the CIP intrusion.

62
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,233
I'm running a pattern match.
With any luck at all,

63
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,401
we could anticipate
where in the infrastructure

64
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,695
they're targeting next.
And I need Sean.

65
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,657
Janis, I don't want to waste personnel
on some wild-goose chase.

66
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,660
Dubaku's threatened to kill
10,000 Americans in the next 30 minutes.

67
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,621
I understand that, and I will drop it
the minute it feels cold.

68
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,926
I'm gonna brief the White House.
Keep me in the loop.

69
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:29,051
Sean.

70
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,259
Are you sure
he's up to running this operation?

71
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,047
- Larry's fine.
- Is he?

72
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,387
You're the one who told me
about him and Renee.

73
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,112
This has got
to be hitting him pretty hard.

74
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,434
If I don't think Larry can do his job,
I'll let you know, all right?

75
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,437
In the meantime,
I need you to open up a fresh socket.

76
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,098
<i>You've reached Agent Brian Gedge.</i>

77
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,564
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

78
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,381
Agent Gedge,
I expected to hear from you by now.

79
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,893
It's urgent that I speak
with the First Gentleman

80
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,339
as soon as possible.

81
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,464
<i>Mr. Kanin?</i>

82
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,473
Call me back, Agent Gedge.
This is extremely important.

83
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,312
- Yes?
<i>- Larry Moss with the FBI.</i>

84
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,437
Where are we?

85
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,607
We've I.D.'d a vehicle that we believe
was used in the Matobos' abduction.

86
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,203
<i>We're trying to track it down.</i>

87
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,924
- And how long is that going to take?
- I wish I could tell you, sir.

88
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,969
- I don't have a time frame.
- That's not good enough, Larry.

89
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,700
Unless you get some results,
we're going to get hit again.

90
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,661
A lot of people are going to die
if you don't find Dubaku.

91
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:51,126
With all respect, sir,
I don't need to be told what's at stake.

92
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,084
We're giving everything we can.
One of our agents has given her life.

93
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,088
Yes, I was told about that.
I'm... I'm sorry.

94
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,886
- I'll call you when we have something.
- We'll be waiting.

95
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,772
The Matobos have been taken
into a building.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,177
546 Adams.

97
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:18,317
- Pull up the stats on that address.
- On it.

98
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:23,262
It's the Ritter Building,
four stories high. It's two years old.

99
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,605
- Give me the security specs.
- Give me a minute.

100
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,451
We're coming up on it.

101
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,411
I'm going to need your help.

102
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,856
I see you've chosen a target.

103
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,909
The Boyd Chemical Plant
near Kidron, Ohio.

104
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:02,945
The CIP device has enabled us
to take control of the main tank.

105
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,242
We're about to cause
the primary safety valves to fail.

106
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,051
Do you rember the last time
we saw each other, Ule?

107
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:20,004
It was at a state dinner
in your residence.

108
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,998
We shared
an excellent bottle of wine.

109
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,950
I offered my hand in friendship
and you...

110
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,679
slapped it away.

111
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,597
You gave me an ultimatum:

112
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:32,641
to be the puppet for your military.

113
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:36,205
You could have had a long
and prosperous career as prime minister.

114
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:39,148
But now you're going back to Sangala
as a traitor to your people.

115
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,892
I am Prime Minister.

116
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,810
I was elected by the people.

117
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,737
It's you and Juma
who are the traitors.

118
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,536
No.

119
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,663
We brought order to Sangala,

120
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:58,459
but you are trying to destroy
everything that we've built.

121
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:04,715
You'll be taken
back to Sangala, Ule,

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,636
and you will give General Juma
the names of all your fellow traitors.

123
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,430
I will never do that.

124
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,265
Never.

125
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:24,401
Believe me, you will.

126
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,487
Take them.

127
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,747
Any response from the president?

128
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:38,492
Not yet.

129
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,887
But once she sees
dead Americans lying in the street,

130
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,721
she will be less stubborn.

131
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,644
I'm inside, Jack,
approaching the front desk.

132
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Copy that.

133
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,010
Are the Motobos
still on the third floor?

134
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,917
Affirmative, Jack. They're being moved.
I'm just not sure where yet.

135
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,042
Copy that.

136
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,497
Good afternoon.

137
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:20,415
I'm Agent Walker with the FBI.

138
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,567
I don't have an appointment,
but I'm here to see Mr. Roane

139
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,535
- of Roane and Associates.
- I let them know.

140
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,048
I don't want to be announced.
I'm here on official business.

141
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,341
All right.

142
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,766
So as far as you're concerned,
I was never here, understand?

143
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:34,550
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,853
Past security.
Heading toward the elevator.

145
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,772
We're on our way
to the service entrance.

146
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,535
I'm on the third floor.

147
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:58,114
Law firm is on your left.

148
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:01,374
On your right is a suite of offices
where Matobo's being held.

149
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,499
I see it.

150
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,543
Stairwell's down the hallway
to your left.

151
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:24,605
Agent Walker, we're at the door.

152
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:34,323
There's one guard outside the suite,
probably armed.

153
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,332
Bill, take the third floor.
Wait for my signal.

154
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:48,828
Go on.

155
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,059
We're on the fourth floor
in the computer room. What now?

156
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,775
In the center of the room
there are two removable panels.

157
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,936
This should give you access
to the crawlspace.

158
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,061
Copy that.

159
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,447
Okay, we're clear. Let's go.

160
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,024
We're in.

161
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,004
Go ahead.

162
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:05,205
I should never have allowed you
to come with me.

163
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:06,832
It was a mistake.

164
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,178
It was not your decision, Ule.

165
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,919
We will be all right.

166
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,177
Jack Bauer will be here soon.

167
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,601
Okay.
We're at the heating unit.

168
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,521
Jack, there's an airduct
leading off that unit, do you see it?

169
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,488
Follow that for about 30 yards
until you see an electrical junction.

170
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:37,622
Make a left, then another 20 yards
you'll come to the vent.

171
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,180
This will give you
a view of the entire floor.

172
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:41,366
And the Matobos?

173
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,746
They've been moved into an adjacent room
just off the main area.

174
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,871
Okay, copy that.

175
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,619
Come on.

176
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,667
The entire NSA
has been combing the firewall

177
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,912
searching
for the next CIP device breach.

178
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,464
If this were something,
don't you think they'd know about it?

179
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,365
I can live without your negativity
today, Sean.

180
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,386
There it is again,
that same code fragment.

181
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,974
"Kidron, Ohio."
What's in Kidron, Ohio?

182
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,525
Any sensitive installations?
Something Dubaku might want to hit?

183
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,846
I don't know. Homeland
has a high-value target database.

184
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm cross-checking it now.

185
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,893
Okay. Okay,
nothing in Kidron itself,

186
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:20,994
but in the neighboring county
there's... Boyd Chemical.

187
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,687
- What do they make?
- Insecticide. Get me that number.

188
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,030
Hello?
This is Janis Gold at FBI.

189
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:37,399
I need to speak to your plant manager
immediately, please.

190
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,208
Ma'am,
as I just stated I'm with the FBI.

191
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,933
Does that sound vaguely important
to you?

192
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,097
Now, connect me to John Brunner.

193
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,238
FBI?

194
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,342
Yeah, put her on. Hold on.

195
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:56,733
- This is John Brunner.
<i>- Hello.</i>

196
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,860
Mr. Brunner,
this is Janis Gold, FBI,

197
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,279
<i>- D.C. Bureau.</i>
- What can I do for you?

198
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:04,432
We've been tracking some possible
breaches in the government firewall.

199
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:07,051
The firewall's designed
to protect installations like yours...

200
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,034
I know what it does, honey.

201
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,059
We have tracked and isolated

202
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,108
one of these breaches
in the Kidron area.

203
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:16,420
I need to know are you experiencing
any problems right now?

204
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:19,454
- We're dealing with one right now.
- What is it?

205
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:23,326
Three of our safety valves just failed
on the primary storage tank.

206
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,047
- We're having trouble resetting them.
- What's in that tank?

207
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,641
Methyl isocyanate.
Concentrated insecticide, highly toxic.

208
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:32,688
Can you...
What the hell is this all about?

209
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,871
Mr. Brunner,

210
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,692
I have reason to believe that this is
a terrorist attack on your facility.

211
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,363
- Terrorist attack?
- Yes, sir,

212
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,847
I need you to initiate
on-site emergency procedures

213
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:44,580
and stay on this line.

214
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,782
- Shut down the tank. Do it!
- What's going on?

215
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:48,869
My authority.

216
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:53,248
- Damn.
- What is it?

217
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:57,074
- It's not responding.
- What do you mean? Try it again.

218
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:58,748
Nothing.

219
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,092
Pressure in the primary tank
is rising.

220
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,388
- Son of a bitch.
- Mr. Brunner?

221
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,549
We cannot shut down the primary tank
and the pressure is building.

222
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:16,324
If we cannot stop this,
we are looking at atmospheric release.

223
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,029
Okay.

224
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:19,989
Get Larry.

225
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:23,403
Dubaku has targeted that facility.
We need to alert the president.

226
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,447
Mr. Brunner,

227
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,462
<i>you need to begin evacuating people
right now.</i>

228
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:45,509
All right, Agent Moss, keep me apprised.
I'll speak to the president.

229
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,856
I just received
an interagency alert.

230
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,984
The FBI just discovered
Dubaku's next target.

231
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:52,751
A chemical plant. I just got off
the phone with Larry Moss.

232
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,744
I need to brief the president.

233
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:57,286
Has the First Gentleman spoken
with the president?

234
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,300
Not yet.

235
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:00,425
I talked to Agent Gedge
40 minutes ago.

236
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,694
Mr. Taylor is the only person who can talk
the president

237
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,528
into withdrawing our troops
in Sangala.

238
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,568
That is our best way
to prevent this attack.

239
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,157
I know we need him.
I'm waiting for a call back.

240
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,936
The middle section's still bothering me;
read it again.

241
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,940
"Colonel Dubaku and the Juma regime

242
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,381
"have killed countless thousands
of their own people,

243
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,491
"and now
hundreds of our fellow citizens.

244
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:21,127
"They deserve your prayers
and your outrage."

245
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,458
I think the word "outrage"
might be too strong

246
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,800
if you're trying
to convey calm authority.

247
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,288
"Outrage" is the only word
to describe how I'm feeling,

248
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,532
and how every person in this country
will be feeling.

249
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,676
The American people deserve
the truth.

250
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,878
Dubaku's already killed
300 Americans.

251
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,253
God knows what else he has planned.

252
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:39,674
Come in.

253
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,544
Could you excuse us, Angela?

254
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,675
What is it?

255
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,551
The FBI believes they've detected
where the next attack will take place.

256
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:02,951
Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical plant
just outside of Kidron, Ohio.

257
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:06,298
He's causing the pressure
on the facility's tank to go critical.

258
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:07,844
If the tank erupts,

259
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:10,969
over 3,000 gallons of methyl isocyanate
will be released into the atmosphere.

260
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,692
Given the prevailing winds,

261
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,967
a very large, very toxic cloud
will sweep into town.

262
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,107
Methyl isocyanate is
a concentrated insecticide.

263
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,133
Even brief exposure causes
severe lung damage

264
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:26,109
- and chemical burns of the skin.
- What's our time frame?

265
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,377
The tank could rupture
in less than 15 minutes.

266
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:29,861
They've begun evacuating?

267
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,674
We've contacted emergency responders
on the ground in Kidron.

268
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,146
It's just not enough time
to get everyone out.

269
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,538
Kidron's population's
just over 30,000.

270
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,209
This projection says
that we could lose over 50%?

271
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,266
- Dear Lord...
- Right now,

272
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,427
our only chance of stopping this
is finding Dubaku

273
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,999
and the CIP device.

274
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,253
You ready?

275
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,378
Quietly.

276
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:05,773


277
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:09,126
<i> I just intercepted an FBI alert
identifying Dubaku's next target.</i>

278
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,146
A chemical plant near Kidron, Ohio,
12 minutes from going critical.

279
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:15,360
There are 30,000 people in that town.
We have to hurry.

280
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:17,535
We're moving as fast as we can.

281
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,774
Give me the scope out of the bag.

282
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,726
Turning scope over to night-vision.

283
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:45,772
I don't see Dubaku.

284
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,719
We've got Nichols.

285
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,062
Three men with automatic weapons.

286
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,447
Three more over at the control station,
most likely armed.

287
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:56,511
Copy that.

288
00:17:58,668 --> 00:17:59,868
That's Dubaku.

289
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,499
We got Dubaku.
Chloe, are you seeing this?

290
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,056
Yes. The control station
looks like an S-dart.

291
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:09,378
It's a really powerful processor.
It could be driving the CIP device.

292
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:10,213
Copy.

293
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,991
NSA's Classified Infrastructure Team
is trying to plug the firewall breach.

294
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:15,131
Any luck so far?

295
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:17,971
- No, but they're staying on it.
- They have less than 10 minutes left.

296
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,550
They're aware of that,,
but they're doing what they can.

297
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:21,675
Not now.

298
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,018
- What's going on at the plant?
- I'm on with them now.

299
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:26,652
John?

300
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:29,047
Did you try flashing
the memory cards?

301
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:30,469
Three times, honey.

302
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:32,977
We're not in control
of the computer system.

303
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,071
I've already told my people
to get out of here.

304
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,783
I don't allow people to call me "honey,"
but we can discuss that later.

305
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:42,138
Yeah, well,
it sounds like you need to lighten up.

306
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:46,299
I'm heading
to the primary tank room.

307
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,877
I'm going to try to manually
release some of the pressure.

308
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:51,171
- That's not going to stop it.
<i>- No,</i>

309
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:55,133
but it might buy us a few more minutes
so people can evacuate.

310
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,251
I've got a thousand workers
at this facility.

311
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,779
And I am responsible
for their safety.

312
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:04,085
I need you to stay on the phone.

313
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,503
- I'm going to need some help.
- Absolutely. What can I do?

314
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:10,528
I don't have access
to the override schematics.

315
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:14,114
See if you can pull up
the operating procedures for Tank One.

316
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,595
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,072
- I got it. I got it right here.
- All right.

318
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,076
Now look for the emergency valve
release sequence.

319
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,620
Okay.

320
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,705
Valve release.
I have it right here.

321
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:29,680
<i>Okay, good, now...
what I need you to do is...</i>

322
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:33,437
This, wait, this procedure is going
to release the chemical

323
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:36,508
right into the primary tank room
where you are right now.

324
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,226
I know that.
I have respiratory gear on.

325
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,846
I'll be okay,
just give me the sequence.

326
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:46,643
- How long will that protect you?
<i>- Don't worry about it, honey.</i>

327
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:50,509
Okay.

328
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,274
- Are you looking at the routing board?
- I am.

329
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:54,791
Go ahead.

330
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,538
Set the bus switches

331
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,670
to this sequence from left to right:

332
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,071
- Two.
- Two.

333
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:03,577
- Eight.
- Eight.

334
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,097
- Seven.
- Seven.

335
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:06,608
- Four.
- Four.

336
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,133
- Three.
- Three.

337
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:10,818
Done.

338
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,585
<i>The secondary flow valve</i>

339
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,253
should be behind you
and to your right.

340
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,216
I need you to turn that clockwise
please.

341
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,393
All right. All right, I got it.

342
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,190
Okay,

343
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,689
that's one valve down,
three more to go.

344
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,734
Pressure inside the tank
is approaching 400 psi.

345
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:50,497
- How long before the tank ruptures?
- 7 minutes.

346
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:52,175
We've got a problem.

347
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,896
- What is it?
- An alert.

348
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,087
This is our hidden surveillance camera
on the roof.

349
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:58,166
Almeida and Bauer.

350
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,967
- When was this taken?
- 20 minutes ago.

351
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,433
I thought you killed
Almeida and Bauer?

352
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,155
Damn it! You said this location
was kept secret from everyone!

353
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,375
- It was.
- Then what are they doing here?

354
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,811
- I don't know!
- How did they find us?!

355
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,521
600 psi and rising.

356
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,981
Disengage the CIP module.
Begin the offload.

357
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:27,854
What are you doing?
We're almost there.

358
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:31,697
We will continue this attack
from another location.

359
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,574
Let's finish this.
We can handle them.

360
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,752
We need to get out of here now.

361
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,840
The CIP module's disengaged,
starting off load.

362
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,319
Hey, what the hell is that?

363
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,738
What's the matter?

364
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:50,308
The firewall breach just closed.

365
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:52,032
What?

366
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,853
- What are you talking about?
- No CIP intrusion.

367
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:56,375
The firewall is secure.

368
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:58,733
How? The NSA?

369
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,026
I don't know.

370
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,658
Bring the CIP module.

371
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,950
Get Motobo and his wife!

372
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,992
We should go
with the second option on the assault.

373
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,322
2-prong attack. You and Tony
come through the entrance.

374
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:11,913
- We'll go in from here.
- Copy.

375
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,874
Give me the C4 out of the bag.

376
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:49,693
Move.

377
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,548
Move!

378
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,268
Get the CIP device!

379
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:30,782
Clear!

380
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:35,563
All clear over here!

381
00:23:35,946 --> 00:23:37,618
- Get Dubaku?
- Negative!

382
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:41,961
Jack, I've got the CIP device.

383
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:43,713
It's been destroyed.

384
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,018
<i>Jack, it's Renee.</i>

385
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:47,235
<i>The Motobos are safe.
I'm taking them to the van.</i>

386
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,348
Copy that.
I want you and Bill to do a sweep.

387
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:52,363
See if you can find Dubaku.
I'll cover the south side.

388
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,944
John? John, are you still there?

389
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:10,073


390
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,366
<i>Listen to me.
The terrorists are out of the system.</i>

391
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,869
Please tell me
what is happening right now.

392
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:22,386
Automatic shutdown mode
has kicked in.

393
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,662
Pressure's dropping.

394
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,424
I think we're gonna be all right.

395
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:32,386
OK, that's great. Now you gotta
get out of there right now.

396
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,381
John?

397
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:45,108
I can't make the door.

398
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:48,069
I'm sending the rescue team.
A rescue team is on its way.

399
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,000
John, please stay with me.
Stay with me.

400
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,434
- Have they found Dubaku?
- Still searching.

401
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,929
First responders
are five minutes away, Jack.

402
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,063
Copy that.

403
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:34,817
Get up.

404
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,577
I said...

405
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:39,267
get up!

406
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:56,713
They're coming.

407
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,104
Please don't make me do this.

408
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,614
I will go to your home, Michael.

409
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:06,358
I'll make your wife watch
as I kill your daughter,

410
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,123
and then I will kill her.

411
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:09,350
So do as I ask.

412
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:11,382
Save your family.

413
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:33,674
- Let me see your hands!
- It's Latham.

414
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,010
Where's Dubaku?

415
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,261
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,016
Cover!

417
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,389
Tony! Bill!

418
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,121
You're all right?

419
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,694
Jack?

420
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,164


421
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:00,160
- Jack, can you hear me?
- Yeah, we're OK.

422
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,436
What happened?

423
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,371
Latham was wired with explosives.

424
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:05,873
We still don't have Dubaku.

425
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:08,918
- What?
- The CIP device has been destroyed.

426
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,796
I want you to stay with the Motobos.
Make sure they're safe.

427
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:15,013
The police are almost here.
If you get arrested,

428
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:16,642
this operation goes out the window.

429
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,678
- You have to get out of there.
- Copy that.

430
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,509
- He's gone.
- We need to get back to the safe house.

431
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,862
Sean, this stays both NSA

432
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,055
and Homeland have no idea
why the breach at the plant was stopped.

433
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,348
They're still looking.
We're working on it here also.

434
00:27:42,473 --> 00:27:45,663
Janis is coordinating with the forensics
that she sent over to the plant.

435
00:27:46,852 --> 00:27:50,006
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would Dubaku suddenly stop an attack

436
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,211
when he was minutes away
from causing mass casualties?

437
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,547
Maybe there was a malfunction
in the CIP device.

438
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,716
No, I don't want maybes, all right?
I want answers.

439
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,469
- We're doing everything we can.
- It's not good enough right now, is it?

440
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:05,063
I don't know what else to tell you, sir.
I know you're upset about Renee,

441
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,019
but getting angry at me
is not going to make it go any faster.

442
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:11,192
If you think I'm yelling at you
because of my history with Walker,

443
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,390
you are mistaken.

444
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:14,532
There are thousands
of lives at stake here.

445
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,357
That's what concerns me.

446
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:18,685
Sorry, sir.

447
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:22,366
I want you and Janis
to work with NSA.

448
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:25,244
Find out where that CIP device
is being used.

449
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,705
If we find the device,
we find Dubaku.

450
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,707
I appreciate the call.
Thanks a lot.

451
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:45,971
Janis, Larry wants you
to interface with NSA.

452
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:49,119
See if you can back-trace
that CIP code fragment to its source.

453
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:50,244
I'll try.

454
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:55,274
- Who were you talking to?
- The response team at the plant.

455
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:56,692
What did he say?

456
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,551
Facility's clean. A trace amount
of the chemical was released,

457
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:02,239
but not enough to do any damage,
and the site has been secured.

458
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,407
That's good.

459
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,035
- What about the plant manager?
- John Brunner.

460
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,495
- Is he okay?
- No.

461
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,041
- Will you do me a favor?
- It depends.

462
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,211
I'd like to track down Brunner's family.
I was the last one to speak with him

463
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,755
and I feel they should know
how brave he was.

464
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,980
- I'll see what I can find.
- Thank you.

465
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,260
Janis, before you start
sending flowers,

466
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:26,281
you need to find out
where that CIP device was being used.

467
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,099
I know. I'm on it.

468
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,319
Cleanup crews are already on site
and we're continuing our evacuation

469
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:51,984
of a one-mile radius
around the chemical plant.

470
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,114
Casualties?

471
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,720
There was, in fact, one casualty,
the plant manager.

472
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:58,062
13 other workers are being treated
for chemical burns

473
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,546
and inhalation of toxic fumes.

474
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:02,591
And there haven't been
any other intrusions in the firewall?

475
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:05,419
No, madam.
It appears the crisis has been averted.

476
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:09,014
Except that no one was able to explain
how the firewall break disengaged.

477
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,060
Not yet. The FBI has no idea
how it happened. It just happened.

478
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,051
And that's not an explanation.

479
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,225
Perhaps Dubaku was firing
another warning shot.

480
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,819
No, Dubaku's already down two planes.
He's not afraid to take more lives.

481
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,080
In any event, we should be grateful.

482
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:29,118
I'm not one to accept good news
unless I know where it comes from.

483
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:33,539
Until we have more answers,
I want to maintain alert levels.

484
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:36,090
<i>- Madam President?</i>
- Yes?

485
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:39,043
<i>- I have Admiral Smith on the line.</i>
- Put him through.

486
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,366
Thank you, Tim.

487
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,382
Admiral?

488
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,892
I've been trying to reach Agent Gedge,
and he hasn't picked up.

489
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:50,306
Yes, I'm sure
I have the right number.

490
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:52,444
I just spoke to him
over an hour ago.

491
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,969
He said he was outside
Samantha Roth's apartment

492
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:57,023
waiting for the First Gentleman.

493
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,711
Just find him.

494
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:02,504
I don't care
who you have to pull off shift.

495
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,964
Still can't reach Gedge.

496
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:08,115
The Secret Service
doesn't know where he is either.

497
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:13,463
- I need to tell the president.
- Maybe you should hold off.

498
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:15,319
The domestic threat's
been lifted for now

499
00:31:15,444 --> 00:31:17,546
and she's on the phone
with Admiral Smith.

500
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,700
I can't authorize the air strikes

501
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,437
until our post-invasion plans
are in place.

502
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:29,204
Finding a politically
viable replacement, until that happens,

503
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:32,181
you need to keep your forces
at full readiness.

504
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:35,100
The Joint Chiefs
are getting impatient.

505
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,782
Madam President,
we need to talk about your husband.

506
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,485
His theory about your son's death,

507
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,785
he hasn't let it go.

508
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,365
What are you talking about?

509
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,284
He's been harassing
Roger's girlfriend,

510
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,343
accusing her of complicity
in the death of Roger.

511
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:59,678
Henry and I went over it
again and again with the FBI,

512
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,269
and he swore to me
he was past all that.

513
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:06,541
Well, he's found a private investigator
who's feeding his conspiracy theory;

514
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,537
taking advantage of him.

515
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:11,923
Please get Henry on the phone.

516
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,242
I'm afraid I can't do that.

517
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:17,359
Henry's unreachable.

518
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:20,159
I don't understand.

519
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:22,830
Agent Gedge hasn't been
answering his phone.

520
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:27,054
I probably should have
told you before, but...

521
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,112
You're telling me
my husband's gone missing?

522
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,577
Secret Service has put out an APB.

523
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,573
They're going
to Ms. Roth's apartment.

524
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,472
Whatever's going on,
I will find out soon enough.

525
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,052
<i>This is a priority order
code Charlie Zero Charlie.</i>

526
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,477
<i>We need an immediate 20
on Agent Gedge.</i>

527
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:55,490
<i>All available field agents
proceed to his last known location:</i>

528
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,722
<i>404 Wilkinson Drive.</i>

529
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,651
You're making a mistake.

530
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,588
- Think about it.
- Shut up!

531
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:20,224
You haven't killed anybody yet.
You don't need to do this.

532
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,546
Gedge's plan to frame me
is already blown.

533
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,356
If you kill me,

534
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:31,360
they'll know it was murder,
and they'll trace it back to you.

535
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:42,902
Go ahead.

536
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,915
Where's Agent Gedge?
I can't reach him.

537
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,491
Gedge is dead.

538
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:48,774
What happened?

539
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,546
<i>Everything was going
according to plan,</i>

540
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,966
but something went wrong.
Taylor killed Gedge; I don't know how.

541
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,720
- Where's Mr. Taylor now?
- He's right here.

542
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,693
Don't kill him, bring him to me.

543
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,084
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

544
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,549
Prime Minister Matobo,
ma'am, please come with me.

545
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:24,714
Chloe, pull up the Ritter Building
on a satellite grid.

546
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,639
Look for any sign
of Dubaku leaving the site.

547
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:29,371
We've got to find him.

548
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,713
- It's going to take me 20 min.
- Then don't waste time talking.

549
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:37,271
Pull up satellite and traffic cams,
street corners and metro stations.

550
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,942
- What's the priority?
- Satellite!

551
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,067
Fine.

552
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,891
- Bill, we need to rethink this.
- What do you mean?

553
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,515
You were set up to surveil
an undercover operation.

554
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,812
Your cover's been blown.
The police are after us.

555
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,607
We are not equipped to look
for one man in a city of millions.

556
00:35:51,938 --> 00:35:53,754
We need additional resources.

557
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:56,612
- What are you suggesting?
- It's time to contact outside agencies.

558
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,032
- The government?
- Yes.

559
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,249
- You said it couldn't be trusted.
- Right now, we don't have a choice.

560
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:06,455
We can't trust anybody,
that's why we're working on the outside.

561
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:10,125
- President Taylor can be trusted.
- I'm not questioning that.

562
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,354
It's the people around her
who can't be trusted.

563
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,546
Mr. Buchanan, Jack's right.
We need help.

564
00:36:15,468 --> 00:36:18,300
- It's too dangerous.
- We can limit the flow of information.

565
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,844
Mr. Matobo can get us
past the President's outer circle.

566
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,305
That way, we can explain to her
what we're doing.

567
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,975
I think Jack's right.
We left a lot of clues in that building.

568
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,476
We're vulnerable.
We can't do this on our own anymore.

569
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,060
Am I supposed
to remain in hiding with you,

570
00:36:31,185 --> 00:36:34,066
pretend that my wife and I
are still being held hostage or dead?

571
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,209
I need to return to the White House

572
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:39,942
and help the President save
what's left of my country.

573
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,532
Let my husband do this.

574
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:43,902
Let him call President Taylor.

575
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,536
She will listen to him.

576
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,116
Bill, you want to find Dubaku,
make the call.

577
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:04,705
All right.

578
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,987
Get me the White House.

579
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:15,262
<i>Representatives from Boyd Chemical
have assured local authorities</i>

580
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:19,236
<i>that the immediate crisis has passed.
However, this has done little</i>

581
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,077
<i>to calm the nerves
of the citizens of Kidron, Ohio,</i>

582
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:25,312
<i>many of whom have taken shelter
in neighboring communities.</i>

583
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:29,087
<i>Again, we have confirmed one fatality
inside the plant itself.</i>

584
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:33,593
<i>13 others, all Boyd employees, are being
treated at local medical centers...</i>

585
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,623
Yes?

586
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,215
<i>I have prime Minister Matobo
calling for you.</i>

587
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,443
- Matobo?
- Yes, ma'am.

588
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:41,037
You're tracing it?

589
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:43,343
<i>We tried, madame President,
but it's a secure line.</i>

590
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,095
Put him through.

591
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,956
- Prime Minister?
- Yes, madame President.

592
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,247
Are you all right?

593
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:53,020
Thank God my wife and I are both fine.
We were rescued.

594
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,731
By whom?
Where are you?

595
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:57,348
In a safe place.

596
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,577
Madame President,
you need to listen to me.

597
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,990
The people who rescued us,
they have acquired the CIP device.

598
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,162
It has been destroyed, and your country
is no longer under immediate threat.

599
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:13,081
Who are these people?
And tell me how this happened.

600
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:15,208
I will tell you everything
in person,

601
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,754
but, this must happen privately.
I must speak to you alone.

602
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,797
Why alone?

603
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,681
They will bring me to you,
madame President.

604
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,469
We will arrive in ten minutes.

605
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,137
I'll be waiting for you.

606
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,683
They tried to trace the call,
but the line held.

607
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,356
- Ethan, I need to see you right now.
- <i>Be right there.</i>

608
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:49,415
- Yes, madame President?
- I just spoke to prime Minister Matobo.

609
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,307
- What?
- He's safe.

610
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,593
- How? What happened?
- He'll let us know when he gets here.

611
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:58,085
He's on his way now.
He wants a private meeting.

612
00:38:58,823 --> 00:39:02,547
Bring him in through the south entrance,
keep this to as few people as possible.

613
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:04,302
All right.

614
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,015
I've mapped a route for you
to the White House.

615
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,612
It's mostly side streets,
but there will be fewer traffic cams.

616
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:16,254
Okay, good. Send it to my phone.

617
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:19,845
We're ready. Let's go. As soon as we set
the vehicle in front of the building,

618
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,170
agent Walker will move Mr. Matobo.

619
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,653
What?

620
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:26,967
I'm not going.

621
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,936
What are you talking about?

622
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,755
If the government gets their hands
on Tony, they'll arrest him.

623
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,308
I already told you.

624
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:37,120
I did some pretty bad things
before I teamed up with Bill.

625
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,965
Tony, take it from me...

626
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,378
You need to deal
with the consequences.

627
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:45,096
And believe me, I will.
But not yet. Not till we get Dubaku.

628
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:47,143
I'm working on a lead.

629
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:50,525
I've got a guy on Emerson's crew
who might have some intel we can use.

630
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,847
Let him do this.

631
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,425
He's the reason we got this far.

632
00:39:57,725 --> 00:39:58,603
Fine.

633
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:01,023
But you give me your word
as soon as this as over,

634
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,991
you turn yourself in.
We'll stand behind you.

635
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,743
All right, you have my word.

636
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,395
Good luck. Be careful.

637
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,308
I was on my way to work,
so I thought I'd stop in and see you.

638
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,469
- I tried calling you earlier.
- I'm sorry; I've been busy.

639
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,638
Are you all right?
You look exhausted.

640
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:16,932
It's just been a long day.

641
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:20,927
Well, I hope you're still coming over
for dinner. I'm making lasagna.

642
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:24,552
And my sister promises
not to give you any more dirty looks.

643
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,252
- You haven't forgotten, have you?
- No.

644
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:30,987
It's just that I've got
some business to attend to.

645
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:33,240
Samuel, you work too much.

646
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,701
Every time you come into the diner,
you're always on the phone.

647
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,213
I have to, Marika,

648
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:41,623
so I can finally take you away
from that awful place that you work in.

649
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,070
Well, we met in that awful place.
Don't forget that.

650
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,088
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

651
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,814
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- Have you got Mr. Taylor?

652
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,024
Yes. I'm about three 3 min away.

653
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,069
There's a korean grocer
opposite my building.

654
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,531
One of my men will meet you out back.
Bring Taylor inside.

655
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:19,333
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Just make sure you weren't followed.
