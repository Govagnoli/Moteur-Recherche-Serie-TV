1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,876
Previously on "24":

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,752
Welcome to the first of three debates

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,111
between President David Palmer
and Senator John Keeler.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,276
We've just learned that the woman with whom
the president is involved, Dr Anne Packard,

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,717
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,879
Did the president know of these
accusations and choose to ignore them?

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,635
Kim, your dad's trying to break out Salazar.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,877
- When did you last hear from him?
- About a half hour ago.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,117
He asked me to issue a transfer order
for Ram Ãn Salazar.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,232
- And you did it.
- Yeah. He said Salazar needed to be moved.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,989
- You're telling me this isn't true?
- Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,874
- What's gonna happen to him?
- Best way out of this is to find Kyle Singer.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,672
Then your dad will give up Salazar.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,833
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,838
If I die, the virus is dying with me.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,592
Kyle!

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,397
I got it. A patrol car found
the truck Kyle Singer was in.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,431
Pipe this in to the teams on standby.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,155
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level one CDC protocol.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,512
If you wanna get out of this,
you're gonna have to trust me.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,397
- Chase!
- What are you doing, Jack?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,597
I gotta get Salazar in the air in 60 seconds
or 100,000 people will die. You choose.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,549
This is Warden Mitchell. I want all teams
to stand down. I repeat, stand down.

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,272
Congratulations. Now you are an even
bigger enemy to your country than I am.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,871
The following takes place
between 6pm and 7pm.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,318
Have we enough fuel to get to Mexico?

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,789
- We're not going to Mexico.
- What? Why not?

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,634
If we try, they'll just force us down.
You're gonna have to trust me.

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,755
- Field Ops. O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Chase.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,872
Jack disarmed his locator,
but the military have him on radar.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,869
They're feeding us the stream
now, Chase. I'm sending it to you.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,676
He just banked.
He's heading west towards downtown.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,396
Downtown? He knows they can't
shoot him down over a populated area.

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,671
Try to override his disabled comms
using an emergency frequency.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,076
We have to get through
to let him know we found Kyle Singer.

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,149
On it.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,068
Major Blanchard, this is Chappelle.
What's the status of your pursuit craft?

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,272
I have two helicopters that have
just taken off from down here.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,713
- How quickly will they intercept?
- Bauer's no longer headed south toward us.

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,479
- Where's he headed?
- He's headed toward the city.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,876
At his current speed,
it'll take us ten minutes to get within range.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,351
You got to force him down.
Even shoot him down, if it comes to that.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,155
We can't do that over the city
without serious collateral damage.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,239
Then do it before he gets to the city.
If he lands, he'll be difficult to catch.

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,873
- Yes, sir.
- Keep this line open.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony. Division
wants a senior officer in charge of CTU.

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,269
Give me an update.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,716
We're trying to contact the chopper.
Now the virus is contained,

49
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,594
we need to let Jack know
the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,880
Send the department heads to the conference
area. I want everyone on the same page.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,755
- What about C-band?
- It's a SWAT chopper, they wouldn't use it.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,750
Adam, tie up whatever you're doing. We have
a briefing in the conference area in two.

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
Kim?

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,873
- Over here.
- What do you need?

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,478
Anchor these lists for Chloe while she tries
to find an admitting channel for the chopper.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,556
I'm on it.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,871
I'm sorry I lost it in your dad's office.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,875
It's OK. Did you tell Michelle
about the drugs you found in there?

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,599
- Yeah.
- What are they gonna do?

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,278
I don't know. Everything came in right
after that, so no one's had time to process.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,239
- Sending you over the first two groups.
- Sure.

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,674
We'll attempt to communicate with Jack,
to resolve this peacefully.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,679
But if we can't, I need everyone
absolutely clear on this.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,999
Salazar's terrorist connections are a threat
to this country. We cannot let him leave.

65
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,673
Now that we've got Singer, should it come
to it, both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,872
Can't we focus on options
to bring down the chopper without force?

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,873
Jack's not giving us any options.
He's on a suicide mission either way.

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,391
Once he hands Ram Ãn off to Hector,
they'll have no use for him. They'll kill him.

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,672
I just got off the phone with Major Blanchard.
He has pursuit craft tracking Jack.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,873
However, if they're not able to catch him
by the time he reaches metro airspace,

71
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,354
then we have a whole new set of problems.

72
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,869
We need to coordinate
with local authorities now.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,596
(ringing tone)

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,349
- Dammit!
- Hector, relax.

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,758
- Why can't I reach Gael?
- Maybe he can't get away.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,072
I need to know what's going on
with Ram Ãn now.

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,710
The government is probably
releasing him. It's just taking time.

78
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,434
They're not releasing him.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,396
- I didn't want to tell you.
- Tell me what?

80
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,911
The plan has changed. Jack Bauer
is the one who is going to deliver Ram Ãn.

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,955
Jack Bauer? What is that, a joke?

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,439
- No.
- How is that possible?

83
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,519
Ram Ãn would never accept help
from the man who put him in prison.

84
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,915
Oh, no. He is accepting his help.

85
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,795
Bauer is now a criminal
in his own country for doing this.

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,078
Hector, what's going on? How could you let
Bauer come to us? That's too dangerous.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,880
- Don't worry about it, Claudia.
- No, I am worried!

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,031
Look what he's already done to us.
It's some kind of trick.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,433
Don't worry about Jack Bauer.
I have plans for him.

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,516
- (phone rings)
- Yes?

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,791
I don't have a lot of time.
We're in the middle of this.

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,438
Is Ram Ãn alive?

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,870
Yes. He and Bauer
have escaped in a helicopter.

94
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,032
- Have they contacted our pilot?
- No. They're being pursued.

95
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,879
Everything will be decided
in the next few minutes.

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,155
Hey.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,880
What did Chappelle say in the briefing?

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,713
He said a lot of stuff.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,870
Are they gonna try
and shoot down my father?

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,996
If they have to. But if they can contact him it
won't come to that. Chloe, where are you at?

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,834
No progress on the hailing frequency.
We can't get through to Jack.

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,192
I've some new ones to try. Use a tree search.
We've got to get through to that chopper.

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,556
- Kim?
- Yeah?

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,148
- I need to speak to you.
- Sure.

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,880
Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here until
the situation with your father is resolved.

106
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,635
- I'm qualified to handle the work.
- Your qualifications aren't at issue.

107
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,157
- Your emotions are.
- I can control my emotions.

108
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,880
My father's doing this to stop the virus. If he
knows we have Singer, he'll return Salazar.

109
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,916
I know, but we can't reach your father.

110
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,830
Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are
getting there. And I can help them.

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,235
I'm a resource, Michelle. Don't do this.

112
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,718
OK, go back and help Adam.

113
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,078
If we have to fire on that chopper,
I want her out of here.

114
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,911
(alarm)

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,880
- What's going on?
- It's military.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,110
- How can you tell?
- Their formation and speed.

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,277
- They'll be on us in three to four minutes.
- And then what?

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,672
I assume they've got orders
to shoot us out of the sky.

119
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,151
- Chappelle.
- I just called CTU.

120
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,875
- They said you authorised the use of force.
- That's right, Chase, I did.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,911
Does President Palmer
know about this?

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,152
Palmer? First of all,
he's in the middle of a national debate.

123
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,751
And I don't need his authorisation. Bauer
helped Ram Ãn Salazar break out of prison.

124
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,235
To stop Salazar's people releasing this virus.

125
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,676
I don't care. Look, this is my jurisdiction.

126
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,873
All I'm saying is that getting Palmer's
authorisation might be the smart play here.

127
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,310
Think about it. Bauer has
a personal relationship with the president.

128
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,111
He's saved his life more than once, and
Palmer has interceded on his behalf before.

129
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,030
Our mandate does not bend to
accommodate personal relationships.

130
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,870
You're right. After you shoot Jack down, you
can personally explain that to the president.

131
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,234
- (phone rings)
- Chappelle.

132
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,114
Our aircraft are about to make contact
with Bauer. We can be ready to fire...

133
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,872
Do not fire. Repeat, do not fire
until you hear back from me.

134
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,833
The president has spoken of his support
for the American worker,

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,880
but I'm sure these words sound hollow
to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston,

136
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,237
to Shawnda Brown of Biloxi,
to Kendall Taylor of Tampa,

137
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,831
and to 100,000 of their fellow workers
who have lost their jobs

138
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,190
because of trade agreements
signed by President David Palmer.

139
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,880
- It's my belief that opportunities were missed.
- (phone rings)

140
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,156
- Wayne Palmer.
- Mr Palmer, Ryan Chappelle calling.

141
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,880
Mr Chappelle,
what's the latest on the bio threat?

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,000
Kyle Singer, who we believe to be
the only carrier of the virus, is in custody.

143
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,714
So there's no risk
of this virus being released?

144
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,880
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, thank God.

145
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,271
- Yes. We still have the Bauer situation.
- What's the status?

146
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,472
Bauer has taken Salazar
from the prison in a helicopter.

147
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,189
We have him in our sights
but can't communicate.

148
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,438
- What are you planning on doing?
- We can't allow Salazar to leave the country.

149
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,359
I'm afraid our only alternative
is to shoot him down.

150
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,313
Mr Chappelle, my brother
is not gonna like that.

151
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,753
That's why I'm calling. I don't wanna fire
on Bauer without the president's permission.

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,192
The president is in the middle of a televised
debate right now. This is gonna have to wait.

153
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,273
In a few minutes, their helicopter
is going to be over downtown LA.

154
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,190
We'll be unable to shoot it down without
risking significant civilian casualties.

155
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,788
- Let me get back to you, Ryan.
- Soon, Mr Palmer.

156
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,476
Otherwise Bauer will land that chopper and
disappear with Salazar into the population.

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,836
Yeah.

158
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,194
(Palmer) Economic experts predict that those
jobs will be regained and more will be created.

159
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,795
- (chairman) Senator Keeler.
- (Keeler) Whose economic experts?

160
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,512
The administration's? I, for one,
cannot accept the blurred numbers

161
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,313
projected by the so-called economic experts
of this administration. Those are the people...

162
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,512
(Wayne) David, it's me.
The bio threat's been eliminated.

163
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,355
We have Kyle Singer in custody.
However, Jack Bauer doesn't know this.

164
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,880
He's facilitated Salazar's escape and they're
in a chopper on the outskirts of the city.

165
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,996
Listen to me carefully, David.

166
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,918
It may be necessary to shoot him down.

167
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,359
(Keeler) I would like to hear the
president's answer to that question.

168
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880
(Wayne) Are you prepared to authorise this?

169
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,351
(chairman) Mr President, your response?

170
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,472
Come on, David. What do you wanna do?

171
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,197
(Keeler) I think the entire American
workforce would like to hear his answer.

172
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,871
- (chairman) Mr President?
- My fellow Americans,

173
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,160
I have been informed of a national emergency
that requires my immediate attention.

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,358
Therefore I must withdraw from this debate.

175
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,436
Excuse me.

176
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,351
- Now what is this?
- (chairman) This is, to say the least, unusual.

177
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,472
No one here is sure what this emergency is...

178
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,114
I need this room clear.

179
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,873
Get these people out of here!

180
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,998
(Singer) Hey!

181
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,392
Where are you guys taking me?

182
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,476
Where are you taking me?

183
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
Why won't you talk to me?

184
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
Hey! Hey!

185
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,198
Help!

186
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,270
Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

187
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,591
Hey!

188
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
What's goin' on?

189
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,431
- Talk to me, please!
- I'm Dr Duncan. I need you to calm down.

190
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,872
- Where's my girlfriend? Where's Linda?
- We have her in another part of the facility.

191
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,951
- Is she OK?
- Yes, she's fine.

192
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,640
There's an incubation period of 14 hours.

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,874
With this virus, if you haven't become
symptomatic, you haven't transmitted it.

194
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,316
But what about my parents?
Are they going to be OK too?

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,230
Yeah, they're on their way.

196
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,873
What happens when I do become...
symptomatic?

197
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,317
It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it?

198
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,353
It's gonna eat me alive.

199
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,076
We'll keep you as comfortable as possible.

200
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,074
(pilot on radio) Alpha One,
Zebra One. We have visual.

201
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,756
They've locked onto our heat signature.

202
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,677
- Why aren't they firing?
- I don't know.

203
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,474
Chloe, come on,
give me the hailing frequency.

204
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,353
I can't make the servers go any faster, OK?

205
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,675
(Blanchard) We've locked onto the chopper.
It is not yet over a populated zone.

206
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,032
- I need an answer.
- How much time do we have, precisely?

207
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,636
Before collateral damage becomes an issue,
just over four minutes.

208
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,275
Stay on course, Major. I'm waiting
to hear back from the president.

209
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,632
We still haven't gotten any indication
as to the nature of this national emergency.

210
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,477
Senator Keeler's staff is questioning
whether or not this emergency actually exists.

211
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,711
If this indeed is
a national emergency of any sort,

212
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,957
something to challenge the nation
at this critical time,

213
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,676
it would be an odd thing, but nonetheless
something that should be taken seriously.

214
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,319
And so tonight everyone on both sides
of the aisle is beginning to tread lightly...

215
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,513
- Could you give us a moment, please?
-..veracity to the president's claim.

216
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,956
(woman on TV) Any speculation
as to what the emergency might be?

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,029
(man) The auditorium was abuzz
with speculation of all sorts...

218
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,037
David, I'm sorry,
but we don't have a lot of time.

219
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,994
So what do you want to do
about shooting down this chopper?

220
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,477
- I can't order them to kill Bauer.
- You can't let Salazar go either.

221
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,279
Is it Salazar you're worried about?

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,756
Or are you worried
Bauer will talk about our arrangement?

223
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,998
It's a fair question. To be blunt, yeah,
I am worried about that. Even if you're not.

224
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,510
But you still have to think about
national security, David.

225
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,639
Salazar not only runs a drug cartel,
he's connected to terrorist organisations.

226
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,392
And he has proven he has the infrastructure
to launch a biological attack on our soil.

227
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,476
We can't allow him to do that again.

228
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,558
Jack Bauer sacrificed everything
to prevent that attack.

229
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,990
Jack Bauer volunteered.
Jack Bauer knew the risks.

230
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,393
David, you have got to make this decision
as if it wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

231
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,870
You have to do what's right
for this country, David.

232
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,989
Listen, this is your call.

233
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,873
But you gotta make it now.

234
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,557
Get me Chappelle.

235
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,071
- (Blanchard) We have just over one minute...
- (phone rings)

236
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,589
Hold on, Major.

237
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,359
- Ryan Chappelle.
- This is President Palmer.

238
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,869
Can't you force down that chopper
without firing?

239
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,191
Bauer won't communicate with us.
He's forcing our hand.

240
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,235
- How much time do we have?
- In 60 seconds he'll be out of reach.

241
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,270
Sir?

242
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,477
- You have my authorisation to fire.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,238
- Major, shoot him down.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,791
Alpha One to Zebra One and Zebra Two.
You have a go. I repeat, you have a go.

245
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,348
(pilot) Roger that. Preparing to launch.

246
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,428
- Dammit, what's happening?
- They gave the order.

247
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,278
No. Please.

248
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,880
(pilot #1) He's diving. I don't have a shot.

249
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,678
(pilot #2) He's changing course.
Get under him.

250
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,791
(pilot #1) Do you have a shot?

251
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,759
(pilot #2) Negative. He knows we 're
on him, and he 's manoeuvring away.

252
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,872
- (pilot #1) Rockets engaged.
- You're clear for shot.

253
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,193
- (pilot #1) Target locked. I'm taking the shot.
- (pilot #2) Hold fire. Stand by.

254
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,636
Alpha One, he 's reached downtown corridor.
Should we still fire?

255
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,880
No. Stand down.
I repeat, do not fire. Do not fire.

256
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,348
(pilot #1) Roger that,
Alpha One. Standing down.

257
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,515
We're going in.

258
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,310
All right. Everyone, fall back to B protocols.

259
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,556
Have all units on the ground prepared.

260
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,274
Wherever Bauer lands,
I want to be on top of him.

261
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,428
(pilot #1) I'm coming up behind.
Stay with him. He's heading to the southeast.

262
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,880
He's dogging.

263
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,756
Dessler.

264
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,236
- What's going on?
- They're not firing. Jack's over the city.

265
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,796
- Can you get him on the hailing frequency?
- Chloe's getting close.

266
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,478
- OK, he's putting it down. I've gotta go.
- Whoa, whoa. Get me to Chloe.

267
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,194
- (phone rings)
- Yeah?

268
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,751
Chloe? Chloe?

269
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,555
- Any second now, Chase.
- I need to get through to him before he lands.

270
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,711
(car horns)

271
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,877
I've got it, Chase.
Patching you through. You're in. Go.

272
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,236
Jack? We found Kyle Singer.

273
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,314
I repeat, we found Kyle Singer. The virus is
contained. There's no need for you to do this.

274
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,873
(woman over PA) Area four, full quarantine.

275
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,349
Mr and Mrs Singer, I'm Dr Duncan.

276
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,879
- Hi.
- Hello.

277
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,553
(man) One more second.
That's good. Get these.

278
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,558
(Dr Duncan)..but our options
for treatment are limited.

279
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,913
I don't understand. If he's not sick yet,
why isn't there any way to treat him?

280
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,997
Once someone's exposed and is incubating
the virus, there's nothing we can do.

281
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,275
- Well, how long does he have?
- The lab tests haven't come back yet...

282
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,595
Please, just give me some idea.

283
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,880
Hours, not days.

284
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,269
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,871
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

286
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,793
- Come on, hon.
- No, I can't. I can't!

287
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,998
Hey, Helen, he needs to know
that we're not angry with him.

288
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,673
OK?

289
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,875
(medic) Almost done.

290
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,952
Kyle, your parents would like
to speak with you.

291
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,398
They can hear you through the intercom.

292
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,918
Take your time. I'll be just outside.

293
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,997
- Baby.
- The Doctor told us everything.

294
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,396
But maybe they're wrong.

295
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,876
Maybe it isn't as bad as they think.

296
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,799
They're not wrong.

297
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,919
- I deserve what I'm getting.
- Don't say that.

298
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,478
All you deserved was a father
who could do better for you,

299
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,588
so you wouldn't have to get money
and bring it home because I couldn't.

300
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,880
No.

301
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,749
I'm sorry. Kyle, I'm so sorry.

302
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,474
I love you.

303
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,872
You've always taken care of me.

304
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,474
Now, I never...

305
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,956
Now, I never told you this,

306
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,789
but you made me feel safe.

307
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,950
Even now,

308
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,833
you make me feel safe.

309
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,998
You did the best you could, Dad.

310
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,832
- I don't wanna die.
- No, no.

311
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,870
- Edmunds, CTU. Anybody seen 'em?
- They ran into the station five minutes ago.

312
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,072
- How many trains have left?
- Two. One stopped ten blocks east.

313
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,829
Officers are searching that area.
We stopped the other train here.

314
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,919
- Jack won't let himself get trapped on a train.
- You think he's still in the tunnel?

315
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,553
- CTU. Bauer.
- Kim.

316
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,673
- I need MTA schematics of Pershing Square.
- What's going on?

317
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,839
Your dad got out of the chopper.
He and Salazar are on the run.

318
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,632
I've got the schematics.

319
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,753
How many tunnel emergency exits
are there between here and Grant?

320
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,108
- Kim?
- I'm looking.

321
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,880
Come on, let's go!

322
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,158
There's one. In the alley just off
Sixth Street. Southwest corner.

323
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,834
- How far is that from here?
- One block.

324
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,872
- All one-ways. You're better off on foot.
- I'll get back to you.

325
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,509
Hey, are we coordinating
with you guys or not?

326
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,074
(car horns)

327
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,236
- I just spoke to Chase at the metro station.
- What did he want?

328
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,630
- Plans of the subways.
- Copy them to our other agents.

329
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,716
- I did.
- Good.

330
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,760
They know not to use lethal force, right?

331
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,036
Mandate's the same.
Stop Salazar by any means necessary.

332
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,880
But now that they're on the ground, they can
probably do that without harming your father.

333
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,199
Right.

334
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,871
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Chase.

335
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,714
Jack got out through a maintenance access
off Mission.

336
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,752
Redeploy all your people here.
Seal off a ten-block radius.

337
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,995
I'm on it.

338
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,036
Come on, get in.

339
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,880
The exit of the president did come
at a critical time in the debate,

340
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,353
and even pundits on both sides of the aisle
are speculating that it is odd to say the least...

341
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,917
Y eah, I will. I'll tell him. Thanks.

342
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,192
That was CTU.
They still haven't found Bauer or Salazar.

343
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,831
LAPD's placing a net around the area
where the chopper landed.

344
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,394
Hopefully they'll be picked up
without incident.

345
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,475
Yeah. Yeah, it's probably
more likely that Bauer slipped through.

346
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,396
David, listen. You're gonna have to stop
thinking about his welfare for the moment.

347
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,514
Bauer breaking Salazar out of prison
has already leaked to the press.

348
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,879
You're gonna have to explain to them
that's why you ended this debate.

349
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,196
And then explicitly denounce what Bauer did.

350
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,880
So Jack puts his life on the line to stop
the virus, and we hang him out to dry.

351
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,873
David, we cannot allow anyone to know
that we sanctioned what he did.

352
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,997
That would do irreparable damage
to you, to the office...

353
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,476
Now, you know what I'm saying is true.

354
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,314
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to let him go.

355
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,915
(dials phone)

356
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,112
- Who are you calling?
- Your pilot.

357
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,357
Your brother gave the FBl
contact instructions in his last call.

358
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,948
He's got a plane circling,
waiting to pick you up.

359
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,112
So CTU knows about the plane?
Won't that be a problem?

360
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,992
Not for long.

361
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,309
(phone rings)

362
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,273
- Yes?
- This is Jack Bauer. I've got Salazar.

363
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:42,511
I'm on a secure cell. 7-1-1-star-6-5-5-9.
Reconfigure your frequency and call me back.

364
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,230
- If I get confirmation.
- That's right.

365
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,229
- Is this the real thing?
- Yes. He's got Salazar. Call him back.

366
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,035
- And we're buffered from CTU?
- It's handled.

367
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,516
(phone rings)

368
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,195
- Yeah?
- (pilot) Where are you?

369
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,312
2700 block of Figueroa.
We're headed south.

370
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,880
The closest safe airstrip is Santa Margarita.
Do you know where that is?

371
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,316
Yeah, I can get there in about ten minutes.

372
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,079
You really are the best, Jack.

373
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,149
When you were down there with us,
I had no idea you were an agent.

374
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,229
We accepted you. You didn't
have to put the needle in your arm.

375
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,390
You did that for other reasons.
Same reason as all junkies. To kill the pain.

376
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,074
What's your pain, Jack?

377
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,993
What does the needle make go away, huh?

378
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,989
- Tell Division to move their men.
- (man) Same place?

379
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,874
- Yeah, we need everyone downtown.
- (woman) Dr Linzer on line three.

380
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,431
- (man) lt'll take a few minutes.
- Yeah, call me back with confirmation.

381
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,870
- Yeah, Doctor?
- Well, your husband's out of surgery.

382
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,229
- How is he?
- There was no nerve damage.

383
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,237
The injury was entirely vascular.

384
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,595
- And that's what we were hoping for, right?
- Yes, he should recover fully.

385
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,159
Oh, thank God.

386
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,956
He's going into post-op now,
so he should be awake in the next hour or so.

387
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,238
I'll be there. Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

388
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,032
Thanks.

389
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,349
That was the hospital.

390
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,155
Tony's gonna be OK.

391
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,634
- That's good news.
- Thank you, Ryan.

392
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,593
Have you heard back from lNS?

393
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,078
Yeah, we sent out an alert,
and we're covered from Baja to New Mexico.

394
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,549
How about local airfields?

395
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,070
We're trying to stop everything
but we're bogged down with the FAA.

396
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,876
Have Gael run a pattern analysis on local
air traffic. We may come up with an anomaly.

397
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,155
That's a good idea.

398
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,999
(phone rings)

399
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,270
- Kaufman.
- Adam, where's Gael?

400
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,551
Um, Tech One. Kim and l
are just about to head down there.

401
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,877
- Do you need me to tell him something?
- Just send him to my office.

402
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,072
- OK, I'll let him know.
- Thanks.

403
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,908
Once you get back in the air, I'll be offline.
Increment your frequency every 15 minutes.

404
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,271
- I'll pick you up on 22-7.
- (pilot) Roger that.

405
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,391
(beeping)

406
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
I'll get back to you.

407
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,395
(Adam) Everything on the system
hasn't been updated since 11am.

408
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,239
- That's where you should start.
- (Kim) Got it.

409
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,113
Gael? Michelle needs to see you in her office.

410
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,435
OK.

411
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,028
- You can use this station.
- What's she doing?

412
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,470
Updating the logs.
We got behind when everything hit the fan.

413
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,757
I can do that a lot faster than she can.

414
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,314
No, Michelle needs to see you now.

415
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,358
- OK, you're all set.
- Great.

416
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,755
- See you in a bit.
- Yup.

417
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,512
(agent) Sir?

418
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,554
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah.

419
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,355
I want these two paragraphs inverted. And
have the secretary meet me in the morning.

420
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,274
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

421
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,429
Is everything OK?

422
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,792
We had to make some fast choices,
and I couldn't do that while I was on stage.

423
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,997
Yes, everything's OK now.

424
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,315
Are you sure?

425
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,671
- This is just damage control.
- David, I'm sorry.

426
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,237
I still can't believe Keeler would
repeat those lies in a national debate.

427
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,995
You don't have to apologise for anything.
We didn't sink to their level.

428
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,351
And in the long run, it's gonna pay off.

429
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,314
- I hope you're right.
- But I'm more concerned about you.

430
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,512
You've only been brought into this
because of me.

431
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,749
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are.

432
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,389
David, Jerry scheduled a press conference.
They're expecting a statement this evening.

433
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,351
- Fine.
- Good.

434
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,758
- We need a response to Keeler's accusation.
- What did the quick polls tell us?

435
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,274
We got hit hard. Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

436
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,510
Once they find out Ted was lying...

437
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,633
And how are they supposed to do that, Anne?
It's he-said-she-said.

438
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,230
This is politics. It's not medicine.
Do me a favour and stay out of it.

439
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,876
- "Stay out of it"? I am it.
- That's enough.

440
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,873
Be patient. Anne's not going anywhere,
and we're not changing our strategy.

441
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,398
- David, we need to talk...
- Right now, it's "Mr President".

442
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,874
Yes sir, Mr President.

443
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,352
I may not agree with his bedside
manner, but I think he's right.

444
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,314
- You don't need this right now.
- What are you saying?

445
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,716
We should put our relationship on hold
until after the election.

446
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,358
First of all, that won't resolve anything.
And second of all, I need you.

447
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,872
Then I'm right here.

448
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,873
That's my lady.

449
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,869
- (medic #1) And the third series?
- (medic #2) Yeah, he'll be isolated.

450
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,519
Wait a minute.

451
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,279
How can that be?

452
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,630
- Have we checked these results?
- Three times.

453
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,876
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

454
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,236
OK. Thanks.

455
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,872
Yeah, get me Chappelle at CTU.
Put him through to my cell.

456
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,828
What's going on?

457
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,350
There's no trace of the virus in your blood.

458
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,435
What?

459
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,874
We reran the tests several times and had them
double-checked at another lab. You're clean.

460
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,277
My God!

461
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,916
(phone rings)

462
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,879
- Duncan.
- Nicole. Chappelle.

463
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,435
- Kyle Singer's tests came back negative.
- How is that possible?

464
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,988
It's only possible if he was never infected.

465
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,278
You're telling me this whole
virus scare was a bluff?

466
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,393
I don't know if I'd say that.
That dead body this morning was infected.

467
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,354
Then why wouldn't they have infected
the boy? What the hell is going on here?

468
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,869
I don't know. You tell me.

469
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,274
(shouting in Spanish)

470
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,837
- What the hell's going on?
- You didn't think I'd let you just leave?

471
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,871
- Get him out.
- Ram Ãn!

472
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,390
What the hell is going on? Ram Ãn!

473
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,394
- Thanks for the ride, Jack.
- Ram Ãn!

474
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,671
Hector said to bring him back. Alive.

475
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,793
Fine. Let's go.

476
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,998
Adam!

477
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,554
Adam, there's something seriously wrong...
