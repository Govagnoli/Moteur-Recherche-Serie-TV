1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,992
Ijust spoke to my source
at Keeler's headquarters.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,590
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,678
- Meeting Keeler about what?
- He didn't know, David.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,430
I came here because I can guarantee you
a win in November.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,155
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,990
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,829
- Why are you lying to me?
- I screwed up earlier.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,992
The SAT transmission on my system
was forged by own people.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,953
Making a mistake is one thing.
Covering it up is another.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,958
I can't let you stay in place.
I am taking over command of CTU.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,119
- I made a mistake, Jack.
- No, Tony. You made two.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,549
I'm going to let you speak to your husband.
Tell him you're OK and being treated well.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,632
- (Tony) Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Don't let them do this...

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,150
If Jane is not released when I order it,
your wife dies.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,317
That's all you need to know. Are we clear?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,880
From this point on, I am assuming control
of CTU. Tony Almeida has stepped down.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,158
(Tony) I'm taking Jane Saunders to Division.
Here's the order.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,990
We're leaving right now.
We're going out this way right here.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,992
- Where are all the guards?
- We don't need those guards.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,910
Tony locked me in here. Saunders has
Michelle. He's using her to get his daughter.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,716
- This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.
- I'll give you instructions in 20 minutes.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,276
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,429
Chloe, pull up all the surveillance tape
from every exit. Focus on the last 10 minutes.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,677
- Have you linked up with traffic yet?
- I'm working on it.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,997
- I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders.
- That's right.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,116
- Why?
- Saunders has Michelle.

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,800
- He wants to trade her.
- Jane is our only leverage.

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,233
I know that.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,557
I got him. He left the building
and drove off the premises.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,800
He's in a silver SUV. Prep a tactical team.
Be ready to move as soon as I give the order.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,997
I got him. He's on 5th
about half a mile from here, heading east.

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,192
I'll call you from the car.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,556
(Tony) Son of a bitch.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,357
- Are you OK?
- It's just traffic.

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,235
- You've been acting all weird since we left.
- There's a lot going on right now.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,074
You never explained why you wanted
to transfer me to this Division place.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,475
- I told you...
- I know. It doesn't make sense.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,798
I don't have the time
to explain it to you right now.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,909
Almeida got my daughter out of CTU.
Be ready to move the moment I tell you.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,395
When are you calling Almeida
with instructions?

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,478
15 minutes. I'll be with Frederick.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,269
At least 800 people are dead or dying
in the Chandler Plaza Hotel

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,030
because Saunders released a weaponised
virus into the ventilation system.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,317
What the media is reporting is a cover story.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,194
They're deflecting the truth
to avoid mass panic.

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,318
You'll be infected along with everyone else!

47
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,595
No matter what he's paying you,
it's not worth losing your life!

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,910
Jack's in pursuit of Tony. We move out
as soon as we get a location on Saunders.

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,871
Good.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,879
- Kim, what are you doing?
- I'm on the team monitoring my father.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,798
- I thought you were setting up a tactical unit.
- I am.

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,037
We have to wait
until we get a location on Saunders.

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,432
Listen. Before I have to go back out there,
I wanna talk to you.

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,516
About what?

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,194
About us.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,676
I need to know
whether there's gonna be an us.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,472
Look, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and the baby changes everything.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,275
- It doesn't change the way I feel about you.
- Forget about me for a second.

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,076
You have a daughter
and a job that won't let you be with her.

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,919
Is that you talking or your father?

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,999
My dad would be the first one to admit it -
he wasn't the greatest dad.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,238
And it wasn't because he didn't love me.
I know he loved me.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,880
It was because of his job.

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,717
If I transferred out of field ops,
would you consider staying with me?

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,353
I wanna stay with you,
and I would raise a child with you, Chase.

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,469
I just won't raise one foryou.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,399
- Adam, is he still on 5th Street?
- No, he turned between Jarvis and Hill.

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,590
- Widen the search.
- I am.

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,914
Got him. He's going south on Vine, two
blocks below Hill. You could save time...

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,792
I got it.

71
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,798
He's hit traffic.
You might be able to intercept on Grant.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,597
Look, I know you're lying to me.
I know you're not taking me to Division.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,349
- You're fine, Jane.
- At least tell me where we're going.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,149
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to your father.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,232
My father? Why?

76
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,315
He's holding my wife hostage.
He'll kill her if I don't take you back to him.

77
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,591
So, basically, you're kidnapping me.

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,358
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,632
After everything he's done,
how can you be sure he'll do what he says?

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,638
How do you know
he won't kill your wife anyway?

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,390
I don't have a choice. I wish I did, but I don't.

82
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,839
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,794
Put the gun on the dash now!

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,068
Slowly get out of the car.

85
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,917
Jane, stay where you are.
Everything's gonna be fine.

86
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
- Saunders has Michelle.
- I know.

87
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,511
- He wants to make a trade.
- I know. I can't let that happen.

88
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,710
I almost lost her once today.

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,832
I understand exactly how you're feeling.
I've been there.

90
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,317
- And you handled it just like me!
- Millions of lives are at stake.

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,190
- Rules apply to other people, but not to you?
- Tony, just calm down, OK? Come on.

92
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,989
You help me make this trade,
I'll turn myself in, go to prison, whatever.

93
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,351
I can't do it.
We need Jane to lure her father in.

94
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,756
- Even if Michelle's gotta die?
- Michelle doesn't have to die.

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,872
We can string Saunders along.
Start working with me.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,150
- Chase has already got a strike team.
- No!

97
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,673
- Saunders sees CTU, he kills Michelle.
- He's not gonna know we're there.

98
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,319
Where are you meeting him?

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,595
Tony, you don't have a choice. You've gotta
work with me on this. Where is the meeting?

100
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,871
Come on. Where are you meeting him?

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,159
He wants me to be at a payphone at the
corner of Taylor and Vine in five minutes.

102
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,074
He'll give me further instructions from there.

103
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,793
Thank you. You're doing the right thing.

104
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,394
The quarantined areas are in red.
As far as we know, we have containment.

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,991
- We're still not certain?
- We can't be certain for hours, maybe days.

106
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,839
The press is breathing
down Gerry's neck pretty hard.

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,191
- He thinks we should release a statement.
- I already have.

108
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,154
I've closed down public transportation
and told people to stay in their homes.

109
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,475
We have F-18s patrolling the skies.

110
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,071
But we haven't revealed the exact nature of
this threat, and the press is picking up on it.

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,955
We have 10 million people spread out
over a 4,000 square-mile area.

112
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,271
If even a small percentage
decide to leave at the same time,

113
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,632
it will ignite a public panic
beyond anything we could control.

114
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,920
The right thing to do is to withhold the truth
until we're sure the virus is contained.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,551
I'll tell Gerry to hold off on the press
as long as he can.

116
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,559
(intercom bleeps)

117
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,636
Mr President.

118
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,757
- Yes, Jeannie?
- Senator Keeler's here to see you.

119
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,999
- Have him brought in.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,399
Thank you.

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,393
- Hello, John.
- Mr President.

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,876
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you, I'll stand.

123
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,516
You can imagine my surprise
when I was told that you wanted to see me.

124
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,279
Are you withdrawing from the race?

125
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,238
Mr President, with respect to the death
of Alan Milliken, I know you lied to the police.

126
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,634
Excuse me?

127
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,117
You obstructed the investigation
of a capital crime.

128
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,958
That's a baseless charge. Though I've come
to expect this kind of recklessness from you.

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,794
No, sir, it is neither baseless nor reckless.

130
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,310
This is a photograph of the nitroglycerin
medicine that would have saved his life...

131
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,358
if it hadn't been kept from him.

132
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,678
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

133
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,669
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle
prove otherwise.

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,478
Now, the last thing this country needs is to
have its president dragged through the mud

135
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,518
for complicity in a murder.

136
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,431
Why are you showing me this, John?
What do you want?

137
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,869
Your resignation.

138
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,320
Not immediately, of course.

139
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,955
But once this crisis
you're dealing with is over,

140
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,996
you can resign with whatever
face-saving reason you wanna give.

141
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,917
Get out of here.

142
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,392
I'm offering you the chance
to leave office with honour,

143
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,671
to control how your legacy is written.

144
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a good deal, David.

145
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
You should take it.

146
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,758
I should go to the phone.

147
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,112
As soon as he tells you where he wants
the exchange to take place, reject the location.

148
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,829
We need him to pick a secondary location
so Chase has time to embed his teams.

149
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,633
If I don't go where he wants,
he's gonna kill Michelle.

150
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,593
Not as long as we have his daughter.

151
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,477
- What if he doesn't go for it?
- You've got some leverage here. Use it.

152
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,352
I need to go.

153
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,590
My father kidnapped his wife because of me?

154
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,837
Something like that.

155
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,196
And now you wanna use me
as bait to get to him.

156
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,111
We're gonna do whatever we have to
to stop your father from releasing this virus.

157
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,838
Stay here. We'll be right back.

158
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,838
(phone rings)

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,958
- Where are we meeting?
- First let me speak with my daughter.

160
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,039
No, you can talk to her
when we make the exchange.

161
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,029
All right.

162
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,597
Bring her to an industrial park three miles
north of where you are on Morton Road.

163
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,280
A car will be waiting at loading dock 22.

164
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,069
Choose a new place. That doesn't work.

165
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,876
Make it work. You've got 10 minutes to get
to the industrial park or your wife will die.

166
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,275
- If we meet there, we all die.
- Really?

167
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,994
CTU has satellite surveillance of that area.

168
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,830
They're dedicating all their resources
to finding me right now. Pick a new spot.

169
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,431
I am not negotiating terms. I've planned
too long and too hard for this day.

170
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,678
I will do whatever it takes
to make sure nothing interferes,

171
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,157
even... even if it means
sacrificing my daughter.

172
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,429
You need to understand my commitment.

173
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,473
- What the hell you doing?
- He's testing you. He'll phone back.

174
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,398
- How do you know?
- He thinks I'm gonna kill his daughter.

175
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,398
He exposed himself
to make sure she's still safe.

176
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,795
That's what you'd do,
but you're not Saunders.

177
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,390
No matter how well you think
you know this guy, you're not him.

178
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,590
This isn't a game. She's my wife.

179
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,838
Michelle's got a chance if we control
the ground where the exchange takes place.

180
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,520
But protecting her is not your priority, is it?

181
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,431
If she were to get killed, that would be
an acceptable loss, wouldn't it?

182
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,951
My God, Jack. Didn't you learn anything
from what happened to Teri?

183
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,600
Shut up, Tony. Shut up!

184
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,473
Tony!

185
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,391
Just because you sacrificed your wife for this
job doesn't mean I'm gonna sacrifice mine!

186
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,476
(phone rings)

187
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,394
I'm here.

188
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,717
Make no mistake, this is your first
and your last accommodation.

189
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,434
Just tell me where
you wanna make the exchange.

190
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,632
Downtown, under the 6th Street Bridge.

191
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,596
- Under the 6th Street Bridge.
- Be there in 30 minutes.

192
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,273
But if I see that you've brought anyone else
into this, I will kill your wife.

193
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,960
You did great.

194
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,991
Tony'll make the exchange, but until we know
that Saunders is on site, we stay invisible.

195
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,913
I'll assign positions on the way out. Let's go.

196
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,119
- What is it?
- Satellite pictures of 6th Street Bridge.

197
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,994
- I asked for real-time feed.
- We'll have it to you when you're on site.

198
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,477
- What about air support?
- We're coordinating with the marines.

199
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,397
Look, Chase...

200
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,075
please be careful.

201
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,320
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

202
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,549
Chloe, how much time before you can set up
a real-time satellite feed for 6th Street Bridge?

203
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,037
Do you really think Chase is gonna
quit field ops to start a family?

204
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,513
- He won't.
- It's none of your business.

205
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,155
I've known Chase for three years.
You've been dating for three months.

206
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,670
- Your point being?
- He's a great guy, but he's like your father.

207
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,270
They're the same, so if you're expecting him
to leave for the suburbs,

208
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,551
you should revise your expectations.

209
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,400
- When can you uplink a satellite feed?
- 10 minutes.

210
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,031
- Then do it.
- I'm just trying to be a friend, that's all.

211
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,113
- Hello?
- You've gone too far this time, Sherry.

212
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,879
I thought I might be hearing from you, David.

213
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,675
You sent Keeler over here to blackmail me
into giving up my presidency!

214
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,792
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
You mean Keeler paid you a visit?

215
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,718
You know damn well he did,
and you know why.

216
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,912
Only you could have given him
that prescription bottle.

217
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,270
OK, supposing that was true. What then?

218
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,517
- You could go to jail for murder.
- You could go to jail, too.

219
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,438
You lied to the police.
You told them that I was with you.

220
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,156
Withholding evidence, obstruction of justice.
Those are serious crimes.

221
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,836
I knew you wanted to go down in
the history books, but I'm not certain like this.

222
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,111
- What did Keeler offer you?
- What you should have offered me.

223
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,196
Respect, and a seat at the table.

224
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,709
But you called me up when you needed me,

225
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,749
and then after I did your little dirty work,
you threw me out like an old pair of shoes.

226
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,152
You know me, Sherry. Better than anyone.

227
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,320
You know I won't be bullied.

228
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,359
So before this goes too far,
you better ask yourself a question.

229
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,952
- Are you willing to go to jail?
- I've asked myself that a million times.

230
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,356
And the answer is yes,
I am willing to go to jail.

231
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,000
The question is, are you?

232
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,596
I didn't think so.

233
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,156
I want the strike team in two groups.

234
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,558
Group A can take cover here, group B here.
I want them ready to go when we get there.

235
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,911
If Saunders sees anyone,
he's not gonna make the approach.

236
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,032
- What's the response time for air support?
- 30 seconds.

237
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,835
- I'll relay the coordinates.
- See you at the bridge.

238
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,355
I know my father released the virus
in the hotel, that people died,

239
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,270
but do you really think
he'll do what he's saying?

240
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,511
Release it all over the country?

241
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,949
If we don't stop him, yes.

242
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,389
Why?

243
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,956
There has to be a reason he's doing all of this.

244
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,756
When I worked with him, he was dedicated
to saving the lives of innocent people.

245
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,519
Something's happened to him,
I don't know what,

246
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,359
but now he believes
our government's betrayed him.

247
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,040
Is he right?

248
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,239
There's no easy answer to that.

249
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,434
The work your father did often demanded
that he make seemingly impossible sacrifices.

250
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,676
Whatever happened to your father in Bosnia
was a sacrifice he wasn't willing to make.

251
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,756
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,877
- (Michelle) No!
- Shut up! No one can hear you.

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,798
- (screams)
- Shut up now!

254
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,876
No!

255
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,993
- No! Oh, God!
- I said stop. Stop screaming.

256
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,877
Look at me. I've been infected.

257
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,551
Help me. Help me.

258
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,872
Oh, God!

259
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,116
No.

260
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,356
- We got a problem here.
- What's going on?

261
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,756
- She has it. She has the virus.
- What are you talking about?

262
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,792
She's bleeding.
She must have caught it at the hotel.

263
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,071
They wouldn't release her
without testing her. It's a trick.

264
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,475
She did it to herself.

265
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,835
Kevin, are you there? Kevin!

266
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,838
Take the east corridor. Stop her from getting
above ground, but do not shoot to kill.

267
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,756
- (phone rings)
- O'Brian.

268
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,236
- (static) Chloe, it's me. It's Michelle.
- Hello?

269
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,239
Can you hear me?

270
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,272
Whoever this is,
I have a really bad connection.

271
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,237
Chloe!

272
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,678
So what did Keeler want?

273
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,360
My job.

274
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,157
He has proof that Sherry
was at Alan Milliken's tonight.

275
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,078
What? What proof?

276
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,070
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

277
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,639
- How did he get ahold of this?
- How do you think?

278
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,716
Sherry?

279
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,269
I talked to her a few minutes ago.
She didn't even bother to deny it.

280
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,597
She's gotta be bluffing.
If this gets out, she goes to jail.

281
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,995
So will l.

282
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,237
She figures I have more to lose than she does.

283
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,349
- And she's right.
- What does Keeler want you to do?

284
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,951
Withdraw from the race...
for whatever reason I choose.

285
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,235
The party gets thrown into chaos.

286
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,512
Whoever takes my place
won't have a prayer in the election.

287
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,633
And Keeler becomes president.

288
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,516
Oh, my God.

289
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,553
This is all my fault.

290
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,636
Hey, look.

291
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,600
We both made mistakes.

292
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,838
I'm the one who called Sherry.

293
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,150
- There may be a way out of this.
- How?

294
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,477
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?

295
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,276
- What are you suggesting?
- We take away the only leverage she has.

296
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,278
You mean steal evidence?

297
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,393
- My God, Wayne.
- Before you say no, you just think about this.

298
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,909
I can call Foxton
and he can make this disappear.

299
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,429
All you have to do is give me the OK.

300
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,116
You stay with her.

301
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,353
- Is your team in place?
- Two minutes, they'll be ready.

302
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,153
- They'll be out of sight?
- They'll be invisible.

303
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,431
- I'm gonna back Tony up here.
- We should get into position.

304
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,393
- Priority call from Kim.
- This is Jack.

305
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,040
- I got Michelle on the line.
- Is she with Saunders?

306
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,230
No, she said she got away from him.

307
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,591
- Patch her through.
- Hold on.

308
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,589
- Michelle, go ahead.
- I got away from Saunders, but he's after me.

309
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,029
Michelle, it's me. Where are you?

310
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,230
Wilshire. A block east of Olive.

311
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,316
- Send your strike team in now.
- Don't.

312
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,113
- What are you talking about?
- Michelle, listen.

313
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,073
- Let Saunders catch you again.
- Are you crazy?

314
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,397
We have to let the exchange go down.
It's the only way to catch him.

315
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,035
- You want me to give myself up?
- Yes. The exchange site is secure.

316
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,630
- I'll send our people in when he's there.
- Redirect your people now!

317
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,196
- Chase, don't!
- Jack, stay out of this!

318
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,956
You are not in command here.
Get him out of here now! Now!

319
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,549
That's my wife, Jack, you son of a bitch!
My wife! Jack!

320
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,072
We need this exchange to go through.
Everything depends on it. Understand?

321
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,069
If he doesn't have you to trade,
he's not gonna go through with this meeting.

322
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,796
We're not gonna get another chance at this.
Do you understand, Michelle?

323
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,353
Y es.

324
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,118
We're gonna do everything to make sure you
come out of this OK, but we gotta move now.

325
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,073
Let's get our teams into position.

326
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,110
I thought your brother was a politician
who would never lower himself to my level.

327
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,636
I need to recover something
that could cause him a lot of trouble.

328
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,355
- What is it?
- A bottle of medicine from a crime scene.

329
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,519
- Has it been admitted into evidence?
- No.

330
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,952
It's in the possession of Sherry Palmer,
the president's ex-wife.

331
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,790
I have a pretty good idea where she is and
can partially reconstruct where she's been.

332
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,635
- What time frame are we looking at?
- Hours, Foxton, not days.

333
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,435
Has this... operation been authorised
by the president?

334
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,519
What difference does that make?
You'll get your money.

335
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,633
I'm not worried about that.
I just need to know who I'm working for.

336
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,957
My brother knows what you're doing.

337
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,437
Not that I don't trust you, but...
I'd like to hear it from him.

338
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,356
Fine.

339
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,358
That's proof enough.

340
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,476
Let's go.

341
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,633
Do Chase's men have Saunders yet?

342
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,190
No one's coming yet.

343
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,072
(voice on radio)

344
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,480
Look, Jack, promise me you won't make
a move on Saunders until Michelle is safe.

345
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,838
We move as soon as we've got a visual
on Saunders. That's how it's gotta go.

346
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,948
I know. I'm... I'm just asking you
just to do what you can.

347
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,148
You know I will.

348
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,279
We've got three cars headed in from the west.

349
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,756
- Tony, they're coming. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

350
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,231
Windows are tinted. I can't see inside.

351
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,196
(phone rings)

352
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,711
- Yeah.
- (Saunders) Give her the phone.

353
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,469
My preference is to turn you over
to your husband unharmed.

354
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,160
But I will kill you if anything goes wrong.

355
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,596
(phone rings)

356
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,432
Y eah.

357
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,792
(Saunders) When I see my daughter,
you get your wife.

358
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,273
Right.

359
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,278
Jane, I need you to get out of the car.

360
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,198
Everything's gonna be OK.

361
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,396
- I want you to walk over to your father's men.
- Where's my father?

362
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,511
We don't know.

363
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,589
Listen, we have to do this, Jane. I'm sorry.

364
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,275
Look, Jane, you gotta trust me on this.
Please, go. Come on.

365
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,800
- Jack, send your men in now.
- We don't have a visual on Saunders.

366
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,718
- I can't.
- Come here!

367
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,071
- Turn around!
- Jane, it's OK! Come here!

368
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,239
Teams A and B move.
We've got a visual on Saunders. Move now!

369
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,835
Stephen!

370
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,516
Stephen!

371
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,836
I'm pinned down! Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now!

372
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,475
- I repeat, call in air support!
- I need air support!

373
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,479
I've got two US marine F-18s just off
the marina, call sign Guardian Angel.

374
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,036
Copy that! Guardian Angel,
this is Watchtower!

375
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,720
We got a hostile at vector Bravo Tango!

376
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,039
(Chase) Jack, marines are coming in.
Take cover.

377
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,353
Let's go! Let's go!

378
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,796
Chopper's been taken out!

379
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,752
- You OK?
- Yeah.

380
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,231
(Jack) Don't move!

381
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,670
1 1 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.
Where are they?

382
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,078
- It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.
- Stephen, it's over.

383
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,232
No, it's not, Jack. It's just beginning.

384
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,516
Where are the vials?

385
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,393
You can waste time trying to break me
and kill millions of people.

386
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,670
Or you can give me what I want.

387
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,309
This is Jack Bauer. Saunders is in custody.

388
