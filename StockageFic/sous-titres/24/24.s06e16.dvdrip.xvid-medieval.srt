1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,757
- Yeah.
- Mark Hauser?

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,513
- Who's this?
- You know who it is.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,957
- I already gave you what you asked for.
- But your employer has tightened security.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,271
- So the access I paid for is no good.
- It'll take some time

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,989
- to download the new security protocols.
- I'll be there in 40 minutes.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,357
Federal agent, get on the floor!

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,638
Hauser sold Gredenko security specs
for Edgemont nuclear power facility.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,951
- Does Gredenko have them?
- He's picking them up in 20 minutes.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,670
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother.
We're gonna use him for the transaction.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,671
You look nervous, Brady.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,119
All teams, take out your targets.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,954
All teams, there's a third hostile
inside the vehicle.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,434
You know who I am.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,798
Then you know what I'm gonna do to you,
unless you tell me where the bombs are.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,711
First, my terms.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,316
Amnesty from your government
and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,995
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,913
I don't know if I can accept
that she betrayed us.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,310
She spied for Fayed? I think we're wrong.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,154
- I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends.
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,994
I came across evidence at the switching
station that proves she's innocent.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,355
You're cleared, Nadia.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,955
Admiral, is the Vickery ready to launch?

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,271
- It's seconds from optimal launch position.
- Good.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,191
Proceed with the strike.

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,831
Vice President Daniels is about to launch
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,392
This strike is a complete reversal
of everything that he was working for.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,234
You want Dr Welton
to bring him out of the coma?

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,514
Yes.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,475
It's for you, sir.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,949
- Yes?
- I've called off the strike, Noah.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,270
I'm resuming my duties
as commander in chief.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,037
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's
to be no action without my authorisation.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,955
It's apparent to me
the president is still suffering the effects

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,634
from the attack on his life.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,314
I can't let him remain in power.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,389
Get me the Attorney General.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,876
- (man) Should have live feed, sir.
- Secretary Dawes,

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
- can you see and hear me clearly?
- Yes, I can.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,955
Secretary Durant
and Attorney General Graves?

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,554
- Connections are being set up.
- And the president?

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,313
He should be arriving any moment.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,039
- What are you doing?
- I need to get up from this wheelchair.

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,908
- No, you need to take care of yourself.
- Sandra, I can't afford to look weak.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,673
Roosevelt did just fine
from a wheelchair.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,230
Listen, when I face Daniels,
I want to be on my feet.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,631
- Dr Welton?
- Yes, sir?

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,588
- Can you give me a shot of Adrenalin?
- Wayne.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,918
I can. It'll raise your blood pressure,
which is not what you need right now.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,797
- The risk of...
- (knock at door)

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,759
- Mr President? It is time.
- Give us a few minutes, please.

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,910
Excuse me, Mr President.

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,868
- Mr President...
- Just do it.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,670
Now.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,313
- What do you have, Jack?
- Gredenko offered us Fayed,

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,359
in exchange for immunity and a guarantee
that we won't extradite him back to Russia.

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,149
- Bill, I don't trust it. He rolled over too easy.
- What do you think his play is?

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,516
- I don't know yet.
- It's your call, Jack.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,239
But you should know
what's happening in Washington.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,551
- The president's regained consciousness.
- How is he?

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,316
Well enough. But Daniels is challenging him
under the 25th Amendment,

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,439
in large part so he can go ahead with
the nuclear strike against Fayed's country.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,988
- Does he have a chance of winning?
- It's unclear.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,200
But if Fayed detonates another bomb,
no one will be able to stand in Daniels' way.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,037
If there's a challenge for the presidency,
the immunity agreement won't be binding.

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,159
Bill, you need to understand that I have
no intention of honouring this agreement.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,435
Tell the Attorney General,
draw up the papers.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,192
I'm calling him right now.

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,713
The president should be here momentarily.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,988
- (woman) Mr President.
- (man) Mr President.

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,318
Mr President. I know
I speak for everyone here in saying

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,075
how very happy I am
to have you with us again.

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,871
Let's proceed.

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,868
(Tom clears throat) As you know, an attempt
was made to assassinate the president.

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,035
He sustained injuries so serious that the
doctors had to induce a temporary coma

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,796
in order to relieve the pressure on his brain.
In so doing, they saved his life.

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,192
The question now is whether,
in the words of the 25th Amendment,

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,752
he is unable to discharge
the duties and powers of his office.

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,071
- Isn't this really a medical question?
- Well, to a degree it is.

80
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,470
But the 25th Amendment
puts the final decision

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,519
- squarely in the hands of the cabinet.
- May we hear medical testimony?

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,309
Yes. Let me bring in the surgeon
in charge of the president's case.

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,073
Dr Welton, if you would, please.

84
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,308
The president has undergone an ordeal,
but from a medical point of view,

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,393
the greatest danger has passed. His
cognitive functions are presenting normally.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,597
I have every expectation
that he will make a full recovery.

87
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,672
Might the pressures of the office
increase the chance of a relapse?

88
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,276
- It's difficult to say. It's certainly a possibility.
- Can you estimate those chances?

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,069
- No, I'm afraid I can't.
- If you had a vote, Doctor,

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,550
- how would you cast it?
- This is precisely the question

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,950
which the Constitution demands
that this cabinet answer.

92
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,996
Thank you very much, Doctor.

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,355
Mr President, I think now
would be an appropriate time

94
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,834
- to address the cabinet, if you would, please.
- The vice president initiated this process

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,515
because I stopped him launching
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,989
But this vote shouldn't be about policy.

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,913
According to the Constitution,
you're judging me

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,312
to see if I am unable
to discharge the duties of my office.

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,915
Well, as you can see,
and as you were just told by my physician,

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,471
I'm in complete possession of my faculties,
and so to remove me from this office

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,553
would be to betray both your oath
and the American people,

102
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,677
who voted me as their president.

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,156
Mr Vice President?

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,036
Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet,
the 25th Amendment is purposely vague

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,592
on how you're supposed to judge if the
president is unable to discharge his duties,

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,437
which is why this is very much about
the president's policies, and his actions.

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,512
Here are the facts:
When a second nuclear attack today

108
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,194
spread radiation over one of our major cities,

109
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,956
I decided it was necessary
to launch a retaliatory strike,

110
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,309
to show our enemies that if attacked,
we would make them share our pain.

111
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,279
Wayne Palmer's first act
upon regaining consciousness

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,316
was to stop that strike.

113
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,038
To respond to the attack by doing nothing.

114
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,117
In a time of war, the president must be
strong enough in body and mind

115
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,111
to defend this country.

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,228
And I'm afraid Wayne Palmer's actions
are the proof in this matter

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,599
that... indeed he is unable
to discharge his duties.

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,713
All right. Time is of the essence,
so unless there is an objection,

119
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,591
I would like to recess and then reconvene
for your vote in ten minutes.

120
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,399
- Any word on the cabinet vote?
- No, they haven't come back yet.

121
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,832
Look, Milo, about what happened today.
Let's just put it behind us, OK?

122
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,198
Which part? The... suspicion of terrorism,

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,158
or the... the other thing?

124
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,357
- The suspicion.
- And the other thing?

125
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,194
Let's not worry about it right now.
Let's try and get through the day.

126
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,191
OK.

127
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,077
I'm not gonna forget about the kiss,
and I don't think you are either.

128
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,071
(phone rings)

129
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,232
- Nadia.
- It's Doyle. Don't say my name. Just listen.

130
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,313
I need you to come up to my office.
Don't say anything to anybody. Just come.

131
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,799
On my way.

132
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,151
Have a seat.

133
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,592
Look, I know you and I
got off to kind of a bad start.

134
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,157
"A bad start"? You assaulted me.

135
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,555
This country is under attack. We had reason
to believe there was a mole in this building.

136
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,632
Starting with you wasn't racist.
It was common sense.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,508
- So you're not a racist, you're just a sadist.
- You don't know me.

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,192
I think I do.

139
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,034
- Why did you call me here?
- Turns out there was no mole.

140
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,112
The terrorists could hack into
our system cos someone screwed up

141
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,668
and logged the wrong security parameters.

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,548
I'm pretty sure that someone was Milo,
and the proof is on his computer.

143
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,029
I need someone to get it
without him noticing.

144
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,111
I can't do that.

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,638
Why? Is it cos you're too busy deciding
if you wanna sleep with him?

146
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,869
Listen, if you don't get the evidence for me,
I'm gonna call a forensics team

147
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,032
and they'll tear his system apart
as the entire floor watches.

148
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,350
And if they find
what I think they'll find,

149
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,989
everyone gets to watch Milo
hauled out of this building in handcuffs.

150
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,675
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant when it happened
to you, but you're gonna stand by

151
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,834
and watch it happen to him?
That's your idea of being a friend?

152
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,514
So you want me
to betray him for his own good?

153
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,037
I promise you, Milo will be better off
if you help me than if you don't.

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,792
Your call.

155
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,073
If the cabinet sides with you,
what will you do about Daniels?

156
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,755
The Constitution does not allow the president
to fire his vice president.

157
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,116
- But you can marginalise him.
- She's right. Get him out of the bunker.

158
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,668
I'd love to, but Daniels
has way too many supporters,

159
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,036
and I can't afford
to alienate any one of them right now.

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,319
Besides, I'd rather have him somewhere
where I can keep an eye on him.

161
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,437
- Mr President? The cabinet's reconvening.
- Thank you.

162
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,909
(Karen) All right, let's go.

163
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,319
Please, sit down.

164
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,360
Right. Ladies and gentlemen of the cabinet,
let us now begin the vote.

165
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,468
Will those of you who believe that President
Palmer is able to discharge his duties

166
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,518
please, at this time, raise your hand?

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,992
Do we have any abstentions?

168
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,549
The vote is seven to seven.

169
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,954
Mr Attorney General,
what would be the next step?

170
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,035
Well, there's no need for a next step.

171
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,830
The Amendment requires that the vice
president and a majority of the cabinet agree.

172
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,792
There is no majority in the cabinet, it's split
evenly. President Palmer remains in office.

173
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,190
It's not that simple.
One of the cabinet votes is invalid.

174
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,829
- Sir, which vote is not valid?
- National security advisor.

175
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,751
- What do you mean?
- She resigned.

176
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,195
- I resumed my duties.
- I don't agree.

177
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,989
I've seen no evidence
that you've been reinstated.

178
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,359
That is ridiculous. I sat here with you in
a cabinet meeting less than one hour ago!

179
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,954
Ms Hayes, allowing you
to sit in on the meeting

180
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,874
isn't equivalent to formally recognising you
as national security advisor!

181
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,474
In fact, I did not and do not
so recognise you.

182
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,348
- Oh, my God.
- And if Ms Hayes' vote is invalid,

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,911
then the tally's seven to six in favour
of invoking the 25th Amendment

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,197
and removing President Palmer from power.

185
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,395
I'm sorry, Wayne.

186
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,838
Noah, don't waste your apologies on me,
because I won't let you steal the presidency.

187
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,354
- That's not gonna happen.
- Then what do you suggest?

188
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,113
- The country has to be governed.
- I would suggest, sir,

189
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,953
- that this is properly a matter for the courts.
- I concur.

190
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,511
- We don't have time to go to...
- Mr Vice President, if I may.

191
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,876
I agree with Mr Lennox.
This is a legal question.

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,270
The Supreme Court was in session
this afternoon. We can recall it,

193
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,399
and have them render a decision
regarding the validity of the vote.

194
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,516
The matter could be resolved
in under an hour.

195
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,038
Thank you, Attorney General Graves.
Get the process started and keep us advised.

196
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,998
I think this meeting is concluded.

197
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,598
- Get my affidavit started.
- Yeah.

198
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,671
Tom.

199
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,590
You know something?
I'm beginning to think you're not on my side.

200
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,274
Sir, I'm on the side
of the United States of America,

201
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,559
and if you ever thought otherwise,
you're very much mistaken.

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,713
Gredenko's attorney approved
the immunity agreements.

203
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,156
Yeah, we're just waiting for digital signatures.

204
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,112
All right. I'll inform the Attorney General's
office it's on its way. Thank you.

205
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,792
- Milo.
- What's up?

206
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,112
I'm having a problem. My station keeps
telling me to refresh the system credentials.

207
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,079
It's the hardware codes. You have to
reset them. I can take care of it.

208
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,673
Thanks.

209
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,709
- You OK?
- Yeah.

210
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,351
You were right. Milo forgot
to refresh the security parameters.

211
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,355
The breach was his fault. So when you tell
District, they can fire and maybe arrest him.

212
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,399
Which is why I'm going to alter the log
so they'll never know.

213
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,316
(sighs) This should work, as long as
they haven't changed the password.

214
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,111
There. It's done.

215
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,830
- Why did you do that?
- Cos all I care about is finding those nukes.

216
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,632
We have a better chance of doing that with
Milo on board, whether he likes me or not.

217
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,156
"And mankind is naught but a single nation".

218
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,789
- You've read the Koran?
- And the Bible. And the Upanishads.

219
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,633
Anything I can get my hands on.

220
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,192
You're lucky, you've found your answers.
I'm looking for mine.

221
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,238
I'd better get ready to deploy.

222
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,839
- What did Doyle want?
- Nothing. Just reviewing some data sets.

223
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,312
There you go. Your system's back up.

224
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,951
Thanks.

225
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,718
(phone rings)

226
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,950
- Buchanan.
- (Karen) Hi, it's me.

227
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,749
- How did the cabinet vote go?
- It was a tie,

228
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,877
which in effect means
that Palmer is still in office.

229
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,669
- That's good. That's what we wanted.
- Daniels is contesting the vote.

230
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,672
- He's saying that mine is invalid.
- Based on what?

231
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,355
Based on the fact that I resigned,
and I was never officially reinstated.

232
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,639
That's ridiculous. You attended meetings.
You had no replacement assigned.

233
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,269
I know, but maybe he's right, Bill.
I did hand in my resignation.

234
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,433
Which was rescinded before it was
officially accepted. Daniels knows that.

235
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,751
- He's grasping at straws, Karen.
- I'm so scared, Bill.

236
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,116
If he wins, this will all be my fault.

237
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,475
Stop, stop.

238
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,950
It's desperate manoeuvring on his part,
Karen, nothing more.

239
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,999
He hasn't got a case.
And the Supreme Court will agree.

240
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,916
Well, we're giving our arguments
in 15 minutes.

241
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,232
- Call me as soon as the decision is in.
- Thank you for being there.

242
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,949
You don't have to thank me.
It's my job.

243
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,351
I miss you so much.

244
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,351
I miss you too.

245
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,829
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Bye.

246
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,031
(sighs)

247
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,629
(speaking Russian)

248
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,470
Good. My attorney
has verified the agreements.

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,629
- We're set. Gredenko's ready to make the call.
- We're standing by.

250
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,713
Doyle's got a team ready to go as soon
as Fayed tells Gredenko where to meet him.

251
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,634
You try and warn Fayed
with anything you say, or how you say it,

252
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,238
- and I will kill you right here, right now.
- I believe you, Agent Bauer.

253
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,311
Make the call.

254
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,192
(phone rings)

255
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,515
- Yes?
- (Gredenko) It's me.

256
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,239
- Do you have the security protocols?
- Yes. Where do you want to meet?

257
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,835
- Are you sure you're not under surveillance?
- Of course.

258
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,469
- Do you think I'd be calling you otherwise?
- I can't allow another mistake

259
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,949
to disrupt my plans
for the remaining two devices.

260
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,953
- Do you want the protocols or not?
- Where are you right now?

261
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,473
Culver City.

262
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,235
Meet me at the Santa Monica pier
in ten minutes.

263
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,589
- Uh... It may take me more time.
- I won't wait.

264
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,672
- Where do I find you?
- Just be there.

265
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,796
I'll find you.

266
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,313
Give him the phone. Bill, how long will it take
Doyle's team to make it to the pier?

267
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,198
- He's about 30 minutes out.
- We'll make do with Ryan's team.

268
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,271
Put him in the vehicle.

269
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,795
Instructions from the Supreme Court.

270
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,270
Our arguments have to be submitted
in writing in the next ten minutes.

271
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,353
Sandra's working on our brief.
How's it coming?

272
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm just about finished.

273
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,676
We have a strong case. You resigned, and
Daniels was in charge when you returned.

274
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,150
So the legal question is,
did he consent to your reinstatement?

275
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,559
Of course he did.

276
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,519
And he made no objections
when you returned to the bunker,

277
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,750
and he never questioned
your right to be there?

278
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,149
No, he didn't.

279
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,834
His own actions prove our case.

280
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,435
Thank you. For everything, Sandra.

281
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,833
My affidavit explains everything - that
I never really intended to reinstate Karen,

282
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,990
letting her perform her duties temporarily,

283
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,029
therefore she had no authority
to cast a vote under the 25th Amendment.

284
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,477
Problem is, after she returned, you treated her
as if she still were national security advisor.

285
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,994
It's a question
of my state of mind, though, isn't it?

286
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,279
Yes. And your state of mind
will be inferred from your actions.

287
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,749
Doesn't sound like you think
our chances are very good.

288
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,319
I don't.

289
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,712
Then I am... deeply afraid for our country.

290
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,599
When the world sees that Wayne Palmer
isn't willing to fight back,

291
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,470
our enemies will be encouraged, these
recent attacks will be just the beginning.

292
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,111
America will be vulnerable
in a way it never has been.

293
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,035
There may be a way

294
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,955
to illuminate your state of mind
more explicitly.

295
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,952
I can swear an affidavit that earlier today
you told me to inform Karen Hayes

296
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,669
you had no intention of reinstating her,
but you'd let her perform her duties

297
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,830
on a temporary basis only.

298
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,472
Then Wayne regained consciousness before
I could have that conversation with her.

299
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,518
You'd be perjuring yourself
in front of the Supreme Court.

300
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,989
I'm aware that it's perjury.

301
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,273
But the end justifies the means.

302
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,156
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do

303
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,834
what's right for this country.

304
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,271
You're right.

305
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,470
Do it.

306
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,630
Prepare your affidavit.

307
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,951
And, Lisa...

308
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,711
Thank you.

309
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,674
Yes, sir.

310
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,711
Hasim, Hasan, with me.

311
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,993
I'm meeting Gredenko.
I'll be back within the hour.

312
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,071
And if you're not?

313
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,315
Are you worried for me, Halil?
Orjust anxious to take my place?

314
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,313
I think we're wasting time. We have
the bombs. We should use them right now.

315
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,313
Gredenko's information will enable us to
inflict damage across half of California.

316
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,836
There's other targets out there
will result in large amount of casualty

317
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,630
- without the additional risk.
- I've made my decision.

318
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,791
Let's go.

319
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,871
(engine starts)

320
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,711
(Daniels) Come in.

321
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,358
Mr Vice President,
I need to speak with you alone.

322
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,911
There is something in this room
you need to know about, sir.

323
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,471
"Something in this room"?
What are you talking about?

324
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,193
This small object here
is a microtransmitter.

325
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,558
After you directed me to lie to the
ambassador about the assassination attempt,

326
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,108
I decided it was time to protect myself.

327
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,875
Now it turns out I was
protecting the country as well.

328
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,951
Be careful, Tom.

329
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,877
Be very careful what you try to do here.

330
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,755
Actually, sir, you are the one
who needs to be careful here.

331
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,233
(Lisa) I'm aware that it's perjury.
But the end justifies the means.

332
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,029
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favour so that you can do

333
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,079
- what's right for this country.
- You're right.

334
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,628
Do it. Prepare your affidavit.

335
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,711
Turn it off.

336
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,949
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,

337
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,589
conspiracy to commit perjury
is a felony offence.

338
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,834
Now, I strongly urge you to pick up
that phone and call the Supreme Court.

339
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,277
You tell them that you have withdrawn
your affidavit and that of Miss Miller as well.

340
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,749
Tell them you support
the vote of the Cabinet,

341
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,675
that you have no further objections to
President Palmer continuing his presidency.

342
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,117
You do understand that I'm just
trying to do what's right for this country.

343
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,191
Well, so am I, sir.

344
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,670
Are you going to make that call now, sir?

345
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,594
Karen, I need the launch protocols
the joint chiefs set up with Daniels,

346
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,956
- and chain-of-command signing.
- They just came from the Pentagon.

347
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,319
Everything is in place. If the court sides with
you, you can cancel the strike permanently.

348
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,075
I also want an update on the situation
with Fayed. Has CTU made any progress?

349
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,594
Yes, they have Gredenko in custody.

350
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,478
Bill said they were gonna use him
to lure Fayed out in the open.

351
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,835
- Who's running it?
- Jack Bauer.

352
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,037
- Good.
- Wayne. The Supreme Court was just notified

353
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,395
Daniels withdrew his suit.

354
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,993
- What?!
- It's over.

355
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,278
He gave up before the court
had a chance to make its decision.

356
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,839
- Why?
- I don't know.

357
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,550
I just know that you're still
the President of the United States.

358
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,109
Let the Cabinet know I won't take any action
against those who sided with Daniels.

359
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,031
Yes, sir.

360
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,116
Oh, and Karen? Tell Bill I want him
to keep me up to date on CTU's progress.

361
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,679
- (woman) Yes, sir?
- Melinda...

362
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,320
- Tell Dr Welton I need to see him, please.
- Certainly.

363
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,593
I don't have a visual yet, but Fayed won't
show himself until he sees Gredenko.

364
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,514
- Ryan, what's your status with Gredenko?
- I've got the audio transmitter set up.

365
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,830
Preparing the tracker now.

366
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,956
Roll up your left sleeve.

367
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,999
- (Jack) What's his range?
- We can track up to 15 miles.

368
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,071
Copy that.

369
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,671
- Is it radioactive?
- Yes.

370
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,791
It penetrates into the bone.
It's got a half-life of about 11 hours,

371
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,189
so forget about digging it out
or making a run for it.

372
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,590
- He's good to go.
- Bill, how far out is Doyle's team?

373
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,910
- About 20 minutes.
- We can't wait.

374
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,710
Fayed was clear about his time line.
Ryan, send in Gredenko.

375
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,791
Gredenko's moving now.

376
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,393
I'm getting a clean audio signal
from the transmitter on Gredenko.

377
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,556
And we are locked on the isotope signature
that's being emitted from Gredenko's arm.

378
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,631
(phone rings)

379
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,553
Hello?

380
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,229
Hello?

381
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,873
I have the gain on Gredenko's transmitter up
all the way. There's no one on the other end.

382
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,357
He's reading something off his phone.
It's a text message.

383
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,356
Fayed's made contact. Everyone get ready.
Gredenko is heading south.

384
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,273
(Gredenko, distorted) I'm moving in.

385
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,388
- Milo, have you got him on the tracker?
- Yeah. He's still moving.

386
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,677
I'm heading in. I'm gonna follow him.

387
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,510
(beeping/static)

388
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,115
I've lost audio signal.
I'm going to secondary channel.

389
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,398
- There's no audio on the secondary channel.
- But he hasn't moved.

390
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,673
I don't like it. Something's wrong.

391
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,196
- You led them to me.
- I had no choice.

392
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,315
But if you listen to me,
we'll both get away from here alive.

393
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,111
Hasim.

394
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,472
Which direction, Milo?
I'm nearing the south end of the pier.

395
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,634
That's where he stopped
and entered the building on the left.

396
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,478
- Is he still inside the room?
- Yes. He's right on the other side of the door.

397
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,551
I'm going in.

398
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,189
Milo, no one's in here.

399
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,549
Jack, the tracker's showing the signal
right there in the room with you.

400
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,717
My God!

401
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,396
They cut off Gredenko's arm!
Ryan, move your men in now!

402
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,034
Hold on. I've picked up his blood trail.

403
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,879
Fayed, their men will be coming
from the west side parking lot.

404
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,034
We should go this way. (coughs)

405
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,317
Ryan, circle back to the east side of the pier.
Try and cut 'em off.

406
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,038
I want Fayed alive.

407
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,911
- Ryan, you got anything?
- Negative.

408
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,911
- How far out is Doyle's team?
- 20 minutes.

409
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,151
Have him set up a perimeter
as soon as he gets here.

410
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,316
- Ryan, where are you? I'm pinned down.
- Moving towards you now.

411
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,390
Show me your head.

412
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,312
(TV) The same terrorist cell is most likely
responsible for the explosion in Valencia...

413
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,913
- We're trapped.
- This way.

414
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,231
...and the assassination attempt
on President Palmer.

415
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,709
- That's him!
- What?

416
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,635
I recognise him from the news!
It's the terrorist they're looking for!

417
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,110
- (woman) Terrorist?
- (man) That is him.

418
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,316
You bastard.

419
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,998
(gun clicks)

420
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,835
(men yelling)

421
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,831
Federal agent!

422
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,232
I am a federal agent. I'm taking this man
into custody. Now back off!

423
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,311
- Back off!
- He shot my friend.

424
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,073
We'll get him medical attention.
Just stay back.

425
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,277
- I hope your friend is dead.
- Shut up!

426
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,749
Everybody out of the bar now! Move!

427
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,953
Ryan, this is Jack. Gredenko is not here.
Lock down the area, initiate a search.

428
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,589
We have two men down. One is a civilian,
the other is Fayed. He's in custody.

429
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,468
- I need medical up here now.
- All right, Jack. Good work.

430
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,632
Nadia, get me the president, please.

431
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,551
I understand you're weak. More Adrenalin
will raise your blood pressure even higher,

432
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,710
to the point where we know
there'll be vascular damage.

433
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,031
- That's a risk I'm willing to take.
- Your wellbeing is my responsibility.

434
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,795
And my responsibility
is the wellbeing of this country,

435
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,512
so give me another dose
or I will find someone else who will.

436
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,871
- (beeping)
- Mr President? Bill Buchanan on line one.

437
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,791
I'll take it.

438
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,276
Thank you, Arthur.

439
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,112
Yes, sir.

440
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,756
- Bill?
- I'm calling to tell you

441
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,673
- that Jack has Fayed in custody.
- What about the bombs?

442
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,356
We haven't finished the scan yet. We can't
confirm the bombs are in the vicinity.

443
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,034
Jack is going to interrogate Fayed
as soon as possible.

444
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,192
There's no way of knowing
how successful that will be, right?

445
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,955
- No, sir.
- All right, Bill. That's what I wanted to know.

446
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,031
Thank you, sir.

447
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,516
The case was withdrawn. The court
has no reason to retain the documents.

448
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,470
They should be sealed and returned to me
immediately. Good. Thank you.

449
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,671
I was thinking that maybe
it's time to declare a truce.

450
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,595
OK. Well, maybe it is.

451
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,071
I know we both want the same thing
for this country, what's good for the country.

452
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,118
We just don't always agree on the means.

453
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,036
I would love to go forward
without the threats and the intimidation.

454
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,799
Done.

455
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,956
Good. One more thing.

456
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,716
Do you know why the vice president
withdrew his suit from the Supreme Court?

457
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,916
No. I've no idea. Why?

458
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,959
One of my aides saw you with him
before it was announced.

459
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,079
I... I guess just put this down
to happy coincidence.

460
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,993
For now. But someday
I'd love to know the real story.

461
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,435
- (phone rings)
- OK. Someday.

462
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,511
Lennox.

463
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,950
He... This cannot be.
This has gotta be some mistake.

464
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,473
I'm on my way.

465
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,835
- President Palmer.
- What?

466
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,468
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

467
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,434
Mr President?

468
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,033
If I may, sir. I understand
you're about to launch the very strike

469
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,873
we just prevented Vice President Daniels
from launching.

470
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,032
- That's right.
- This makes no sense, sir.

471
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,309
- It's what you risked your life to stop!
- I risked my life to reassert my authority.

472
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,915
Vice President Daniels calling me weak.
Even you thought the same thing.

473
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,834
I implore you, sir, do not mistake
being reckless with being strong.

474
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,639
- I am done talking.
- Mr President.

475
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,394
- We have a successful launch.
- Good.

476
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,591
ENGLISH SDH
