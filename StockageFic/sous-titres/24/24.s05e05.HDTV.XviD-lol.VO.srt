1
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:13,167
Previously on 24:

2
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,334
BERESCH:
We have waited patiently
for you to renounce

3
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,701
this unholy pact
with our oppressors,

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,601
but we have heard nothing.

5
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,467
This it the cost
of that silence.

6
00:00:21,534 --> 00:00:23,301
( gunshot )
( hostages screaming )

7
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,301
If you choose to sign
this corrupt document,

8
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,434
understand that you will also
be staining it

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,933
with the blood
of the remaining hostages.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,100
If CTU can't
pull this off in time

11
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,301
that's upwards
of 60 people, Mike.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,401
Mrs. Logan, if someone
altered the recording

13
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,267
of your conversation
with David Palmer,

14
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,634
the president needs to know.

15
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,534
Between the summit
and the hostage situation,

16
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,800
he's not in the frame of mind
to deal with this.

17
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,734
Until the treaty's signed,

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm not letting this
out of my sight.

19
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,967
What did she tell you?

20
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,134
She said it was a transcript

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,467
of the call she had
with David Palmer.

22
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:55,933
( muffled screaming )

23
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:01,768
I under President Logan
wants us to go

24
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,267
into the terminal
as soon as possible.

25
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,567
Yes, before the treaty
is signed.

26
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:06,900
Curtis, what's your situation?

27
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,100
CURTIS:
My men are in place,

28
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,467
and we're setting
the entry charges.

29
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,000
We should be able to make
our entry on target.

30
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,668
I assume Mr. Bauer's
been taken into custody?

31
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,234
Well, I plan
to debrief him here.

32
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,334
Bring him in now.

33
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,800
Diane, what's going on?
What's wrong?

34
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,601
Derek is inside the terminal.

35
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,467
I see him.

36
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:23,234
He's with the other hostages
but he's not hurt.

37
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,134
Please don't let anything
happen to him.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,601
This is not your fault.

39
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,167
I'm the reason you went
along with them.

40
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,067
This is not over.

41
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:31,900
( explosion )
( men shouting )

42
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,267
( gunshots )

43
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:37,100
( explosion )
( automatic gunfire )

44
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,100
We got a problem.

45
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:39,833
One of the hostages
is missing.

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,867
He was working
with the terrorists.

47
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,267
Give me a description;
I'll take care of it.

48
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:44,734
I'll help you now--
let's go.

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,434
Buchanan just gave orders
to take you into custody.

50
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:49,034
JACK:
I watched Beresch
give this guy a key card.

51
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,134
Something else
is going down here.

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,701
We've got to find this guy now.

53
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,167
( grunting )

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,301
( latches clicking )

55
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:54,434
Sorry we have to bring you in
like this, Jack.

56
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,900
It's all right, Mara.
I understand.

57
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,601
A year and a half.

58
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,167
How did you manage to stay
invisible for so long?

59
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:05,167
Apparently I wasn't as invisible
as I should have been.

60
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,234
( phone ringing )

61
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,634
Tyler.

62
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,467
Mara, it's Curtis.
Put Bauer on.

63
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,234
It's Agent Manning.

64
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:13,867
Yeah?

65
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,567
Jack, you say the suspect
was hiding among the hostages?

66
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, right up until
the assault began,

67
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,567
somewhere around 10:30.

68
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,301
Then he must have broken
for an exit.

69
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,734
What exit was closest?

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,067
Without an alarm?

71
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,900
Between gates six
and seven.

72
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,768
Thanks, Jack.
Yeah.

73
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,668
Pull up external video
starting at 10:30.

74
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:32,768
All cameras covering
gates six and seven.

75
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,768
We're away.

76
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,701
Mrs. Logan?

77
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,634
Mrs. Logan?

78
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,668
Oh, my God.

79
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,067
EVELYN:
Help!

80
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,634
Something's happened
to the First Lady.

81
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:24,867
Get a doctor, now.

82
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,267
According to Jack, he should be

83
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:35,000
between gates six and seven,
just outside this view.

84
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,800
I got this feed
from ten minutes ago.

85
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,900
Try camera seven.

86
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,833
Camera four.

87
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:48,034
All right, there he is.

88
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,933
Tighten up.

89
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,501
Yellow Tie. Got him.

90
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,900
Now let's follow him.

91
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,800
Damn it. What camera covers
the adjacent sector?

92
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,567
14A, but it's a bad angle.

93
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,768
Pull it up, anyway.

94
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,100
Match the time codes.

95
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,100
Okay, here he is.

96
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,000
This is two minutes,
25 seconds later.

97
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,668
What hangar is that?

98
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,933
Hangar Double-B.

99
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,800
Has it been searched yet?

100
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,401
No. It was outside
the secured perimeter.

101
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,267
All right, I'm going to take
a field team, head over there.

102
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,401
Send this info to Comm.

103
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,534
Team A with me.
Let's go!

104
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,434
Hangar Double-B.
Let's go.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,267
( phone rings )

106
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,567
CTU. Stiles.

107
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,234
Edgar, Jack told us
about a suspect

108
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,467
hiding among the hostages.

109
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,334
We just picked up surveillance
on him.

110
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,434
He entered Hangar Double-B
at roughly 10:57.

111
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,534
Did you check it out yet?

112
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,668
No, we're going in now.
I'll need comm.

113
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:49,701
I'm on it. Chloe, what volume
is airport facilities on?

114
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,800
Hennessy Four.

115
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,100
Team Two, cover the rear.

116
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,301
* *

117
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,034
Check it out.

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,933
Everyone else,
search the building,

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,734
see what you can find.

120
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,467
* *

121
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,768
Craig, it's Curtis.

122
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,367
Send a forensics team
down here now.

123
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:30,534
Tell them they'll need
a full bio-pack

124
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,800
with spectrum analyzers.

125
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,234
Any problems getting
the canisters out?

126
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:45,367
No. They were hidden exactly
where you said they'd be.

127
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,134
Everything on schedule
with our transport?

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,034
Customs documents are being
finalized at the port.
Good.

129
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,967
The Russians will finally
understand the consequences

130
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,434
of occupying our homeland

131
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,034
when we turn Moscow
into a graveyard.

132
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,301
( canisters clattering )

133
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,000
When did this happen?

134
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,401
A few minutes ago.

135
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,701
I came back in,
and I found her on the bed.

136
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,534
What do you mean "came back in"?

137
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,900
You mean you left her alone.

138
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,567
What happened, Doctor?

139
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,000
Is she all right?

140
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,701
She seems to be now,
but I'd have to do some tests

141
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:24,833
to find out why she blacked out.

142
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,501
I didn't black out.

143
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,501
Someone did this to me.

144
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,000
Someone attacked me, Charles.

145
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,833
Shh, shh. Martha...

146
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,467
You have to do something.
You have to do something.

147
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,000
They're trying
to get me.

148
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,267
No, no one's trying
to get you.
Yes!

149
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,634
We just want you
to be well.
Honey, listen.

150
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,034
Listen, listen.

151
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,334
I had the proof,

152
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:42,534
and now it's gone.

153
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,067
What proof?
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,734
The proof
that David Palmer called me

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,434
to warn me about today.

156
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,734
Are we still on this?

157
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,567
We've never been off of it.

158
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,734
You just wouldn't
listen to me.

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,301
Sir.

160
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,567
Is everything okay?

161
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,134
I think so.

162
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
No. No, damn it,
it's not o... okay!

163
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:11,567
You people have got to listen
to me.

164
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,567
I had a document,
from the archive room.

165
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,501
Where was this document?

166
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,734
I am trying to tell you.

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,067
It was hidden in my blouse.

168
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,967
It's gone.
Someone stole it from me.

169
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,833
Martha, you've been under
a lot of stress.

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
We all have.

171
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,200
Let... let...

172
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,501
No, let Dr. Hill...

173
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,367
Let Dr. Hill examine you

174
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,467
and we can figure out
how to get you better.

175
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,967
( crying ):
You don't believe me.

176
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:42,701
You don't believe your own wife.

177
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:49,067
( crying )

178
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,933
( Martha moaning )

179
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,200
I have an important phone call
from the Secretary of State

180
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,867
that I have to get to.

181
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,301
If there's any sudden changes,

182
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,967
you get back to me
as soon as possible.

183
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes, Mr. President.

184
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,334
Charles, don't leave.

185
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,134
Honey, I'll be
right down the hall.

186
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,967
No, no, no, honey,
honey, don't leave me.

187
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:14,334
You need to get some rest.

188
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,634
Ple...

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,401
Close that door.

190
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,768
What do I do about this, Walt?

191
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,301
This is what she was like
before you sent her to Vermont.

192
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,867
Are you suggesting
that I readmit her?

193
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,668
You have to consider
the option.

194
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,601
For her sake.

195
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:49,367
She said she'd rather die
than go back in there.

196
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,334
Sir,

197
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,401
if she's going to persist
with these conspiracy theories,

198
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,933
it's only a matter of time

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,367
before she talks to someone
who believes her.

200
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:02,000
Then we really will
have a problem.

201
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,167
I wish you were wrong,
but I don't think you are.

202
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,900
Do you want me
to handle this, sir?

203
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,167
Make the arrangements.

204
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:24,100
But don't let Martha find out.

205
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:27,067
Let me be the one to tell her.

206
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,434
Yes, sir.

207
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,668
Yeah.

208
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,034
Have you handled
the problem there?

209
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,401
Yes.

210
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,467
Martha Logan won't be giving us
any more trouble.

211
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,567
Good. Erwich has just

212
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:50,000
completed transferring the gas
to the semi

213
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,833
and is on his way to the port.

214
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,200
And the authorities
don't know

215
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,634
anything's been stolen?
Not yet.

216
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,367
Then the only thing we have left
to take care of is Bauer.

217
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,567
Where is he?

218
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,734
On his way to CTU.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,134
Mm. He's getting too close.

220
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
He's already started
putting the pieces together.

221
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,833
I know.
He needs to be taken out.

222
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,534
I'm handling it myself.

223
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,100
How?

224
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,900
Once he gets to CTU, your hitter
won't be able to get near him.

225
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,000
I've have someone on the inside
who can help us.

226
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,668
Then use him.

227
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,134
Done.

228
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,100
EDGAR:
You sure those
readings are right?

229
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,067
They're right.

230
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,967
2,000 parts per million.

231
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,534
That can only be military grade.

232
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll tell him.

233
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:50,967
Where are you going?

234
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,034
I need you to finish

235
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,334
the shell script.
Not now.

236
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:54,934
Since when do you say "not now"?

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,668
BUCHANAN:
According to this,
the hangar was leased

238
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,534
to some offshore company,
but it's been vacant

239
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,201
for at least 18 months.

240
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,167
Sir?

241
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,501
I just heard from Curtis.

242
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:03,767
He was right.

243
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,833
There was nerve gas
in hangar Double B.

244
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,501
That's what killed the rats.

245
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,568
EDGAR:
There were trace amounts found
in the animals' blood.

246
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:10,867
But the concentrations

247
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,700
were definitely mil spec--
weaponized.

248
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,100
So this man in the yellow tie,

249
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,501
the suspect that Bauer's
telling us about

250
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,167
that's what he was
doing at the airport?

251
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:19,534
Stealing canisters of nerve gas
out of the hangar?

252
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,668
Stealing from whom?

253
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,733
Military destroyed

254
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,234
its stockpiles years ago.

255
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,367
Well, maybe this nerve gas
wasn't produced by the military.

256
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:32,067
Edgar, have forensics get a
signature off the trace samples.

257
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:34,000
See if they can figure out
who manufactured it.

258
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,434
Chloe, elevate our alert status.

259
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,167
Activate all available personnel
and get Curtis back here.

260
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,134
We're gonna need

261
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,668
everyone we have.

262
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,167
I wouldn't issue a statement
about the First Lady

263
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,434
for another couple days.

264
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,867
Let your successes today
run front and center

265
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:47,867
on all the networks.

266
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,767
That sounds right.

267
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,833
Dr. Hill, please, come in.

268
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
How's Martha doing?

269
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,367
Well, she's asleep now.

270
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,367
Have you figured out
what caused the blackout?

271
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:00,201
I spoke with her psychiatrist,
Dr. Carlstrom,

272
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,467
and none of the medication
she's been prescribing

273
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,000
would have caused
this kind of collapse.

274
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,668
So we still don't know
what it was.

275
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,967
Not yet, no.

276
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,401
Mr. President, I need
to speak to you and Walt alone.

277
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:13,267
Thank you, Doctor.

278
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,867
Keep a close eye on her.

279
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,034
We'll talk soon.

280
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,034
Yes, Mr. President.

281
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:22,201
What's up, Mike?

282
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,301
I'm afraid the situation
at the airport

283
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,800
has taken an unexpected turn.

284
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,067
What's the problem?

285
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,267
The hostages were saved,
we've captured or killed

286
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,434
all the terrorists.

287
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,501
Not all of them.

288
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:32,733
One of the terrorists was

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,900
posing as a hostage.

290
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,601
He used the hostage crisis

291
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,467
to cover a theft.
A theft?

292
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:38,568
What was stolen?

293
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,634
A cache of chemical weapons.

294
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,000
What kind of chemical weapons?

295
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,501
Nerve gas.

296
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,800
Is it ours?

297
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:51,967
No, sir.

298
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,501
CTU is still trying
to source it.

299
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:54,501
But it was buried

300
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:55,967
in a bunker at the airport.

301
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,201
It seems this man

302
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,733
had another crew
waiting for him there.

303
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,634
Do we have any idea what
the terrorists are planning?

304
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,867
Well, they haven't
made any demands

305
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,367
or issued any threats, yet.

306
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,967
Well, what are we doing
to stop them?

307
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,401
CTU is running

308
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,634
an interagency search effort.

309
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,934
They're coordinating
ground operations,

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
filtering intelligence.

311
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,601
Has the press found out
about this, yet?

312
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,134
No, sir.
It's being kept internal.

313
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,167
Whatever retaliation

314
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,967
we were bracing for an hour ago

315
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:29,668
is nothing compared to what
these people

316
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,367
are capable of doing now.

317
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,700
Sir, I'll assemble
the Homeland Security team

318
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,201
to discuss evacuation scenarios.

319
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,501
I sent everyone updates
on the airport forensics.

320
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:52,967
What did you want me on next?

321
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,634
Check the task list.
You don't need to

322
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,334
ask me every time you need

323
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,934
something new to do.

324
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,668
I don't care if
you are my boss

325
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,367
or if you regret sleeping
with me last night.

326
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:04,867
No one talks to me like that.

327
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:05,934
Really?

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,100
I just did.

329
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,401
Now, what's your problem?

330
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,733
I don't have a problem.

331
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,100
Then what do you want?

332
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,167
Nothing.

333
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,034
Edgar.

334
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,833
Look, I'm sorry
that my private life

335
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,467
hasn't remained private today.

336
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:48,867
I'm thinking the opposite.

337
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,234
What do you mean?

338
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,367
You're too private.

339
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,401
We've known each other
for years.

340
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,700
And today I find out
you're keeping secrets from me?

341
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,568
Haven't you ever taken
a psychology class?

342
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:58,534
People keep secrets.

343
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,568
I don't.

344
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,100
Not from my friends.

345
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:04,134
Why didn't you tell
me Jack was alive?

346
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,134
Oh, come on.

347
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,100
It's called national security.

348
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,134
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?

349
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,934
I didn't even know you
two were going out.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,900
Give me a break.

351
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,967
Okay, when we find the nerve gas
and the alert level drops,

352
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,301
we can have some chamomile tea

353
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,100
and I'll tell you
all my secrets, okay?

354
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,134
You paged me.

355
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,934
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,434
No, not yet.

357
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,434
When he does, I need you
to do something.

358
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:40,501
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

359
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:42,267
Bauer is a priority.

360
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:45,434
I need you to clear
an entrance into CTU.

361
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm sending it now.

362
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,067
Okay.

363
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,301
Miss Raines.

364
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,668
I'll get back to you. Yes?

365
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,967
I take it you're up to
speed on the nerve gas

366
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,967
stolen from the airport.
I was just filling in DOD.

367
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,634
Diane Huxley and her son were
brought in to be debriefed.

368
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,934
I'd like you to interview her.

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,167
Interview her about what?

370
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,401
Any information she has

371
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,000
that could help us
find the nerve gas.

372
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,534
What could she possibly
know about that?

373
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,534
I've reviewed the evidence
against Jack Bauer,

374
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,267
and I'm inclined to agree
with your assessment

375
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,634
that he was framed for the
assassination of David Palmer.

376
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,134
Thank you.

377
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,367
I also think that whoever
framed Jack is also involved

378
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:17,867
with the theft of
this nerve gas.

379
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:19,401
Which means that Diane Huxley

380
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,434
could have had contact with that
person without realizing it.

381
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,668
I-I'm not
a trained interrogator.

382
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,568
But you know Jack Bauer
better than anyone else in here.

383
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:30,668
You have something in
common with this woman.

384
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,334
It might help her open up.

385
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,401
I realize it's awkward,
but I need you to do it.

386
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,234
Fine.

387
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,467
I'll see what
I can get from her.

388
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,668
Thank you.

389
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,301
Where is she?

390
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,900
She and her son just
cleared security.

391
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,601
Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.

392
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:01,534
Hi.
Hello.

393
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:02,800
This is my son, Derek.

394
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:04,867
Hi. I'm gonna be asking you
a few qutions.

395
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,367
And Derek, I want you

396
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:08,967
to be checked out by a doctor
while I speak with your mother.

397
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,201
There's nothing wrong with me.

398
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,434
It's just procedure.

399
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,867
When you're done,
you and I will speak.

400
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,000
Can you take him
to medical, please?

401
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,800
It's okay,
I'll see you in a bit.

402
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,367
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

403
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:27,501
Is Jack gonna be here soon?

404
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,301
He's on his way in.

405
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,367
Come with me.

406
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,334
I had no idea he worked
in a place like this.

407
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:38,034
It's just up these stairs.

408
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,401
Did you know him before?

409
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

410
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,234
I knew him.

411
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:11,201
A lot of people here thought
you were dead until today.

412
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,700
Yeah, I know.

413
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,234
Excuse me.

414
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,267
Chloe.

415
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,067
Hi, Jack.

416
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,167
You all right?

417
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:21,934
Yeah, I'm okay.
We wouldn't have made it

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,267
out of that airport

419
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,401
without your help.

420
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:25,600
Thank you.

421
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:26,667
You're welcome.

422
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,534
Mr. Bauer, Lynn McGill
from division.

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Mara, I'll assume custody
at this point, thank you.

424
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,434
You're no longer a suspect

425
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,167
in President Palmer's murder,
but while you're here,

426
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,934
you will need this.

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
It'll give you
level two clearance.
Thank you.

428
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,367
Was Agent Manning able
to apprehend the suspect?

429
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:42,534
No.

430
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,134
It seems the person
you identified

431
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,900
used the hostage
situation as a cover

432
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,301
to steal a cache of weaponized
nerve gas from the airport.

433
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,134
Nerve gas? How do
you know that?

434
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,800
McGILL:
Following your lead, Curtis
found trace amounts in a hangar

435
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,267
adjacent to the terminal.
We don't know

436
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,234
how much there is and
where it came from,

437
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:57,934
but it is a military grade
chemical weapon.

438
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,468
Do you have any leads?

439
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,367
Not yet, but we're gonna run
the search operation from here.

440
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,234
You're not gonna be able
to track these terrorists

441
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:04,667
fast enough with a standard
search operation.

442
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,934
The only way you're gonna
get that nerve gas in time

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,667
is if you find out who ordered
the hit on David Palmer.

444
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:10,934
I agree.

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,834
I think Palmer was about
to expose this plot.

446
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,434
I think that's
why he was killed.

447
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,000
I also think that if you can

448
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,568
help us identify
who framed you,

449
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,767
we can intercept this nerve gas
while there's still time.

450
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:20,834
Hello, Jack.

451
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,134
Hey, Bill.

452
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,767
President's been informed
of the nerve gas.

453
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:24,767
He wants to ensure

454
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,468
the media doesn't find out.

455
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:30,067
Well, make sure Division
restricts information flow.

456
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:32,633
We'll continue this
conversation when I'm done.

457
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:36,067
Good to see you
again, Jack.

458
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:38,700
It's good to see you,
too, Bill.

459
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,334
I'm so sorry
about Michelle.

460
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,034
I never meant
to put her in jeopardy.

461
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,633
Of course, you didn't.

462
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,468
How's Tony doing?

463
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:49,167
He's still
unconscious,

464
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,201
but the doctor says he's
going to pull through.

465
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,201
( sighs )
Good.

466
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,534
We're gonna need to speak to him
as soon as possible.

467
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,667
They know to call us.

468
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,034
Jack...

469
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:03,934
Audrey has been
working for us.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,667
She's here in the building now?

471
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,633
She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

472
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,000
Why is she talking to Diane?

473
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,434
Lynn asked her to.

474
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,568
DIANE:
I'm not used to
calling him Jack.

475
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,534
He said his name
was Frank Flynn.

476
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,800
I thought he worked
for the oil company.

477
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,967
You probably know more
about him than I do.

478
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,867
We all thought he was dead
for the last year and a half.

479
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,967
So what do you want to know?

480
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,501
You said that Jack was living
with you for the last...

481
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:34,767
six months,
is that correct?

482
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,201
He was renting a room.

483
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:41,201
So, you don't have a personal
relationship with him?

484
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,267
I'm not sure that's any
of your business.

485
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:47,034
I'm sorry, I just...
I need to know

486
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,434
how close you and Jack were,

487
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:52,600
whether he confided
in you or not.

488
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,101
Jack's a private person.

489
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,967
I always knew he was
keeping something from me.

490
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,468
I just never
pushed it.

491
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:03,633
I accepted him for who he was.

492
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,934
Ms. Raines...

493
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,501
whoever he was before...

494
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:14,167
it doesn't change
the way I feel about him.

495
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:19,201
He was good to me,
he was good to my son.

496
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:22,900
He meant a lot to us.

497
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,934
He still does.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,367
I see.

499
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,267
( clears throat )

500
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:34,534
Did anyone ever come by
and ask about Jack?

501
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,667
What do you mean?

502
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,568
Someone knew
that Jack was alive.

503
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,334
It's critical
to our investigation

504
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:42,101
that we find out who that was.

505
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,301
No. No one asked about him.

506
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,468
No one ever came
to see him.

507
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:11,633
Can you excuse me
for a minute, please?

508
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,501
Yeah.

509
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:20,434
AUDREY:
Jack.

510
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:29,167
I don't even know
where to begin.

511
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,201
You have to believe me.

512
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,000
I couldn't tell you
I was still alive.

513
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,667
Jack, you don't need
to apologize.

514
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,733
I did it for your
own protection.

515
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,000
It's been hard for me,
thinking you died,

516
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:45,201
believing that I was angry
at you...

517
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,334
that I hated you.

518
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:51,134
I wasn't able
to forgive myself for that.

519
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:53,900
You had every
reason to hate me.

520
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,401
I was responsible
for Paul's death.

521
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:57,234
I lied to you.
Jack.

522
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,267
You made a hard decision.

523
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:12,568
I never imagined I'd get
another chance to tell you this.

524
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:19,934
But I want...

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,633
I want you to know
that I don't blame you

526
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,967
for what happened with Paul.

527
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:28,800
Thank you.

528
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,667
Jack...

529
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,700
There's so much that I want
to say to you, I know its...

530
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,000
WOMAN:
Mr. Bauer.

531
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,667
Mr. McGill needs
to see you.

532
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,101
I'll be right down.

533
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,934
I should go.

534
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,334
( sighs )

535
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,700
Evelyn, is Mrs. Logan
still asleep?

536
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,067
Yes, she's finally
getting some rest.

537
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:05,468
Good.

538
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,468
You should probably start
gathering some of her things.

539
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,101
I thought the president
was staying through the weekend.

540
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:13,534
He is... but she'll be
leaving today.

541
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,900
Where's she going?

542
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:18,201
Just make sure
she has the essentials

543
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,633
to make her trip comfortable.

544
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,134
Yes, sir.

545
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:28,267
( typing )

546
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:37,201
( continues typing )

547
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,568
( footsteps )

548
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,934
Edgar said he saw you
come in here.

549
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,034
What are you doing?

550
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:51,201
Setting up a new socket.

551
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,468
We're overloaded
from the NSA database.

552
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:56,434
Why are you here?

553
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:57,934
Looking for you.

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,234
What for?

555
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,067
I need to get into
your utilities volume.

556
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:03,900
Why didn't you message me?

557
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,334
Okay, I wanted
to say something, too.

558
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,167
Let's not make a big drama
out of it.

559
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,867
What?

560
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:14,568
I was unfairly harsh to you
a few minutes ago.

561
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,900
I didn't mean anything.

562
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,401
All right.

563
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,201
Apology accepted.

564
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,600
It wasn't really
an apology,

565
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:24,867
it was more of
an observation.

566
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,534
I mean, the fact...

567
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,367
Spenser.

568
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:31,167
( sighs )

569
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:34,667
Damn it, why do I do that?

570
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:03,568
It's Chloe.

571
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,834
What is it?

572
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,767
I need to know
Spenser's clearance level?

573
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,267
Why are you asking?

574
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:11,067
Spenser works for me, and I need
to know his clearance level,

575
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:13,134
so could you please
open the header file

576
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,367
and give it to me, Edgar?

577
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,468
Fine.

578
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:16,700
( typing )

579
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,468
Level three.

580
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:24,934
Chloe?

581
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,367
Call Buchanan, tell him
I need to talk to him now.

582
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:28,800
It's important.

583
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:34,700
Division sent me.

584
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:39,201
One of your mainframe
servers is cycling slow.

585
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:40,568
You're not on the manifest.

586
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,234
I was told it'd
be taken care of.

587
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:45,934
I'm going to have to clear this
with the systems administrator.

588
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,434
Are you Hank,

589
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,367
from on-site support?
Yeah.

590
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:50,568
My fault.

591
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,301
I was supposed to advance him

592
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:54,301
an emergency
clearance.
All right.

593
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,667
Place the bag
on the conveyor belt,

594
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,000
and walk right through, sir.

595
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:17,733
All clear.

596
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,934
Thank you.
Thank you.

597
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,067
Thank you.

598
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,468
I'll show you the way.

599
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,234
Mr. Cummings told me
it would be best

600
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,534
to keep you off the manifest.

601
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:31,667
Classified material
generally runs

602
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:33,167
on servers nine
and twelve.

603
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,633
All the information you need
on Bauer should be there.

604
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,767
I don't know what
files Mr. Cummings

605
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,000
asked you to download,

606
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,900
but you need to keep vector
counts the same,

607
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,334
or it'll get flagged.

608
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:49,134
( rattling )

609
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:50,867
I got it.

610
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

611
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,733
I need to get back
to my station.

612
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,734
Evelyn, what are you doing?

613
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,767
Mrs. Logan,
are you feeling better?

614
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,467
Why are you
packing my things?

615
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,834
Walt Cummings asked me to.

616
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:53,334
Why?

617
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,867
Where are we going?

618
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,667
I don't know if the president's
going with you.

619
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:01,001
Evelyn, stop. What's going on?

620
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:06,400
They just asked me
to get you ready to leave.

621
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,200
They're sending me to Vermont,
aren't they?

622
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:20,334
Charles is having me committed.

623
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,233
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Logan.

624
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I honestly don't know
anything else.

625
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:33,701
It's fine.

626
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,567
( drawer closes )

627
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,901
I'll getting dressed.

628
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:59,500
( typing )

629
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,701
Edgar, my FGA is locked.

630
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:02,901
Where's Chloe?

631
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:03,934
How should I know?

632
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,233
( typing )

633
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,801
Can you unlock this?

634
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,200
No.

635
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,068
Mr. Wolff?

636
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,434
Please come with us.

637
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,267
What do you want?

638
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,133
Mr. Buchanan has ordered us
to take you to him immediately.

639
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,334
I'm in the middle
of a critical task here.

640
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,634
SECURITY GUARD:
Mr. Stiles

641
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,100
has been authorized
to take over your work load.

642
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:28,400
Did you know about this, Edgar?

643
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:31,867
Yeah. I just got the bulletin.

644
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,534
Sorry.

645
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,367
GUARD:
Mr. Wolff.

646
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:36,434
Please.

647
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:40,434
I'm coming.

648
00:32:58,034 --> 00:32:58,968
Chloe?

649
00:32:59,034 --> 00:32:59,801
Sir.

650
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,233
What is going on here?

651
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,634
Sit down, Spenser.

652
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,233
BUCHANAN:
You've been
burrowing

653
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,801
into classified CTU protocols

654
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,068
without authorization.

655
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,167
I don't know
what you're talking about.

656
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,634
Stop-- I know you were logged
onto the security subsystem,

657
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:21,133
where you had
no right to be.

658
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,167
We're going through
your system

659
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,567
so you might as well
tell us now

660
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,500
what you were doing.

661
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:25,701
I told you I was opening...

662
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,334
That's enough!

663
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:31,434
You've accessed files
outside your clearance level

664
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,867
at least 18 times in the
four months you've been here.

665
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:37,100
Sir, whatever you think
you've found,

666
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,100
it's a mistake.

667
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,834
I've done nothing wrong.

668
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,534
Come on, Spenser,
you obviously have

669
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,434
your own agenda
here.

670
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,801
I don't have an "agenda."

671
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:46,100
And while you're at it,
why don't you explain

672
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,034
why it was necessary
to crawl into my bed.

673
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,167
Which certainly
wasn't

674
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:48,968
what it appeared to be,

675
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,034
just like your work here

676
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,634
isn't what
it appears to be!

677
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:52,701
Chloe, Chloe.

678
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,734
Chloe, let me
handle this, please.

679
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,500
Sir, obviously you can't take

680
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,567
anything she says
into consideration.

681
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:03,467
I was careless.

682
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,133
And, inadvertently,

683
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,634
I caused her
some emotional pain.

684
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:08,334
Oh, please.

685
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,767
And now she's trying
to get back at me.

686
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:11,968
I don't think so, Spenser.

687
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,867
Sir, I'd like
to talk to a lawyer.

688
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,334
Forget about a lawyer!

689
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,968
We're in the middle
of a terrorist crisis

690
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:19,133
There are lives
on the line.

691
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,467
You're going to tell us

692
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:21,867
what you've been
doing here,

693
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,167
and you're going
to tell us now.

694
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,334
I hope this goes better

695
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,467
than when I sent her
up there the last time.

696
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,167
Dr. Hill and his staff
are on standby

697
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,167
if she overreacts.

698
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm not looking forward
to this.

699
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:39,068
Evelyn?

700
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,034
Mr. President.

701
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,267
Where is she?

702
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:42,801
She's in the bathroom, sir.

703
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:47,801
Martha?

704
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,734
Marty?

705
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,701
Are you sure she's in there?

706
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,200
Yes, sir.
She's getting dressed.

707
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,867
Marty?

708
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,133
Aaron?

709
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,901
My wife is gone.

710
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,534
This is Pierce.

711
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,467
We have a priority alert.

712
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:32,934
The First Lady has left her
quarters and is unaccounted for.

713
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:36,034
All agents in the main wing,
move to points north and west.

714
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,400
Anyone spotting her,
check in immediately.

715
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,868
So the only people
who knew you were alive

716
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:57,033
were David Palmer,
Tony Almeida,

717
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,567
Michelle Dessler
and Chloe O'Brian.

718
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,701
Yeah, and at least one other
person who killed David Palmer

719
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:02,167
and tried
to frame me for it.

720
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,834
And you don't know who that
other person might be?

721
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,834
No.

722
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Any theories?

723
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,701
( sighs )

724
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:11,734
About a year and a half ago,
David Palmer called me.

725
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:12,900
Told me there's someone
in Logan's administration

726
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:14,100
targeting me.

727
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:15,601
Which is why you faked
your own death

728
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,634
and assumed a new identity?

729
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,900
Yeah, except it didn't work.

730
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:23,200
I believe that whoever tried
to kill me 18 months ago

731
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,267
somehow found out
I was still alive,

732
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,601
and waited until today
to exploit that information.

733
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,100
Someone inside
President Logan's
administration?

734
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:33,334
That's what David Palmer told me
a year and a half ago,

735
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,567
and I believe him.

736
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:35,967
Well, first of all,
that would mean

737
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:37,334
someone in
this administration
is also tied

738
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,134
to the theft
of the nerve gas.

739
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,634
Yeah. You're going
to have to look into that.

740
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,434
Well, even if you're right,

741
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,167
there are hundreds of people
in Logan's administration.

742
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,033
It would take an investigation
of that magnitude months

743
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,134
to gain any
traction--

744
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,701
and we don't have
months to work with.

745
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:50,967
WOMAN ( on speakerphone ):
I'm sorry to interrupt,

746
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,801
but Dr. Paulson is calling
from medical.

747
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:53,734
Put him through.

748
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,634
DR. PAULSON ( on speakerphone ):
Mr. McGill?

749
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:56,801
Yes?

750
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:57,900
Tony Almeida's regained
consciousness

751
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,434
and is in recovery.

752
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:00,434
Can he talk?

753
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:01,401
Yes. He's very weak,

754
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,900
you'll have to be brief.

755
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,300
Let him know I'll be down
in a few minutes.

756
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,567
Tony asked if he could
speak to Jack Bauer first.

757
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:10,501
He says it's important.

758
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:11,634
He's a friend of mine.

759
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:15,434
Tell Mr. Almeida that Jack
will be down in few moments.

760
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:16,434
I'll let him know.

761
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,234
Thank you.

762
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,267
I'll be right back.

763
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,134
Jack.

764
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,234
What's going on?

765
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,667
I know
you're busy.

766
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:31,834
I...

767
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,033
I just wanted to apologize.

768
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,167
You have nothing
to apologize for.

769
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:36,768
Yes, I do.

770
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,300
I thought you were
just another loser,

771
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:41,634
trying to take advantage
of my mom.

772
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:43,734
I was wrong.

773
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:47,634
You were trying
to protect her.

774
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,801
Your mother is lucky
to have someone

775
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,334
who loves her
as much as you do.

776
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,401
As soon as this is over,
I promise you,

777
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:55,501
you and I are going
to get a chance

778
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:56,467
to sit down and talk.

779
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:57,801
But right now
I have to go.

780
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:58,701
Yeah.

781
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,967
Take care of your mother.

782
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,334
Who gave you the Level Five
authorization?

783
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,768
Don't look at me.
Answer him!

784
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:18,100
I can't.

785
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,000
I can't talk to anyone here
about this.

786
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,000
Whatever you were doing
is over, Spenser.

787
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,701
Sir, I was able

788
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:27,701
to pull Spenser's screen
activity from the archive.

789
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:29,567
This is what he was looking at
ten minutes ago.

790
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:31,067
Looks like he was using

791
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:32,667
in-house surveillance
to track someone

792
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:35,534
through CTU.

793
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:38,000
BUCHANAN:
Why are you

794
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,534
tracking Jack Bauer?
What the hell's going

795
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:41,067
on here, Spenser?
I was following orders.

796
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,100
I'm sure if they're tracking
Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

797
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,401
Who is they?

798
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,033
I won't say anything else.

799
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,200
Chloe, find security,
have them locate Jack now.

800
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:08,900
Dr. Paulson?

801
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,734
Yes.

802
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm Jack Bauer.

803
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,501
Tony Almeida wanted
to speak with me.

804
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:14,734
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer.

805
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,967
Just remember
to please keep it brief.

806
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,100
Thank you, sir.

807
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:27,200
Tony.

808
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,401
Tony, it's Jack.

809
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,501
( grunting )

810
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,601
( grunting )

811
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:55,501
( groans )

812
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,868
( groans )

813
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,067
( grunting )

814
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,234
( gurgling groan )

815
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:23,967
( final gasp )

816
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:27,267
( panting )

817
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,601
( groaning )

818
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,167
BUCHANAN:
Jack,

819
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:34,467
you all right?

820
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:35,734
I think he cracked my rib.

821
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,100
I've been trying
to reach you,

822
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,701
but the lines
were locked out.

823
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:39,900
What happened?
Who is he?

824
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,200
I don't know,

825
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,634
but he's a professional.

826
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,134
He killed Dr. Paulson,
then he tried to kill me.

827
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
You have any idea
how he got into CTU?

828
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,534
We identified a mole working
in Chloe's department.

829
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:49,801
Who?

830
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:51,300
Spenser Wolff.

831
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,000
We've been interrogating him,
but he hasn't talked yet.

832
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,434
Where is he?
Holding.

833
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,067
Get a doctor down here
to monitor Tony Almeida now.

834
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:58,768
Lock this room down.

835
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,567
Contact Lynn McGill,
have him meet me in Holding.

836
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:22,734
Bring up visual surveillance
on Medical Room Two.

837
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:24,834
Open the door.

838
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,334
( keyboard keys clicking )

839
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,768
( Jack panting )

840
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:33,967
I want to show you something.

841
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:35,567
Get up!

842
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,167
Did you let that man into CTU?

843
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,000
JACK:
This man
is a professional assassin.

844
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,334
He just killed Dr. Paulson,

845
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,501
and he tried to kill me.

846
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:45,567
Did you let him into CTU?

847
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:46,900
No. They told me he was here

848
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,834
to place a tap
on one of the servers.

849
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,801
That's all I knew.
Who told you?

850
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:53,067
I was here as part
of an Internal Affairs

851
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:56,234
investigation.

852
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Are you starting to understand
how much trouble you are in?

853
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:00,134
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

854
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,434
Who told you
to let that man into CTU?

855
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:05,734
The White House.

856
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:07,801
Mr. Cummings

857
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:09,033
in the White
House.

858
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,467
Cummings recruited me

859
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:11,701
after I started working here.

860
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:13,067
He said that

861
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:15,267
they wanted to make
sure CTU was operating...

862
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,501
within the rules.

863
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:21,501
You have to believe me.

864
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:26,100
I thought
I was serving the President.

865
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,134
Yeah. Take him back
to Holding.

866
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,601
Walt Cummings

867
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,067
killed David
Palmer, and he tried

868
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,434
to have me killed.

869
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,501
Even if it is true,
we have to build a case

870
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:43,634
before we call
the President.

871
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:44,967
We don't call the President.

872
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:46,900
He's here in California.
We go see him now.

873
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:48,834
Cummings is the President's
Chief of Staff, Jack.

874
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,200
And his friend.

875
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,434
Without any hard evidence,
CTU can't touch him.

876
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:54,501
I'm not CTU.

877
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,534
I'll go get Walt Cummings
myself.
