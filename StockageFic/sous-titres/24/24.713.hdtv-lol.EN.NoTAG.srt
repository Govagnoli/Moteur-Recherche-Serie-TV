3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,411
Mr. Burnett, you're a traitor
and a terrorist.

4
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:19,560
Where's the target?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,980
Mr. Bauer's under arrest.

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,734
- Have you learned anything else?
- Walker followed a lead on her own.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,154
Got a visual on a heavily armed
commando unit lead by Juma himself.

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,489
Bill Buchanan.

9
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,810
Renee Walker says
the target is the White House.

10
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,369
Condition red.
Secure the president.

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,538
There's no safe path out.
Secure her in the first floor lockdown.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,346
Hostage rescue team
are moving into place.

13
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,966
They're prepared to storm the building
as soon as the order's given.

14
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,356
Mr. Vice President, terrorists
are in control of the White House.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,599
<i>Until you can provide me with more intel
on what's going on in there,</i>

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,353
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

17
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,106
President Taylor's locked
in the safe room.

18
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,691
What is it I can do for you?

19
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,954
I need you to find me
another way in.

20
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,507
Well, I'm looking
at the White House manifest,

21
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:15,616
and according to this, Olivia Taylor
is presently in the building with you.

22
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,370
<i>You find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get
the president to open that door.</i>

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,122
<i>President Taylor...</i>

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,581
God, no.

25
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,837
<i>If you don't open the door,</i>

26
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,879
I'm going to cut out
your daughter's eyes one by one.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,131
- Open the door.
- Madam President...

28
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:35,052
- Open the door. Open it!
- I can't do that. I can't!

29
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:37,096
Do you have children, Jack?

30
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:38,556
I have a daughter.

31
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,977
Could you do what you're asking me?
Just stand by and watch her butchered?

32
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,145
No, ma'am,

33
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,939
but I am not the President
of the United States.

34
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,650
Well, I am the president,

35
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,621
and I am ordering you
to open that door.

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,524
All right, General,

37
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,353
you've got me now.

38
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:05,583
There's no reason
to hold anyone else.

39
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,001
Let them go.

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,971
<i>Now, what we do know is that
the president was in the building</i>

41
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,417
<i>when the attack took place,
and she may have been taken hostage</i>

42
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,097
<i>along with numerous other
White House personnel.</i>

43
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,663
<i>Vice President Hayworth
was not in the building,</i>

44
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:29,315
<i>and we're told
he was moved to a secure location.</i>

45
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,427
<i>The FBI has cordoned off...</i>

46
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,982
Mr. Vice President,

47
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,071
- that was Agent Moss.
- What does he have to say?

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,282
He's requesting
that you authorize a rescue operation

49
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,079
Does he have more intel
about what the hell's going on in there?

50
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:44,789
No, sir. He deployed two units
with parabolics, but all they could get

51
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,645
was static. They think
Juma's using some jamming equipment.

52
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,191
They've got spotters
at every angle around the building,

53
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:51,754
but they couldn't see inside.

54
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,813
So we still don't know
whether Juma has the president,

55
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:57,803
or whether the president
is locked inside the safe room?

56
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,011
No, sir, we don't.

57
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,071
I will not authorize any action until
I know the status of the president.

58
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,853
- Relay that to Agent Moss.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:18,364
Mom, I know that I hurt you.

60
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,407
I'm so sorry
for cutting you out of my life.

61
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:22,722
- It's okay...
- No, it isn't.

62
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,780
You were right
to fire me off the campaign.

63
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,415
I felt so betrayed,
I turned my back on you.

64
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,652
- Don't worry about it.
- It all seems so stupid now.

65
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,278
I hope you can forgive me.

66
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,444
Darling, I forgave you
a long time ago.

67
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,805
Livy, you have to listen to me.

68
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,391
We really are going to be okay.

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,644
Just keep your eyes open
and be ready.

70
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
Abo.

71
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,733
- Get up.
- Leave her alone!

72
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,654
- Get away from her!
- Get back!

73
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,118
- I said leave her alone. Please.
- Olivia, it's okay, darling.

74
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,243
It's okay.

75
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:04,619
Bill, we need to make a move
to try to save the president.

76
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,996
- How?
- In the lockdown room,

77
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:09,417
there were five canisters of CH-4.

78
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,176
Before we surrendered ourselves
over to Juma, I opened the valves.

79
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,117
Within the next few minutes, that room
will be saturated with natural gas.

80
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:19,091
It's gonna take one spark
to set it off.

81
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:22,349
The explosion should be large enough
to take out most of Juma's men.

82
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,977
- That's when you can make your move.
- How do we set it off?

83
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:28,158
I'll me a run for the lockdown room.
Try and draw their fire.

84
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,297
All we need is one stray bullet.

85
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,397
- That's a suicide play, Jack.
- We don't have a choice.

86
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,521
Get to the president
and get her out of here.

87
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,010
She knows about the plan,
she'll be ready.

88
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,343
What are you planning?

89
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,609
- Are you going to do something?
- When it happens, you'll know about it.

90
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,123
Damn it, if you're planning something,
I want to know what it is.

91
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,523
Senator, shut up.

92
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,330
Read this statement.

93
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,710
It is a confession of your crimes
against my country.

94
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,420
The atrocities
that you have committed

95
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,173
will now be seen by the whole world.

96
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,551
I'll read your statement, General,

97
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,263
but I need you to release
the other hostages.

98
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:10,935
You got what you came for.

99
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,479
You have the President
of the United States.

100
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,358
As a sign of good faith...

101
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,605
I will release one of the hostages.

102
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,662
You...

103
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,831
Stand up.

104
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,399
Do you want me to release
any more hostages,

105
00:05:58,912 --> 00:05:59,984
President Taylor?

106
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,257
You son of a bitch.

107
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,704
You will read this statement

108
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,408
or I will do the same thing
to everyone here...

109
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,619
starting with your daughter.

110
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,164
General, the uplink is complete.

111
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,716
All right.

112
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,051
The world is waiting,

113
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,658
Madam President.

114
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,729
"This is the president
of the United States.

115
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:44,737
"Six hours ago,
I ordered our armed forces

116
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,321
"to invade Sangala

117
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:49,450
"without warning
and without provocation.

118
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,893
"This attack was a criminal act

119
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,747
"motivated solely
by America's desire

120
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,374
<i>"to exert its power and influence."</i>

121
00:06:57,758 --> 00:07:00,335
- Tell me you're shutting this down.
- We can't, sir.

122
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,997
- It's a live feed to the Internet.
- I don't care. Shut it down.

123
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,676
It's going out on multiple servers, sir.
It would take hours just to trace them.

124
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,180
This is Derek Watts.

125
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:12,877
Hold on.

126
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,309
- It's Agent Moss on teleconference.
- Put him on.

127
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:20,302
<i>- Sir, are you getting this?</i>
- Yes.

128
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,036
So is the rest of the damn world.

129
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:25,539
<i>Mr. Vice President, I believe Juma
came here to humiliate the president</i>

130
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,551
<i>and stage a public execution.</i>

131
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,626
<i>We have a rescue operation in place.
All we need is your authorization.</i>

132
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,242
You don't know Juma's intentions.

133
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,161
It could be a prelude
to a set of demands.

134
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,426
<i>There are no demands here, sir.
This is about revenge.</i>

135
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,696
<i>Juma knows he'll never get out
of the White House alive.</i>

136
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,085
You're speculating.

137
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,670
<i>My advisors are telling me
the most prudent course of action</i>

138
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,346
<i>is to try to initiate
communication with Juma.</i>

139
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:48,810
We've been trying to do that.
He hasn't responded.

140
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,345
<i>Sir, Juma has no desire
to negotiate anything.</i>

141
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,515
<i>- He's going to kill the president.
- Sir, we have a tactical plan in place.</i>

142
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,434
It's a two-pronged assault,
we're confident it stands a good chance

143
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,021
<i>of catching Juma off guard, but we're
losing time. We have to initiate now.</i>

144
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,441
I can't authorize any action that might
result in the president's death.

145
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,795
<i>Keep trying
to open dialog with Juma.</i>

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,904
<i>Hold your position
till you're told otherwise.</i>

147
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,833
I will keep this feed open.

148
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,699
<i>"General Juma has demonstrated</i>

149
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,871
"that even a tyrant state
like the U.S..."

150
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,108
- Be ready.
- Jack, listen to me.

151
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,624
Juma's not solely coordinating
this attack.

152
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,293
- What do you mean?
- I heard him talking on his sat phone.

153
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:27,382
He's coordinating with someone outside.
They were giving him real-time intel.

154
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,243
- It's someone in the White House?
- I don't know.

155
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:34,314
But even if we take Juma down,
the president may still be in danger.

156
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,518
You're the only one I know
who can do this, Jack.

157
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,944
Find out who Juma's working with.

158
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,542
Agent Moss, a device has been detonated
in the West Wing.

159
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,924
There's been an explosion
at the White House.

160
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,457
<i>- An explosion?</i>
- Yes, sir.

161
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,507
<i>- The Internet feed has gone dark.</i>
- We saw that. What's happening?

162
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,297
I don't know, sir, but we're going in
under my authority. Let's go.

163
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,215
All teams, Attack Plan Delta.

164
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,718
<i>- You're under orders! Agent Moss!</i>
- Code Green.

165
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:25,235
Pierce, get to the president!

166
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,906
Madam President, are you okay?

167
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,783
We need get out of here right now.
Both of you, come with me.

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,927
Madam President, get down.
Stay low till I know we're clear.

169
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:58,802
Ngozi,

170
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:00,974
kill the hostages.

171
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,322
The president is mine!

172
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,856
Udo...

173
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:18,369
Don't move!

174
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,180
Don't you move!

175
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,262
Clear.

176
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:39,883
We're clear!

177
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,359
Secret Service!
I have the president!

178
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,368
Aaron Pierce, Secret Service.

179
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,056
Let's go, ma'am.

180
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,455
Madam President, this way!

181
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,240
We have the president.
The president is secure!

182
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,420
Repeat: We have the president.
This way, ma'am.

183
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,989
Renee! We gotta get
the president out of here now!

184
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,599
- This way, ma'am.
- It's all right, darling.

185
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,424
It's gonna be all right.

186
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,241
Madam President...

187
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:08,132
we're still sweeping. We do believe all
the hostiles have been accounted for.

188
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,780
You and your daughter will stay here
until the building is secured.

189
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:11,815
I understand.

190
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,941
Once we get the all clear, we're going
to move you to Andrews Air Force Base.

191
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,579
- I'm staying right here.
- Ma'am, it's for your own safety.

192
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,947
Do what's necessary
to make sure this building's safe

193
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,817
because I'm not going anywhere.

194
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,578
The American people need to know that
the president is in the White House.

195
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,746
Yes, Ma'am.

196
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,572
- How many people did we lose?
- It's too early to tell.

197
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:35,092
Medical teams are on their way
to treat the wounded.

198
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,477
We're going to set up
a triage unit in the East Wing.

199
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,465
All right.

200
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,511
I'd like to speak to the vice president
as soon as possible.

201
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,569
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,641
And I need to know
how my husband's doing.

203
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,318
Would you please contact
Dr. Lee Schulman

204
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:49,953
at West Arlington Hospital?

205
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,494
- Yes, Madam President.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,823
How's Agent Pierce?

207
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,467
They said he's gonna be okay.

208
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,080
What about you?

209
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,544
I'm not sure.

210
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,676
I still can't believe this happened.

211
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,051
I thought
they were gonna kill all of us.

212
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:25,322
I was...

213
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,567
so scared.

214
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,743
It's over...

215
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,276
and we're safe...

216
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:38,203
thanks to a lot of brave people.

217
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,739
Excuse me, Madam President,
the vice president is on a secure line.

218
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,407
I'll be right there.

219
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,887
Did you mean what you said...

220
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:54,961
about putting the past behind us?

221
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,127
Of course I meant it.

222
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:00,374
I don't ever want to lose you again.

223
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:03,621
You won't.

224
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:50,521
The president's safe, Jack.
She's in the residence. She's secure.

225
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,808
I'm so sorry, Jack.

226
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:59,595
I know that he was your friend.

227
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,275
It was supposed to be me.

228
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,185
I was supposed
to set off the explosion

229
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,760
so that he could secure
the president.

230
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:17,127
He died protecting his country.

231
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,297
Yeah.

232
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,721
This isn't over yet.

233
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,320
Agent Moss...

234
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,624
Juma and his men
were not working alone.

235
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:41,627
- What are you talking about?
- When I was in the lockdown,

236
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:44,042
Bill said he heard
Juma talking on a sat phone.

237
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,570
Said he was getting real-time intel
from someone on the outside.

238
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,903
- Who?
- I don't know.

239
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,266
I don't think this threat is over,
and I don't think the president is safe.

240
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,034
You sure Buchanan heard this right?

241
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,981
He wouldn't have told me
unless he was sure.

242
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:00,504
The only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
He knew about the attack,

243
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,086
and chances are, he's gonna know
who Juma was talking to.

244
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,963
All right, I'll talk to him.

245
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,775
No, the president already offered him
immunity. He turned it down.

246
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,898
He's not gonna tell you anything,

247
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,673
but he will talk to me.

248
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,490
- Why? 'Cause you tortured him?
- I don't need to touch him.

249
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,866
I just need him to think
I'm there to finish what I started.

250
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,770
And I promise you he will tell us
everything we need to know.

251
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,238
Larry, please, the last thing
Bill asked for before he died

252
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:28,320
was for me to follow this through.
I owe him that.

253
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:31,795
Look, I give you my word.
I will not touch Burnett.

254
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,682
Jack, look,
I understand about your friend,

255
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,286
but I got orders from the president
to take you into custody.

256
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,039
I gotta get you back to FBI,
but I promise you I'll look into this.

257
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,332
Agent Powell,

258
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,460
handcuff Mr. Bauer.
Take him down to Staging Area B.

259
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,915
Sir,
put your hands on top of your head.

260
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:50,418
- Don't tell me he's right about this.
- You're not listening to him.

261
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,302
When are you gonna stop
defending this guy?

262
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:55,137
I'm not defending him,
I'm defending a good idea.

263
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,265
I just said I will look into this!

264
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,569
Now do your job:
finish locking down the building.

265
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,369
Agent Reynolds.

266
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,375
- I need to speak with the president.
- She's in a secure location.

267
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,801
- You'll need to go through Ethan Kanin.
- Where is he?

268
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:24,000
He just arrived.
He's on his way to see the president.

269
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,357
Thanks.

270
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:30,716
The president's in the residence with
her daughter. They're in good condition.

271
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,891
Thank God.

272
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:36,828
I want a conference with the SECNAV and
the Joint Chiefs as soon as possible.

273
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,922
We're routing all communications
to the residence,

274
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,900
and we're setting up
a temporary command post.

275
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,817
- Mr. Kanin, I need to speak with you.
- I'm on my way to see the president.

276
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:49,517
I know, sir, but it's extremely urgent.
It'll only take a few moments.

277
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,642
All right.

278
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,733
What is it?

279
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,732
Some new intel has just come to our
attention and we need to act on it now.

280
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,534
I couldn't reach the president.

281
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,286
- I'm listening.
- Sir, the threat may not be over.

282
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,916
We've reason to believe
that General Juma was not acting alone.

283
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,293
Before Bill Buchanan died, he saw
General Juma communicating with someone.

284
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,072
<i>At this point, we can confirm</i>

285
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,273
<i>that FBI agents entered
the White House moments ago,</i>

286
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,797
<i>and there were
reports of sustained gunfire.</i>

287
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,293
<i>It appears that authorities are now
in control of the West Wing,</i>

288
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:25,218
<i>and we are expecting word
from our FBI source</i>

289
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,924
<i>of the status of the hostages.
There has been no official comment...</i>

290
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,525
So what have we got?

291
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,831
The president's alive.

292
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,738
Are you sure?

293
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,110
We've been monitoring
interagency servers.

294
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,744
Word just went out.
Juma's dead, Taylor survived.

295
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,045
What happened do you think?

296
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,833
We don't know any details yet,
but we'll keep monitoring.

297
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:51,738
Well...

298
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,201
you gotta admire the damn bitch.

299
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:57,755
- She doesn't give up easily.
- I'm sorry, sir.

300
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,130
We just didn't have
enough control over the situation.

301
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,933
Greg, you look tense.

302
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,687
Do me a favor.

303
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,815
Have a drink, relax.

304
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,828
Juma held up his part of the bargain.
We're getting what we wanted.

305
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:23,153
As far as I'm concerned,
everything's still on track.

306
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,919
Where are the weapons now?

307
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:30,236
A shipment should be ready for pickup
in the next couple of hours.

308
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,544
Good.
Get Chapman on the phone.

309
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,340
I want to nail down some targets.

310
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,523
The chopper you requested is on its way.
It'll be here in 10 minutes.

311
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,546
You'll be escorting
Mr. Bauer back to FBI.

312
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:58,224
- Hold him in the command center.
- Yes, sir.

313
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,622
- This is Larry Moss.
- This is Ethan Kanin.

314
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,618
I understand
you're taking Jack Bauer back to FBI?

315
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:10,375
Yes. He's gonna be debriefed
and remanded into federal custody.

316
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,256
- I want you to put that on hold.
- Sir?

317
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:15,255
I just spoke with Agent Walker.

318
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:18,550
<i>She told me Juma may have been working
with someone on the outside,</i>

319
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,803
<i>and that there may be
an ongoing threat to the president.</i>

320
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,610
Yes, that's true.

321
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,804
I want you to send Jack Bauer
to question Ryan Burnett.

322
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,370
Agent Moss?

323
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,409
Sir, I think that's a mistake.

324
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:37,133
Yes, Agent Walker
shared your concerns with me,

325
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,977
<i>and I've given this some thought.</i>

326
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,363
<i>If Burnett does know</i>

327
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,774
who Juma was working with,

328
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:44,784
Bauer's approach may be our best chance
to get that information.

329
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,705
With respect, sir,
Bauer almost killed this man.

330
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,423
<i>I was there, Agent Moss,</i>

331
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,250
but this will be
a controlled interrogation.

332
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:55,033
<i>We're gonna play on Burnett's fears.</i>

333
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:58,284
Bauer's presence alone should be enough
to intimidate him into talking.

334
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,636
<i>Bauer is a wild card.</i>

335
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,255
We have no idea what he'll do
when he gets in the room with Burnett.

336
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,866
<i>I realize there's a risk.</i>

337
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:08,062
That's why you're going to do this under
my authority and my authority alone.

338
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:10,686
You're not taking this
to the president?

339
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,508
If something does go wrong,

340
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:16,107
I want to make sure
the president is protected.

341
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,260
I think you're not telling the president
because you know she'd never allow this.

342
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:22,764
You've made your objections clear,
Agent Moss.

343
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,339
I'm not going
to debate this with you.

344
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,960
I want you to take Bauer
to question Burnett.

345
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,787
That's a direct order.
Do you understand?

346
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,122
I understand.

347
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:35,416
<i>And I'm counting on you to supervise
every second of that interrogation.</i>

348
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,795
I'll expect a full report
as soon as you're done.

349
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Yes, sir.

350
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:47,626
I want to speak personally
to the families

351
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,836
of everyone we lost tonight, so...

352
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,775
keep me informed
as they're notified.

353
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,623
Absolutely, Madam President.

354
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,080
And the minute Angela Nelson gets here,
send her straight up to me.

355
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:00,026
We need to start working on the...

356
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,920
speech to the country.

357
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,899
Of course, Madam President.

358
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,111
Patrick,

359
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,576
you have just been through
a terrible ordeal.

360
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,116
Are you sure you're okay?

361
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:16,054
I'll be fine.

362
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,806
It helps to focus on work.

363
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:20,998
I understand.

364
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,692
Thank you, Patrick.

365
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,617
Thank God you're all right.

366
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,615
How you feeling?

367
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,422
Like I just woke up
from a nightmare.

368
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,444
It was unbelievable, Ethan.

369
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,269
I can't even imagine it.

370
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:48,408
How's Olivia?

371
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,327
She's shaken up,
but she's going to be okay.

372
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:52,912
I'm glad to hear it.

373
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,998
We lost some good people
tonight, Ethan.

374
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,709
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

375
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,170
I'm thinking about
bringing Olivia on

376
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,134
as a special advisor.

377
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:07,337
Madam President,
I can understand your not wanting

378
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:10,013
to be separated from your daughter
after what's happened.

379
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,868
Especially after what's happened,
we need people who can do the job.

380
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,167
I'm not disputing
Olivia's competence,

381
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,771
but she's also
a political liability.

382
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:21,469
Nobody's forgotten
what she did during the campaign,

383
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:25,028
leaking damaging personal information
about your opponent to the press.

384
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,030
Olivia knows what she did was wrong.

385
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,991
- She almost cost you the election.
- She's changed.

386
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,410
We talked about it, Ethan,

387
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,662
and she is accepting
full responsibility.

388
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,078
She has learned from her mistakes.

389
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:41,398
I'm willing to put the past behind us
so we can move ahead.

390
00:23:41,523 --> 00:23:44,797
- I still think it's a mistake.
- I don't care what you think!

391
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:53,890
I am so sorry, Ethan.

392
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,009
You know I don't mean that.

393
00:23:57,107 --> 00:23:58,857
But I've made up my mind.

394
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,355
I want Olivia to join
my administration.

395
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:04,676
And I want it to come from you.

396
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,523
Me?

397
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,821
Your offering her
this position would be

398
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,209
a good way to extend
an olive branch.

399
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:15,265
I need the two of you

400
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:16,846
to make peace.

401
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,086
All right, Madam President.

402
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:23,127
I'll talk to her.

403
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:24,768
Thank you, Ethan.

404
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:29,217
I understand Agent Walker
was trying to reach me.

405
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,655
- That's right, but I spoke to her.
- What did she want?

406
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,099
Just some procedural matters,
Madam President. I took care of it.

407
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:07,842
Larry, you wanted to see me?

408
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,971
I just got off the phone
with Ethan Kanin.

409
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:22,645
I didn't want to go behind your back,
you didn't leave me any choice.

410
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,250
I didn't leave you a...?

411
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,149
How about you choose
to follow orders?

412
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:29,111
- I'm sorry, Larry.
- No. I don't think you are.

413
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,562
I've seen Jack
do some terrible things today.

414
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:36,104
Things that I still can't justify.
But he has been right every time.

415
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:37,873
And I can't help
but think that maybe

416
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:40,413
if we had stayed out of his way,
none of this would have happened.

417
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,332
I am sorry

418
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,784
that I went behind your back,
but I promise you

419
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:48,713
this play with Burnett will go down
just the way Jack says.

420
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:54,343
If you think you're going with Bauer,
you are out of your mind.

421
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:58,848
You may have gotten a White House order,
but I'm still running this operation.

422
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:01,559
I'll take Bauer to see Burnett.

423
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,364
You're going back to FBI.

424
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:07,631
I want you to clean out your office
and hand in your badge.

425
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,781
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

426
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,657
I know that you're upset, Larry,

427
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,697
but this isn't over.
You're going to need me.

428
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:18,542
What I need are people that I can trust.
I thought that was you.

429
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,986
You may think you got what you wanted,
getting Renee to go behind my back,

430
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:49,981
but Ethan Kanin ordered me
to let you question Burnett.

431
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,903
I'm gonna be watching you. You do
one thing I don't like, you're finished.

432
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,322
- You understand me?
- Understood.

433
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,747
You should leave Renee out of this.

434
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:03,037
She was just doing
what she thought was right.

435
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:06,314
- She may lose her job over it.
- She's the best agent you've got.

436
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:09,590
She circumvented my authority.
I can't just ignore that.

437
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,136
I've known this woman
for nine years,

438
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:15,633
and I've never seen her do the things
she's done in the last nine hours.

439
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:41,409
We've narrowed the list down to 12
targets along the eastern seaboard.

440
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,452
They're all within
300 km of the base.

441
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,787
How many people?

442
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,039
10,000 to 15,000
in each target zone.

443
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:49,130
And our kill ratio would be what?

444
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:52,104
Well, we've chosen these areas
for maximum population density,

445
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,213
so the ratio could be
as high as 80%.

446
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,424
Let's hope we never have
to find out.

447
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,218
Get these coordinates down
to the boys in Tac-Ops.

448
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,012
Have them start programming them in.

449
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,180
Yes, sir.

450
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,670
We just intercepted
a flash memo from the FBI.

451
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,942
Jack Bauer is on his way to Kennedy
Memorial Hospital to question Burnett.

452
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,236
Bauer was arrested.
How is this possible?

453
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:20,902
There was an executive order
from the White House

454
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:23,077
giving Bauer access to Burnett.

455
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:26,412
Bauer will finish what he started.
Burnett will tell him everything.

456
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,538
No, he won't.

457
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:31,083
I have already sent somebody
to the hospital to deal with Burnett.

458
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,878
He can take care of Bauer
at the same time.

459
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,578
- Who did you send?
- Quinn.

460
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,370
Quinn's good.

461
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,291
Bauer's good, too.

462
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:44,805
Agent Moss,
we've locked down the entire floor.

463
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,604
We equipped Burnett's room
with two cameras and audio surveillance.

464
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:49,856
- Where is he?
- Down the hall.

465
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:52,332
It's going to be a moment.
Doctor has to revive him.

466
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:53,856
Why? What happened?

467
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,984
He was given a heavy sedative.
He was in bad shape when he got here.

468
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:58,865
Dr. Wyndam,

469
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,087
Special Agent Larry Moss,
Jack Bauer.

470
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:03,806
- You're here to interrogate my patient?
- That's right.

471
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,462
He's still recovering, so if you're here
to brutalize him again,

472
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:07,747
I won't be party to it.

473
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,470
Your patient was involved in a terrorist
attack against the White House

474
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,629
in an effort to kill
the President of the US,

475
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:15,114
and I believe the people
he's working with want to try it again,

476
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,530
- so if you've got a problem...
- We won't harm him, Doctor.

477
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,300
This will be a controlled interrogation.
Please, we need your cooperation.

478
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:29,277
It's going to take him
a couple of minutes to come out of it.

479
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,011
Who are you?

480
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:14,353
I'm a friend.

481
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,364
- What's your name?
- Robert.

482
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:17,949
- Robert?
- Yeah.

483
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:20,092
You're recovering
from heart surgery?

484
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,217
Yeah.

485
00:30:22,094 --> 00:30:23,487
Do you have a wife, Robert?

486
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,366
- No. She passed away.
- Children? Grandchildren?

487
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:28,655
No.

488
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:34,505
What about this man?
Does he have family?

489
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:36,497
Yeah.

490
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,877
Lots of grandkids.

491
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:40,463
Make a hell of a noise
when they visit.

492
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,786
How's your arm?

493
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,662
I should be back on my feet
in a couple of hours. And you, ma'am?

494
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,624
It's nothing a little aspirin
won't take care of.

495
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,294
Thank you for what you did.

496
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,798
You took a bullet for me.
You saved my life.

497
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,308
There is no need to thank me, ma'am.

498
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:34,637
Right, you were just doing your job.

499
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,224
Only in this case,
it wasn't really your job

500
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,849
- since you retired 4 years ago.
- Yes, ma'am, that's true.

501
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,604
Do you mind if I ask you why?

502
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,926
Did it have to do with Martha Logan?

503
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,055
Martha and I were... close.

504
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:59,188
- It must have been hard for you.
- I'd prefer not to talk about it.

505
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,313
I'm sorry.

506
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:03,546
You don't have to apologize.

507
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,296
I hope you won't be a stranger,
Agent Pierce.

508
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,464
Thank you.

509
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,750
And...

510
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:14,894
it's Aaron.

511
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:18,847
Okay, Aaron.

512
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,336
You get some rest.

513
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:26,686
I'd like to head back
to the residence now if that's okay?

514
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:28,023
Olivia...

515
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,824
I was just coming to see you.

516
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:34,223
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

517
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,865
Do you have a moment to talk?

518
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,033
Sure.

519
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,378
The blunt fact of the matter is...

520
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,655
this administration
has just suffered some terrible losses,

521
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:55,384
and we need help.

522
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:59,054
The president and I would like you
to consider coming on board

523
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,056
as special advisor to the president.

524
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,250
I...

525
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:09,481
I have to say
I'm a little surprised.

526
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,859
- Surprised?
- That you'd sign off on this.

527
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:16,035
You mother said she's ready
to put the past behind her...

528
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:17,473
and so am I.

529
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:23,036
I overstepped my bounds
during the campaign, and I was wrong.

530
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,436
I'm glad you see it that way.

531
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:28,000
But it's not the past
that concerns me, Ethan.

532
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:33,005
It's what's happening
ever since my mother took office.

533
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:36,258
Excuse me?

534
00:35:36,563 --> 00:35:39,636
Do you think this would have happened
if my mother had a chief advisor

535
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,590
who knew what the hell was going on
in her administration?

536
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:44,099
What are you talking about?

537
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,595
Her government was corrupted
on every level,

538
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,979
and it all happened
right under your nose.

539
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,086
Even you have to admit,

540
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,484
it's an unconscionable failure
on your part.

541
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:59,072
Frankly, I'm surprised
you haven't tendered your resignation.

542
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:03,035
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

543
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,829
You don't know
what you're talking about.

544
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,664
You don't have the facts.

545
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,958
I intend to get the facts.

546
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,061
I'm going to find out who failed her,
and I am going to make sure

547
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:18,486
that that person
never is in a position to do it again.

548
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,247
Excuse me.

549
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:44,062
Okay, let's go.

550
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,206
I'll be watching.
You lay one finger on him, it's over.

551
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:53,937
Right.

552
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,935
- He's coming around.
- Good.

553
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:44,471
<i>Wake up.</i>

554
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:47,123
Wake up.

555
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,896
Remember me?

556
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:58,686
Oh, my God.

557
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,823
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I've just come from the White House.

558
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:06,450
Juma's attack failed.

559
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:10,562
He's dead, and so are his men.
A lot of innocent people died today.

560
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:14,583
Good people. Including a friend of mine.
Bill Buchanan. You might have met him.

561
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:18,927
You stay the hell away from me.
I want to talk to a lawyer right now.

562
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,624
<i>I want to talk to a lawyer!
Somebody get me the hell out of here!</i>

563
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:24,051
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

564
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,061
<i>It's just you and me, pal.</i>

565
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:28,811
<i>Did you really think
you were going to get away with it?</i>

566
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,807
Somebody please, help me!

567
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,311
<i>You're wasting your breath.
They're not coming for you.</i>

568
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,563
Please don't hurt me.
I'll tell you anything you want.

569
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,900
Do you hear that? I'm ready to talk.
I'll tell you anything

570
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,402
<i>you want to know!
Just get him out of here!</i>

571
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,696
<i>- I'm ready to talk!
- They're done talking to you.</i>

572
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,247
That's why they sent me.

573
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:48,617
Please, you can't do this!
You have no right!

574
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,135
<i>This isn't legal!</i>

575
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,247
- What happened?
- I don't know.

576
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,541
Looks like we lost the sound feed.
Give me a second.

577
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:02,381
There are no laws in here, Mr. Burnett.
You aided and abetted terrorists,

578
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,437
<i>who then tried to kill
the President.</i>

579
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:06,662
Now you have to answer for that.

580
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,707
The rules don't apply
to you anymore.

581
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:12,054
No, please, you can't let him touch me!
Please, you can't let him do this!

582
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,016
Shut up!

583
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:19,443
It could be a glitch
in the trunk line.

584
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:18,790
- Damn it, fix the thing!
- I'm trying, sir.

585
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,735
- He jammed the electronic bolt.
- Is there another way in?

586
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:52,199
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

587
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:17,307
Have security
lock down the hospital.

588
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:21,542
I want a high-priority APB
issued for Jack Bauer. All agencies.

589
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,660
- It's done.
- Good. Thank you.

590
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,484
It's done.

591
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:05,856
- Burnett's dead.
- And Bauer?

592
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,798
They'll think he killed Burnett.

593
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,228
So, nobody will know
that we were involved.

594
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:12,696
Good.

595
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,887
Now we're having some fun.

596
00:42:20,024 --> 00:42:22,414
- Agent Moss.
- Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.

597
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,804
- Where are you?
- I didn't kill Burnett.

598
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:26,379
- I'm being set up.
- Set up?

599
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,523
A man released some kind of nerve agent
into the room. It immobilized me.

600
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:33,467
He came through the ceiling
and killed Burnett. I'm not lying.

601
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:36,678
- Get back in here, we'll work this out.
- I can't, you know that.

602
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,842
- You can if you're innocent.
- There is a reason

603
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,599
why they framed me
and didn't kill me.

604
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,398
They want you to be focused on me
so they can finish what they started.

605
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:47,314
Don't let them get away with this.
This threat is not over.

606
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:55,864
Damn it!
