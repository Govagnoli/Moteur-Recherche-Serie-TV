00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,367
Begin the
launch countdown.

4
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:18,801
How much time
do you need to cancel

5
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,367
the launch sequence?
I won't know for
certain till I see

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,801
how the targeting
software is configured.

7
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,667
We're going to keep Bierko
and his men out of here,

8
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,134
so you can finish this.

9
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,433

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,634

<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

( <i>computer beeping</i> )

12
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,701
It's done.

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,234
( <i>over radio</i> ):
The launch sequence is canceled.

14
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:40,434
You were never really
going to let me go, were you?

15
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,668
JACK:
<i>No.</i>

16
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:43,867
( <i>gun clicks</i> )

17
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,601
You were responsible
for the deaths

18
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:48,668
of David Palmer
and Tony Almeida

19
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,200
and Michelle Dessler.

20
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,167
I'm going after Logan.

21
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,301
What do you mean,
"going after Logan"?

22
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,234
<i>I'll fill you in</i>
<i>on the details later.</i>

23
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,634
Right now, I need you
to walk me through

24
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,534
modifying some field
communications equipment.

25
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,900
Who is this guy?
Morris O'Brian,
Chloe's ex-husband.

26
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:06,167
I need some com unit
modifications.

27
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,534
Can you do that
without talking?

28
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,334
I could, but it would be
a terrible waste of my charm.

29
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,234
Jack Bauer's on
his way here now.

30
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,867
<i>He's going to confront</i>
<i>your husband directly.</i>

31
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,367
But Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

32
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:20,567
You have to find
a way to stall him.

33
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:23,100
There's a helicopter
waiting for me.

34
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,000
Let it wait.
I can't.

35
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,067
Yes, you can.

36
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,301
You're the president.

37
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:32,768
Aaron said
the recording you had

38
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,900
implicating the president
was destroyed.

39
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,401
Yes.

40
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,067
NOVICK:
<i>Without it, you can't</i>
<i>mount a case.</i>

41
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:39,534
I'm working with someone
inside CTU.

42
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,000
They're setting up
a digital uplink.

43
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,234
If I can get Logan
to acknowledge

44
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,467
everything that he's done today,

45
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,867
it's going to be
all the evidence we need.

46
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,933
<i>I need to get on that chopper.</i>

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,501
PIERCE:
<i>I don't see how that's</i>
<i>gonna be possible.</i>

48
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,100
If Logan doesn't confess,

49
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,234
how far are you actually
willing to go?

50
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,501
As far as I have to.

51
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,167
Ah...

52
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,567
Here, let me get
this for you.

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,567
Watch your hair.

54
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,234
Thank you.

55
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,434
You're welcome.

56
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:29,668
I got a flight suit.

57
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:30,768
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,267
Go ahead.

59
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:37,567
Did you make it to the
Secret Service outbuilding?

60
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:38,634
Yeah.

61
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,134
I think Morris and I
may have a way

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,401
to pull the copilot
from the flight.

63
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,234
What about the
reassignment protocol?

64
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,501
Working on it.

65
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,768
Mike Novick will have
to verify the pilot codes.

66
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,200
It should take him
about one minute.

67
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,234
Chloe, hold on
a second.

68
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,668
I'm switching over
to com.
Okay.

69
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,134
Do you copy?

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,634
Yeah.

71
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll get back to you as soon
as I'm on the chopper.

72
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,067
Mike Novick's
going to call.

73
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,100
Morris.

74
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,933
Yes, sweetheart?

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,167
I need you to do
one more thing.

76
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,833
Some guy from Central
just called.

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,867
Says your packet's
messed up.

78
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,234
I got that
straightened out Monday.

79
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,367
I guess not.

80
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,800
He wants to
talk to you.
Now?

81
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,501
Right now. He had
me patch you through

82
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,401
to the Secret
Service outbuilding.

83
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,067
Mike.

84
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,634
I've delayed him
as long as I can.

85
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,867
He'll be there in a few minutes.

86
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,467
Have you heard anything
from Jack Bauer yet?

87
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:49,833
He should be in
the Secret Service

88
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,167
outbuilding. I'm sending him
the necessary documents now.

89
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,800
There's not much time.

90
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,067
I understand.

91
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,734
( <i>dialing</i> )

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,334
PIERCE:
Yeah, Mike.
The reassignment protocol

93
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,467
and authorization
should be coming through to you.

94
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:12,601
He'll need both.

95
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:13,967
How are we
doing for time?

96
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,034
Hurry.

97
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,301
Hello.

98
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,434
Hello.

99
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,933
John.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,334
Aaron.

101
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,367
I thought you transferred out.

102
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,601
Not quite yet.

103
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,900
Some guy from
Central called,

104
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,534
said my packet's
all messed...

105
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,234
( <i>groaning</i> )

106
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,134
Don't worry
about him.

107
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:50,200
Carruth has been relieved.

108
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,167
I guess there was something
wrong with his packet.

109
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:55,467
Ron Franklin.

110
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:56,967
There's my protocol.

111
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,067
This is not bad,

112
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,200
but it needs to
be more positive,

113
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:13,401
like, uh...

114
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,634
Jack Bauer is
on the helicopter.

115
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,301
You have to find an excuse

116
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,401
not to get on board.

Charles?

119
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,000
Excuse me. Could
I talk to you

120
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,967
for a second?
Absolutely.

121
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,434
Will you excuse us
for a second?

122
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,867
I know it sounds silly,

123
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,134
but I didn't bring
my medication.

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,401
and I just, I just want
to have it with me.

125
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,634
Of course. Of course.
We'll send

126
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:41,067
somebody
back for it.
No, no, no.

127
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,701
I don't want to delay you.

128
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,167
I'll be along later.
Besides, Charles,

129
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,567
I-I'm thinking that
when you land,

130
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,567
it would be better

131
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:48,567
if I wasn't with you.

132
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:49,501
Why?

133
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,134
This is <i>your</i> moment, Charles.

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,034
I-I think that...

135
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,634
when you step out
of that helicopter alone,

136
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,034
after saving the country,

137
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,334
that is an image that
history will never forget.

138
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,601
All right.

139
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,601
Thank you, Marti.

140
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,234
But don't be

141
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,267
far behind me, now.

142
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,501
I won't.

143
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you.

144
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,134
Captain.

145
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,768
I can fly this thing
if I have to,

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,367
which leaves you
with one of two choices.

147
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:25,234
You either do what I say and you
live, or you don't

148
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:28,601
and you die for nothing.
You understand me?

149
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:32,267
I want you to wait until
I give you my command, then

150
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,501
follow these
instructions slowly.

151
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,234
You're going to disconnect
your helmet from

152
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,734
the communications system.
Then I want you

153
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,967
to rip out the mic cable,

154
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,467
take your helmet off
and stow it.

155
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,167
Do it now.

156
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,100
I'll know if you deviate
from your flight plan.

157
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,668
Mr. President!

158
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,967

I'm here, Jack.
Where are you?

165
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:21,234
We just left the ranch.
I have Logan with me.

166
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,067
Is Morris standing by
with the equipment?

167
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:25,000
He's on his way. I'll
let him know you're airborne.

168
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,501
Make sure the pilot
takes heading 2-8-6

169
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,933
for two miles,
then breaks south.

170

I want you to follow
heading 2-8-6

172

for two miles,
then break south.

173
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,134
Once you break south, there
should be an industrial park.

There's an abandoned
printing press facility

175

00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:40,734
I'll get back to you.

177
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,734

Are you going to kill me?

182
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,367
I suppose you want
some sort of revenge.

183
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,167
I understand that.

184
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,134
Bad things happened.

185
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,933

that they thought

188

I wanted them to do,
but they were wrong.

and now the President
is being attacked.

to do what's right,

thing around and go back.

I know that you're good

far behind, Jack.

There's still time to get away.
Take it.

276
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,601
The plan involving the Sentox
nerve gas,

277
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,967
it was designed
to fool the terrorists
and the Russians.

278
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:28,467
Whether or not you formulated
the plan is irrelevant.

279
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,134
You authorized it.
You're delusional.

David Palmer uncovered
evidence of this plan.

When he started
asking questions,
he was assassinated.

282

Other people were killed
to cover that murder up.

283
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,867
Men and women who served this
country with distinction;

284
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,501
people that I worked with;
friends of mine.

No, you're wrong.

This is all a pack of lies.

The terrorists discovered
your deception.

288
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:51,100
And they deployed
Sentox nerve gas
on American soil.

Every American
who died today

290

as a result
of terrorist activity

291
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:59,167
is another murder that
you're accountable for.

292
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:01,867
And before you leave here,
you're going to admit it.

293
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,668
I suppose if you hurt me
enough, Jack,

294
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,534
I'll say whatever you want,

295
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,201
but that won't make it
the truth.

296
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:14,501
And everybody who watches this
will know that perfectly well.

297
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,867
What are the names
of your co-conspirators?

298
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,967
There are no co-conspirators,
because there is no...

have all admitted

to being part
of this conspiracy!

303
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,668
Now they are dead!

304
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,434
Right before
Christopher Henderson died

305
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:29,900
he acknowledged that
there were others!

306
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:31,700
What are their names?!

307
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,867
A man will say anything
under torture.

308
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,668
This won't mean a thing.

309
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,934
Mr. Logan, I'm not going
to torture you,

310
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but you are going
to tell me what
I want to know.

311
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,733
Or so help me God,

312
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,434
I will kill you.

313
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,201
A year and a half ago,

314
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,434
I was warned
that my life was in danger

315
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:17,534
by someone within
the government.

316
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,100
I was told the only
way I could stay alive

317
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,767
was to create the illusion
that I was dead.

318
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,934
I was forced to deceive
people that I loved.

319
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,833
My only daughter
will never forgive me.

320
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,967
As I see the depth
of your corruption unfold,

321
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:40,000
I have no doubt
that you are that
source of danger.

322
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,733
David Palmer
was a great man.

323
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,367
And he was
a great president.

324
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:47,568
He was also my friend.

325
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,067
He tried to warn me
about you

326
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,733
and now he is dead.

327
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,067
Other people tried
to help me

328
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:54,301
and they are dead, too.

329
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:59,167
So, Mr. Logan, I hope
you understand

330
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:02,467
I have absolutely
nothing to lose.

331
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:04,867
You are going
to be held accountable

332
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,967
for your part
of everything that
happened today.

333
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:09,167
You are not going to be able
to hide behind the presidency.

334
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,733
Right here, right now,

335
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,201
you are going
to face justice!

336
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,534
And make no mistake
about this, this
is personal.

337
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,034
And if you think
for a second

338
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,601
that I am scared
to put a bullet
in your brain,

339
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:22,034
you don't know me.

340
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,967
I'm going to ask you
one last time,

341
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:32,534
who are your
co-conspirators?

342
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:35,301
You have until
the count of three,

343
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,301
or I will kill you.

344
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,000
One...

345
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,301
You make me a martyr, I'll go
down in history with Lincoln

346
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,267
and Kennedy, but you'll go down
with John Wilkes Booth

347
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,034
and Lee Harvey Oswald.
Is that what you want?

348
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,833
Two!

United States

in front
of the entire world?

If you love your country,
you won't pull the trigger.

00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,634
It's all right that you can't.

359
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,934
I'm the president.

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,934
Jack, they're here.

361
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,934
AGENT:
Lay flat on your stomach!

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,634
Put your hands
out in front of you!

363
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,201
Extend your arms!

364
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:18,967
Mr. President,
are you all right?

365
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,501
I'm fine.

366
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:22,167
I actually feel sorry
for that man.

367
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,934
He's delusional.

368
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,234
It would be better
if he were put

369
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:27,634
in some sort
of solitary confinement

370
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,800
for the time being.

371
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:16,734
Jack Bauer

372
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,234
wasn't able to get
the President to confess,

373
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,367
Mrs. Logan.

374
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,467
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,433
Why not?
What happened?

376
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm not sure
of the details.

377
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:28,001
Bauer's in custody.

378
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,300
Gentlemen.

379
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:54,834
Thank you.

380
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,667
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

381
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,834
That will be all.
Thank you so much.

382
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,034
If I could just get you

383
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,967
to come this way. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

Marti, don't
do this to me now.
You killed him.

00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,134
You killed him.

390
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,433
You're a murderer.
Stop.

391
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,400
You are!
You're a criminal!

392
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:18,400
My wife is not well.

393
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:20,567
Would you please
escort her?
Get off me!

394
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,333
Don't you touch me!

395
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,934
Don't you touch me!
Escort her into
the hangar, please.

396
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,801
You don't know what he did!
He's not fit to be president!

397
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:31,567
It is a sacrilege for him to be
even speaking David's name!

398
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,634
Don't...!

399
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,867
No!

400
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,801
I want to make sure
that she's all right.

401
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:44,967
Has the hangar
been cleared?

402
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:46,367
Yes, sir.
All secure.

403
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,034
It's empty.
Good.

404
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:50,300
Let them know that
I'll be back in a moment.

405
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,934

You're not wearing some kind
of listening device, are you?

00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,600
What are you
talking about?

409
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:10,500
I have to watch you
now, Marti.

410
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,101
You said that
I was a good liar,

411
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,734
but I am nothing
compared to you.

412
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,567

00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:17,734
Stop it!

Charles...
Aah!
Yeah, Marti.

415
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,700
Tell me the truth.

416
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,101
You're hurting me.

417
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,034
You don't know
what pain is.

418
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,168
I'm on to you, Marti.

419
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:39,300
I should've seen it
from the first,

420
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,067
but I wanted to believe
that you still cared for me.

421
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:46,534
Making love to me was
just a ploy, wasn't it?

422
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,168
Took a lot of planning

423
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:52,067
to get Jack Bauer
on that helicopter.

424
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:53,801
You were part of
that plan, weren't you?

425
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,400
It was your job
to delay me, wasn't it?

426
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,600
Wasn't it?!

427
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,234
Please...

428
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,268
Wasn't it?!

429
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,400
They used you

430
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,500
so Jack Bauer
could get to me.

431
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,534
Come on, Marti.
Come on, Marti.

432
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,034
Admit it,
you were part of it.

433
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:11,467
Yes. Yes.

434
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Why?

435
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,001
Why...?

436
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,467
Why did you help them?

437
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:22,901
Because you killed
David Palmer.

438
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,300
I told you I didn't realize
that was going to happen.

439
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,667
Your people killed him
to protect you.

440
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,367
You covered it up,
that's just as bad.

441
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,500
I covered it up
because I had to.

442
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,433
Oh, and then others
died to cover that up.

443
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,134
That's right, for
the good of the country.

444
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,801
You sold nerve gas
to terrorists.

445
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,901
You're insane.

446
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,600
You're insane!
I did it

447
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,034
for the good of the country
as I saw it at the time.

448
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,801
You're such a hypocrite.

449
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,834
After your little
performance this morning,

450
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,634
you're in no position
to call me a hypocrite.

451
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,634
And I will tell you
something else--

452
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,034
if you blow up like this
one more time...

453
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:07,101
I will fill you
so full of drugs,

454
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,433
you won't even remember
your own name.

455
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,867
And then I will ship you
off to an asylum

456
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,767
and you can stay there
for the rest of your life.

457
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:19,534
Are we clear?

458
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,300
Are we clear?

459
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,366
My fellow Americans,

460
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,833
this has been a terrible day
in the history of this country--

461
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,133
and yet at the same time,
a triumphant day,

462
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:44,366
because in the end,
we won a significant victory

463
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:48,733
over the forces of chaos
and terror.

464
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,900
We have preserved and protected
our way of life,

465
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:55,233
despite the loss
of innocent American lives.

466
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,633
I'll start the transmission

467
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,767
in one minute.
Is the Attorney General there?

468
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,733
I'm here, Ms. O'Brian.
I certainly hope

469
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,633
this recording is as important
as you claim it is.

470
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,833
Chloe, what's this about?

471
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,767
I set up
a conference call with

472
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,366
the Attorney General.
He's on speakerphone now.

473
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,433
Are you serious?

474
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,667
I'm very serious.

475
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,600
Mr. Attorney General,
this is Karen Hayes,

476
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,934
Homeland Security.
Bill Buchanan, CTU.

477
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,099
Sir, I apologize. Ms. O'Brian
placed this call without

478
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,133
authorization from me.
I'm sorry I had to do that.

479
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,633
We had to do things
under the radar

480
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,767
to protect you all in case
things went wrong.

481
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,366
In case what things
went wrong?

482
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,900
I think it would help
if I just played the recording.

483
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,333
HAYES:
What recording?

484
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,934
It's a conversation that took
place five minutes ago

485
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,166
between the President
and his wife.

486
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:38,433
How could you

487
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,199
possibly have a recording
of something like that?

488
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,500
Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer
placed a listening device

489
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,934
on the President shortly
before this conversation.

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,633
Bauer? Isn't he the one
that's under arrest?

491
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,600
CHLOE:
I'm going to play
the recording now.

492
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,133
I don't want
to listen to it.

493
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,199
Ms. O'Brian, at the very least,
this constitutes

494
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,166
an egregious violation
of privacy,

495
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,800
and we're talking about
the President.

You're insane.
You're insane!

A poet once said,
"No man is an island."

506
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,366
On a day like this, we can feel
the truth of those words.

507
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,500
Any untimely death is a tragedy.

508
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:35,433
Yet some men embody such
greatness of character

509
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,900
that their death
serves as a unifying force

510
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:42,533
for those who remain behind.

511
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,034
David Palmer was such a man.

512
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,400
A great President,
a great American--

513
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:55,500
and on a more personal note--
a wonderful friend.

514
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:57,800
He'll be missed...

We take this moment to
remember with appreciation...

With all due respect,
Mr. Attorney General,

519
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,533
are you sure this isn't
some kind of mistake?

520
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,967
Yes, sir.

521
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,233
I understand, sir.

522
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,700
I'll do exactly as you say.

523
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:20,066
LOGAN:
...combination of wisdom,
strength and moral courage,

524
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:24,567
this country might have not
survived in its present form.

525
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,500
It's very appropriate that David
Palmer will be laid to rest

526
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,800
in Arlington Cemetery,

527
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:41,433
for he was a soldier
in the truest sense.

528
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:46,500
He was a man whose courage rose
in direct proportion

529
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,900
to the threats
his country faced.

530
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,567
In closing, I would ask
that the country

531
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,034
observe a national day
of mourning

532
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,066
for one of
the greatest Americans

533
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,400
this nation will ever see.

534
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:12,133
Thank you very much.

535
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,266
( <i>applause</i> )

536
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,833
( <i>mouthing</i> )

537
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,133
Federal marshall.
Would you please
come with us?

538
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,867
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

539
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,767
You came very close
to disrupting my speech.

540
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,567
BROWN:
On behalf of President Logan,

541
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:30,433
I wish to thank you all
very much for joining us.

542
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,433
I am sorry, but out of respect
for today's...

543
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,600
Those are ridiculous
accusations.

544
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:40,333
Excuse me.
If I may, sir?

545
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,800
You've probably never seen
one of these, Mr. President.

546
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,900
It's a micro-transmitter.

547
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,333
Agent Clark, arrest these men

548
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
and get them the hell
out of here.

549
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,667
I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

550
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,700
We have our orders.

551
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,500
You take...!

552
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,066
You take your orders
from me.

553
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,833
Not anymore.

554
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,900
After you, sir.

555
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,533
OFFICER:
Attention!

556
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,900
Aim, fire!

557
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:57,833
( <i>rifles firing</i> )

558
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,767
OFFICER:
Attention!

559
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,000
Aim,

560
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,133
fire!

561
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:05,633
Attention!

562
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,533
Aim,

563

Present arms.

565
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,934
Sir.

566
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,733
Give me a second.

567
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,900
Hey.

568
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,833
Hey.

569
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,133
Thank God you're safe.

570
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,233
Everything's going
to be all right.

571
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,000
Jack, when I heard
you kidnapped the
President...

572
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:19,300
I was just trying
to get him to give me
a direct confession.

573
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,366
Jack...

574
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,633
How much longer
do you need to stay here?

575
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,967
Not much longer. They can
debrief me tomorrow.

576
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:34,400
You sure?

577
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,500
I can't believe
you're really,

578
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,700
you're really here.

579
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,567
Agent Bauer,

580
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,533
excuse me, but there's
a call for you

581
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,533
from your daughter.

582
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,833
From my daughter?

583
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,300
Yes, sir. A Kim Bauer.
It's been put through

584
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,199
to a land line
just inside that door.

585
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,700
Thank you.

586
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,533
I'll be right back.
I promise.

587
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,800
Take as long
as you need.

588
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,199
I'm not going anywhere.

589
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,533
I love you.

590
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,667
I'll be right back.

591
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,867
Hey, Kim?

592
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,100
Any word on Logan?

593
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:16,733
No. My guess
is he'll try
to cut a deal.

594
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,334
He'll resign
without a fight

595
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,100
in exchange for clemency.

596
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,501
He doesn't deserve clemency.

597
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,933
No, but the country
doesn't deserve

598
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,033
a long impeachment
process, either,

599
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,033
with everything
that's happened.

600
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,501
In any event, we can expect

601
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:33,167
Hal Gordon to be sworn in
as president soon.

602
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,100
Which means this
will probably be
the last time

603
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,100
I see this place.

604
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,833
I don't think so.

605
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,766
Not if I have anything
to do with it,

606
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:40,766
and I will.

607
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:44,700
You'll be back here
running CTU.

608
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,666
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

609
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:51,300
When I came in here
last night to save the day,

610
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:54,467
I was a little bit
condescending and tactless,

611
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:57,300
to say the least.

612
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,900
I had no idea
what you were up against.

613
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,967
I'm sorry.

614
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,200
No. No need to apologize.

615
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,467
Mistakes were made.

616
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:07,601
You were right to come
in with a firm hand.

617
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,933
Well, I better go.

618
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Karen.

619
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:18,267
I was thinking
of getting some breakfast

620
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,766
before going home.

621
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:23,534
I have to go over to Division
for one last briefing.

622
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:24,700
Bureaucracy.

623
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,234
Rain check?

624
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,601
Sure.

625
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,766
Chloe,

626
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,800
really good work today.

627
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,534
You, too.

628
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,567
I found this
in Edgar's possessions.

629
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,833
I thought you should
have it.

630
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,067
Thanks.

631

( <i>sniffles</i> )

632
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:30,534
Hey.

633
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,067
What's all
this, then?

634
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,501
A friend of mine
who died today.

635
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,033
You, um, do you
want to talk about it?

636
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,200
Yeah? Come on.

637
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,400
Jack?

638
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:14,334
Oh, my God.

639
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,867
Agent Davis,
Jack Bauer's missing!

640
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,334
Attention, all units.

641
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,833
We have a missing agent:
Jack Bauer.

642
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,534
I repeat, we have
a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

643
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,100
...the lower level.

644
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,501
Put three men
on perimeter search.

645
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,334
Report back.

( <i>Jack grunts</i> )

647
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,300
You surely must
be aware, Mr. Bauer,

648
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,534
that China has a long memory.

649
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:17,567
Only 18 months ago,

650
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,534
you invaded
our territory

651
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,300
and killed our consul.

652
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,467
Did you really think
that we would forget, hmm?

653
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:40,666
I know how this works.

654
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,267
I need to make one phone call.

655
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,534
Please...

656
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,534
just one phone call.

657
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
Kill me.

658
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,000
Just...

659
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:23,400
kill me.

660
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:25,334
Kill you?

661
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,134
You're far too valuable
to kill, Mr. Bauer.
