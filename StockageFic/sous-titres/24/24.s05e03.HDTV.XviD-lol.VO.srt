1
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,633
Now, why would David
Palmer call my wife

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,834
about a national
security threat?

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,401
Can't risk having Mrs. Logan
obsess about this phone call.

4
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:21,201
David Palmer
called her yesterday.

5
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,867
Our communications office
will have a recording

6
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,067
of their conversation.

7
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:25,500
Get that for me.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,533
You don't need to be concerned
that there's any connection

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,834
between David's death

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,767
and the phone call
he made to you.

11
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,600
He said it was a matter
of national security.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,067
Those were
his exact words.

13
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:39,500
Martha, it's David Palmer.

14
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,401
I need to talk to you.

15
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,201
It's hardly a matter
of national security...

16
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,900
No, that's not what he said.

17
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:45,900
That is not
what he said!

18
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:48,001
Yes, it is.

19
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,334
CUMMINGS:
I have dealt with
the Martha Logan situation.

20
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,800
I was able to alter
the tape of the phone call

21
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,201
before the president heard it.

22
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,767
There's no longer any evidence

23
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,967
on my end that Palmer was trying
to warn her about the attack.

24
00:00:58,034 --> 00:00:59,600
Sir, it's Edgar.
I think we can find Chloe.

25
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,401
She's accessing our system
through a laptop.

26
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:02,967
I'm running a locate now.

27
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,967
What'd you get for me
on Chevensky?

28
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,234
He's a baggage supervisor
at the airport.

29
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,800
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian!

30
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:13,368
We know you're down here!

31
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,533
( tires squealing )

32
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:20,667
JENNINGS:
Don't fire!

33
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:23,800
Do not fire!

34
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,201
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

35
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,567
Jack didn't kill anybody.

36
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,533
He's being framed
to cover up the real reason

37
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,533
Palmer was assassinated.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,301
Where is he?

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,667
I can't tell you.

40
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,301
Where can I find the
baggage claim supervisor?

41
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,500
Down that hall
to the left.

42
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:38,667
Chevensky!

43
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:40,234
Why was President
Palmer killed?

44
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,234
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,401
You are going to tell me
what I want to know.

46
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,234
It's just a question
of how much you want it to hurt.

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,201
Mom, do you see those men?

48
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,800
I have to tell Jack.

49
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,967
Derek, where
are you going?

50
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,134
Come back here!

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,468
( gasps )

52
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,867
No!

53
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,267
Quiet!

54
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,434
Quiet!

55
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,867
You will not be harmed

56
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,934
as long as
your president

57
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,368
complies with our wishes!

58
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:28,734
( sirens wailing )

59
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,734
We have a critical
incident in progress!

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,934
I want a facility lock down
and a code five evac, right now!

61
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,434
Clear the area! Ma'am...
Officer...

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Officer, my son
is in there.

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,500
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We're evacuating the area.

64
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,633
Follow these people.
Ma'am!

65
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,067
Grab her!

66
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,867
I have to get my son!

67
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:55,867
( crying )

68
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,734
Sorry, lady.

69
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:00,867
I'm sorry,
you can't stay.

70
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:01,834
I have information
for CTU!

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,867
Please!

72
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,667
My son!

73
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,500
BERESCH:
Everyone, quiet!

74
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,934
Quiet!

75
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,867
If you cooperate,
you have a chance

76
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,633
of leaving this building alive.

77
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,201
If not, you will die.

78
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,934
Do you understand?

79
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,468
Take out all cell phones
and pagers

80
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,301
and drop them
on the floor.

81
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,368
( boy crying )

82
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,034
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay...

83
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:04,468
Bring them in.

84
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,567
GUNMAN 1:
Everyone up.
Move it.

85
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,934
GUNMAN 2:
Let's go!

86
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,334
GUNMAN 3:
Chevensky?

87
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,401
Chevensky?

88
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,201
( phone rings )

89
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,567
Well?

91
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,667
Chevensky's not here.

92
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,267
We have to find him.
Keep searching.

93
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,301
( line disconnects )

94
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,734
( sirens wailing outside )

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,067
( garbled radio transmission )

96
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:00,201
( phone rings )

97
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,500
McClaren.

98
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,800
BERESCH:
Listen very carefully.

99
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,267
We have hostages.

100
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,934
If you wish to keep them alive,

101
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,301
you'll make no attempt
to re-enter the terminal.

102
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,834
I'm listening.

103
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,001
We are wearing
explosive vests.

104
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,067
We are prepared
to detonate ourselves

105
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,468
along with our captives.

106
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,034
If you make any efforts
to enter the terminal,

107
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,900
you will spend
the rest of the day

108
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,134
collecting body parts.

109
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,767
Hello?

110
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,201
Set up a security perimeter.

111
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,167
We'll operate from the northwest
apron behind hangar 12

112
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,334
and get those fire trucks
out of here!

113
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,834
Everybody out!

114
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,434
Claremont, grab that woman
in the yellow next to Bailey.

115
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,067
Bring her up here. Quick!

116
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,401
All right.

117
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:10,900
Yeah. Thank you.

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,101
Bill, I just spoke to the
director of Secret Service.

119
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,667
Now that Suvarov
has arrived safely,

120
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,734
they're lowering their
security level by one.

121
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,167
I think we should
do the same.

122
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:23,034
I'll take our Tac Teams
off standby.

123
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,567
Have we heard back
from our unit

124
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:25,667
that was sent out
to the refinery?

125
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,101
Yeah. At least that part

126
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,700
of Chloe's story
checked out.

127
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,234
So it's possible that Jack
was set up

128
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,201
in Palmer's assassination.
We can't assume too much.

129
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,067
Jack still has
a lot to answer for.

130
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,001
( phone rings )

131
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,767
Buchanan.

132
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,867
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan, I've got
Jack Bauer on the line.

133
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,201
Put it through.

134
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,368
Bill, put it
on speaker phone.

135
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,034
Please.

136
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,034
Jack, it's Bill.

137
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,567
Bill, I'm in Ontario Airport.

138
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,368
Gunman have just attacked
and taken over Terminal One.

139
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:59,667
They are carrying automatic
weapons and they have hostages.

140
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,468
We haven't received
any alerts.

141
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,301
Trust me. You will.

142
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,301
What are you doing
at the airport, Jack?

143
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,900
I was following up
a lead.

144
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,034
President Palmer knew
of the planned attack.

145
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,434
I believe that's why
he was assassinated.

146
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
We just received
an interagency flash.

147
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,767
There's been an attack
on Ontario Airport.

148
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,434
First reports are of
several men carrying
automatic weapons

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,633
and they've taken control
of Terminal One.

150
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,334
Go to alert level four.

151
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,834
Launch all available
Tac Teams.

152
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,034
Curtis is
in the air.

153
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,267
Redirect him to the airport.

154
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:25,800
Have him maintain
operational control

155
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,267
the moment he's on site.

156
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,533
Right.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,934
Jack, we just
received confirmation

158
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,134
of the situation.

159
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,734
I want you out of there
now, Jack.

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,934
Turn yourself in.

161
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,567
Let our people handle this.

162
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,267
Understand this, Bill.

163
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,167
I don't work for you.

164
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,334
I'm staying inside.

165
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:43,134
You want my intel, fine.
But I'm doing this my way.

166
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,334
How many hostiles are there?

167
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,401
Approximately 10 to 12.

168
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,600
What's your situation?

169
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,834
Gunmen have locked down
the terminal.

170
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,533
Heads down!

171
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,101
I'm going to be sending
you photos of the hostiles.

172
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,567
They should be clear enough
that you can identify them.

173
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:01,667
Hold on.

174
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,934
Okay, they're transmitting.

175
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,967
All right, Jack.

176
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,201
We'll pull a schematic
of the airport

177
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,401
and forward it
to your cell.

178
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,301
Bill, hold on.
One more thing.

179
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,633
A woman is going to contact you.

180
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,967
Her name is Diane Huxley.

181
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,667
I sent her and her son
to CTU for protection.

182
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:19,267
Who are they?

183
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,934
I don't have time to explain,
but I'm responsible for them.

184
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,500
Just make sure
they're safe, okay?

185
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,201
We'll take care of them, Jack.

186
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,267
Thank you.

187
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,500
I'll be standing by.

188
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,267
We have to alert
the president.

189
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,001
Right.

190
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,700
I'd like to personally
extend my condolences

191
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,267
on the loss your country
has suffered today.

192
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,101
Thank you, Mr. President.

193
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,633
I hope that what you and
I accomplish here today

194
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,067
will serve as
a fitting tribute

195
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,301
to David Palmer's legacy.

196
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,267
I can't imagine anything
more appropriate

197
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,867
than the two of us establishing
a... a comprehensive

198
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:16,867
antiterrorism alliance
between our nations.

199
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,567
If you would excuse me
for a moment, Mr. President.

200
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,767
Of course.

201
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,434
What's up, Mike?

202
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Terrorists are controlling
the main terminal

203
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,434
of Ontario Airport
in Los Angeles.

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,600
Terrorists?!

205
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,368
Yes, sir. There are
witness reports

206
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,867
of two casualties

207
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,301
and they've taken
hostages.

208
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,134
Who are they?

209
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,401
Unclear.

210
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,334
CTU Los Angeles is prepping
a briefing.

211
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,234
Mr. President.

212
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,667
I suggest we move
to the Situation Room.

213
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:54,967
Now?!

214
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,667
CTU thinks this
may be related

215
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,500
to the summit.

216
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,234
Related in what way?

217
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't know, sir,

218
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,567
but we'll find out
during the briefing.

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,767
Sir?

220
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,001
We should go.

221
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,900
Of course.

222
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,700
Mr. President, as you've
probably been made aware,

223
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:24,368
a situation
has developed

224
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:26,334
that requires
my immediate attention.

225
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:29,201
I have just been informed.

226
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,167
This is terrible
news, indeed.

227
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:32,834
Please let me know if there
is anything I can do.

228
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,767
I will. Thank you, sir.

229
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,700
That's all for now,
ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,134
Spenser?

231
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,267
Pulling the ground plan

232
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,767
of the terminal
off the NTSB server

233
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,234
and sending it
to Jack Bauer now.

234
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,334
Good. Edgar.

235
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,600
Were you able to identify

236
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,034
the terrorists
from the photos Jack sent?

237
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,867
Still no matches
on the watch list.

238
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,633
I tried three different
encoding arrays.

239
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,034
Did you try widening
the parameters?

240
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,934
If it was any wider, we
could use the phone book.

241
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,334
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on a second.

242
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,334
Try using NP-safe
adaptive search.

243
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,468
You okay?

244
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,734
Thanks for asking, Edgar.

245
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,334
Chloe...

246
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,700
you managed to rack up
four protocol violations.

247
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,900
Well, it's a lot worse
than that if you count
agency doc codes.

248
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,368
It's more like
26 violations.

249
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:15,134
Do you want me to figure
out whose face that is?

250
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:17,834
Or I could just go
wait in holding.

251
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,301
See what you can do.

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,533
Did it work?
We got something.

253
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,234
It's off an archive from
the Bureau of Consular Affairs.

254
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:28,234
Anton Beresch,
a former army officer

255
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,267
in one of the Russian
breakaway republics.

256
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,134
BUCHANAN:
Which means this definitely
has something

257
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,533
to do with the summit.

258
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,034
I'll data-mine
the interagency servers,

259
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,767
see what I can come up with.

260
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,267
DOD is receiving a localized
broadcast from the airport.

261
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,267
The networks are also
picking it up.

262
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,134
Spenser, put it on screen.

263
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,434
...citizens
of the United States,

264
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,900
today your president
and the president of Russia

265
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,567
have come together to sign
what they have called

266
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,734
an "historical accord,"

267
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,301
an "antiterrorism alliance."

268
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,867
BERESCH:
Your leaders claim
it will bring peace

269
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:05,500
and security
to their respective countries.

270
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:09,368
As you'll soon learn, it'll
accomplish exactly the opposite.

271
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,434
I have hostages.

272
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,734
Unless President Logan

273
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,900
and President Suvarov
make a joint statement

274
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,533
repudiating this accord,

275
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,468
I will order their execution.

276
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,468
You have exactly 90 minutes.

277
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,767
We have to get this lunatic
off the air.

278
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,867
Sir, we can contact
the networks,

279
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,834
but they're under
no legal obligation

280
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,834
to comply.

281
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,700
BERESCH:
We take these actions

282
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,301
with the full knowledge
that we will be called butchers,

283
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:54,867
but we are only responding
to the violence that has been

284
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:58,201
inflicted upon our own
sons and daughters.

285
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:02,834
Until we as a people
achieve our own due--

286
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,567
national sovereignty--
terror will be met with terror.

287
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,500
NEWSMAN:
That was a live feed

288
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,067
from the Ontario Airport
in Southern California.

289
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:16,500
As we just heard,

290
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,667
the terrorists are demanding
that President Logan

291
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,900
repudiate
the antiterrorism accord.

292
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,533
This is insane.

293
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
How did these people
get control of an
entire airport?!

294
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,900
We've been preparing
for this summit for 16 months!

295
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:32,167
Every news agency in the world
is here!

296
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,633
I-I've staked my entire

297
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,500
administration on this day,
and now these people

298
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,468
are demanding that
I go on national television

299
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,533
and publicly repudiate
everything we've done?

300
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,201
Mr. President,
perhaps you should take

301
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,434
a few moments...
Mike!

302
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,267
I want this handled!

303
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,667
Do you understand?

304
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,667
I don't care
how you do it,

305
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:55,067
I don't care what it takes--
fix it!

306
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,700
Go ahead.

307
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,101
Curtis, this is Jack.

308
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,234
I'm starring straight down
on the main concourse.

309
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,834
I've got six hostiles
wearing explosive vests.

310
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,633
Four of them are staying
near the hostages.

311
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,101
I expect their orders
are to detonate

312
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,234
if we try and make a move;
the other two are roaming.

313
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:41,401
I've got two security doors
on the northeast side

314
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,334
of the concourse--
both are chained,

315
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,767
but currently
unguarded.

316
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,101
All right, get a recon unit
over to the northeast wall.

317
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,667
All right, Jack,
I'm gonna need you

318
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,500
to quarterback this thing
from inside.
Copy that.

319
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,500
Hey, I got a woman,
Diane Huxley,

320
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,201
says she has info for CTU.

321
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:55,767
CURTIS:
Diane Huxley. Who is she?

322
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,301
Curtis, did you just say
Diane Huxley?

323
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:58,834
Yes, I did.
Is she there?

324
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,134
Yeah.
Let me speak to her.

325
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,633
I'll bring her over.

326
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:07,734
Hello?

327
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Diane, what's going on?

328
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,800
What's wrong?

329
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,201
Derek is inside
the terminal.

330
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:13,667
What are you talking about?
I left him with you.

331
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:16,967
He saw some men;
he wanted to warn you.

332
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,767
I tried to go after him.
There was an explosion.

333
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:20,700
Are you sure he

334
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,800
made it all the way inside?

335
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,800
I don't know.

336
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:25,633
Hold on.

337
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,434
Damn it!

338
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,600
I see him.
He's with the other hostages.

339
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,967
But he's not hurt.

340
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,034
Please don't let anything
happen to him.

341
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:02,401
Jack, I can't lose my son.

342
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:03,967
Diane, listen to me.

343
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,800
I promise you on my life, I am
gonna get Derek back to you.

344
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,167
Do you understand me?

345
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,468
Okay.

346
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,368
Let me speak to Curtis.
Okay.

347
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,834
Jack.
Hey, Curtis, I need
to ask you a favor.

348
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,401
I want you to let
Ms. Huxley

349
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,334
stay with you
at the command post.

350
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,334
You got it.

351
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,767
I need you to let me know

352
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,034
if the hostiles adjust
their profile in any way.

353
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,134
Copy that.

354
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,867
I'll get back to you.

355
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,600
Son of a bitch!

356
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,667
His name is Anton Beresch.

357
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,734
He's a member
of the Dawn Brigade,

358
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,201
a separatist movement blamed

359
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,934
for numerous terrorist bombings
in Russia.

360
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,300
Precisely the kind

361
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,433
of terrorist organization
today's accord

362
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,201
was designed to combat.
Bill, I have no
intention of calling off

363
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,400
this signing,
much less making

364
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,767
a public statement
to that effect.

365
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,101
So that gives you
less than 90 minutes

366
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,400
to rescue the hostages.

367
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,901
We're already operating
under that timetable, sir.

368
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,433
We have a unit
on the ground,

369
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,001
and we're making
an on-site assessment.

370
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,700
Spare the agency patter;
just get it done.

371
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,767
Sir, you need to be aware,

372
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,168
we should be prepared to accept
additional civilian casualties.

373
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,767
More casualties?

374
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,801
It's a possibility
we have to face, sir.

375
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,101
I'm not prepared to accept
any such thing.

376
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,567
Bill, it's your job

377
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,067
to make sure those people
get out of there alive.

378
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,034
Mr. President, the terrorists
are wearing explosive vests.

379
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,134
They've threatened

380
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,101
to detonate themselves
and the hostages

381
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,600
if any attempt is made
to retake the terminal.

382
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,067
I'm aware of
the situation.

383
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:45,234
Bill, have you tried

384
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,801
initiating a dialogue
with the terrorists?

385
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,500
Yes, what about talking to them?
Have you tried that?

386
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,034
Beresch placed
a call to

387
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,034
an Airport Police sergeant--
it was a blocked number,

388
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,801
but we're in the process
of back-tracing it.

389
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,967
Look, whatever you do, just make
sure it's done by the deadline.

390
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,433
When I put my name
on that accord,

391
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,433
I do not want to be
signing the death warrant

392
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,767
of innocent
American citizens.

393
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:02,801
Yes, Mr. President.

394
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,667
Do you have that number?

395
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:06,901
Yes, sir.
We just completed
the back-trace.

396
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,134
Try it.

397
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:16,967
( woman crying )

398
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,667
( phone ringing )
It's gonna be okay.

399
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:20,934
It's gonna be okay.

400
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,067
( ringing continues )

401
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,567
Yes?

402
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,767
This is Bill Buchanan,

403
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,268
a director of the Los Angeles
Counter-Terrorist Unit.

404
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,667
I am listening.

405
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,034
The president has authorized me
to speak on his behalf.

406
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,567
I'm hoping we can
resolve this peacefully.

407
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,534
I've told you how
to resolve this peacefully.

408
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,667
Your president

409
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,201
must make a public statement.

410
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,934
I know he's considering
that option.

411
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,700
Then we have nothing
more to speak about.

412
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,500
There must be some other way
we can address your demands.

413
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,801
I don't think you understand
just how serious we are.

414
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,867
Wait. We can talk about...
( line disconnects )

415
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,867
Data-mine the call.

416
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:01,734
Yes, sir.

417
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:03,300
Get up!

418
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,201
Up!
What?

419
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,034
Bring him.

420
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,700
Curtis, they're moving
one of the hostages.

421
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,300
On your knees!

422
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,734
Oh, my God.

423
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:37,268
Please...

424
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,367
I have a wife.

425
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:41,934
So do I.

426
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,734
No.

427
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,433
( people screaming )

428
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,667
* *

429
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,234
You!

430
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,367
No.

431
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,667
Curtis, they're moving

432
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,967
another one of the hostages.

433
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,333
I can't see where.
I'm changing position.

434
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,333
Derek?
Ma'am, please, ma'am.

435
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,801
That's my son.

436
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,967
Ma'am, please.
They're gonna kill my son!

437
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,834
( weeping ):
That's my son!

438
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,934
Derek!

439
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,333
No, let me go!

440
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:19,268
( Diane screaming )

441
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,534
In 15 minutes,

442
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,234
your president will get
another demonstration

443
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
of our commitment.

444
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,700
15 minutes.

445
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:32,767
I'm in position.

446
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,001
How much longer
till you're ready

447
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,534
to move in?
At least a half hour.

448
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,967
We're still transferring
personnel from the summit.

449
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,467
Negative. That's too long.

450
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:39,667
You need to advance your attack.

451
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:40,901
We can't.
We're just not ready.

452
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,101
Curtis, they're gonna
kill that kid.

453
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,901
Jack...

454
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,034
I heard that woman Diane's side
of the conversation...

455
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,333
This has nothing to do with her.

456
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,367
These people are gonna continue
to kill hostages

457
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:52,901
until the summit deadline.

458
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,901
We can't risk the lives of all
those hostages for this one kid.

459
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,034
You know that.

460
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,101
I not gonna jeopardize
the mission.

461
00:21:58,168 --> 00:21:59,867
Just tell your men to hurry.

462
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,301
It's all connected.

463
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,200
Maybe that's enough, Mrs. Logan.

464
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,200
The doctor said you
really shouldn't
be watching this...

465
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,167
Evelyn...

466
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,167
David Palmer called me
last night.

467
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:53,167
He said he had
something to tell me.

468
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:56,167
It was "a matter
of national security."

469
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:59,567
I think it has something
to do with this.

470
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,867
The terrorists?

471
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:05,933
Yes. I tried to tell my husband
and Walt Cummings,

472
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,401
but they think I
imagined the call.

473
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,000
So we checked
the phone recordings.

474
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,534
The conversations don't match.

475
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,933
Someone altered
the conversation, Evelyn.

476
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,601
Who would do something
like that?

477
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:23,267
I don't know.

478
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,833
Now listen to me.

479
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,534
You have got
to cover for me.

480
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:31,768
No one can know
that I am gone.

481
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,668
Do you understand me?

482
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:38,367
W-Where are you going?

483
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,367
( sighs )

484
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:04,034
( phone dialing )

485
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,334
( phone rings )

486
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,867
O'Brian.

487
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:08,267
Chloe, is that you?
Jack?

488
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,167
What's going on?
Why are you answering the phone?

489
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:11,167
Mr. Buchanan
needed my help

490
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,534
with the
airport crisis.

491
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:13,768
Are you alone?
Yeah.

492
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,067
Okay, I'm going
to send a picture

493
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:16,933
of one of the hostiles
over to your screen. Hold on.

494
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,367
Okay, I got it.

495
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,034
I want you to enlarge

496
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,534
the upper right corner
of his vest.

497
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,967
Looks like
a secondary detonator,

498
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:35,167
cell phone activated.

499
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,701
Yeah, so the leader
can set off the charges

500
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,701
individually in case
anybody gets cold feet.

501
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,634
I need the detonation
frequency.

502
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:42,301
Okay, I'll have to
I.D. the detonator.

503
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:43,301
It could take some time.

504
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,768
Just get started.

505
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,933
Did you clear this
with Buchanan?

506
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,900
No.

507
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:51,900
Chloe,

508
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,267
can you see the live feed?

509
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,167
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

510
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,100
I need your help.

511
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,334
Okay. I'll get back to you.

512
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,668
( sighs )

513
00:25:06,734 --> 00:25:09,501
Spenser...

514
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,200
I was really worried about you.

515
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,000
Uh, not now.

516
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,334
I need you to
reconfigure Jack's phone

517
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:15,434
to emit an
alternate signal.

518
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:24,668
What for?

519
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,768
Could you just work
up a procedure?

520
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,467
This is off protocol,
isn't it?

521
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:32,501
Yes.

522
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,100
Spenser, you have
more knowledge

523
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,100
about bandwidth processing
than anyone here.

524
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,833
I need you.

525
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,234
( computer keys clacking )

526
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,967
Got it?

527
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:03,567
Yeah.

528
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,800
( knocking )
It's Agent Pierce.

529
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,334
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan

530
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,234
to the Garden Room.

531
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:24,501
She's still

532
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,067
not ready.

533
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:29,701
President Logan is expecting her
15 minutes before the ceremony.

534
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,567
Could I speak
with her?

535
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,000
What's going on?

536
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,534
She's in one
of her moods.

537
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:48,301
If you push her,
it'll make it worse.

538
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,034
I'll wait out here.

539
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,034
Thanks.

540
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,401
( door closes )

541
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,000
( liquid flowing )

542
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,501
It's Mr. Burk,
isn't it?

543
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,167
Uh, Mrs. Logan...

544
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:26,668
You work in the
communications
office, don't you?

545
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:28,134
Yes, Ma'am.

546
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,833
I know that all phone
conversations are recorded.

547
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,034
Where do they keep
those recordings?

548
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:41,067
Uh, well, the calls are recorded
onto a hard drive.

549
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:43,134
It's part
of the central server.

550
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
Is there, by any chance,
any hard copies?

551
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,967
Actually,
the-the President insists

552
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,267
on written transcripts
as backups.

553
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,134
He's-he's kind of
old-fashioned that way.

554
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,701
I know. Where do they store
those transcripts?

555
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:56,800
Archive room down the hall.

556
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,267
Can you show me?

557
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,100
Access is restricted.

558
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm the First Lady.

559
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,334
I understand,
Mrs. Logan,

560
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,933
uh, but there are
security requirements.

561
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You... you have to have
an entry card.

562
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:07,034
Do you have one?

563
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,034
Well, yes, I do...

564
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,534
Can I borrow it?

565
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,567
It's extremely important.

566
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,301
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry.

567
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,867
Um... there's-there's
nothing I can do.

568
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,833
Mr. Burk...

569
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,501
we can continue
this little dance

570
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,334
if you really want to,
but you and I both know

571
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:27,000
I am going to get
into that room,

572
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,301
so you can save us
both the trouble

573
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,900
and just give me
your entry card.

574
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:32,867
Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't...

575
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:35,734
You know, in three
seconds, Mr. Burk,

576
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,134
I am going to scream

577
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,134
louder than any woman
you've ever heard in your life.

578
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,134
One... two...

579
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,067
Here's the card. Here.

580
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,634
Um...
Thank you.

581
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:49,134
Yeah.
Thank you.

581
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
I will try to return it soon.

582
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,034
O'Brian.

583
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,301
Chloe, they're going

584
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,601
to kill Derek
in less than three minutes--

585
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:20,634
I need that frequency.

586
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,900
We're still
trying to find

587
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,134
the manufacturer
of the detonator.

588
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,933
Hurry. We're
running out of time.

589
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,601
I know, but if we don't get
the frequency right,

590
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,134
we could accidentally detonate
all the vests.

591
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,768
Okay, there's no match
on any of the Czech

592
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,000
military components.
That leaves
the German manufacturers.

593
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,634
Jack, we're trying
to narrow it down.

594
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,167
Now, the first team
will enter

595
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:45,334
through the southeast door
and split into two flanks.

596
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,768
The primary kill
shots will take out

597
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,167
the hostiles
wearing bomb vests.

598
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,100
Second team enters

599
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,367
through the southeast door,

600
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,401
forms a protective ring
around the hostages.

601
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,501
We'll only have
a few seconds to
neutralize the hostiles,

602
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,467
so find your targets fast.

603
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,867
Go.

604
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,301
What's your time frame?

605
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,334
We're on target to launch
the assault in 15 minutes.

606
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,134
Understood.

607
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
( sniffling and panting )

608
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,701
How old are you?

609
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,601
Fifteen.

610
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:26,601
BERESCH:
Try to control
your breathing.

611
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,467
Slow down.

612
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,867
( quiets )

613
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,601
See?

614
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,900
Better.

615
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:43,034
Please don't kill me.

616
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,601
That's up to your president.

617
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,167
( phone rings )

618
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,601
Bill Buchanan.

619
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:03,401
MAN:
Beresch is calling
from the airport, sir.

620
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,200
This is Bill Buchanan.

621
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,100
The boy hasn't long to live.

622
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,034
We're haven't heard
from the president yet.

623
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,034
We need more time.

624
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,367
No.

625
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,634
The president must announce
the summit is canceled,

626
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:19,668
or I kill the boy.

627
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,367
We're doing our best

628
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:23,034
to get an answer
from the president.

629
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,200
I implore you
to resolve this

630
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,301
without further killing.

631
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:30,067
This boy's blood
will be on his hands.

632
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,434
Come on, Chloe.

633
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,334
Jack, we just got a match
on the manufacturer.

634
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,301
We're trying to figure out
the frequency.

635
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,933
There's no match
on the 2004 series.

636
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,601
It's got to be
one of these three.

637
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,734
Hold him!

638
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,701
Agent Manning!

639
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,034
I got it.

640
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,401
Here it is.

641
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:56,933
We've got the trigger frequency
for the detonator.

642
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,301
Go to submenu three
on your phone.

643
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,301
I'm at submenu.

644
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,800
Enter this code: 6-3-3-9.

645
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,034
JACK:
Now what?
The phone needs to reboot.

646
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,234
When it does, it'll give you
a ready message.

647
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:07,768
Then you press the star key,

648
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,734
and it should send the signal
to set off the detonator.

649
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:14,900
Your president
has abandoned you.

650
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,900
I'm not getting
a ready message signal.

651
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,967
It takes time
to re-flash the ROM.

652
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,668
Son of a bitch, come on!

653
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,467
I'm sorry.

654
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:27,967
( erratic panting )

655
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:32,434
I got it. I got it!

656
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,768
( loud explosion )

657
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:41,000
Curtis, what was that?

658
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,301
CURTIS:
There was an explosion
in the terminal.

659
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,334
We can't tell
what it is from here.

660
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:44,933
Patch me through to Jack.

661
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,134
Stay in position!

662
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,267
Keep the hostages together!

663
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:53,434
Check the exits, make sure
the perimeter's secure!

664
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:05,334
It was Ibrim's vest.

665
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,200
It must have detonated
by accident.

666
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:09,334
Jack, what's going on?

667
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,967
One of the terrorists' vests
blew up.

668
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,567
But none of the hostages
were hurt.

669
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,601
BUCHANAN:
Were you responsible
for that, Jack?

670
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,301
Jack, answer me.

671
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:20,067
Bill, they were going to kill
another hostage.

672
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,534
I didn't have a choice.

673
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:24,034
I didn't compromise my position.

674
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,401
Now you tell me this.

675
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:26,534
Are Curtis and his team

676
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,701
on schedule?

677
00:33:27,768 --> 00:33:29,367
Yes. The backup units
are in position.

678
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:30,867
Go time is ten minutes.
Okay.

679
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:31,867
BERESCH:
Everyone.

680
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,601
Fall into formation "B"

681
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:36,334
and run circuit checks
on your vests.

682
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:38,567
The terrorists are revising
their formation.

683
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,634
I'll contact Curtis
in the next few minutes

684
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,701
with final positions.

685
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:42,833
BUCHANAN:
Thanks, Jack.

686
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,734
( beeping )

687
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,267
EDGAR:
Mr. Buchanan, President Logan's
on the line for you.

688
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:52,734
Mr. President.

689
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,167
The news is saying

690
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,534
there was some kind of explosion
inside the terminal.

691
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,200
Everything is
under control, sir.

692
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,933
Our tactical units
are in position.

693
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,167
Go time is ten minutes.

694
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:02,668
Then what caused
the explosion?

695
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,334
Well, we're not
entirely certain, sir.

696
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,900
We believe that
our man inside

697
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:08,800
may have been trying to stall
the execution of a hostage.

698
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,734
He triggered the bomb vest
of a hostile.

699
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,301
Did you authorize
this action?

700
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,567
No, sir, he acted independently.

701
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,334
You should know,
Mr. President, the man

702
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:22,234
we're talking about
is Jack Bauer.

703
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:23,701
Jack Bauer?

704
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:26,434
He was in the terminal
when the terrorists attacked.

705
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:28,100
He's been helping us
coordinate

706
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,434
our operation
from inside, sir.

707
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,000
I thought that Jack Bauer
assassinated David Palmer.

708
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,367
There's mitigating
evidence

709
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:35,567
to suggest that Bauer

710
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,234
may have been framed,
Mr. President.

711
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:39,234
What evidence?
What are you talking about?

712
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:40,434
It's complicated,
Mr. President.

713
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:42,234
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

714
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:44,967
I didn't want to distract you
with details

715
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,467
that could wait
until after we'd resolved

716
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:47,567
this hostage situation, sir.

717
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,668
You tell me

718
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:49,933
everything and I will decide

719
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,501
which details are relevant.

720
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:52,601
With respect, Mr. President,

721
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:53,900
we don't have time.

722
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,367
Then talk faster.

723
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,067
PIERCE:
Mrs. Logan is due

724
00:35:21,134 --> 00:35:22,867
in the Garden Room right now.

725
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,334
Open the door, please.

726
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:26,700
Just a few more minutes!

727
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,533
Ma'am, it's my job
to make sure she's there.

728
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,368
If you don't open the door,

729
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:33,700
I will open
it myself.

730
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,001
Mrs. Logan.

731
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,067
How dare you barge in here.

732
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:42,867
Mrs. Logan.

733
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,767
This is a private
residence...

734
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:47,900
Evelyn, if something
happens to Mrs. Logan,

735
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,567
the blame will fall on you.

736
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:51,101
We both know that.

737
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,533
So I am urging you
in the strongest
possible terms

738
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,101
to tell me where she is.

739
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,401
We're moving to entry positions.

740
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,167
Davies, Matthews,
are your teams in place?

741
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:21,867
MAN:
All teams in place and ready
to go, Agent Manning.

742
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,900
All right. Copy.

743
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,101
Go.

744
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,434
Oh my God...
It's okay.

745
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,101
Listen, listen.
Derek's alive.

746
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,067
He's okay.

747
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:34,267
Are you sure?

748
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:36,700
I can't go into details,
but he's okay.

749
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:37,767
I have to go.

750
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,934
We're mounting
our rescue operation.

751
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,167
Thank you.

752
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,434
Keep an eye on her.
Let's go.

753
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,633
They're waiting for you in
the Garden Room, Mrs. Logan.

754
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,301
( sighs )

755
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:06,101
I can get up myself.

756
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,234
All right.

757
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:08,967
But you still need
to come with me.

758
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,800
( sighs )

759
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:14,834
Whatever you say, Aaron.
Whatever you say.

760
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,667
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan...

761
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:36,667
It's all right.

762
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,567
I'm really sorry.

763
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,167
Evelyn, will you
stop apologizing?

764
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:41,234
It's annoying.

765
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,834
Besides, I got what I came for.

766
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,600
NATHANSON:
Yes.

767
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,134
You have a problem
at the terminal.

768
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,134
Explain.

769
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:04,500
Jack Bauer is inside

770
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,900
providing recon
for CTU's rescue operation,

771
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,401
which will launch shortly.

772
00:38:08,468 --> 00:38:09,800
Are you sure?

773
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,700
This came straight
from the Director of CTU.

774
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,134
And Bauer was responsible

775
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:15,867
for detonating the vest
of one of Beresch's men.

776
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,867
Can you tell me
Bauer's precise location?

777
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,301
No.

778
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:21,900
But I know he has a connection
to one of the hostages--

779
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,734
a 15-year-old boy
named Derek Huxley.

780
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,134
I have to go.

781
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:33,533
Tell them that's being handled
out of the press office.

782
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,034
Thank you.

783
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:37,834
Yes?

784
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,667
Mrs. Logan is back in her room,
getting ready.

785
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:41,834
Why the delay?

786
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,201
She was in one
of the archive rooms.

787
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,633
Archive rooms...

788
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,734
What was she doing there?

789
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,734
The First Lady is safe
and accounted for.

790
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,500
You'll need to ask her
about anything beyond that.

791
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,201
Thank you, Aaron.

792
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,800
C.T.

793
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,101
Go to the ticket counters.

794
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,401
Go to the west exit.

795
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Manning.

796
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:27,767
JACK:
Curtis, this is Jack.

797
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,600
Beresch's redeployed six men.

798
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,734
Are you ready
for final positions?

799
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,101
Go ahead.

800
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,867
Four men were deployed
to the east side of the terminal

801
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:36,101
in front
of the ticket counter,

802
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,934
the other two to the west side
of the terminal

803
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,334
in front
of the emergency exits.

804
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:40,567
Do you copy?
Copy.

805
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:42,201
Okay, once you deploy,

806
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:44,600
I'll give you real-time
updates on their positions.

807
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,500
All right, Jack.
I'm starting the countdown.

808
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:48,967
All teams stand by to execute.

809
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:52,434
This is it.

810
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,267
NATHANSON:
He's in the terminal now.

811
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:03,334
Okay.

812
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,034
Hostages up!

813
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:09,700
Hold on one second.

814
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,800
Hold on.

815
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,301
Hold on, Beresch is
changing something.

816
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,500
He's moving...

817
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,434
( loud electronic distortion
and static )

818
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,001
Jack? Jack!

819
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:26,967
Curtis, what happened?

820
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,001
I lost Jack.

821
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,001
What do you mean,
you lost him?

822
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,067
The connection's broken.

823
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:32,134
Can you reconnect?

824
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,401
I'm trying.

825
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,600
Jack Bauer.

826
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:47,700
Derek is a very brave young man.

827
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,368
I will shoot him in the head

828
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,001
if you don't show yourself
immediately.

829
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,834
( sighs )

830
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,567
BUCHANAN:
Curtis!
It's not going through, Bill.

831
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,134
Can you move in without him?

832
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:58,301
The last thing Jack said

833
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,001
was that Beresch
was moving something.

834
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,934
He could be moving the hostages
into the kill zone.

835
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,567
Abort.

836
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:06,267
All teams, abort the operation.

837
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:07,767
Repeat: This is an abort.

838
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,001
BERESCH:
Bauer, if you want
to save the boy,

839
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:15,700
present yourself now.

840
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:39,034
Mr. Bauer!

841
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:43,667
Derek has five seconds
left to live.

842
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,067
Four.

843
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:46,134
Three...

844
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:47,934
JACK:
Beresch!

845
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:55,067
JACK:
I'm lowering my weapon.

846
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,533
Secure him.
