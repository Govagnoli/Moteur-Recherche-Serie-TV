1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,673
-What's wrong?
- Keeler.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,759
He's bringing your ex-husband into this
debate, the investigation into his company.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,919
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and
trust that the people can tell the difference.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,639
- What's going on? Where's Tony?
- He's been shot.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,115
- How bad?
- He was hit in the neck. He's alive.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,391
They're getting him to the hospital.
You're in command.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,432
(distorted) Deliver Ram Ãn Salazar
to the Van Nuys Dam.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,870
Whoever sent this message is
controlling Singer's movements.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,072
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,510
- What are you into, Kyle?
- These cops came to my apartment,

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,679
saying something about using me
to bring some disease into the country.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,755
A disease?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,433
Go! Run!

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,835
(screaming)

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,552
No!

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,598
- You going to see Salazar?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,235
- Dad said questioning him is a waste of time.
- Sitting around here is a waste of time.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,874
I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,753
- What's this about?
- I need to move Ram Ãn Salazar.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,872
This has priority clearance.
No one at CTU's supposed to know.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,073
Either I hand over Ram Ãn Salazar,
or his brother will release the virus.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,755
I understand that this is an impossible
choice. I have another option for you.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,758
Ram Ãn Salazar would be broken out
and delivered to him.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,189
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
Who'll break Salazar out?

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,356
I will, sir.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,074
This would be my last assignment.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,509
If you play this cool
you're walking out of here now.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,312
(alarm)

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,719
Open the cell blocks now.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,359
Move!

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,276
Good evening to those on the East
Coast and good afternoon in the west.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,875
Welcome to the first of three debates
between President Palmer

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,752
and Senator John Keeler.

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,872
We'll begin tonight with a two-minute
opening statement,

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,829
followed by the first question,
which will go to President Palmer,

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,476
this decided by a coin-flip
backstage just moments ago.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,875
How you feeling?

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,197
Is that a medical question or a personal one?

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,198
- Both.
- I'm fine.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,709
It'll be conducted
within the rules agreed to

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,877
by each member of the debate
and by the two campaigns.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,509
Now we'll bring to the stage the candidates.

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,510
(applause)

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,194
I'm sorry you have to deal with
my ex-husband's lies.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,556
It's all right.
We have the truth on our side.

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,399
Ladies and gentlemen,
President David Palmer.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,436
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Keeler, good evening.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,838
I'm looking forward to discussing
some of the critical issues...

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,673
(yelling)

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,873
OK... when I tell you to,
you start fighting with me over the gun.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,514
I gotta pull two guards off the main corridor.

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,756
OK, come on.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,669
Help! Help! Help!

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,839
(Ram Ãn) Now!

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,992
That's enough! Enough!

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,629
Put on his uniform now.

58
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,596
I want a team at every security post.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,950
Jack and Salazar are in east block.

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,670
- You partner's not my only problem.
- Warden, today he is.

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,678
He and Salazar need to be
contained and kept alive.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,759
Want me to redeploy my men? I need
to know how real this terrorist threat is.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,632
Salazar's brother will spread a virus into
the population unless we release him.

64
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,594
If we don't, the death toll will be
in the hundreds of thousands.

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,280
(low dispatch voice)

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,354
This is Mitchell. Tactical unit five, you are
now under the command of Agent Edmunds.

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,873
Thank you.

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,793
- Yeah?
- What the hell is going on over there?

69
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,792
- Jack's breaking Salazar out of prison.
- What?

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,953
He thinks he'll deliver him to Hector
and stop the virus from being released.

71
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,674
He's gonna get himself and Salazar killed.

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,880
I know, I know. I'm trying to protect him.
What about Kyle Singer?

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,952
- We're close to locating him.
- As soon as you do, call me.

74
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,311
If Jack knows we got the carrier
of the virus, he'll return Salazar.

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,873
Everyone is working on it.

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,874
- We'll find him.
- OK.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,751
Negro?

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,871
I'm sorry, Linda.

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,032
Linda...

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,070
Am I gonna die?

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,871
It depends...

82
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,593
if they find us in time.

83
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,676
What do you mean?

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,880
The guy from the government.

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,668
He told my dad that I had
a couple more hours before l...

86
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,830
before I become contagious.

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Maybe they'll find us by then.

88
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,871
You'll be OK.

89
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,595
Yeah... maybe.

90
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,880
- What are you doing?
- There must be some wires in here.

91
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,429
- What do you need wire for?
- Get you out of this.

92
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,995
Adam, look at this.
Got it from a Caltrans server.

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,230
Traffic camera right near the mall.

94
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,757
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that
what Kyle Singer was wearing?

95
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,952
Yeah. There's enough to enhance.
Release it to my screen.

96
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,957
Got it.

97
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
- Kim.
- Yes?

98
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,154
I need you a second.

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,072
- You got this?
- Yeah.

100
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,872
All right.

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,915
Something wrong?

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,156
Have you heard what's going on
at the prison?

103
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,559
No. Adam and I have been working
on finding Singer. Why? What is it?

104
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
- Your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
- What?

105
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,590
He's acting on his own authority.
He's trying to remove Salazar by force.

106
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,790
What you mean by "force"?

107
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,189
He started a prison riot to cover the escape.

108
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
- Why's he doing this?
- We're trying to figure that out.

109
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
- When did you last hear from him?
- About a half hour ago.

110
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,872
He asked me to issue a transfer order
for Ram Ãn Salazar,

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,877
and he gave me a password.

112
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,915
And you did it?

113
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,875
Yeah, he said Salazar needed
to be moved. This isn't true?

114
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,554
No, Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

115
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,837
Why would he do that?

116
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,829
He knew if he asked anybody else, they
would know he was violating protocol.

117
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,112
- What's gonna happen to him?
- We're gonna try to find him.

118
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,993
The best way out of this
is to find Kyle Singer.

119
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,880
Then your dad will give up Salazar.
So go back to work. Help Adam.

120
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,950
Yeah, sure.

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,075
We're clear!

122
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,074
They'll funnel their forces
through one entrance.

123
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,191
There must be another way, Jack.

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,869
The prisoners have taken control.
We have to fight our way through.

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,313
(gunfire)

126
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,232
Get ready.

127
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,075
(inmate) Pick him up! Come on!

128
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,668
Come on, get 'em on their feet!

129
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,154
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Move, move!

130
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,271
Hold your fire!
We got hostages, so back off!

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,356
Hold your fire!

132
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,880
Come on, man.

133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,196
Move! Let's go!

134
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,279
Move!

135
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,159
Move it, move it!

136
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,953
..and in order to do this,
our reserves must be kept

137
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,719
and our fossil fuels must be conserved.

138
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,710
- Did you send me that Kalman filter?
- What?

139
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,799
- I need it to clean up that image.
- Shoot, I forgot. It's in my outbox.

140
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,472
How can you forget?
It's all you're working on.

141
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,270
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sending it
to you right now. Done.

142
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,710
We need to find Kyle Singer
before he's contagious.

143
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,989
I'm doing the best I can.

144
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,873
"The best I can" isn't what we do.
It's done or it's not.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,349
So why are you lecturing me?
It's in your system.

146
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,436
(phone ringing)

147
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,876
- Kaufman.
- Is there a problem?

148
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,880
I need to make sure
things are running smoothly.

149
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,149
I haven't had a chance to brief you, but
Jack's created a situation over at the prison.

150
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,158
- What situation?
- He started a riot to free Salazar.

151
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,350
They're caught up in the middle of it.

152
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,880
Whoa.

153
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,351
He used Kim to create a transfer order
that started it, so cut her a little slack.

154
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,758
Um... yeah, OK, I understand.

155
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,879
We're all under a lot of pressure, so
let's find Kyle Singer before it's too late.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,309
Yeah, OK. Thanks, Michelle.

157
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,432
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here!

158
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,155
You don't deserve what happened.

159
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,515
I do.

160
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,877
If I die, the virus is dyin' with me.

161
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,393
- Kyle!
- (choking)

162
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,351
Kyle!

163
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,516
Put your feet on here!

164
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,396
Kyle!

165
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,152
Kyle, hold on.

166
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,556
(coughing)

167
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,351
Oh, Kyle.

168
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,996
A welcome-home party?

169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,391
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- What are you talking about?

170
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,919
You've been running things.

171
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,998
Show Ram Ãn you're going to be his partner.

172
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,950
Not his caterer.

173
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,868
Why do you care? You don't want
to be involved in my business.

174
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,880
No, Papi. I care about you.

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,917
And I want you to get what you've earned.

176
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,551
(cellphone rings)

177
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,998
- Yes?
- It's me. Riot's still going on.

178
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,588
- But we know Ram Ãn's alive.
- Yeah.

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,632
But Bauer's gotta get him out soon.

180
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,874
CTU's getting close to finding Singer.
If they do, they'll never let Ram Ãn go.

181
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,480
- Then make sure they don't.
- I'm working on it.

182
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,879
Get it done.

183
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,636
That's him. That's Singer.

184
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,276
Is that a gun?

185
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,555
Yeah. Someone's got him.

186
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,673
We won't be able to get
the licence plate from the shot.

187
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,873
I'll get access to the traffic cameras.
See if we can find them again.

188
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,234
Michelle, we found Singer being driven
from the mall 47 minutes ago.

189
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,636
- Are you working up a vehicle lD?
- As soon as we get another visual.

190
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,876
- This camera's still functional.
- The hostages are on the right.

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,151
- Try and pan the camera over.
- They may see the camera move.

192
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,992
We have no choice. Do it.

193
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,476
There they are.

194
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,115
We gotta get in before they kill everyone.

195
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,229
Come on, faster! Faster!

196
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,595
Let's start wasting the guards
unless they let us walk.

197
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,792
First step outside - bam!
Headshot from a sniper.

198
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,989
You don't know that.

199
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,430
I know cos that's what went down in Chino!

200
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,757
They'll let the guards get wasted.
All they care about is keeping us in.

201
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,599
What the hell are we doing here, then?

202
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,112
Give me your gun.
Bring 'em over here.

203
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,948
We're gonna have a little fun with 'em.
Put 'em on their knees.

204
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,076
Who wants to live?

205
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,397
(gunshot)

206
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,715
- OK.
- Do 'em all, dude. Do 'em all.

207
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,159
Let's try it again.

208
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,838
- Who wants to live?
- Me! I do.

209
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,716
Him. Over here.

210
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,797
Who else?

211
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,996
I've never seen you before.

212
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,076
I'm new here.

213
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,111
Him, over here.

214
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,830
One in six chance.

215
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,311
You're first.

216
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,038
Please... don't make me do this.

217
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,391
There's nothing to it.
Just put the gun to your head...

218
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,114
I can't. I can't.

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,870
You're gonna do it. You hear me?

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,195
Please... please...

221
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,878
It's easy. See?

222
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,317
All you gotta do is smile.

223
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,872
And pull the trigger.

224
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,190
- (gun clicks)
- (laughter)

225
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,069
Now it's one in five.

226
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,592
Let's go!

227
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,796
No! No!

228
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,633
(sobbing) I can't. I can't.

229
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,228
- This is a waste of my time. Shoot him!
- No, wait! Wait!

230
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,275
Come on, man. Just do it.

231
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,198
This way at least you got a chance, OK? Do it.

232
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,871
Come on.

233
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,876
You're gonna do it... or we will.

234
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,880
(gunshot)

235
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,279
(inmates) Yeah! Yeah!

236
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,516
We have a winner!

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,872
- Let's hear it for the new guy.
- (cheers/applause)

238
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,877
We're now seeing concrete results.

239
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,397
This is a road we will continue to travel.

240
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,109
I got a shot from a camera
at the next intersection. The same truck.

241
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,798
Can you read the licence plate?

242
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,192
We won't be able to read anything
until it finishes downloading.

243
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,629
I just saw the lAD inquiry
come in over the system

244
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,149
about what your father's doing at the prison.

245
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,636
They're questioning the transfer order
you generated for him.

246
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,790
I heard.

247
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,318
If you want me to say you didn't know
he'd use it to break out Salazar, I will.

248
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,874
Thanks. I'll be OK.

249
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,869
Hold on. It stopped downloading.
I'm getting an error message.

250
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,715
Error 402. That means trouble
with an internal router.

251
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,233
Gael. What are you doing?

252
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,875
There's a problem with one
of the routers. I'm trying to fix it.

253
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,509
- Why don't you call a tech?
- No, it's OK.

254
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,312
I think I found the problem.

255
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,830
Protection circuit kicked in.
Must've been a line surge.

256
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,550
Should be up and running now.

257
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,879
- Let me know if you have more problems.
- I will.

258
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,873
(Adam) It's back up. What was it?

259
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,669
I'm not sure. Is it possible a surge
could've knocked out a router?

260
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,758
Not from my side.
You could ask Chloe.

261
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,519
- Got it.
- (dialling)

262
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,358
- (phone rings)
- Hold on.

263
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,550
I've got a plate on the pickup.

264
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,715
Where do you have it?

265
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,276
In the north quadrant
of Santa Fe Springs, driving west.

266
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,995
Put this out to mobile units.
I want everyone looking for this vehicle.

267
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,878
OK, right.

268
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,474
Ryan, I'm back.

269
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,559
So, do you have any idea if Bauer is
trying to break out Salazar on his own

270
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,352
or if he's working with someone?

271
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,592
- I'll get back to you when I find out.
- You do that.

272
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,959
- Chloe.
- Yeah, Michelle?

273
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,875
- Know what's going on at the prison?
- What's happening?

274
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,357
We don't have the details, but Jack's
behind it. Check his phone logs, email.

275
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
See what case files he's accessed recently.

276
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,074
What am I looking for?

277
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,630
Anything to help us know
why he's doing this.

278
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,797
Are you sure?
You really want me snooping in his office?

279
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,914
- Yes.
- You got it.

280
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,871
(dialling)

281
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,797
- Surgery.
- This is Tony Almeida's wife, Michelle.

282
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,792
- How's he doing?
- I'll check. One moment, please.

283
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,638
- Mrs Almeida?
- Yeah?

284
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,880
He's still in surgery. You'll be contacted
as soon as he's rolled into Recovery.

285
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,635
- What room is he in?
- Operating room four.

286
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,716
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

287
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,871
- Network op seven.
- It's Michelle.

288
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,633
Do we get OR feeds from Good Samaritan?

289
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,676
Let me check.

290
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,397
Yeah, they do. What do you need?

291
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,798
- See if they're video-docking OR four.
- Yeah, they are. Where do you want it?

292
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,156
- Send it to my desktop.
- All right. It'll take a second.

293
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,950
- There you go. Anything else?
- No.

294
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,672
Sure.

295
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,469
- Four by four.
- More pressure.

296
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,875
- Can you hold that down?
- I've got it.

297
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,916
Got another clamp?

298
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,871
Clamp.

299
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,880
I'll lD the location for the explosives
once we get to the laundry room.

300
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,871
Your weapon, sir.

301
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,794
Sir, we're ready for you.

302
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,873
It's on. Monitor's up.
Should be seeing it on your eyepiece.

303
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,959
- It's working.
- OK.

304
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,879
Radio silence while we're in.
If they hear us, they might kill everyone.

305
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,158
Let's go.

306
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,880
All right! Round two!

307
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,599
(inmates) Yeah!

308
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,195
- And you.
- I'm a prisoner, not a guard!

309
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,880
Ram Ãn Salazar.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

310
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,838
Pick someone else.
He's telling the truth.

311
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,668
He transferred to this block less than
a week ago. I'm a federal agent.

312
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,873
I was escorting him out of the prison.
That's why you've never seen us before.

313
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,111
Good. Federal agent.

314
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,997
- What's your name?
- Jack Bauer.

315
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,872
All right! It's gonna be Agent Jack...

316
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,793
against Ram Ãn Salazar!

317
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,714
- A battle to the finish!
- (inmates) Yeah!

318
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,998
Come on, Jack.
Show this foreigner how it's done.

319
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,673
- (clicks)
- (inmates cheer)

320
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,316
If I die, my brother will find you.

321
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,715
Shut up and do it.

322
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,880
(chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

323
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,871
Do it! Do it! Do it!

324
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,956
(continue chanting)

325
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,033
(chanting) Die! Die! Die! Die!

326
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,913
- (clicks)
- (cheers/applause)

327
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,794
All right, you're up.

328
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,872
Looks like you might lose the title, Jack.

329
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,356
(chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it!

330
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,948
(continue chanting)

331
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,436
(gunshot)

332
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,873
Ram Ãn, stay down!

333
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,030
(gunfire)

334
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,872
Ram Ãn, come on.

335
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,476
All clear. Hold your fire.

336
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,871
Jack!

337
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,349
Jack!

338
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,153
(Palmer) Senator Keeler would have
you believe that I have no triumphs

339
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,874
and only defeats.

340
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,270
God.

341
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,996
(dialling)

342
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,359
- Lab.
- This is Chloe O'Brian.

343
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,314
I'm in Jack's office. Could you send
someone up with a drug kit, please?

344
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,311
On his way.

345
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,558
The differences on the issues are clear.

346
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,880
But I believe you don't elect a platform;
you elect the man.

347
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,348
I am troubled by some
of the personal choices

348
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,557
that this president has made
and continues to make.

349
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,874
We're all aware of the allegations and
indictments surrounding his former wife.

350
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,270
Most of us have operated
under the assumption

351
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,436
that he would not repeat his history

352
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,314
of associating with persons
of questionable moral character.

353
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,955
However, my office has just learned

354
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,438
that the woman with whom the president
is currently involved, Dr Anne Packard,

355
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,435
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial,

356
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,870
a drug which later led to the deaths
of three innocent people.

357
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,318
This is outrageous. This debate is not
a court of law, nor is it a tabloid paper.

358
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,880
This is neither the time nor the place
to personally attack a private citizen.

359
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,590
Mr President, the senator still has
30 more seconds, sir. Please.

360
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,153
This is the right time.

361
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,636
I believe the choices your leaders make
in their own lives

362
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,997
reflect the choices that
they will make on your behalf.

363
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,156
And so the question remains:

364
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,512
Did the president know of these accusations
and choose to ignore them?

365
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,195
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again?

366
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,675
Mr President, your rebuttal.

367
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,156
I can tell you with complete confidence
that the senator's accusation is false

368
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,559
and that I believe it is the senator's way
of avoiding the issues at hand.

369
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,229
I came here to discuss
the real issues pressing our country.

370
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,509
Oh, God.

371
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,200
- I assume that the senator...
- Now do you get it?

372
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,876
(Keeler) This is not something to be
swept under the rug and forgotten.

373
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,911
It's positive.

374
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,150
I'll go tell Michelle.

375
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,429
What are you doing in my dad's office?

376
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,869
Michelle wanted me to go through his stuff.

377
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,234
Why?

378
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,670
To find anything that could help us
understand what he's doing.

379
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,316
Can a line surge shut down a router
on your side of the lTS room?

380
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,149
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs,
not in lTS. Why?

381
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,033
It's probably nothing. Hm.

382
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,393
- Did you find anything?
- I can't talk about this.

383
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,511
- Why not? Maybe I can help.
- You can't help, so just go, OK?

384
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,429
- What's in the box?
- Stuff I'm taking to Michelle.

385
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,677
This is really inappropriate behaviour, Kim.

386
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,110
Why are you doing this?
I'm just trying to help you.

387
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,913
I don't have to have this conversation.

388
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,199
Field Op mandate regulation 40 or 41
says that I have jurisdictional prerogative.

389
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,838
- So could you just leave?
- Not until you tell me what's in the box.

390
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,356
I think your dad's been using drugs.

391
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,835
- What?
- That's right.

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,959
Rubber tourniquet... syringe.

393
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,629
We just had the vials tested for opiates.
It was positive.

394
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,955
And he's been acting really weird. OK?

395
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,993
It's really not fair that you made me do this.
This is very uncomfortable.

396
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,471
Michelle, I found nothing in Jack's records,
but there's something you need to see.

397
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,276
- This was in his office?
- I wanted to make sure what it was first.

398
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,188
The liquid in these vials tested positive
for opiates. Probably heroin.

399
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,236
I think Jack's a user.

400
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,074
A patrol car found the truck
Kyle Singer was in,

401
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,556
parked in an industrial complex
at Fuller and 4th, 2000 block.

402
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,591
Pipe this into the teams on stand-by.

403
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,793
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level-one CDC protocol.

404
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,438
Let's get him!

405
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,431
(dialling)

406
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,233
- Damn! Is there any other way out?
- No, we're pinned in.

407
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,148
You must have known this could happen.
What's the plan, Jack?

408
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,114
Give me the shotgun.

409
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,308
Give me the shotgun.

410
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,556
Take off your uniform.

411
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,399
(Palmer) I have worked with my administration

412
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,234
on my overall economic plan.
The projections could not look better.

413
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,510
(phone rings)

414
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,595
Dessler.

415
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,236
We 're approaching the complex.
There are three warehouses on the property.

416
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,874
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared.

417
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,880
(dialling)

418
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,314
- (phone rings)
- Kaufman.

419
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,316
Adam, pull up infrared satellite
on the industrial complex.

420
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,873
On it.

421
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,276
Kim, log onto the NRT server.

422
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,278
We need to see if they have
any satellites in position.

423
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,830
- Kim.
- OK.

424
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,880
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

425
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,871
(typing)

426
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,790
Jack or Salazar aren't in the east block.

427
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,192
My team can't do a search until we
lock down. That could take a half hour.

428
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,310
You wanna get out of this? You have to
trust me and do everything that I tell you.

429
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,830
- You understand?
- All right.

430
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Come on, let's go.

431
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,880
I want you to take that chopper
and sweep the perimeter.

432
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,871
(Jack) Chase!

433
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,871
- What are you doing?
- Move these people back

434
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,880
or you'll have to take me out!
We need that chopper!

435
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,873
Don't do this. I spoke with Michelle.
We're close to getting Kyle Singer.

436
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,272
"Close" ain't gonna cut it this time!
I gotta deliver Salazar now!

437
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,913
I'm not letting you go, Jack!

438
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,959
How long is it gonna take you
to find Kyle Singer?

439
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,316
A half an hour? An hour?

440
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,311
I gotta get Salazar in that chopper in the next
60 seconds or 100,000 people will die!

441
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,880
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

442
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,271
Let him go. Track the chopper. I need
you to keep your people under control.

443
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,758
Please. I can't have anything
happen to Salazar.

444
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,309
All right.

445
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,274
This is Warden Mitchell.
I want all teams to stand down.

446
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,868
Agent Bauer will take Salazar
to the SWAT chopper.

447
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,878
All teams confirm the stand-down order.

448
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,990
Let him take the chopper.

449
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,032
Stand down.

450
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,278
All right? Back off.

451
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,553
All right, Jack.
No one will try and stop you.

452
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,880
Get this men to holster their weapons!

453
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Back off! Stand down! Back off!

454
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,598
Let's move.

455
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,512
- Get them to holster their weapons!
- Holster your weapon!

456
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,631
- Lower your weapon!
- Stand down!

457
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,320
Get the snipers down off the roof!
Now! Now!

458
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,874
Get off the roof! Get off the roof!

459
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,878
Back off! Do what he says!

460
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,394
(pounding/voices)

461
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,350
We have Singer plus one.
Central, we have Singer plus one.

462
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,833
- What's he doin'?
- Disabled the com and the locator.

463
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,075
(cellphone ringing)

464
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,869
Yeah?

465
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,876
It's Michelle. We have Kyle Singer.

466
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,430
- I can't hear you!
- We found Kyle Singer!

467
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,393
- They found Kyle?
- Yes!

468
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,880
Jack! Jack! We found Kyle Singer! Jack!

469
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,555
Jack! Jack! Jack!

470
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,916
(inaudible)

471
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,468
..talk about facts and figures
all night, Mr President.

472
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,879
Once again, I see this as a question
of judgment and integrity.

473
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,914
You ignore this issue, an issue
of rectitude and foresightedness...

474
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,555
Congratulations. Now you are an even
bigger enemy to your country than I am.
