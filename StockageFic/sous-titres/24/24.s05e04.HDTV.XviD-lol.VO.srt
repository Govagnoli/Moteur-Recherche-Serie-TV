1
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:13,934
The terrorists
are controlling

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,901
the main terminal
at Ontario Airport.

3
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:18,367
Today, your president
and the president of Russia

4
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:22,300
have come together to sign
an anti-terrorism alliance.

5
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,167
I have hostages.

6
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,234
( on TV ):
Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,300
make a joint statement
repudiating this accord,

8
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,100
I will order their execution.

9
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,701
I want this handled!

10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,601
Do you understand?

11
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:36,767
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes.

12
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,701
Fix it!

13
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,167
David Palmer called me
last night.

14
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:44,033
He said it was a matter
of national security.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,701
Those were his exact words.

16
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,701
PALMER:
I need to talk to you.

17
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,467
It's hardly a matter
of national security.

18
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,267
That's not what he said.
Yes, it is.

19
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,033
No, that is a trick.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,167
MARTHA:
I know that all phone
conversations are recorded.

21
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,234
Where do they store
those transcripts?

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,234
Archive room,
down the hall.

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,667
This is Bill Buchanan.

24
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,901
I'm hoping we can
resolve this peacefully.

25
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:06,367
I don't think you understand
just how serious we are.

26
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,234
You make any efforts
to enter the tunnel,

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,434
you will spend the rest of
the day collecting body parts.

28
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:13,701
Jack, I'm going to need you

29
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:14,634
to quarterback this thing
from inside.

30
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,767
I'm staring straight down

31
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,200
on the main concourse.

32
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,968
We've got six hostiles
wearing explosive vests.

33
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,334
We have to assume their orders

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,100
are to detonate
if we try to make a move.

35
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,067
Hey, I got a woman--
Diane Huxley--

36
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,601
says she has info for CTU.

37
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,834
Diane, what's going on?
What's wrong?

38
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,734
Derek is inside the terminal.

39
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,534
You!

40
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:31,801
No...

41
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,234
JACK:
Curtis, they're moving

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,033
another one of the hostages.

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,934
Oh, my God, it's Derek.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,434
You have a problem
at the terminal.

45
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:40,133
Jack Bauer is inside
providing recon

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,701
for CTU's rescue operation.

47
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,367
( loud static )

48
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,200
Mr. Bauer,

49
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,267
Derek has five
seconds left to live.

50
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,434
Four, three...

51
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,801
Beresch!

52
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,934
We've been trying from here,

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but we still
can't make contact with Jack.

54
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,367
Can you make a visual, Curtis?

55
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,300
Negative.

56
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,667
Maybe Jack went dark
intentionally.

57
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:21,000
Unlikely. He was
talking to us

58
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,400
when his transmission
cut off.

59
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,367
We have to assume
he's been captured or killed.

60
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,434
Which means we need to mount
this assault without his help.

61
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,868
Without Jack
directing our teams,

62
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,901
success probability
falls to less than 20%.

63
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,901
President Logan is going
to sign this treaty

64
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,300
in less than an hour.

65
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,100
If the terrorists
are still in control,

66
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,400
they'll kill
all the hostages.

67
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,300
What do you want
me to do, Bill?

68
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,100
Work up an assault plan
that doesn't include Jack.

69
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,467
All right, I'm going back
to the staging area.

70
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,200
We'll coordinate from there.

71
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,801
Back to your stations.

72
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,567
Prepare to reconfigure.

73
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,200
All teams,
stand down.

74
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,234
We're working up
a new mission profile.

75
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:15,400
Mr. Bauer,
what is CTU's assault plan?

76
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,234
The boy means something to you--
otherwise,

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,701
you wouldn't have given
yourself up so easily.

78
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,667
Tell me the plan.

79
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,400
They're going to storm

80
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,734
the north concourse doors
on my command.

81
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:36,067
I'm coordinating the operation
from in here.

82
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,400
Is there anyone else inside?

83
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,868
No.

84
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,834
Get me the plans
to the terminal.

85
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,767
You've been a great help.

86
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:51,133
We'll keep the boy alive now.

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Bring me
another hostage.

88
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,801
Anything you do in here today

89
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,367
will not stop that treaty
from being signed.

90
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,167
The United States Government

91
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,234
does not negotiate with
terrorists-- you know that.

92
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,667
Your president is a weak man.

93
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,767
He'll back down
once more blood is spilled.

94
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:14,467
Not him.

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,234
Move! Move!
I'm not your enemy...

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,234
Please... Please,
you don't have to do this.

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Vlad.

98
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:33,567
I can help you buy
more time-- please!

99
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,968
No! You don't have
to do this now.

100
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,868
CTU was supposed to have raided
the terminal by now.

101
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,801
Why haven't we
heard from them?

102
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,367
Bill Buchanan said
they had a setback.

103
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:53,868
What kind of setback?

104
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,534
They lost contact
with Jack Bauer.

105
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,033
( phone ringing )
Why? What happened to him?

106
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,801
They're not sure
what happened to him,

107
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:02,501
but they need to reconfigure
their assault plan. Yeah.

108
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,834
I'll tell the President.

109
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:09,133
Beresch is transmitting
from the terminal.

110
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
He's got
another hostage.

111
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,167
BERESCH:
We have waited patiently

112
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,434
for you to renounce
this unholy pact

113
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:19,801
with our oppressors,
but we have heard nothing.

114
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:24,467
This is the cost
of that silence.

115
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,934
( gunshot )

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,033
( hostages screaming )

117
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,334
BERESCH:
What happens next is
your choice, Mr. President.

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,901
If you choose to sign
this corrupt document,

119
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,467
understand that you will also be

120
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:43,100
staining it with the blood
of the remaining hostages.

121
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,434
If CTU can't pull
this off in time,

122
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,067
that's upwards
of 60 people, Mike.

123
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,701
You know I've never
done anything

124
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,367
in my presidency
that I didn't feel

125
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,701
was right for the country.

126
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,734
Of course not, sir.

127
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,234
Nobody thinks otherwise.

128
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,467
I know I'm ambitious,

129
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,267
that I want this treaty to be
the hallmark of my presidency,

130
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:15,234
but I never thought I would
sacrifice innocent life.

131
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,501
Mr. President,

132
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,634
you are not responsible for
the actions of these murderers.

133
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,133
I could postpone this.
Sir?!

134
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,634
I give them what they want,
maybe nobody else has to die.

135
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,801
Do you think these
people would actually
release the hostages?

136
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,701
We both know that
would never happen.

137
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,667
You're doing the only thing
you can do.

138
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:44,901
TV REPORTER:
The terrorists, calling the
treaty an "unholy pact..."

139
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,734
Mrs. Logan, if someone
altered the recording,

140
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,367
of your conversation
with David Palmer,

141
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,167
the President needs to know.

142
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,267
No. Not now. Not yet.

143
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,968
What are you waiting for?

144
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,434
Charles is much
too preoccupied.

145
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,767
Between the summit and
the hostage situation,

146
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,734
he's not in the frame of
mind to deal with this.

147
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,367
Besides, he thinks
I'm unstable.

148
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,767
Which means I have
to show it to him

149
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,000
in just the right way.

150
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,534
So, until the treaty is signed,

151
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,234
I'm not letting this
out of my sight.

152
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,968
( indistinct
radio transmissions )

153
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,334
What's happening?

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,834
I'm sorry, I don't
have time to explain.

155
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,200
You said you were going in
to get the hostages.

156
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,734
We lost contact with Jack.

157
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,067
What does that mean?

158
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,300
We're not sure
what happened.

159
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,033
But we need to change
our assault plan.

160
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,467
Is Jack okay?
We don't know.

161
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:34,834
What about Derek?
As soon as we get

162
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,133
more information,
I'll make sure you're told.

163
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,234
Please, I...

164
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,334
Ms. Huxley...
I need to go.

165
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,634
REPORTER:
The situation here continues
to grow more tragic.

166
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,100
We've just received
a video feed

167
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,868
confirming that another hostage
has been executed

168
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:56,234
inside the main terminal
at Ontario Airport.

169
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,634
Jack...
Don't say anything.

170
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,234
We're going to get through this.

171
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,901
Just don't say anything
right now.

172
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,400
TV REPORTER:
...White House spokesperson
confirms

173
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,167
and reiterates
the President's intention

174
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,968
to sign the historic pact
with his Russian counterpart

175
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,067
as scheduled.

176
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,901
You're going to call CTU

177
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:26,934
and tell them you've revised
your assault profile.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,901
Tell them to come
to the emergency door

179
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,534
south of gate 12.

180
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,934
They won't just do that
because I ask them to.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,501
They'll need an explanation.

182
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,901
That's your concern,
Mr. Bauer.

183
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,801
Overwrite volume four
with the approach vectors,

184
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,267
and re-key with
the airport grid.

185
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,067
Okay, hold on,
just for one second.

186
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,334
We don't have one second.
We're running out of time
to save the hostages.

187
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,734
Want some help, Spenser?

188
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,534
He doesn't need
any help.

189
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,434
Just keep managing it
two-ways or else we're
gonna have dropout.

190
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,467
Excuse me.

191
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,667
You're Ms. O'Brian, right?

192
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,767
Who are you?

193
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,300
Lynn McGill.
I'm from District.

194
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,000
I met you when you came out for
that memory management lecture.

195
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,267
If you say so.
What do you need?

196
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,200
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan.
Is he around?

197
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,234
He's in the Situation Room.
He's kind of busy right now.

198
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,234
I see him. Thanks.

199
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,267
I look forward to
working with you today.

200
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,734
You don't know
who Lynn McGill is, do you?

201
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:27,434
No, and I don't care.
Get back to work.

202
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,133
BUCHANAN:
Once Curtis and his
teams go in there,

203
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,133
I want an update

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,267
on deployment of HRT.

205
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,200
Hi.

206
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,734
Mr. Buchanan, I assume
they told you I was coming.

207
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,701
Lynn, please... call me Bill.

208
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,033
If we were having a beer
or something,

209
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,434
but at work,
it's better if we maintain

210
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,534
a more formal mode of address.

211
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,734
Whatever makes you
feel comfortable.

212
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:58,501
Look, we're in the middle
of final prep here...

213
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,100
I know; I understand President
Logan wants us

214
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,667
to go into the terminal
as soon as possible.

215
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:03,968
Yes, before the
treaty is signed.

216
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,367
Is Curtis Manning ready
to send his teams in?

217
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,300
He is, but we're flying blind.

218
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,767
My briefing sheet says
that we have Jack Bauer

219
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,601
on the inside.
And we haven't heard

220
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,868
from him for close
to 20 minutes now.

221
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,133
Well, that's interesting.

222
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,300
Lynn, I read the bulletin
from Division,

223
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,501
but I still don't know
why you're here.

224
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,667
District was getting heat
from the White House.

225
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:23,667
Heat about what?

226
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,133
Jack Bauer.

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
They just want to know things
are running smoothly.

228
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,400
We're on track, Lynn.

229
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:29,534
Well, I'm sure you are...

230
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,834
but that's my assignment.

231
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,834
Is your tactical wired through
to all the servers?

232
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:35,300
Yes, it is-- you can go ahead
and plug into Station Four.

233
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,734
I'd prefer to work from
your office, Mr. Buchanan.

234
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,334
I hate to displace you,

235
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,367
but I think I should have
a central vantage point,

236
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,901
and I just want to make sure
that you're okay

237
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:44,968
working from another station.

238
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,200
Fine.

239
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,968
Good.

240
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,534
And, uh, it's not a big deal,

241
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,300
but just so that everyone's
clear on the chain of command,

242
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:54,968
I think you should address me
as Mr. McGill

243
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,934
in front of
the others.

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,567
You know, Lynn,
I'd rather not.

245
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,000
Just a suggestion.

246
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,534
Anyway, I need your office.
And that's not a suggestion.

247
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,501
( intercom beeps )
Fine.

248
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,100
( over intercom ):
Mr. Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer
on line one.

249
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,100
Is Curtis plugged into
this call?

250
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,167
CURTIS:
I'm on, Bill.

251
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,667
Go ahead, put Jack through.

252
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,200
( over intercom ):
You're both on with Jack Bauer.

253
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,534
Jack, what happened?

254
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,767
One of the hostiles
got too close,

255
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,601
I had to end
the transmission.

256
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,501
CURTIS:
All right, we'll restart
the countdown.

257
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,701
Negative, Curtis.

258
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,801
We need to scrap
the existing plan,

259
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,400
find a new breach point.

260
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,067
My men are already
in position.

261
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,801
They moved the hostages
within the kill zone.

262
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,400
They'll be taken out
with the crossfire.

263
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,100
There's an emergency door
just south of gate 12.

264
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,634
It's unguarded.

265
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,601
You should be able to punch
through with no opposition.

266
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,567
I see it, but I'm not
comfortable with
this entry point.

267
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:49,267
It's the only shot
we've got.

268
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,734
Are you there now?

269
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,100
Yes. It's clear.

270
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,901
I'm in a flank two position.

271
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,701
I repeat,
I am in flank two position.

272
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,667
Curtis, how long before
your teams can redeploy?

273
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:00,968
About 20 minutes.

274
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,434
The President's going
to sign that treaty

275
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,901
within 30 minutes.

276
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,567
I'll go as fast
as I can.

277
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,934
Jack, I'll call you when
my men are in position.
You can call us in.

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,968
Copy that.
I'll be standing by.

279
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,100
Ivan and Ishmael,

280
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,167
stay with the hostages.

281
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,934
The rest of you
come here.

282
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,234
Vlad, guard them.

283
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,534
Manning.

284
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,501
It's Buchanan.

285
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,634
How long until your people are

286
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,901
ready to move on the terrorists?

287
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:50,901
About 15 minutes.

288
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,267
Why so long?

289
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,167
When Jack called and
changed the breach point,

290
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,100
I had to modify everything,
including the explosives.

291
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,667
They have to be
repositioned
precisely.

292
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,133
Maybe it's a mistake
to write down

293
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,801
Jack's new information.
It might take too long.

294
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:03,300
Jack's aware of our deadline.
If he didn't think it was worth

295
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,067
the delay, he wouldn't
have made the call.

296
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,234
I trust him.

297
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,267
All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

298
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,067
You have to make this happen.

299
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,567
I will.

300
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,100
Call when you're in position.

301
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,801
Mr. Buchanan? Mr. McGill needs
to see you in his office.

302
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,400
It'll have to wait.
Tell him I'm busy.

303
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:19,734
He said it had to be now.

304
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,334
Fine.

305
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,434
No, I'm settled in fine.

306
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,300
If I need anything, I'll call.
Thanks, Donna.

307
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,934
What is it, Lynn?
I'm up to my ears

308
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,801
trying to coordinate this
hostage situation.

309
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:38,267
Sit down, Mr. Buchanan.

310
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,901
Would you stop
with the "Mr. Buchanan"?

311
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,834
We need to get this assault
in motion now.

312
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,634
Sit down, Bill.

313
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:52,434
I informed the White House
that the rescue operation
is back on track.

314
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,400
Thank you.

315
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,801
I must admit, though, I felt

316
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,868
a little inappropriate
talking about an operation

317
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,334
that I didn't personally review,

318
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,434
so before you send your
men into the terminal,

319
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,200
I'd like to see the Playbook.

320
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,400
Look, I can't have you

321
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,000
micro-managing
my work here, Lynn.

322
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:07,267
If you want to do my job,
just let me know.

323
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:08,267
I'll go home.

324
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,367
Please don't be defensive.

325
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:10,834
I'm not challenging you.

326
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,267
I'm just trying to do my job.

327
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,734
( sighs )

328
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:15,667
I'll have Chloe send it
to your laptop.

329
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,033
Anything else?

330
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,400
That's all for now.

331
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,234
Bill?

332
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,667
Fighting me isn't going
to increase our chances

333
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,067
of saving those people's lives.

334
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,434
Lynn wants to look
at the revised assault plan.

335
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:44,901
Send it to him.

336
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,400
Does that mean he's running
point, instead of you?

337
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,534
It just means he wants
to see the plan, Chloe.

338
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,868
Bill, Curtis
just confirmed

339
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,968
that his team will be ready
in ten minutes

340
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,167
based on Jack's new intel.

341
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,367
TV REPORTER:
As of this time, there is no
word as to whether

342
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,367
or not the president is going to
call off the signing

343
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,400
of the historic treaty agreement
between the United States

344
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,400
and Russia scheduled
for just under an hour.

345
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,667
There been any response
from the White House

346
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,200
since we killed
the last hostage?

347
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,868
They released their statement
confirming the signing

348
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:15,067
of the treaty is going
ahead as planned.

349
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:17,267
They won't capitulate,
as long as they think

350
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,267
their rescue attempt
will succeed.

351
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,100
Once we kill them, then

352
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,901
they'll realize their
options have run out.

353
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,300
The only chance these people
had of being rescued

354
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,701
is gone because of me.

355
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,534
People were going to die here
today, Derek.

356
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,834
That was their plan.
This is not your fault.

357
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,601
I'm the reason you went
along with them.

358
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,400
If I wasn't here...

359
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,200
Stop it.
( sniffling )

360
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,968
This is not over.

361
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:00,901
TV REPORTER:
While there has been
no official rebuke

362
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,868
of the terrorists' demands,
statements from the White House

363
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,934
appear to confirm the
president's position

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,434
is unchanged, and that the
treaty will be signed

365
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,501
within the hour, as scheduled.

366
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,767
That puts the lives
of the approximately 60 men,

367
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,634
women and children being held as
hostage in question.

368
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,801
Were the terrorists to carry out
their intentions...

369
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,267
Good news, sir.

370
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,567
CTU has reestablished contact
with Jack Bauer.

371
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,367
The rescue operation

372
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,100
is back on track.

373
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,100
But that's still
no guarantee.

374
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,634
Excuse me, sir?

375
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,334
The hostages may be killed
when we go in there.

376
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,234
Let's be honest.
That's more likely than not.

377
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,133
We don't know that, sir.

378
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,300
President Suvarov
is waiting for you outside.

379
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,734
You're walking
outside together

380
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,100
onto the stage.

381
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,501
We all agreed to the protocol.

382
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,701
It's time already?

383
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,534
Yes, sir.

384
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:58,100
Mr. President.
Shall we?

385
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,734
My people have just
informed me that the
assault has been delayed.

386
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,133
It's happening now.
It will happen

387
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,868
before the treaty is signed.
Don't worry.

388
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:08,767
Mr. President, like you,
I have staked

389
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:12,167
much of my political future
on the success of this treaty.

390
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:15,033
If this rescue
attempt fails

391
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,901
it will not only be
rendered meaningless,

392
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:21,167
it will become
a mockery.

393
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,367
And so will we.

394
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,968
I'm here to escort
Mrs. Logan.

395
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,467
The ceremony's beginning
any minute.

396
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,100
She'll be out in a moment.

397
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,234
Oh, may I...

398
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,267
have a word?

399
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:53,100
You're aware Mrs. Logan
was found in one of
the archive rooms?

400
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,667
Uh... I don't know
anything about that.

401
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,200
Aaron Pierce said
you lied to him.

402
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:01,367
You told him Mrs. Logan
was in her room, when
she was actually

403
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:03,033
going through classified
documents.

404
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,567
I don't think you understand
just how

405
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:06,701
grave this situation is.

406
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,234
What do you mean?

407
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,400
Mrs. Logan removed a document
from the archive

408
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,868
that contains highly-sensitive

409
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,567
intelligence protocols.

410
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,701
That's not what
she said it was.

411
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,968
What exactly did she say
she took?

412
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:20,334
I think that you should
talk to her about this.

413
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,901
Evelyn, this is important.

414
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,300
What did she tell you?

415
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,067
She said it was a transcript
of a call she had

416
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,334
with David Palmer.

417
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,567
And I'm sure when she said that,
she believed it.

418
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:35,367
You're aware if this
document finds its way
into the wrong hands,

419
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:36,734
that you'll be held responsible.

420
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:38,067
I'm not the one who took it.

421
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,534
No, you aided
and abetted.

422
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:42,133
You'll not only lose your job,
you'll be prosecuted.

423
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,567
That's not fair.
Hmm...

424
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,434
I tried to talk
her out of this.

425
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,834
Look, all I'm asking is that you
tell me where did she put it.

426
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,968
She has it with her.
It's in her blouse.

427
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,067
She said she wouldn't let it out
of her sight until she talked

428
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,367
to the president about it.

429
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,467
( door opens )

430
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:00,033
Walt?

431
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,267
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm ready now.

432
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,567
( door shuts )

433
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:17,234
Presidents Logan and Suvarov
will each make statements,

434
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,968
which will be followed
by the signing of the treaty.

435
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,934
There will be several photo
opportunities...

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
How much time will there
be between the moment

437
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,934
I step out on stage and
when I sign the document?

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,601
Not long.

439
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,501
Does CTU know that's
how long they have to
launch the rescue attempt?

440
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,901
Yes, sir. They're
completely synchronized

441
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,234
with what's
going on here.

442
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,133
( sighs )
I hope so.

443
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,300
The lives of those hostages
depend on it.

444
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,133
( spokesman speaking
indistinctly )

445
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,501
Today was supposed to be

446
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,467
the crowning achievement
of my presidency.

447
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:46,834
Instead, everybody's
waiting to hear

448
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,334
what's going to happen
at the airport.

449
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,100
( chuckles, sighs )

450
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,133
So, how are you feeling?

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,968
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

452
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,367
How come you
just keep getting
better looking as you

453
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,000
get older, and I just
keep getting older?

454
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,667
What are you talking about?

455
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,300
You're the most beautiful
first lady

456
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,767
Pennsylvania Avenue
has ever seen.

457
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,501
( spokesman speaking
indistinctly )

458
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:15,167
Ladies and gentlemen,

459
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:18,234
President Logan
and President Suvarov.

460
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,000
The treaty signing is a minute
and a half ahead of schedule.

461
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,334
Should you call Curtis
and let him know?

462
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,501
He might need to speed up
the assault prep.

463
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,901
No. Curtis is moving
as fast as he can.

464
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,734
A call from me isn't gonna make
him move any faster.

465
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,801
I just thought
he might like to...

466
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,234
I said no, Chloe.

467
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,200
The only way to make
sure the assault
happens in time

468
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:48,300
to save the hostages is to try
to slow down the signing.

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,033
What's wrong with Buchanan?

470
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,801
Nothing.
I think he just realizes

471
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,934
we're not gonna be able to save
the hostages.

472
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,834
Before we begin the treaty
signing, I would like to address

473
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,233
what's happening
just a few miles away from here.

474
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,801
As you know, terrorists have
already taken innocent life

475
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,967
in an attempt to stop
this historic treaty

476
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,867
from being signed.

477
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,934
President Suvarov
will not let this happen.

478
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:33,367
I will not let this happen!

479
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,200
BUCHANAN:
Yes, Mike?

480
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:38,200
Bill, I should have heard
from you by now.

481
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,567
Have your men gone in yet?
We're not quite ready.

482
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,134
You have to go in now.

483
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,034
The president's about to sign
that treaty.

484
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:46,267
I understand.
We're pushing as hard as we can.

485
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,600
In the meantime,
is there anything

486
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,333
you can do on your end?
Like what?

487
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,534
Can you stall things?

488
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,101
Can you slow down
the ceremony?

489
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:54,567
Bill, the entire world
is watching this

490
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,567
on live television.

491
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,934
The presidents of
the United States and Russia

492
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,600
are on stage now.

493
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,834
This process
has been set in motion.

494
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,567
No, I can't stall.

495
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:06,567
Okay, I'll call you back.

496
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,534
No. You stay on the phone
with me.

497
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,967
I need to know the moment
your people go in.

498
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:12,901
Yes, sir.

499
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,600
( people clapping )

500
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,600
This barbaric lawlessness
that's taking place

501
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:20,034
at Ontario Airport
only underscores the need...

502
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:23,701
the necessity for this accord

503
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:27,034
and for our continued vigilance
and commitment

504
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:30,034
to fighting terrorism
around the world.

505
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,667
It looks like President Logan

506
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:33,467
is going through
with the signing.

507
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:36,534
He said he's not going
to give in to your demands.

508
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,500
Are you sure
this is going to work?

509
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,934
It will work.

510
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,600
And the reason the president
is so confident is that

511
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,068
he thinks his rescue attempt
will save the day.

512
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:47,934
Are you sure you can
fend off that assault?
As soon as

513
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,834
the CTU agents
come through the entry point

514
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,200
that Jack Bauer fed to them
they'll all be killed.

515
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,867
One of the president's aides
will then walk up to the podium

516
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:58,967
and whisper into his ear
that there'll be no rescue,

517
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:02,134
that his signature on the treaty

518
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
will be the death warrant
of the hostages.

519
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:06,967
That will stop him,
I assure you.

520
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,634
Well, just in case you're wrong
and he signs the treaty,

521
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:13,467
you be ready
to carry out your threat.

522
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,901
Every one of my men
is committed to doing

523
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,300
what needs to be done today.

524
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,001
We've upgraded our estimate
of how many wounded there'll be.

525
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,034
I need ten more ambulances
at the airport before we launch.

526
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,600
Right.

527
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,500
The rescue operation
you're about to execute

528
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,534
is radically changed
from your initial approach.

529
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,367
It was revised based on new
intelligence from Jack Bauer.

530
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:34,567
Which he phoned in
after going dark

531
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:35,701
for nearly 20 minutes;
I was there.

532
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,168
Right.
I need to call you back.

533
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,333
Well, I can't say that

534
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,801
his explanation
for being out of touch

535
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,001
is entirely satisfactory.

536
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:43,034
Jack said he was trying
to avoid detection.

537
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,667
Wh-What are you suggesting?

538
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,567
There's too many unusual
circumstances at work here--
I want to try

539
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,400
to understand it better
before we send our people in.

540
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,168
I'll need the entire
transcripts of your

541
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,400
communications with Mr. Bauer
since he's been inside.

542
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,400
To what end?

543
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,634
Thoroughness.
I don't need

544
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,801
a sorting run on the calls,

545
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:57,901
just the raw transcripts'll
be fine.

546
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,233
Fine, I'll send them to you.

547
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,267
Thank you.

548
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,467
Curtis is on line three.

549
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,101
Curtis, what's your situation?

550
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,200
My men are in place, and we're
setting the entry charges.

551
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,867
Any complications?
No.

552
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,667
We're also jamming
the trigger frequency

553
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,734
so Beresch can't detonate
the vests remotely.

554
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:17,934
We should be able to make
our entry on target.
Good.

555
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,068
( ringing )

556
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:36,667
O'Brian.

557
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,300
Uh, Miss O'Brian,
I'm trying to understand

558
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,967
the transcript of
Jack's last call to CTU,
and there are...

559
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,801
Mr. McGill, I'm really
busy trying to help keep
this revised assault

560
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,500
on schedule--
what do you need?
I understand,

561
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,001
and I don't want to
slow you down, but
I'd appreciate it

562
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:51,267
if you'd unlock
volume five-- there
are a few things

563
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:54,300
that I'd like to see.
I don't need to know
what you'd like to see.

564
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,600
Okay, it's unlocked.

565
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,801
Good.

566
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:02,068
This Lynn McGill person's
really slowing things down.

567
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,168
Yeah, that's his style.

568
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,867
I worked with him
once before.

569
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,233
He usually loses about...

570
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,333
20% of his staff in the
first couple of days

571
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,834
after taking control
of a new office.

572
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:12,101
That many people quit?
No.

573
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:13,867
Most of them are fired.

574
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:16,534
In the volatile climate

575
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,300
of the 21st century, the sharing
of deterrent technologies

576
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,667
by responsible powers

577
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:26,767
is the surest guarantee
of global peace.

578
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,634
But let this accord be proof

579
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:32,333
that our two great nations

580
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,967
stand together
in their commitment

581
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:39,567
to fight the enemies
of peace and freedom.

582
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:47,534
( panting ):
Akhmed found Chevensky.

583
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,168
He's dead.

584
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,901
He killed himself--
we found him in
the baggage room.

585
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,333
What about the key card?

586
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,901
Chevensky had it hidden
right where he said he would.

587
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:01,534
BERESCH:
The rest of you
will work cleanup

588
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,801
on whoever makes it through
that line of fire.

589
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,567
Assume CTU is in body armor,

590
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:07,068
so go for the head shot.

591
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,767
You... and you,

592
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,500
guard the hostages.

593
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:15,434
Kill anyone

594
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,001
who tries to break away.

595
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:41,068
the black night is broken

596
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,034
by the dawning
of the light of global peace.

597
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,068
( phone ringing )

598
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:52,867
( ringing continues )

599
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,867
Curtis.

600
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,400
Jack, my men
are in place.
Okay.

601
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:04,367
Now, remember,
I am in a flank two position--

602
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:07,267
make sure your men don't hit me
when they come in.

603
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,100
Roger that. Ready to start
the countdown on your word.

604
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:14,500
Jack?

605
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,934
( panting )

606
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,734
Move in at your discretion.

607
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,968
All teams,
we have a green light.

608
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,801
Counting down from 60 seconds
on my mark.

609
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,034
Now.

610
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,801
Jack, we'll see
you inside.

611
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:32,400
Everyone, 60 seconds.

612
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,968
( rhythmic beeping )

613
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,834
( beeping continues )

614
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:02,801
Stop the assault!
Put Curtis on the phone.
What are you talking about?

615
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:05,634
They're walking into a trap.
Look at the transcript.

616
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:08,467
When Jack issued the
command directive, he
used the term "Flank two."

617
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:10,167
Yes, he was trying to
give us his position.

618
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,434
inside the terminal.
No, he wasn't.

619
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,367
"Flank two" is a duress code
used to indicate

620
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:14,834
the agent is communicating
under duress.

621
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,167
We ran Jack's calls through

622
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,667
a protocol filter--
if there'd been

623
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,267
a duress signal in there,
it would've found it.

624
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:20,867
You filtered through
the current codes.

625
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:24,001
When Jack was active,
"Flank two" was
a duress code.

626
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,601
Chloe, confirm that.

627
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:31,400
Jack is trying to tell
us he's being used to
send misinformation.

628
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:34,867
If Curtis Manning's teams
go in now, they'll be ambushed.

629
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,068
He's right.

630
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,801
Curtis, abort the countdown.
Repeat, abort, abort.

631
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:41,567
Stand down.
All teams stand down.

632
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,133
We're aborting entry.
Repeat, we're aborting entry.

633
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,734
Confirm that
we're standing down.

634
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:48,567
What's wrong?
We detected a duress code
in Jack's call.

635
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,300
We have to assume that
terrorists are feeding him

636
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,867
the information
he gave us.

637
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,400
Redeploy your men according
to the original assault plan

638
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,001
and do not contact Jack.

639
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,233
If Jack contacts you,
buy time.

640
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,534
Copy that. We're moving.

641
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,367
You're gonna outflank
the terrorists?

642
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:03,667
Yes.

643
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:06,701
That should work.

644
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,001
CURTIS:
All teams, reposition for entry

645
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,068
through the east and north
gates-- plan Bravo, repeat,

646
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,701
plan Bravo through
the east and north gates. Go!

647
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:14,834
Acknowledged.

648
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,634
Redeploy protocol one.

649
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,233
What's happening?
Ma'am, I need you

650
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,934
to step back
to the vehicle.

651
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,434
He said 60 seconds

652
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,634
three minutes ago.

653
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:50,100
What is CTU waiting for?!
I don't know.

654
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,100
You heard what I heard.

655
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,567
( rings )
It's Jack.

656
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,267
Jack.

657
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:00,634
What's happening?

658
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,801
There was a malfunction
on the entry charges.

659
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,934
What's the time frame?
Any minute.

660
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,567
They're resetting
the detonators.

661
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,934
Stand by.

662
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:09,267
Copy that.

663
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:13,467
They're in position.

664
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,200
Stay ready!

665
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,001
( phone rings )

666
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:43,334
Yeah.

667
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,667
Is it done?

668
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:48,200
No. CTU hasn't attacked yet.

669
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:50,400
You said it would happen
before the signing.

670
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,734
And you told me the president
would never let it go this far.

671
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,834
He's signing it.

672
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,834
You have no choice.

673
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,300
Kill them all.

674
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:50,901
No!

675
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,200
( explosion )

676
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,367
You okay?
Yeah.

677
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:10,034
CURTIS:
Secure the terminal.

678
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,667
Besides the hostiles,

679
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:12,901
there appears to be
no further casualties.

680
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:15,034
Repeat: remaining hostages
are unharmed.

681
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,133
Good work, Curtis.

682
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,834
You get that, Mike?

683
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:20,601
Yeah...

684
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:28,034
( inaudible whispering )

685
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:37,133
Mr. President,

686
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,867
I have some good news.

687
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:42,034
I have just received word

688
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,167
that the crisis at
the Ontario Airport is over.

689
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:48,267
The rescue operation
that I authorized

690
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,567
was successful.

691
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,834
The terrorists have been
captured or killed.

692
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:55,068
And, best of all,
this has all been accomplished

693
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,901
with no further loss
of innocent life.

694
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:01,001
( applauding )

695
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,801
Excuse me, agent!

696
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,100
My name is Jack Bauer.

697
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,400
I know who you are, sir.

698
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,901
Can I use your pick?

699
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,601
This is Derek Huxley.

700
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,634
His mother is waiting for him
at the command post.

701
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:20,434
Can you please
take him there?

702
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,467
Of course.

703
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:22,601
What about you?

704
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,167
Come here.

705
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,500
I have to finish this.

706
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,968
Go take care of your mother.

707
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,367
Yeah.
Okay.

708
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,968
Go.

709
00:33:58,634 --> 00:33:59,834
I'm missing one.

710
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,200
Everybody, I need
your attention.

711
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:08,001
We're looking for a man who
was being held here with you.

712
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,867
He's a white male, mid-30s.

713
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,968
He was wearing
a bright yellow tie.

714
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:15,167
Did anyone see him leave?
Anyone?

715
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:21,701
Keep the hostages here
until I get back.

716
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:34,067
( sniffling )

717
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,268
Mom!

718
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,034
Derek!

719
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,634
( crying )

720
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,467
Oh, God...

721
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,867
They were going to kill me.

722
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:00,134
Jack saved my life.

723
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,967
He saves everyone's life.

724
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,367
Mrs. Huxley,
I need you and your son

725
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:07,834
to follow me.

726
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:09,467
( sniffles )

727
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:10,934
Can I see Jack Bauer?

728
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:13,101
I'm sorry, I have instructions
to transport you

729
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:14,400
to CTU.

730
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:16,001
This way, please.

731
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,967
( applause )

732
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,867
Thank you.

733
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,168
Charles?

734
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,534
Oh, watch your step.

735
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,234
I need to talk to you.

736
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,801
Sweetheart...

737
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,634
smile, it's over.

738
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,634
Charles, I just need a few
minutes alone with you.

739
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Yes... soon.

740
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,067
No!

741
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:47,834
Not soon, right now--
this is very important.

742
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:51,467
Martha, when I am done
with this, I'll call for you.

743
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,801
I promise.

744
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:55,201
All right, this ends now.

745
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:57,134
I have played my role
without interfering.

746
00:35:57,201 --> 00:36:00,500
Now it is time for
you to attend to me.

747
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:01,901
And I will.

748
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:03,767
Charles, do not
patronize me!

749
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:04,901
Something is going on.

750
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,300
I am not crying
wolf again.

751
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,500
Martha...

752
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:15,134
please... do not ruin
this moment for me.

753
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,001
We'll talk later.

754
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,767
Martha.

755
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:28,034
Everything all right?

756
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,034
No, it's not
all right.

757
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:32,300
I have to talk
to my husband.

758
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,634
The situation is more dangerous
than he realizes.

759
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,600
Whoa, and what
situation is that?

760
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,834
I'm sorry, Walt.

761
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:44,600
I can only talk
to Charles about this.

762
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,834
Curtis just confirmed

763
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,101
the area's been contained

764
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,667
and their reporting
only minor injuries

765
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,400
among the hostages.
Good, thank you.

766
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:06,867
You should probably
route all field updates

767
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,101
through Mr. McGill,

768
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,901
for the time being.
Oh, okay.

769
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,101
Thanks.

770
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,600
Bill, if you have a moment.

771
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,234
Lynn, uh, before you
say anything,

772
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,433
I owe you an apology.

773
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,734
For what?

774
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,001
Well, if you hadn't recognized
the duress code

775
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,801
that Jack transmitted, well...

776
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,534
Bill, you're the reason I
figured out what he was doing.

777
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,268
What do you mean?

778
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,600
Well, I admit,
I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer,

779
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,034
but you were so adamant

780
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:32,534
about his integrity
that I just...

781
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,500
looked for a way to reconcile
the contradiction, so...

782
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,867
thank you.

783
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:42,801
I assume Mr. Bauer's
been taken into custody?

784
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,268
Well, I plan to debrief him
here, but not as a suspect.

785
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,367
Well, he hasn't been
officially cleared
in the deaths

786
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,168
of David Palmer
or Michelle Dessler.

787
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,667
Well, based
on mitigating evidence

788
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:53,168
in Chloe O'Brian's testimony,
we're confident that Jack

789
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:54,634
was framed for those murders.

790
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,801
I appreciate that,
but it still doesn't change

791
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:58,001
a very tangled situation.

792
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,634
I mean, we have
surveillance footage

793
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,967
that places Jack Bauer

794
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:03,234
at the site
of David Palmer's assassination.

795
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,934
Well, clearly, it was doctored.

796
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,600
Not according
to preliminary tests.

797
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,767
If we're gonna get
to the bottom of this,

798
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,001
Jack Bauer has a lot
to answer for.

799
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:13,867
Bring him in now.

800
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,467
The rest
of the terminal's clear.

801
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,867
MANNING:
Jack.

802
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,101
It's good to
see you again.

803
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:33,467
It's good to see you.

804
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:35,734
We've got a problem--
one of the hostages is missing.

805
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,400
He was working
with the terrorists.

806
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,034
Give me a description;
I'll take care of it.

807
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,300
I'll help you now--
let's go.

808
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:41,567
Jack, you need to
go back to CTU.

809
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:42,901
Buchanan just
gave orders

810
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,234
to take you into custody.

811
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,134
I watched Beresch
give this guy a key card.

812
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,700
Something else
is going down here.

813
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,367
We've got to find
this guy now.

814
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,700
And I'll get right on it,

815
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,901
but I need you to go
with these men, please.

816
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,367
He's a white male,
mid-30s, wearing a dark suit

817
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,567
and a yellow tie.

818
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:02,834
He's about five-eight.

819
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:04,433
We'll find him.

820
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,234
Okay. Thanks.

821
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:10,600
These are my weapons.

822
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,700
MANNING:
Altieri, Hutchinson,

823
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,433
we have a possible sleeper
among the hostages.

824
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,767
We're looking for
a Caucasian male,

825
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,168
five-eight, dark suit,
yellow tie.

826
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:37,034
Where have you been?

827
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:39,400
We had a problem
with Chevensky.

828
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:42,134
Where is he?
Dead.

829
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:43,901
You have the key?

830
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:08,168
* *

831
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,134
( device beeping )

832
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,801
Masks.

833
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:34,901
All right, now.

834
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,767
One, two, three.

835
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,500
Push it, push it.

836
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,534
( speaking foreign language )

837
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,067
Do you have the merchandise?

838
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:14,967
YELLOW TIE (over phone):
Yes, we're moving
the canisters out now.

839
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:16,534
Good.

840
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,567
Transportation's been arranged.

841
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:20,201
Call me when you're out.

842
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,433
I will.

843
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:43,934
TV REPORTER:
This will be remembered
as a significant day

844
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,467
for President Logan,
perhaps a turning point

845
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:48,001
in what has been--
up until now--

846
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,134
a fairly unremarkable
presidency.

847
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:52,834
It is almost symbolic that it
should come on the heels

848
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:57,634
of the tragic assassination
of David Palmer.

849
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,534
( door opens )

850
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,101
Evelyn, did you get a chance
to speak to my husband?

851
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:07,934
( muffled screaming )
