www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,682
The FBI believes they've detected
where the next attack will take place.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,198
The chemical plant
just outside Kidron, Ohio.

5
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,438
- What's our time frame?
- It could rupture in less than 15 min.

6
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,357
Right now
our best chance to stop this

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,026
is by finding Dubaku
and the CIP device.

8
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:28,567
400 psi.

9
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,946
How long before the tank ruptures?

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,823
7 minutes.

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,241
We've got a problem.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,535
I thought you killed
Almeida and Bauer. Damn it!

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,496
- How did they find us?
- I don't know!

14
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,080
- They're in the building.
- Disengage the CIP module.

15
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:42,583
Begin the offload.

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,762
Jack, I've got the CIP device!

17
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:56,472
It's been destroyed.

18
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:58,905
The Matobos are safe.
I'm taking them to the van.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,030
Copy that.

20
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,061
You and Bill do a sweep.
Find Dubaku.

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,358
We are not equipped to look
for one man in a city of millions.

22
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,277
- We need additional resources.
- The government?

23
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,239
We can't trust anybody.
That's why we're working on the outside.

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,491
President Taylor can be trusted.

25
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>Madame President,
you need to listen to me.</i>

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,331
The people who rescued us,
they have acquired the CIP device.

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,334
It's being destroyed, and your country's
no longer under immediate threat.

28
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,177
Who are these people?

29
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,171
I'll tell you everything
in person, but

30
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,715
<i>I must speak to you alone.</i>

31
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:34,135
- Please get Henry on the phone.
- Henry's unreachable.

32
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,361
I've been trying to reach agent Gedge
and he hasn't picked up.

33
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,144
He said he was
outside Samantha Roth's apartment

34
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,183
waiting for the First Gentleman.

35
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:48,274
You're telling me
my husband's gone missing?

36
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,194
Gedge is dead.

37
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,697
- What happened?
<i>- Taylor killed Gedge,</i>

38
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,031
I don't know how.

39
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,826
Don't kill him.
Bring him to me.

40
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:18,101
- You're certain you weren't followed?
- Yes.

41
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:19,764
Come on. Help me get him inside.

42
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,240
<i>We can confirm at this point</i>

43
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:35,445
<i>the tragedies
that unfolded in the skies</i>

44
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,137
<i>over Washington and in Kidron, Ohio,</i>

45
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,679
<i>were indeed acts of terrorism.</i>

46
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,984
<i>But I am here to assure you</i>

47
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>that those responsible
are no longer a threat to this country.</i>

48
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,252
Their attempts
to stop us from intervening

49
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,047
in the Sangalan genocide
have failed.

50
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,361
We will not give in to terrorists.

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,055
A short time ago,
I gave the order for our troops

52
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,308
to begin operations that will liberate
the people of Sangala.

53
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:05,981
<i>We are confident</i>

54
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,908
<i>that the Juma regime
will collapse swiftly,</i>

55
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:12,691
<i>and that democracy will be restored
under the leadership</i>

56
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,362
of Prime Minister Ule Matobo.

57
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:48,980
- You, you, come.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,001
Well done, agent Vossler.

59
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:03,158
I've got to go now.
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00.

60
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:06,579
Then go. Your money
will be wired to the usual account.

61
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,421
The room is soundproof, Mr. Taylor.

62
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,418
There's no point in screaming
or trying to call for help.

63
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,424
Elimu,

64
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,301
remove Mr. Taylor's gag.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,340
You son of a bitch.

66
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,266
You're behind my son's death.

67
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,451
He was poking his nose
where it did not belong.

68
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,411
You'll never get away with this.

69
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,439
Everyone in the city
is going be looking for me.

70
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,193
You should be concerned
with just one question, Mr. Taylor.

71
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,792
Does your wife love you enough

72
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,533
to call off the invasion
of my country?

73
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,661
For your sake,

74
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,819
I hope the answer is yes.

75
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,461
Activate the scrambling device.

76
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,968
Our law enforcement agencies

77
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,612
will hunt down
the people responsible

78
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,640
and bring them to justice.

79
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,443
I ask now
that your thoughts and prayers

80
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,996
go to those
who lost their lives today,

81
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,747
to their families and loved ones,

82
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,171
and to our troops

83
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,860
who are putting their lives
on the line

84
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,489
in the name of freedom.

85
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:25,874
Thank you.

86
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:27,653
Good afternoon.

87
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,825
Matobo's arrived.

88
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,119
He and the others
have been brought in secretly

89
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:37,816
through the underground entrance

90
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:40,482
by agents
I personally know and trust.

91
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,686
Matobo told me
the people he's bringing in

92
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:46,613
are responsible for saving his life
and recovering the CIP device.

93
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,931
- Who are they?
- Bill Buchanan,

94
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,096
whom I believe you met
when he headed up CTU L.A.,

95
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:57,329
FBI agent named Renee Walker
and Jack Bauer.

96
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,245
Bauer...

97
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,737
He was one of Matobo's kidnappers.

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,108
- Doesn't make sense.
- I know.

99
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,738
Matobo asked me
to listen to what they have to say,

100
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,212
and I'm willing to do so.

101
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:15,374
Send them in.

102
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,072
The president's ready.

103
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Ule.

104
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:30,472
I can't tell you how thankful we are
that you and Alama are safe.

105
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,851
Thank you.
She's with Mr. Buchanan's people now,

106
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,192
recovering.

107
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,792
That you were subjected
to such an ordeal on our soil

108
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,797
is a source of shame
both to me personally

109
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:44,111
- and to my country.
- Madame President,

110
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,904
my chief concern is for Sangala,
not myself.

111
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:50,291
May I ask what your timetable is
for the invasion?

112
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,823
I've issued the order
to our military to proceed.

113
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,998
I thank you with all my heart.

114
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,333
You're doing my people
a great service,

115
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:01,003
much as these people
have done for your country.

116
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,682
Now forgive me, Prime Minister,
but I'm finding that hard to believe.

117
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,311
I assure you,
none of this is as it seems.

118
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,846
But they're here
to explain themselves.

119
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,798
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Madame President,

120
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,043
I must meet with my people
to discuss post-invasion plans.

121
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,062
Of course.

122
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,545
I want an explanation and I want it now.
What the hell is going on?

123
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,207
Madame President,

124
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:37,416
six weeks ago,
Bill Buchanan discovered

125
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,917
key members of your government
were working with General Juma

126
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,462
and Colonel Dubaku in an effort
to undermine the U.S. foreign policy,

127
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,159
your foreign policy

128
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:47,222
with regards to Sangala.

129
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:51,069
You realize that that is
an outrageous accusation?

130
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:53,474
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,266
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

132
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:00,479
It explains why during this crisis,
every effort to stop Dubaku failed.

133
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:05,150
Bill, why didn't you come to me?

134
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:07,614
I didn't know who I could trust

135
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:09,578
or if you'd even believe me.

136
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:12,947
So I formed a small group
to locate and neutralize Dubaku.

137
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,910
Tony Almeida and ultimately Jack

138
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,034
- joined me.
- Tony Almeida

139
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:20,671
was the one who put the CIP device
into Dubaku's hands in the first place.

140
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,358
Using the CIP device

141
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,838
as bait was necessary
to the undercover operation.

142
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,865
We had to follow it back to Dubaku.

143
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,348
A lot of people
died on those planes,

144
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:34,326
never mind what could have happened
at the chemical plant in Kidron!

145
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:35,958
Madame President, if I may,

146
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,441
I was part of the FBI task force
assigned to recover the CIP device,

147
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,687
I can personally vouch
for what they're telling you.

148
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,871
The loss of life was tragic, yes,
but in my opinion,

149
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,484
everything these men have done
saved the lives of thousands.

150
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:53,684
If I choose to believe
everything you're telling me,

151
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,243
where would you go from here?

152
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:59,746
Dubaku is the only person with the names
of the people who betrayed you.

153
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,415
It's imperative that we find him.

154
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,667
We would have to work
under the radar.

155
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,542
Any word of an investigation,
people would start running for cover.

156
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:10,121
You're saying we can't even involve
the FBI and Homeland?

157
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,817
Yes, sir, that's correct.

158
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:15,961
Madame, Tim Woods is on the phone.

159
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:18,171
- He says it's urgent.
- Put him through.

160
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,486
Put him through.

161
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,669
Have a seat.

162
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:24,485
Yes?

163
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>Madame President, sorry to interrupt.
There's a call for you from Ike Dubaku.</i>

164
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,444
<i>Voice I.D. confirms that.
He says it's about your husband.</i>

165
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:32,870
My husband?

166
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,458
<i>Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you.</i>

167
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:40,829
This is President Taylor.

168
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,666
I'll come straight to the point,
Madame President. I have your husband.

169
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,218
Let me demonstrate.

170
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,462
Say something.

171
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:51,576
Allison...

172
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,926
Henry, are you all right?

173
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,094
I'm fine.

174
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,482
I'm sorry about this.

175
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:01,183
For God sake, don't let them use me
to influence you in any way.

176
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:04,645
Our demands are as follows:

177
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:08,602
You will have your forces withdrawn
from around my country, Sangala,

178
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:10,610
immediately and permanently.

179
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:14,042
Also, Matobo must be delivered
to my men

180
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:17,736
who will be stationed at the east lot
of the Stanswick Power Plant.

181
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,530
If he's not there by 4:00,

182
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,222
or if anybody attempts
to follow or impede my men

183
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:24,999
when they leave the plant,

184
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,501
your husband will die
a slow and certain death.

185
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:29,869
You wouldn't dare!

186
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,463
Cut off his finger.

187
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,551
Stop it!

188
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,448
Stop it!

189
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,691
Meet my demands

190
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,664
or I will send him back to you
one piece at a time.

191
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,795
<i>Do you understand, Madame President?</i>

192
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,225
Yes, I understand.

193
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:16,377
Any attempt to find your husband
will be known to me very quickly,

194
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,927
and I will kill him immediately.

195
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,622
Madame President,

196
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:26,926
I just heard back from the team
I sent to Henry's last-known location.

197
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:28,395
They found Samantha Roth's

198
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,639
and Secret Service
Agent Gedge's bodies.

199
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,026
Gedge had possession
of a paralytic drug.

200
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,206
That and other evidence
on scene suggests

201
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:38,575
he was complicit
in Henry's abduction,

202
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,326
which, of course, confirms
the corruption you just told us about.

203
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,204
Madame President, time is tight.

204
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,405
We need to decide how to respond.

205
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,293
I don't think anyone would blame you

206
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,810
for holding back,
at least temporarily,

207
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,910
the invasion of Sangala.

208
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:59,968
How many people
died on those planes?

209
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,846
How many?

210
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,305
About 300, ma'am.

211
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,227
All because I refused
to change course in Sangala.

212
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:21,542
How can I ask the American people
to make sacrifices

213
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,894
that I'm not willing to make myself?

214
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,268
I can't give in.

215
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,659
I can't.

216
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,750
Madame President,

217
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:41,499
we can still try and find your husband
before the 4:00 deadline.

218
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,601
Dubaku has specifically
forbidden that.

219
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:48,743
And according to you, I can't trust
any of my law enforcement agencies.

220
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,018
You can trust me.

221
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,896
Everyone believes
that agent Walker is dead,

222
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,774
and I have no status at all.

223
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,586
Which means that Dubaku's spies
cannot track us because officially,

224
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,909
we don't exist.

225
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,847
You resigned
from government service,

226
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:06,263
and the Senate regards you
as having been a renegade agent.

227
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:13,125
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

228
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,681
With all due respect,
Madame President,

229
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:17,257
ask around.

230
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:27,055
What could you even do
on such short notice?

231
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,364
I couldn't make you any promises,

232
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,129
but we will do everything possible
to save your husband.

233
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:35,356
Right now, we need you
to go along with Dubaku's demands.

234
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,004
Help buy us some time.

235
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:41,547
Madame President,
you don't have another choice.

236
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,893
All right.

237
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,076
All right.

238
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,246
Find him, please.

239
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:56,725
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,618
We're gonna need a secure hard line.

241
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,854
You may use this room
if you need to.

242
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,940
I'll have you escorted back
when you're ready.

243
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,027
I'm gonna need the president
and his husband Secret Service details.

244
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:24,641
- I'll have them brought to you.
- Thank you.

245
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,342
Okay, we'll start off with agent Gedge.
We need access to his phone records.

246
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,017
I want to know who he's been talking to
over the last few hours.

247
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,664
Obviously, we can't use
any of the president's security people.

248
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:37,716
Thank you.

249
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:44,316
Phone logs are highly classified
for agents assigned to the First Family.

250
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,884
Can Chloe O'Brian get access?

251
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,928
Faster if someone's
already got clearance.

252
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,012
Larry Moss.

253
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:52,807
He doesn't strike me as someone
willing to work outside the system.

254
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,811
That's true, but I think
I can persuade him to do what we need.

255
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,029
- You really trust him?
- Yes.

256
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:01,690
- We know each other pretty well.
- Fine.

257
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:04,015
Try him.
We don't have much time.

258
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:18,173
- Agent Moss.
- <i>Larry, it's Renee. I'm alive,</i>

259
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,964
<i>but you can't let anyone know.
Do you understand me?</i>

260
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:22,587
Oh, my God.

261
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,986
What... Where are you?

262
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,126
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

263
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:36,643
- I'll explain later, we need your help.
- Who's, who's "we"?

264
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:38,916
Myself and Jack Bauer.

265
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
What?!

266
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:42,331
He's on our side, Larry,
just like he said.

267
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,933
Everything that he did,
he did to preserve his cover.

268
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:47,411
Renee, this whole time
I've been thinking you were dead.

269
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:49,865
- Why didn't you tell me?
<i>- The Bureau is compromised.</i>

270
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,367
Just like he said, and no one there
can know about this operation.

271
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,120
It has to stay completely off book.

272
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:03,080
- What operation?
- Jack and I are at the White House.

273
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:05,797
The First Gentleman has been kidnapped
by Ike Dubaku.

274
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,300
I don't know anything about that.

275
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:11,357
It's true. The president's asked
Jack and me to find him.

276
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:14,033
Very few people know about this,
that's the way that it has to stay.

277
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,958
If we don't find him by 4:00 p.m.,
he'll be killed.

278
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,888
If you've ever trusted me,
trust me now, please, and help me.

279
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,702
What do you want me to do?

280
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,476
Looks like his Secret Service agent
was involved in all of this,

281
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,896
Brian Gedge; he's dead.
Check his phone logs

282
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:38,243
and get all the information you can
about who he's been in contact with.

283
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,628
I need to see you

284
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,963
to make sure this is real,
that you're not under duress.

285
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,449
There's no time for that.

286
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,842
That's not negotiable.
You want my help, we meet.

287
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,564
<i>The Capitol Reflecting Pool,
as soon as you can get there.</i>

288
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:54,471
Fine.

289
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,790
He'll help us, I think,
but we need to go.

290
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:15,576
<i>President Taylor emphasized
the terrorists are no longer a threat</i>

291
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,031
<i> and says the invasion will begin.</i>

292
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,716
<i>She also says former
Prime Minister Ule Matobo</i>

293
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,225
<i>will be reinstated to work towards
building a new democratic government.</i>

294
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,345
I don't get it.

295
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,569
- What?
- The president's talking as if

296
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,844
the CIP device and Matobo
have been recovered,

297
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,387
how could that have happened
without us knowing about it?

298
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:35,022
It just means whatever
agency's responsible hasn't let us know.

299
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:38,056
What other agency? We're being kept
out of the loop, and I don't like it.

300
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,686
So am I seeing you later?

301
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:45,855
I don't know.
I've got some things to figure out.

302
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,775
- What does that mean?
- I have to get home at some point.

303
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,485
I haven't seen Christina in a week.

304
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,576
All right.

305
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,543
Sean, are you all right?

306
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,102
I'm fine.

307
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,747
- I'm sensing a little distance.
- I just have to get back to work.

308
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:10,306
Excuse me.

309
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,550
Could you be a little less obvious,
do you think?

310
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,195
- What are you talking about?
- Give me a break.

311
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,390
Just hold up a sign that says,
"Hey, world, we're sleeping together."

312
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,515
Are you stupid?

313
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,259
I know it's stupid and wrong,
and I'm gonna end it.

314
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,024
You'd better, fast,
before Larry notices.

315
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,832
- Where is Larry?
- I don't know.

316
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:32,577
That's not the point. The point is,
if he finds out about this,

317
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:36,604
he's gonna transfer your ass to Juneau
so fast, your head will spin.

318
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:04,983
Oh, my God.

319
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:12,942
I thought I'd never see you again.

320
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,366
Were you able to access
Agent Gedge's phone records?

321
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:23,747
Yeah.

322
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:27,036
Over the last 3 hours,
Gedge spoke repeatedly

323
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,667
to another Secret Service agent
named Edward Vossler.

324
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,599
I checked out
Vossler's personnel records.

325
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:35,511
Before he was a Secret Service agent,
he was Special Forces,

326
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,675
and for 2 years, served in Sangala.

327
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,762
So we can assume
Vossler's working for Dubaku.

328
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,914
Did you bring
any of his files with you?

329
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,130
Does Vossler have a family?

330
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:54,150
- Why do you need to know that?
- Does he have a family?

331
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:56,402
He's been married for 5 years
to a paralegal.

332
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,343
They have an 11-month-old baby boy.
She left her job to stay home with him.

333
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:02,946
We're gonna need to split up.
I need you to help me track Vossler.

334
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,875
I need you to go to his home
and hope his family is there.

335
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:10,661
He was Special Forces. We're not gonna
break him in the time that we've got.

336
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:14,587
The only way is to make him think
we're gonna hurt his family.

337
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:18,049
- No, absolutely not. Renee?
- That's stepping over the line, Jack.

338
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:21,010
You stepped over the line
the second you interrogated Tanner.

339
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,005
Tanner's a murderer.

340
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,015
Vossler's wife is completely innocent,
let alone a small child.

341
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,060
When are you people gonna stop thinking
everyone else is following your rules?!

342
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:30,511
They're not!

343
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:33,887
Dubaku is gonna kill Henry Taylor
within the next 45 minutes

344
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,686
unless we find him.
You've got one of two choices:

345
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:39,096
You can either phone the president
and explain to her

346
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,906
that your conscience won't allow you
to do what is necessary to save him,

347
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:45,063
or you can simply do
what is necessary.

348
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,321
Pick one!

349
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,034
- Renee?
- I'm gonna need your vehicle.

350
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,922
Start tracking Vossler
through his phone.

351
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:05,930
Utilize
his Secret Service deployment grid.

352
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:07,765
Look at yourself.

353
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:12,053
You've lost everyone
and everything you ever had

354
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,063
by doing
what you think is necessary.

355
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,891
I won't let you do it to her, Bauer.

356
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,986
Renee will not end up like you.

357
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,327
Are you gonna give me your keys
or not?

358
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:49,974
The rules are what make us better.

359
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,935
Not today.

360
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,649
I slowed down Taylor's bleeding,
but I can't get it to stop completely.

361
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,756
- Tourniquet is as tight as possible?
- Yes.

362
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,659
Then cauterize the wound.
Mikali has a blowtorch.

363
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,629
- You risk Taylor going into shock.
- Just put something in his mouth.

364
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,252
I don't want him
biting his tongue off with the pain.

365
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,342
Hey, what are you doing at home?

366
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,286
- I thought you'd be at work.
- I was.

367
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:33,184
Rosa called me at the diner.
She was having one of her episodes.

368
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,353
You know your sister.
She's just manipulating you.

369
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,649
- <i>Don't go to her every time she calls.</i>
- I'm all she has, Samuel. Be kind.

370
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,391
You know,
you're kind enough for both of us.

371
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:47,266
I just wanted to make sure
that you were still coming to dinner.

372
00:22:47,775 --> 00:22:49,800
Look, I'm really sorry, but I can't.

373
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:51,744
I'm looking
at a stack of shipping manifests.

374
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,049
Oh, no!

375
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,958
Isn't there some way?
We could do it as late as you want.

376
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,920
I really wish I could.
I'm sorry, Marika.

377
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:05,021
Listen, baby,
I'll make it up to you, okay?

378
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:08,678
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make extra
just in case you change your mind.

379
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,396
- You're too good to me.
- You're right.

380
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,981
I have to get back to the diner.
Are you gonna be okay?

381
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,906
Who was that on the phone?

382
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:26,362
- It was him, wasn't it?
- All right, stop.

383
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:30,700
I know you don't approve of Samuel,
but I love him.

384
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:33,034
You love him?

385
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:34,412
Why?

386
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:36,785
Because he spends money on you?

387
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,916
Because he pays our rent?

388
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,503
- You've only known him 4 months.
- What difference does that make?

389
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,380
You don't know anything about him.

390
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,342
What if he's not the importer
he says he is?

391
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,802
Or that he's in this country
illegally?

392
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:53,241
- Not this again.
- I'm just trying to protect you.

393
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,725
- I don't need your protection.
- Yes, you do.

394
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,169
This man isn't...

395
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:01,522
Isn't what?

396
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,849
Nothing.
Forget it.

397
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:13,076
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.
I'll be home after my shift.

398
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:30,464
We can appear to comply

399
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:33,498
with the first part of Dubaku's demand
by pulling the fleet back.

400
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,698
Then we simply launch the invasion
from farther out at sea.

401
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,435
Now, the second part of his demand
is more complicated.

402
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:43,564
If we were really turning Matobo over,
we'd be putting him in a car right now.

403
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,858
That's out of the question.
We need him safe.

404
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:47,224
Agreed.

405
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:49,662
But we can send a car
with a look-alike.

406
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:52,905
If we handle it right, Dubaku
won't be aware until the last minute.

407
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,951
By then, hopefully,
we'll have found Henry.

408
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,788
Madame President, do we have
your authorization to proceed?

409
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,157
- Bauer.
- Okay, I've got Vossler.

410
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:14,879
He's on the Beltway near Bethesda,
moving south,

411
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:16,722
about 7 miles from you.

412
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,237
Copy that. I'm on my way.
Where's he headed?

413
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:22,624
According to the Secret Service log,
his shift starts at 4:00 p.m.

414
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,022
He's meeting a foreign dignitary's plane
at Andrews.

415
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,441
I don't have to tell you,
once he's through that gate

416
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,777
and onto that base,
you wont be able to touch him.

417
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:33,597
He'll have to double back on the 337
to get through that main gate.

418
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,533
I could make up time
by taking Connecticut.

419
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:37,410
Just keep sight of him.

420
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:42,540
Have you heard from Renee?
She's arrived at Vossler's house yet?

421
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,585
She knows how to get in touch with us
if she's in trouble.

422
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,565
<i>Coming.</i>

423
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:12,425
Can I help you?

424
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:16,788
- Who are you?
- Do what I tell you,

425
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:18,784
and there's a chance
you'll live through this.

426
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:39,167
Don't move!

427
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:40,890
He's scared.

428
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,226
Stay where you are
or I will shoot you where you stand.

429
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:45,937
You're going to kill me
for trying to comfort my baby?

430
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,548
Sit down.

431
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,066
What kind of a person are you?
Doing this to us.

432
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,445
You should ask your husband that.

433
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,739
What are you talking about?

434
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,117
Edward is a good man.

435
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,703
Maybe you don't know him
quite as well as you think you do.

436
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,747
- He'd never point a gun at a child.
- Shut up!

437
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,930
Put the cuff around your wrist.

438
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,006
- Don't do this.
- Now!

439
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:27,061
OK, where is he now?

440
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,314
He just got off the beltway.
He's stopped in traffic.

441
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,867
I'm coming up on the intersection
of Allenford and Auth.

442
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,569
I should be there in 30 seconds.
Just let me know if he moves.

443
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,764
- He's moving.
- Damn it!

444
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,127
- What's the next street north?
- Baxter Drive.

445
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:47,747
But, Jack, it's a one-way street.

446
00:27:47,994 --> 00:27:48,999
Copy that.

447
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,299
He made the light at Allenford.

448
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,762
I'm on Baxter.

449
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,097
He's 15 seconds away.

450
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,355
Ten seconds.

451
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,234
Five seconds.

452
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,523
I got him.

453
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,666
Let me see your hands!

454
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,877
Now!

455
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,715
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

456
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,988
Move!

457
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,492
Where is he?
Where is Henry Taylor?

458
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:53,567
I don't know
what you're talking about.

459
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,024
Where is he?

460
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,487
Fine, we'll do this your way.

461
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,519
I've got Vossler. You got his wife?

462
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:09,851
<i>And his child.</i>

463
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:10,873
You ready?

464
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,043
Put your phone on speaker.

465
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:16,313
Talk to your wife.

466
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:18,939
- You son of a bitch.
- Talk to your wife!

467
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,560
Carol? Are you all right?

468
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:26,104
There's a woman with a gun.
She's threatening to kill me.

469
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:27,472
Why is Conner crying?

470
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,879
Oh, my God, Edward.

471
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:31,101
What's happening?
Who are these people?

472
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,249
You are running out of time.

473
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:36,148
I didn't want to have to do this.

474
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:38,971
- No, you wouldn't...

475
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:42,717
<i>- What's happening?</i>
- I don't know. She's got Conner.

476
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:47,075
My God, she's doing something to Conner!
Let go of my baby!

477
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:50,006
He's just a baby! Please!

478
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,248
- What are you doing?
- You can stop this.

479
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,665
Just tell me where he is.

480
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,112
For God's sake, Edward,
tell them what they want to know!

481
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,117
Damn it! All right, I'll tell you!

482
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:04,301
Stand down.
I'll get back to you.

483
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,394
Your baby's fine.

484
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,350
You're a monster!

485
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,288
Where is he?

486
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:27,664
You tell me now,
or the situation for your family

487
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:29,452
goes from bad to worse.
Where is he?

488
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,412
How do I know you're just not going
to kill them anyway?

489
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,580
You don't.

490
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,011
Fine.

491
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,858
There's a greengrocer,
12451 Arlington Avenue.

492
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,175
- They're holding him in the basement.
- Access.

493
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,510
There's a staircase in the back,
but it's locked.

494
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,100
- Is Dubaku with him?
- He was.

495
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:50,161
- How many guns are guarding him?
- At least 4.

496
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:51,432
Get out of here!

497
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,147
Get away from the car!

498
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,360
Walk away. Now!

499
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:45,909
Damn it.

500
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,326
Stop!
Get out of the car now!

501
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,953
Move! Move!

502
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,588
The goal is to make it look
like we're going to hand Matobo over

503
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,725
for as long as
is reasonably possible.

504
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:22,037
When you get to the rendezvous point,
keep your distance from Dubaku's men.

505
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:24,859
Let them see you in the backseat,
but do not get out of the car.

506
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,319
Don't let them get any closer
than you feel comfortable with.

507
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:31,115
As soon as you start to feel the risk
is unacceptable, get the hell out.

508
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,893
That's straight from the president.

509
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,742
- Clear?
- Clear.

510
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:36,267
Good luck.

511
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:46,130
I got an address for Henry Taylor.

512
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:50,174
12451 Arlington Ave. It's a storefront.
He's being held in the basement.

513
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:54,179
If you get there before me, stand down.
Dubaku's got at least 4 gunmen there.

514
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,198
Alright.

515
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:58,262
I'll call Bill, pull him up to speed.
I want you to do the same with Larry.

516
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:00,019
- And what about Vossler?
- He's dead.

517
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:02,783
He attacked me.
I didn't have a choice.

518
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,596
Are you okay?

519
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,906
No, I don't think I am.

520
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:14,949
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

521
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:20,664
Agent Walker, are you still there?

522
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:23,792
I'm not...

523
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:25,586
Listen to me.

524
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:28,338
We could not have gotten this far
if it wasn't for you.

525
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,759
Okay?

526
00:33:30,436 --> 00:33:33,483
No one would blame you if this was just
too much for you to handle.

527
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,180
Maybe you should get out.

528
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,353
Maybe I will.

529
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:41,945
Yeah.

530
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:44,563
Tomorrow.

531
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:59,120
- Agent Masden and I are on our way.
- We'll be tracking you via satellite.

532
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,598
Check in with me when you're
approaching the power plant.

533
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:02,580
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

534
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,888
How much time do you think
this will buy us?

535
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:07,692
Until Dubaku realizes
Matobo's not in the limo.

536
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:09,505
10 minutes, maybe 15.

537
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,757
That's 15 minutes more than we had.

538
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:14,802
Madame President, I just got
off the phone with Jack Bauer.

539
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:17,782
He and agent Walker think
they have a location on your husband.

540
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,433
- Where?
- Arlington Avenue.

541
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,058
- They're on their way now.
- How long will it take them?

542
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,560
10, 15 minutes.

543
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,788
Thank you.

544
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:31,634
This just came over from Homeland.

545
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,821
Like you said,
we're being kept out of the loop.

546
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:36,283
Thanks.

547
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,217
Did you see this?

548
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:49,128
Homeland's preparing to lower the threat
level at the president's request.

549
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:51,248
- I saw the flash.
- Don't you think that's odd,

550
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,174
considering we don't know anything
about the CIP device being recovered?

551
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,554
- Yeah. I'll talk to Homeland.
- All I'm saying is...

552
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,723
I feel there's something
going on behind our back.

553
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,599
Like I said, I'll talk to them.

554
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:08,195
Excuse me.

555
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:09,719
Yeah, sure.

556
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:14,737
Where are you?

557
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,031
On my way to where we think
Henry Taylor's being held.

558
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:20,075
So you got Vossler to talk.

559
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:23,078
It gave us our only chance
to rescue the president's husband.

560
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,239
What's the address?
I send a SWAT team to meet you.

561
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,407
You know you can't do that.
The Bureau's compromised.

562
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,709
It will jeopardize
any attempt that we make.

563
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:32,295
But there is something else
I need you to do.

564
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,075
Okay, what's that?

565
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,384
Keep an incident quiet until
what Jack and I are doing goes down.

566
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,886
- What incident?
- Vossler's dead.

567
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,015
Jack killed him at the hotel
on 18th and Riggin. It was self-defense.

568
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,765
- Is that what he told you?
- Larry.

569
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,406
Damn it, Renee, what the hell
are you doing with this guy?

570
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,969
We're supposed to bring suspects in,
not murder them.

571
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,231
Larry, please...

572
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,627
Until we know who Dubaku's source is,
you've got to handle this

573
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,403
outside of the Bureau, okay?

574
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,623
There's a guy at D.C. Metro
I know I can trust.

575
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:05,454
I'll have him deal with Vossler.

576
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,572
Thank you, Larry.

577
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,716
I understand.
I will let him know.

578
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:16,073
According to our sources,
a vehicle containing Matobo

579
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:17,939
- just left the White House.
- Good.

580
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:20,031
What is the state
of the American invasion forces?

581
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,573
The fleet is withdrawing
from Sangalan territorial waters,

582
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,632
and has set steam
for the 23rd Meridian.

583
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:25,919
Excellent.

584
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,473
- Hello.
- It's Rosa.

585
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,324
<i>Rosa, if you're looking for Marika,
she's not with me.</i>

586
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:32,856
I'm looking for you, Samuel.

587
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,408
Or whatever your real name is.

588
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:40,280
- What are you talking about?
- My sister may be naive, but I'm not.

589
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:44,298
I checked with someone I know
at Immigration Services,

590
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:47,350
and no one named Samuel Aboa
emigrated from Sangala

591
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:50,082
in the last year,
or in the last 15 years.

592
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,627
- They've obviously made a mistake.
- You're making a mistake.

593
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,281
<i>Now I don't know who you really are,
and I don't care.</i>

594
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,654
<i>I just want you
out of my sister's life.</i>

595
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:01,905
- Does Marika know about this?
- No, not yet.

596
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,704
And I'm willing to keep it that way.

597
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,681
So you've not reported me to anyone?

598
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,976
I don't want Marika
to know anything about this.

599
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,147
- What do you want?
- Break up with her,

600
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,503
<i>and this stays between us.</i>

601
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:17,067
<i>You just end it tonight,</i>

602
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,024
and we won't have a problem.

603
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,908
I have to take care of a little problem.
Call me when we have Matobo.

604
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,460
The vehicle that's supposed
to be delivering Matobo is arriving.

605
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,997
If we delay any longer, Dubaku is going
to get suspicious. What's your status?

606
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,499
- I'm almost there. How much time?
- I don't know, Jack.

607
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,470
Agent Walker and I will move in
as soon as I get there.

608
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,221
- I'll keep you posted.
- All right, good luck.

609
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,175
<i>This is agent Smith.
We've got a visual on Dubaku's men.</i>

610
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,135
Understood.
We have it on satellite.

611
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:49,568
Bring him to us.

612
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,129
They've ordered us
to get out of the car.

613
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,383
- <i>Now one of them is making a call.</i>
- Hang tight, agent.

614
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:06,134
Their car arrived,

615
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,512
- <i>but nothing is happening.</i>
- What do you mean?

616
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,683
<i>We asked them to hand Matobo over to us,
but no one's getting out of the vehicle.</i>

617
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,311
The Americans have been playing us.
Destroy their vehicle.

618
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:17,673
Yes, sir.

619
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,294
That's long enough.
Get them the hell out of there.

620
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,619
- Retreat. Get out now.
- Roger that.

621
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,636
You ready? Let's go.

622
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,986
Get out from behind the counter.
Now! Move!

623
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,782
Okay, I want you
to unlock that door.

624
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:13,682
And I want you to ask those men
what they want to eat.

625
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:17,811
You do one thing I don't like,
and I blow your head off, understood?

626
00:40:18,323 --> 00:40:19,474
Open the door.

627
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:36,267
- Want anything to eat?
- No. Some cold beers.

628
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,392
Okay.

629
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:41,915
Yes.

630
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:44,251
Kill Henry Taylor.

631
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,885
Then we have nothing
to hold over their heads.

632
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,373
We don't have anything now.

633
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,466
The president was willing
to let him die. We are done here.

634
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,436
Kill Taylor, and have your men
pack everything up.

635
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,512
Understood.

636
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:42,726
Oh, my God.

637
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,020
Sir... sir...

638
00:42:47,158 --> 00:42:49,149
We're going to get you help.
Just stay with me.

639
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,211
Get an ambulance!
