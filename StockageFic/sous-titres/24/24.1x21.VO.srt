1
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:18,131
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,568
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,771
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:30,849
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,365
- You just gave your concession speech.
- That remains to be seen.

6
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:43,124
I only hope your conscience comforts you
when you finally realise this is all over.

7
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,249
You mean the campaign or us?

8
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,210
I saw the car explode. I lost my daughter!

9
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:53,043
Kim is alive. She got out
before the explosion. I talked to her.

10
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,927
I'm gonna stick you
back in the holding cell.

11
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,402
Maybe that'll convince you
not to screw around.

12
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:03,205
Call this number. Tell them that I am
Jack Bauer's daughter and that I'm here.

13
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,523
Ask them if they think I'm screwing around.

14
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:08,002
This is a prison facility. Why are you here?

15
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:11,608
The people that want Palmer dead
bribed someone from the power company.

16
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:13,365
Something's gonna happen here.

17
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:17,446
A prisoner's being delivered by chopper.
His identity's classified, even from me.

18
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,684
- That's impossible.
- You recognise him?

19
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,845
That's Victor Drazen,
the man I killed two years ago.

20
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:27,651
- You haven't heard from your brother?
- You seem anxious, Harris.

21
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,372
Just getyour men ready. It's time.

22
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:35,402
The idea is to get my father out ofprison.
This is the best chance we'll ever have.

23
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,407
Get against the wall.

24
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,604
They are here.

25
00:01:56,693 --> 00:02:00,891
Well, it's official. The polls havejust
closed in California, and the big story:

26
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:04,045
Senator David Palmer
seems to have swept California

27
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,284
and every other state that held
a primary this Super Tuesday.

28
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:12,652
It looks like he may have gotten a late boost
based on the roller-coaster events ofhis day.

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:17,682
Earlier, the senator held a press conference
to disclose the details ofa scandal

30
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:20,924
involving both his son
and his primary financial backers.

31
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,891
Palmer claims to have been
unaware ofany wrongdoing...

32
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:10,647
You're in my seat.

33
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,927
Fine.

34
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:25,247
I said, that's my seat.

35
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:48,048
- And how about you?
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

36
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,805
Thanks a lot.

37
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:53,363
11 for 11, my friend.
Congratulations. You did it.

38
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,644
We did it.

39
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,692
That's not the best part.
Fox News just did an instant poll.

40
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,322
83 per cent approved of the way
you handled the Ferragamo situation.

41
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,723
Boy, that is great!

42
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:12,006
- Have we heard from Ames or his people?
- They're all too busy running for cover.

43
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:16,245
We don't wanna get cocky, but so far
it couldn't have turned out better.

44
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,442
Everyone, listen up.

45
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,332
In a bit, I'm going to give
a speech to the country.

46
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:34,723
We have a number of primaries
in the coming months,

47
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:38,044
so technically it's not a victory speech.

48
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,125
But I'm gonna make it
sound like one anyway.

49
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:50,082
Now, as you know, in many ways
this has been a difficult day for my family.

50
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:54,405
And I am confident that being open
and honest was the right thing to do,

51
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:58,372
and that things will be resolved
fairly for everyone concerned.

52
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:03,322
And, in the meantime, I wanna thank
everyone in this room for their support.

53
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,961
- This is our victory.
- Yeah!

54
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:12,329
- This is our night.
- Yeah!

55
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,566
And I just wanna give one last order,

56
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:19,407
which will be obeyed with
no exceptions whatsoever.

57
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:22,485
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

58
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:28,330
Division wants an update
on the Palmer threat assessment.

59
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,132
With Alexis under control,
that threat may be minimal.

60
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,249
Nina, it's your line.

61
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:37,362
- Go ahead.
- Do what you can to get everyone together.

62
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:41,371
- It's Bauer.
- I got it.

63
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,684
- What the hell's goin' on?
- Listen up.

64
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:49,527
The field we were standing in is hiding
an underground detention facility.

65
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,286
It's being used as a prison
to house Victor Drazen.

66
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,648
You said you took him out two years ago.

67
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,443
Apparently not. I'm staring at him. There's
a team in place. They're ready to attack us.

68
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:03,367
They've already cut off the power.
I need you to send in a field unit now!

69
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:08,003
- George, what are you gonna do?
- All right, I'll call Division.

70
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,926
By the time you get approval,
this whole thing'll be over.

71
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:15,291
If Victor Drazen escapes, it'll be our fault.
George, you know what this man can do.

72
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,604
You decide.

73
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,044
What's going on?

74
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:30,804
Dispatch a field unit to the location
in Saugus. I'll clear it from my end.

75
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:35,603
- Get ahold of Chapelle immediately.
- What is going on? Is Jack all right?

76
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:40,084
It is such a shame. You're wasting
the best years of your life on a married man.

77
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,404
- George...
- And picking up Almeida on the rebound?

78
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:47,771
- That is out of line.
- No, you're outta line. Think about it.

79
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,845
I'm just tryin' to be a friend here.

80
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:55,165
- George, just tell me if he's...
- Nina, where's Jack?

81
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,924
Teri, thank God you're OK.

82
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:03,083
- Any word on Kim?
- No, not yet. But we're working on it.

83
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,482
- I need to talk to Jack.
- He's not here. He's on assignment.

84
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:10,246
On assignment?
Has he been told what happened to us?

85
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,244
- Well, not yet.
- Why not?

86
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,484
- Because we can't get ahold of him.
- Get ahold of him now.

87
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:19,486
- Teri, I'm sorry. It's just not possible.
- Nina, I want to talk to Jack.

88
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:24,567
Jack's in a situation where he needs our
support. We're doing everything we can.

89
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:31,368
- What kind of situation?
- That's all I can tell you right now.

90
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:35,890
I need you to tell me everything that
happened at your house before Tony arrived.

91
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,804
I already told Tony everything.

92
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:42,603
But it won't hurt to go over it again. Any
details will help us, and they will help Jack.

93
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:49,491
All right, but I need to know
what's going on with my family.

94
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:53,327
I know, and I promise I'll give you
an update as soon as I have one.

95
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,687
All right?

96
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,731
Stand against the door.

97
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,281
Lawrence, what's goin' on out there?

98
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,722
Lawrence, do you copy?

99
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,329
Ray, this is DeSalvo. Come in.

100
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:16,531
- Ray!
- We gotta get out of here. Which way?

101
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:19,173
The flood egress is to the right.

102
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,642
Open the door slowly.

103
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,006
Step out into the middle of the hall.

104
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,964
Turn to your right.

105
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,044
Keep moving.

106
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,004
Lawrence, where are you?
Lawrence, do you copy?

107
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:06,483
We have to get out of this hallway.
We're too exposed.

108
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:10,930
All right. What's the plan?
How are they gonna break you outta here?

109
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,882
You son of a bitch, if any of my men die...

110
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,726
What area of this building
is most defendable?

111
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:29,610
- Let's get outta here. Move.
- Fall back. Defend the retreat.

112
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,684
Turn around.

113
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:53,561
I've been trying to get ahold of Chapelle.
Whatever he's doing, this is more important.

114
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:59,210
Well, for starters, I sent a CTU field unit
over to a DOD facility.

115
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:02,569
- I need to have some unity of command.
- I can give him a message.

116
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:06,089
All right. Just get him
to call me as soon as you can.

117
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,925
Mrs Bauer.

118
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:11,164
- Teri.
- Mason. I thought you were being debriefed.

119
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:14,848
Nina won't tell me anything,
and I need to know what's going on with Kim.

120
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:18,892
I'm afraid I don't know any more
than Nina does, but I'm sure Kim's safe.

121
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,492
Well, I wish I could believe that, but...
Based on what?

122
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:27,806
I haven't been fully briefed, but the man that
attacked you asked where she was, right?

123
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,691
- Yes.
- So that means they're lookin' for her, too.

124
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,731
As time passes it gets
harder for them and easier for us.

125
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:39,126
There's only a few of them, whereas we can
cover the whole city. And believe me, we are.

126
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:43,847
Jack is extremely important to all of us here,

127
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,609
and nobody's gonna rest easy until your
daughter's back with you, safe and sound.

128
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,604
Thank you.

129
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,922
Just doin' my job.

130
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,848
- Mason?
- George, it's Nina.

131
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:01,524
Uh-huh?

132
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:05,970
Our unit will be on site in 15 minutes. They
wanna know who's in command, us or DOD.

133
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,329
- We are. Let me know when they're on site.
- All right.

134
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:12,370
Was that about Jack?

135
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:16,492
We got a lot of things goin' on. As soon as
we get word from Jack, we'll let you know.

136
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:17,892
You've been very kind.

137
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:22,967
I'll have my assistant Rebecca look after you.
You let her know if you need anything, OK?

138
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,851
Do me a favour, keep your chin up, all right?

139
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,961
- Rebecca.
- Yeah?

140
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,647
I'm sending Jack's wife down.
Baby-sit her for me.

141
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,610
OK. What do you want me to do with her?

142
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:41,686
Whatever. I don't care what you do with her.
Just keep her out of my face, OK?

143
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,092
Got it.

144
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,290
- Where's Patty?
- She's finishing up your speech.

145
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,562
Hold that for me. I'll be right back.

146
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,170
- Senator.
- Congratulations.

147
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:02,202
- Looks like you're going to the White House.
- We'll know by the end of the day.

148
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,251
- Hey, we missed you out there.
- Hi.

149
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,804
I'm just going through it one last time.

150
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,728
I made the changes you asked for.

151
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,643
Oh, yeah. That's much better.

152
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,289
I'm glad you like it.

153
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:34,005
I can't believe you won all 11 primaries.

154
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,561
You and your family must be so happy.

155
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,284
Yeah, we are.

156
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:45,252
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's just all catchin' up with me.

157
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,927
It's been a long day.

158
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:56,208
You know what, Patty? Why don't we
move the second paragraph to the end?

159
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,853
That'll close with the note about party unity.

160
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,083
That's a good idea.

161
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,646
- Uh, Senator?
- Yes, Patty?

162
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,730
There's, um, something
I've been wanting to tell you,

163
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:15,204
but every time I start
it just seems inappropriate.

164
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:19,641
- What is it?
- Well, it's just that, um...

165
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,851
I wanted to tell you how much I admire you.

166
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:32,087
I don't see very many people who stand by
their principles the way that you do.

167
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:36,212
And I truly believe our country
would be a better place with you leading it.

168
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,452
Well!

169
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:47,244
- What is it?
- Nothing. I'm just a little flustered.

170
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:52,407
What a wonderful
and unexpected compliment.

171
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,889
Well, I'll just switch those paragraphs.

172
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,170
All right.

173
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:16,773
Barnes, this is Mason. What's your 20?

174
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:19,048
We're approaching the site.

175
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,045
What's going on down there? Barnes?

176
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,962
Looks like the door's been blown in.

177
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:28,487
- Are the hostiles inside?
- They must be.

178
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:31,929
No activity here. We're preparing to go in.

179
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,568
Take cover! Take cover!

180
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:55,211
- Father!
- Andre!

181
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,646
Get down or I'll shoot him!

182
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,201
- Let him go!
- Let my father go!

183
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:01,648
Drop your weapons!

184
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,930
- Stay back or I will shoot him!
- You don't stand a chance!

185
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:07,322
- Andre!
- Drop it now. You're surrounded!

186
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:10,485
Back off! Drop your weapons or I will shoot!

187
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:13,133
Let my father go right now or this man dies.

188
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,090
- Drop your weapons!
- I'll kill him.

189
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,733
Don't do it, Bauer! Don't release that prisoner.

190
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:20,725
Drop your weapons or I will shoot him!
Drop your weapons!

191
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:24,488
- Don't do it, Bauer!
- Drop it! I'll give you three seconds.

192
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:25,528
One.

193
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:26,728
Two.

194
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,290
The weapon's up!

195
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,490
No!

196
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,246
- Father!
- Andre!

197
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:45,092
- Where is Alexis?
- He's been out of touch for some time.

198
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:47,641
We have to assume the worst.

199
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:58,931
- Hostiles outside the main entrance.
- How many?

200
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:01,049
At least a dozen, all well-armed.

201
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,363
Collapse the corridor immediately.

202
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,047
Let's hustle, men. Down here. Down here.

203
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,603
Take him. We may need him
as a bargaining chip.

204
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,490
Go, go, go!

205
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,211
That was a mistake. Now you're trapped.

206
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,284
We will see.

207
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,926
I told you, don't mess with me.

208
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:51,483
You got something that belongs to me
and you better give it up now.

209
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:54,406
- I ain't got nothin'.
- We cool. I'm your friend.

210
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,961
We cool if you and your girls back off.

211
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,371
You holdin' out on me? You a bad girl.

212
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,485
When we get outta here,
maybe I'll mess you up like that.

213
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,041
- What is your problem?
- You.

214
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,728
Me? I'm only in here because
you told the cops I was a part of the deal.

215
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:35,692
- You were a part of the deal.
- I didn't even know it was happening.

216
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:38,082
Nobody told you to come over.

217
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:41,927
- If this is about Rick...
- Rick? You think I care about that loser?

218
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:46,325
- He's not a loser.
- He kidnaps you, and you defend him?

219
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:50,531
- He didn't know what was going on.
- Like I said, he's a loser.

220
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,808
What are you shaking your head for?

221
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:56,283
You're Daddy's little girl.
You get everything handed to you.

222
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:59,285
Shut up! I have been listening
to this crap all day.

223
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:03,605
About how I get everything I want, and how
my life is great and everyone else's sucks.

224
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:06,890
Wanna know something?
You don't know anything about me.

225
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,487
Last night I was kidnapped, tied up in a trunk,

226
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:12,326
and then I got to see your friend Dan
get shot in the head.

227
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:17,487
Take all the bad luck you've had, it wouldn't
fit into half of what's happened to me today.

228
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:20,326
So messing me up
may not be as easy as you think.

229
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:26,522
But if you wanna try, bring it on -
here, outside, any place you like.

230
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:09,048
You think I am a monster

231
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:13,411
because I want revenge on your wife
and daughter as well as on you.

232
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,844
You were a monster
long before you ever heard of me.

233
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:21,006
Oh, I see. You consider yourself informed.

234
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:26,169
You have read magazines.
You have studied intelligence reports,

235
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:31,202
filed by people who tell their superiors
only what they want to hear.

236
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,365
And you have the audacity to judge me?

237
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,847
When does your suffering end, Victor?

238
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:42,723
After you've killed me and Senator Palmer
and all the thousands of enemies you have?

239
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:46,010
Yes. Simple, is it not?

240
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:51,449
You're insane. It's a psychotic fantasy.

241
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:03,203
A fantasy which is coming
closer and closer to a reality.

242
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:11,165
This is Victor Drazen.
Whom am I speaking to?

243
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,166
This is George Mason. I'm the district
director of the Counter Terrorist Unit.

244
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,370
You will be the person
I will be negotiating with?

245
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:24,050
Negative. We do not negotiate with terrorists.
I'm willing to listen to your concerns.

246
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:27,921
My main concern is Jack Bauer.

247
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,004
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

248
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:32,482
Do you want to see him alive again?

249
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:36,202
How do I know he's alive?

250
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,284
- George.
- Yeah, it's me.

251
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:45,251
I've counted six of them.
They've got assault rifles.

252
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,369
As you hear, he is alive.

253
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:50,809
I'll be speaking with my superiors
and I'll get back to you.

254
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:58,325
Drazen's taken command of the facility.
He's got Jack. There's at least six of them.

255
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:03,567
They've got assault weapons, explosives.
Get that information to the field unit.

256
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,922
Bring up the layout of the facility.

257
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,963
How did Jack sound?

258
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,044
Alive.

259
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,921
- It's gonna be a long drawn-out process.
- I know the drill.

260
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,447
And you know it may not turn out well.

261
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:23,287
If you want me to put somebody who's
less emotionally involved on this, I will.

262
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:25,409
I can do my job, George.

263
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:28,770
OK.

264
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:36,005
- Any word from Chapelle?
- I still can't get ahold of him.

265
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:41,326
Unbelievable. Hope that bastard doesn't
plan on blaming me if things go wrong.

266
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,525
- Take it.
- No way.

267
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,604
- I said take it.
- No.

268
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,210
Who's smokin' pot?

269
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:18,804
- That one.
- She threw it at me.

270
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,929
Bitch! Why you lyin'?

271
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,163
Give it to me.

272
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:25,642
Give it to me!

273
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,205
- And who are you?
- I swear it wasn't me.

274
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:39,207
Oh, you're comin' with me.

275
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,488
She's telling the truth.

276
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:47,368
- Don't make a liar outta me, blondie.
- No need. You are one.

277
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,847
I didn't do nothing! Get off me!

278
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:10,367
I'm gonna get you back,
blondie, don't you worry!

279
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,646
Officer?

280
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,850
Wait.

281
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:22,406
I wanna talk to the cop who busted me today.
I think his name is Krugman.

282
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,406
- You wanna talk to him about what?
- What happened tonight.

283
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:30,566
He wants to know about it,
so tell him that I'm ready to talk.

284
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:33,610
Come on.

285
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:50,087
Two years ago in Kosovo

286
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:54,530
the man who went into the building
before the explosion obviously wasn't you.

287
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,605
- You were using a double.
- A common technique.

288
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:02,003
I am surprised your people
were fooled by it.

289
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,362
- That's not my point, Victor.
- What is your point, Jack?

290
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:11,171
You were using a double.
That means you thought you were a target.

291
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:15,485
When you let that man near your family,
you put them in danger.

292
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:18,371
You're responsible for their deaths.

293
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:23,163
They were away on a trip.
My daughter was ill.

294
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:27,803
They returned one day earlier than expected.

295
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:34,004
But, yes, I should have been more careful.

296
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,481
Father, are you all right?

297
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:52,281
Over the last two years

298
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:58,082
I have accepted my share of responsibility
for the death of my family.

299
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:02,290
This is the day...

300
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:05,683
you accept your share.

301
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:12,007
Come, Dada.

302
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,522
Make sure he does not die.

303
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:41,209
Come.

304
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:49,524
Is this what you wanted?

305
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:56,602
Mm-hm. Much better.

306
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,524
- Senator?
- Yeah, Elaine?

307
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:03,084
- Mike says they're ready for you downstairs.
- Tell him I'll be down in 20 minutes.

308
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:07,405
- Do you have a copy for the TelePrompTer?
- Uh, it's this one.

309
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:10,371
All but the last page.

310
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:12,651
OK. Thanks.

311
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:15,645
Would you like to be left alone?

312
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,293
No. You can work in here if you want.

313
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,604
I'm sorry.

314
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:50,684
What is it?

315
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:55,212
It's just that I feel bad that
this day's been tainted for you.

316
00:26:56,213 --> 00:27:00,764
Don't feel bad for me.
It's Keith and Nicole who have been suffering.

317
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,286
Excuse me for saying this,
but you do that too much.

318
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,650
- Do what?
- You worry about everybody else.

319
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,008
Who takes care of you?

320
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,926
You all take care of me.

321
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:19,244
No. We all wantto, but planning
schedules and writing speeches

322
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,403
isn't taking care of someone.

323
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,204
I'm fine, Patty.

324
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,173
Just relax.

325
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:44,484
You need this.

326
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:50,202
Oh, that does feel good.

327
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,249
I appreciate it, Patty.

328
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,245
I really do.

329
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:16,928
But if I get too comfortable,
I may not get off this couch.

330
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:20,528
Yeah, well, uh...

331
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:24,606
I'll just go prepare tomorrow's briefing
with Mike. Excuse me.

332
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,733
- CTU. Myers.
- Chapelle calling for Mason.

333
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,963
Yes. I'll put you through.

334
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,403
- Mason.
- It's Chapelle.

335
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,573
Ryan, I've been tryin'
to reach you for a half-hour.

336
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:58,009
Yeah. Well, I've been getting
reamed by DOD and the Pentagon.

337
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:01,085
But I think I've managed
to untangle the mess you've made.

338
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,767
What are you talking about?

339
00:29:03,853 --> 00:29:07,528
You should have kept Bauer
on a tighter leash, a lot tighter.

340
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:11,162
- I'm not in love with the guy, but he delivers.
- Oh, really?

341
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:15,852
Let's face it, if it wasn't for Jack,
Victor Drazen would have escaped,

342
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:19,562
which would have been embarrassing
for some, if I'm not mistaken.

343
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,848
- You're very mistaken.
- I beg your pardon?

344
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,811
Come on, George. Think it through.

345
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:29,887
Drazen wasn't officially a prisoner, right?
So he couldn't officially escape.

346
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:33,010
It wouldn't have embarrassed anyone.
It would have been...

347
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:35,288
- A nonevent.
- Exactly.

348
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,286
Instead, we have an assault team out there
with all kinds of people in the loop.

349
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:43,002
Soon the cops'll get wind of it,
and then, God forbid, the press.

350
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:45,766
You wanna talk about embarrassing?

351
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:51,771
Now, we have to end this thing. And
I'm not talking hours, I'm talking minutes.

352
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,684
What about Bauer?

353
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,931
Nobody asked him to go out there tonight.

354
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:05,404
Now, get on with it,
or I'll find someone who will.

355
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,844
Yeah?

356
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:20,325
I'm gonna have to order a full assault,
starting in about five minutes.

357
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,851
Team's making their final preparations.

358
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,605
I'm sorry.

359
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:39,808
CTU. Almeida.

360
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:43,442
This is Detective Krugman. We got
a Kim Bauer here. Says she knows you.

361
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:46,650
She's absolutely telling the truth.
You sure she's OK?

362
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,007
She's fine.

363
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:52,644
Hang on a second. Her mother's worried sick.
I wanna let her know. OK?

364
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,561
Teri, it's Tony. Can you pick up?

365
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:01,283
- Hello?
- Look, we've found Kim.

366
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:04,410
She's fine. She's in a precinct.
They're bringing her over.

367
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:08,725
- Are you sure she's OK? Can I talk to her?
- We'll put you through as soon as we can.

368
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,805
OK. You patch her through
as soon as she calls.

369
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,531
- Thank you.
- OK.

370
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:15,285
- They found Kim.
- They did?

371
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,807
- Yeah.
- That's great.

372
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:20,764
I'm so relieved.

373
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,769
Um...

374
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:30,088
Teri, I have some information about Jack.

375
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,122
Why don't you sit down?

376
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:43,287
We think he may have been captured by
the same group that was after you and Kim.

377
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,404
Oh, my God!

378
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:52,163
I know that sounds bad,
but we have rescue teams on the site,

379
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:55,609
and the people who have Jack
have been completely surrounded.

380
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:07,202
Teri... I know Jack.

381
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:11,812
I know he will get out of this.

382
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,362
I knew you'd want to be told.

383
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:55,009
Team One is inside.
Repeat: Team One is inside.

384
00:32:57,813 --> 00:33:00,281
Charges are in place. We are good to go.

385
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,689
- Yeah?
- This is it.

386
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,121
- All right.
- What about Bauer?

387
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:22,682
Just make sure you get Drazen. Go.

388
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:24,926
Hit it.

389
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,371
Go! Go!

390
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,765
Kimberly.

391
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:05,811
- What is it?
- We're releasing you.

392
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:10,125
- Did you speak to my dad?
- No, but I talked to the people he works with.

393
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:19,084
Melanie told me she lied before. She admitted
you had nothing to do with the drug deal.

394
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,370
So I called the number you gave me,
and everything checked out.

395
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,968
- Sounds like you had a tough day.
- Yeah. Did you speak to my mom?

396
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:28,248
- She's waiting at CTU.
- Are you serious?

397
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,847
I'm serious. I'm gonna drive you there myself.

398
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:35,290
I already processed you out, so you can
call her from the car if you want.

399
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:45,966
- Ready?
- I think so.

400
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,772
- Would you do me a favour, David?
- What's that, Mike?

401
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,923
Smile.

402
00:34:51,013 --> 00:34:53,402
Not a politician's smile, a real one.

403
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:57,650
You've been through hell today,
but you've come through it.

404
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:01,328
And tomorrow morning the fight starts again.

405
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:04,405
But tonight you need to celebrate.

406
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,449
I'll be fine, Mike.

407
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,527
Let go of it, just for a little bit.

408
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,167
I can't.

409
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,245
This thing with Keith is just beginning.

410
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:21,407
And as for Sherry and me? You've had a
front-row seat today. You know it's not good.

411
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:25,692
Let me explain something to you.

412
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:30,324
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

413
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:34,008
It's what you need to do the job.

414
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:40,726
If it's your marriage that helps you...
that's great.

415
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:44,726
But if not... well, that's OK, too.

416
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,284
You can have whatever you want, David.

417
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:01,046
All right, Mike. Let's go.

418
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,052
Patty.

419
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,124
Yes, Senator?

420
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,042
Thank you for all your help today.

421
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,964
Congratulations, sir.

422
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,164
Thank you.

423
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,809
Report.

424
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:56,770
One dead body.

425
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:59,526
No hostiles. Sector One secure.

426
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:14,409
Sector Two secure. One dead body.
Appears to be the warden - DeSalvo.

427
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,964
No hostiles.

428
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,886
Drake, this is Mason.
What's goin' on down there?

429
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,362
The entire staff,
including the warden, is dead.

430
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:25,684
But Drazen's gone, and so
is anyone else who was here.

431
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,649
Looks like they broke through another wall.
Some sort of tunnel.

432
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,611
- Maybe an old sewer system.
- Follow them.

433
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:50,767
Drake?

434
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,050
Drake?

435
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,011
It's booby-trapped. Laser mines.

436
00:37:57,853 --> 00:37:59,889
- Can you disarm?
- Given time.

437
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,168
How much?

438
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,724
About a half-hour.

439
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:10,208
Do what you can.

440
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:24,006
Get your hands back on your head.

441
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,683
Well done.

442
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:37,528
Father, we have less than
three hours left. Get down.

443
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,843
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

444
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:43,289
I will offer you one consolation.

445
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,764
Your family will be joining you soon.

446
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:50,925
Your son Alexis -
do you wanna see him again?

447
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:54,207
- Alexis is dead.
- No, he's not. We've got him.

448
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:56,727
You are lying.

449
00:38:56,813 --> 00:39:00,806
How else would I know that he was
supposed to meet with one of Palmer's staff,

450
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:05,921
a woman named Elizabeth Nash,
in room 1243 at 4.30 this afternoon?

451
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:09,972
- Yeah, that much is true.
- We captured him. I know where he is.

452
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,124
Get him in!

453
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:01,885
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Oh, yeah.

454
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:15,723
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom. It's me.

455
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,004
- Hi, honey.
- Can't wait to see you.

456
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:20,926
I can't wait to see you.
I'm glad you're OK. I thought...

457
00:40:21,013 --> 00:40:23,846
I know. I thought they had you again.

458
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:28,290
- How did you end up in jail?
- I'll tell you when I get there. Where's Dad?

459
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:34,567
He's not here. He's working.
I'm hoping he'll call in very soon.

460
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:39,852
I love you so much, Mom. And I'm
gonna be there in a few minutes, OK?

461
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,841
I love you too, honey.

462
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,367
- Bye.
- Bye.

463
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:55,410
Thanks.

464
00:41:05,093 --> 00:41:10,292
- I'm real sorry about not believin' you at first.
- Don't worry. Not sure if I believe it myself.

465
00:41:10,773 --> 00:41:13,367
Watch out! Argh!

466
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:27,803
No! No! No! Get off me!

467
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,603
No! Get off me!

468
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:08,886
