3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,883
Have you made the preparations?

4
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:15,973
Sure you want to leave now, Colonel?

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,268
General Juma will not be pleased
to learn you're abandoning your mission.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,604
The mission is over.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,355
You think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett?

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,042
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country,

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,955
a data file with all the names
and transactions of all those involved

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,737
will be sent
to the Justice Department.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,691
When the car arrives,
we would like you to go with the driver

12
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,575
so that we could follow you
back to Dubaku.

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,410
You want her to go to him
and face him?

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,704
It's our only chance to find him
before he disappears

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,247
- forever.
- I'll do it.

16
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,750
- You keep her safe, you hear me?
- We will.

17
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,005
FBI. Go! Go!

18
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:01,977
I want the names of everyone
that you've been working with.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,354
I have a list.

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,399
I found some kind of storage device
implanted under Dubaku's skin.

21
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,817
Can you upload the files?

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,763
Marika didn't make it.

23
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:12,238
You killed my sister.

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,614
I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,741
- What do you want?
- To know that you feel

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,370
something. I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

27
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,955
Do you feel that?

28
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,113
I'm working with FBI to coordinate
an interagency sweep.

29
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:27,896
We should make arrests
within the hour.

30
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,774
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

31
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,376
There are a lot of people to thank,
including Jack Bauer.

32
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,217
What are you asking me to do, Bill?

33
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:37,179
I'm asking you to speak
to Senator Mayer.

34
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,354
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

35
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,559
He doesn't deserve
to spend his life in prison.

36
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,728
- I'm going to the White House.
- Sir?

37
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,522
President Taylor wants to speak to me
regarding Jack Bauer.

38
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,400
Grab your laptop, Ryan.
I want you there with me.

39
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,111
There's gonna be another attack,
here in D.C.

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,573
My source tells me
that the window opens at 1900 hours.

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,074
What's the target?

42
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:58,951
He doesn't know the exact target,

43
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:02,872
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,287
He gave me the name of somebody
who's been involved.

45
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:06,570
- Who?
- Ryan Burnett.

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,335
- Senator Mayer's chief of staff?
- That's right.

47
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,017
Hold on a second.

48
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:34,784
Go ahead.

49
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:44,997
ICU.
One moment, please.

50
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:47,535
Corinna, you got a call on three.

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,907
- Who is it?
- Dr. May. He's got a question.

52
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,386
Doctors are so helpless.

53
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,031
Dr. May?

54
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,097
There was no one there.

55
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:06,361
If he calls back,
tell him I'll call him back in a minute.

56
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,984
Code Blue. Code Blue!
We have a Code Blue in the ICU!

57
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,237
Get Agent Walker down to ICU now!

58
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,999
<i>"Swift and decisive"
is how the Pentagon describes</i>

59
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,795
<i>the U.S. invasion
now underway in Sangala.</i>

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,351
"Sporadic resistance,
minimal casualties."

61
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>This in direct contrast</i>

62
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,560
<i>to assertions made
by Sangalese leader Benjamin Juma</i>

63
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,411
<i>on state-supported television.</i>

64
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:36,176
<i>Our brave soldiers
are beating back the enemy</i>

65
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,431
<i>all across Sangala City.</i>

66
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,235
<i>History is on our side, my friends.</i>

67
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,331
<i>We survived their slave ships,</i>

68
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,976
<i>and we will survive
their warships, too.</i>

69
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:51,498
Declaring victory while his own troops
are fleeing the capital,

70
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,065
and his palace lies in ruins.

71
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,561
When do we think this was made?

72
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,374
My guess is these recordings were made
some time before the invasion, ma'am.

73
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,183
Which begs the question, John.

74
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,167
Where is he,
and why haven't we found him yet?

75
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,597
Special Forces teams all over
Sangala City are searching for him.

76
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,374
There is some intelligence to suggest
he may have fled the country.

77
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,725
Admiral Smith, you and I both know
that Juma must be captured.

78
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:18,081
He must be tried and convicted
of his crimes against humanity.

79
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:19,884
Otherwise, we've as good as failed.

80
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:23,387
He can't go far, ma'am. No country
on earth will grant him asylum.

81
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,681
Then find him, Admiral Smith.

82
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:27,800
Wherever he is.

83
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:33,603
General Juma?

84
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:36,689
Beautiful, isn't it?

85
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,194
Sir?

86
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,196
It's not a trick question, Laurent.

87
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:43,079
It is beautiful.

88
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,516
Why not?

89
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,415
It is almost time.

90
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,123
The men, are they ready?

91
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,611
Yes, sir.

92
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,418
Are they afraid?

93
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,732
I don't know, sir,
but some of them are praying.

94
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,426
It's good if they are afraid.

95
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:04,686
It means they will fight bravely.

96
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,412
Have you heard
from my father yet, sir?

97
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:11,143
I thought he was supposed
to be meeting us here.

98
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,346
Don't worry, Laurent.

99
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,147
He will be here.

100
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,451
- Colonel Dubaku is dead.
<i>- Are you certain?</i>

101
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,428
The dose I administered
was catastrophic.

102
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,664
<i>His son just asked me about him.</i>

103
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,699
He must never know about this,

104
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,085
or about his father's cowardice.

105
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,336
He won't.

106
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,130
<i>Then nothing will stand in our way, Udo.
But hurry.</i>

107
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,926
The attack window is narrowing.
Our timing must be precise.

108
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,552
Yes, sir.

109
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,650
Clear.

110
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,354
- One more time at 360.
- 360. You're charged.

111
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,522
Clear.

112
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,303
Nothing.

113
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:01,899
Going again, Doctor?

114
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,117
That's it, everybody.
I'm calling it.

115
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,109
Time of death: 6:06 pm.

116
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:12,864
- Dr. Stahl, what's going on?
- A massive heart attack.

117
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,452
You said that he was stable.
So, what happened?

118
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:18,122
I'm not sure.
Maybe a preexisting condition.

119
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,468
The autopsy will tell us.
Excuse me.

120
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,553
The wide extent of the corruption
requires a coordinated approach.

121
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,347
<i>We know the government is compromised.
We just don't know at what level.</i>

122
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,886
<i>Presently, Chloe O'Brian is vetting
the names department by department.</i>

123
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:38,313
I'm prioritizing Secret Service,
so the president is secured ASAP.

124
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,908
Team leaders will then receive
their assignments:

125
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,604
Defense, Treasury, State, et cetera,

126
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,280
and make their arrests
contemporaneously across the District.

127
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:52,745
- O'Brian.
<i>- Chloe, it's Jack.</i>

128
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,738
Have the names from Dubaku's database
been given to the arrest teams yet?

129
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:56,790
<i>Not yet.</i>

130
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,994
I've just learned Juma's operatives
are planning another attack.

131
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,712
They're telling us here it's over.

132
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,985
That's wrong.
Tony's my source on the intel.

133
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,131
- What's the target?
- Only that it's high value,

134
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,802
high casualty, and it's happening now,
which is why I need your help.

135
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,557
There's a name on the list,
a Ryan Burnett.

136
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,007
- He's Senator Mayer's chief of staff.
- Mayer?

137
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,929
The guy who grilled you this morning
at the Senate Subcommittee hearing?

138
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,941
But the senator's not implicated.

139
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,191
But Burnett has been providing support
for Juma and Dubaku all along.

140
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,485
I need you to delete
his name from the list.

141
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:25,747
What?

142
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,990
- Why?
- If the FBI start to move in on him,

143
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,713
he'll lawyer up, and no one will get
the information on time.

144
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,163
- Where is he now?
- At the White House with the senator.

145
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,452
They have a meeting with the president.
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed.

146
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:37,898
I'll take care of him then.

147
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,128
You don't expect to interrogate
a suspect in the White House?

148
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,296
Let me handle that.

149
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,755
Get his name deleted from the list.
I'll get back to you.

150
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:46,843
She's in.

151
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,739
- How close are we?
- Close.

152
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,201
Can I help?

153
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,344
I'm just cycling
through the last layer of data now.

154
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,556
It might be quicker if you send
the subsets to my station one by one.

155
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,600
- Good idea.
- And then that way

156
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,561
I can get to work
on distributing them.

157
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,502
- Okay, then.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,444
Listen, Jack,
maybe you should reconsider.

159
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:04,251
Reconsider what?

160
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,504
Taking Bill into your confidence.

161
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,732
Look, I mean, he's been a part
of this operation since the get-go.

162
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,187
I don't know
what it'll take to get Burnett to talk.

163
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,486
If I have to use extreme measures...

164
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:19,183
You don't think he'll go there?

165
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,929
I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony.

166
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,147
I don't need to put Bill
in the passenger seat.

167
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,011
All right, then, fine.
I'll go with you.

168
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,363
You're a wanted felon. You wouldn't
get past the first checkpoint.

169
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,866
Besides, with all of the government
agencies still compromised,

170
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,319
it might be up to you
to stop the attack.

171
00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:43,865
See you on the other side.

172
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,177
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Can you extend the attack window?

173
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,832
Not without risking
the entire operation.

174
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,349
- Why?
<i>- There's been a complication.</i>

175
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:03,101
I may be stuck here
longer than I anticipated.

176
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:04,902
I'll call you back.

177
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,438
Mr. Kanin.

178
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,991
Ryan Burnett, Senator Mayer's chief
of staff. We've spoken on the phone.

179
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,070
Many times.
It's good to finally meet you.

180
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,735
Likewise. The senator's inside.
Right this way.

181
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:20,556
Senator?

182
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,832
Well, Senator,
I see you've found the bar.

183
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,821
Mind if I join you?

184
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,589
Something I never knew.

185
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,940
If it ain't from Kentucky,
you can't call it bourbon.

186
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,427
Spare me the Southern gentleman
routine, Ethan.

187
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:41,974
The president didn't call me up here
at the end of the day to drink her booze

188
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,887
and flip through a briefing book.

189
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:46,146
I thought it might be helpful
before your meeting

190
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,480
to bring you up to speed
on the last events.

191
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Okay.

192
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,776
I'm up to speed.

193
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,057
Senator,

194
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,366
surely you have some reaction
to what you just read.

195
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,981
Damn right I have a reaction.

196
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:04,774
I want to know what all this
has to do with Jack Bauer.

197
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,980
I mean, that's the reason
I'm here, right?

198
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,474
Without Mr. Bauer,

199
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,461
we would never have uncovered
the conspiracy in the first place

200
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,047
nor the people behind it.

201
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,172
His efforts,

202
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,103
in conjunction with those of the FBI,
are largely responsible

203
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,807
for the arrests being made right now
across the District.

204
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:23,515
You're not saying that he's acting
in an official capacity?

205
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,601
I don't have to tell you
how this looks, Ethan.

206
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,980
Colluding with a rogue operative
from a disbanded agency.

207
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,834
- I'm sorry you see it that way.
- How else am I supposed to see it?

208
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,545
The way the president does.

209
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,613
That Jack Bauer saved lives today,
plain and simple,

210
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,066
including her husband's.

211
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:45,683
Look, Senator,
I know this isn't easy for you.

212
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,164
The public battle you've waged
against detainee abuse

213
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,739
and human rights violations...

214
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:53,641
Are you seriously asking me
to look the other way on this?

215
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:57,227
I have been after this son of a bitch
for years.

216
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:58,884
He's a thug, Ethan.

217
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,464
He's exhibit "A."

218
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,226
The president is prepared
to reverse policy

219
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:11,146
and support your amendment
to the War Crimes Act.

220
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,937
In exchange for what exactly?

221
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,442
The hearings.

222
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,115
Declare a recess
till after the holidays

223
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,656
and then quietly let
Mr. Bauer's subpoena expire.

224
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,826
- And if I refuse to go along?
- The president is prepared

225
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,703
to invoke executive privilege.

226
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,884
Executive privilege,
meaning what exactly?

227
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,416
That's for the president to decide.

228
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,836
Are you talking about a pardon?

229
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,047
I wouldn't rule it out.

230
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:41,166
Well, if that's how the president
wants to play it, you can tell her

231
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,470
she just walked into a street fight.

232
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,818
You can tell her yourself.

233
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,863
You got here sooner than I expected.

234
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,119
Put down your weapon now!

235
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,123
Step away from the desk!

236
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:13,959
Take a seat.

237
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,127
Sit down, Bill!

238
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,546
Okay, okay, I'm sitting.

239
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,867
- Now, what's this all about?
- Where is Ryan Burnett?

240
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:22,134
- What?
- Mayer's chief of staff. Where is he?

241
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,553
I'm not saying anything
until you tell me what's going on.

242
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,308
Tony doubled back
to one of his contacts

243
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,378
who gave him information
of a second attack.

244
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:31,643
It'll take place here
in Washington within the hour.

245
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,167
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
Burnett's been supporting them.

246
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,023
He knows where the attack
will take place,

247
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,943
so you can either tell me where he is
or I will find him myself.

248
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,279
Jack, I can't.

249
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:46,074
Fine, put your hands
behind your back now.

250
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,690
How good is the intel?

251
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,914
Good enough for me to need
to talk to him. Don't you move.

252
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,685
Let me have him arrested.
There are other ways to deal with this.

253
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,673
The attack window's open.
We're out of time.

254
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,343
Jack, listen to me.

255
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,554
I spoke to the president
on your behalf.

256
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:12,091
She's going to intervene
with Senator Mayer, stop the hearings.

257
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:16,438
You can get your life back. You do this,
you're throwing it all away.

258
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,315
I wish there were another option.

259
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,307
Let me help you at least, Jack.

260
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,987
You don't have to do this alone.

261
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:25,555
Yes, I do.

262
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,216
It's the only way I can make sure
to keep you out of this.

263
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:34,164
- Bill, I'm sorry. Don't move.
- Wait.

264
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,505
Wait, Jack.

265
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,147
It's all right.

266
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:40,695
Don't fight it.

267
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,789
- This is Moss.
<i>- Larry, it's me.</i>

268
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,165
Dubaku's dead.

269
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,347
I thought the doctors said
he was stabilized.

270
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:21,962
- What happened?
<i>- Officially,</i>

271
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,965
they're characterizing that it was
a coronary brought on by systemic shock.

272
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:28,699
- Sounds like you don't believe it.
- I did a follow-up with the admin.

273
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,841
She confirmed there was an eight-member
team on duty when Dubaku flatlined.

274
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,116
There was a ninth man in the ICU
before the code was called, an orderly.

275
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,832
I ran back the tapes on the ward
and that's when I spotted him.

276
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:41,273
I've asked around
and nobody seems to know who he is.

277
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,608
Wait, are you saying
you think Dubaku was murdered?

278
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,835
I'm saying that there was
an unidentified man in with Dubaku

279
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,328
just before he went
into cardiac arrest.

280
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:52,830
- What does the admin say?
- She says that they often use floaters,

281
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,858
personnel from other area hospitals
filling in from time to time.

282
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:59,066
Said it's not uncommon for the regular
staff not to know who they are.

283
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,918
- She's double-checking with payroll.
- Right, so there's your answer.

284
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
Still it seems odd.
I mean,

285
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:08,156
what if Dubaku knew something
and they needed to shut him up?

286
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:10,083
Is this Bauer's theory, too?

287
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,138
Jack's not even here, and you know
I resent that implication.

288
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,714
- What implication?
- I'm not the one calling the shots.

289
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,463
This has been my investigation
from the beginning, not Jack Bauer's.

290
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:21,479
I was just asking a question.
I wasn't implying anything.

291
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:26,681
You there?

292
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:29,417
I'm sorry. I guess
I'm a little sensitive on the subject.

293
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,699
Everything we needed
from Dubaku, we got.

294
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:35,997
Names and bank accounts of every
corrupt official on his payroll.

295
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,226
Teams are in the field as we speak.

296
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:39,741
So you want me to come in.

297
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,709
We need you back in the office
to help process all these arrests.

298
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:47,248
Larry, look, I've got security searching
the hospital and reviewing more video.

299
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,584
- So you want to follow that up first?
- Yeah.

300
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,464
<i>- Fine, call me when you clear it.</i>
- I will. Thanks, Larry.

301
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,599
Excuse me, Agent Walker?
That orderly you were looking for,

302
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,978
one of our parking lot cameras
picked him up.

303
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,713
- When?
- About 15 minutes ago.

304
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,645
I've got a screen grab
of his license plate.

305
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,054
Thank you.

306
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:11,613
This is Agent Walker.
Put me through to our DMV contact.

307
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,076
Are you busy?

308
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:21,998
I'm just reformatting the server,
so, yeah, I guess I am busy. Why?

309
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,362
Well, I was cross-referencing
Dubaku's offshore accounts

310
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,676
and I came across
an orphaned header fragment.

311
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,589
- What are you talking about?
- Take a look.

312
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,879
Okay, see, there, right there,
right there. It's a remnant file header.

313
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,787
It's probably just
a phantom data string.

314
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,076
No, it isn't.

315
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,687
I ran a systems analysis.
The coding is not random.

316
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,973
It can be traced back
to one of the accounts.

317
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,859
Also, it looks like a name
was deleted from the list.

318
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,063
Why don't I run a recovery program?

319
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,449
Well, you're very busy
with the reformatting and all,

320
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,785
so why don't I just upload it
to my station and take care of it there?

321
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,977
Well, that's okay,
I can do it faster.

322
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:06,106
No offense. I'll let you know
if I retrieve anything.

323
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,144
Sure.

324
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,762
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

325
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,896
<i>Have you gotten to Burnett yet?</i>

326
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,315
Working on it.
Making my way over to the West Wing.

327
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,212
Someone here has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.

328
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:33,878
I don't know if I can hold her off.

329
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:36,853
- Do they know it was Burnett?
- No, but it's just a matter of time.

330
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,734
Okay, I'll get back to you.

331
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:41,781
Great.

332
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Senator,

333
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:47,940
I'll head back and get with Sandy.
We should have a press release drafted.

334
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,921
I'm also going to need a sit-down
with your friend Hauser at the Post.

335
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,772
Off the record, I assume.

336
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,573
We've got to make
pardoning Jack Bauer

337
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,617
as politically toxic
for the president as possible.

338
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,475
She's a woman
in a highly emotional state.

339
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,848
Her husband's been shot.

340
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,643
- You think her judgment's impaired?
- I think that a case could be made.

341
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,851
Excuse me, Senator. President Taylor
is ready to see you now.

342
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:12,650
Go ahead. I'll get this to the AG,
tell him you want the option to go ahead

343
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:14,736
- with the hearings tomorrow.
- Thanks, Ryan.

344
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:25,830
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's Burnett.

345
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,149
- You took care of the problem?
- I'm leaving now.

346
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:31,251
Good, then we rendezvous
at 2130 hours,

347
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,129
- as planned.
- I'll be there.

348
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:49,292
Excuse me,
I'll be out of here in just one second.

349
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,024
You and I...

350
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:57,311
we're going to have a talk.

351
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,341
We've got
a command post set up at EEOB,

352
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,742
and we'll brief CIA
and Diplomatic Security,

353
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,764
but not until after
the first sweep of arrests.

354
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:21,173
Look, nobody is going anywhere, Phil.
We've dropped a net on the city.

355
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,210
And I'll let you know
as soon as that happens.

356
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,335
All right.

357
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,016
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need you to listen to something.

358
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,187
- May I?
- Yeah, that's fine.

359
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,653
She's supposed to be
this whiz-bang systems analyst,

360
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,489
it tipped me off in the first place.

361
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:35,898
- Her demeanor is so bizarre...
- Janis, slow down.

362
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,883
- Who are you talking about?
- Chloe O'Brian.

363
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:41,335
I ran a systems check on her work,
and there's evidence of file tampering.

364
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,997
Plus she's been scrambling
all her out-of-office phone calls,

365
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,870
so I had Operations archive
her cellular traffic.

366
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,591
I did a work-around. Listen.

367
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:52,366
<i>- Yeah.
- Have you gotten to Burnett yet?</i>

368
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:55,015
<i>Working on it.
Making my way over to the West Wing.</i>

369
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,821
<i>Someone has figured out that a name
has been deleted from the database.</i>

370
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:00,676
<i>- I don't know if I can hold her off.
- Do they know it was Burnett?</i>

371
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,053
<i>- No, but it's just a matter of time.
- Okay, I'll get back to you.</i>

372
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:09,911
Becker.

373
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,510
In the conference room.
I want Chloe O'Brian detained.

374
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,165
And get her off that server.

375
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,638
Get me the White House.

376
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,181
Let me just remind you,
Madam President,

377
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,592
you supported the effort

378
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:44,622
to ban abuse and torture.

379
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:47,797
You campaigned
to reform the intelligence agencies.

380
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:50,259
These past ten hours, Senator,

381
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:53,061
things haven't appeared
as black and white as they once did.

382
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,729
Well, there's nothing gray
about Jack Bauer.

383
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,113
The man has committed atrocities.

384
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:00,488
Prisoners have died in his custody.

385
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:04,364
Mr. Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents, not just me.

386
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,260
Is it any more lawful
or any less repugnant

387
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:09,535
if it's authorized
at the highest level?

388
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,538
A state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.

389
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:14,443
Oh, don't lecture me, Senator.

390
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:17,218
I am well aware
of the limits of my power.

391
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,059
Due respect, Madam President,

392
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:21,381
your power is great.

393
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:25,093
Just be careful that you use it
to send the right message.

394
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:27,437
All I'm asking you to do

395
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,837
is excuse Mr. Bauer as a witness.

396
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:31,706
It's not a message.

397
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:35,019
It is an expression of gratitude
for what he's done today.

398
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,709
You're asking me to excuse him

399
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,298
as a target of the investigation.

400
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:43,081
And the message is clear.

401
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:46,406
Under certain circumstances,
you believe his methods are acceptable.

402
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:51,265
- Some would argue that they are.
- And they would be wrong.

403
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,137
Under any military
or moral standard.

404
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,688
America has been down this road before,
Madam President.

405
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,962
You yourself called it
a national tragedy.

406
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,678
It was a tragedy.

407
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:04,674
I still believe that.

408
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,317
Pardon Jack Bauer,

409
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:08,990
and you're telling
every interrogator in the field

410
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,722
that it's open season again.

411
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,589
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt,
Madam President.</i>

412
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,328
<i>There's an urgent call
from Larry Moss at FBI.</i>

413
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,825
- Put him through.
- <i>Yes sir. Agent Moss is on the line.</i>

414
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,775
Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
You're on speaker with the president.

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,332
<i>Madam President, forgive me
for coming directly to the point.</i>

416
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:33,801
<i>You have a meeting this evening
with Senator Mayer?</i>

417
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,707
In fact, I do.
I'm with him right now.

418
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,888
Did the senator's chief of staff,
Ryan Burnett,

419
00:23:38,013 --> 00:23:40,084
accompany the senator
to the White House?

420
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,671
- Yes, he did, Agent Moss, why?
<i>- I have reason to believe</i>

421
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,591
that Jack Bauer is carrying out
an off-book interrogation of Mr. Burnett

422
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,817
as we speak.

423
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:57,880
I can pull the trigger 128 more times
before this battery dies.

424
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,305
I'm telling you,
I don't know anything about an attack.

425
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,139
- Stop lying to me.
- I'm not lying.

426
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,423
- What's the target?
- I don't know.

427
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:08,081
Mr. Burnett,
you are a traitor and a terrorist.

428
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:09,947
I'm not. I love my country.

429
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,328
That was 1,200 volts of current.

430
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,015
Now, when I eject this cartridge,

431
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,166
I access the drive stun mode

432
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,345
upping the voltage 40 times
when directly administered.

433
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,549
All you need to do is talk to me.
Mr. Burnett, it's really simple.

434
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,000
Just tell me what the target is,
and this will be all over.

435
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,013
I promise. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

436
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,512
This is your last chance.

437
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:38,189
If I knew, I would tell you,
I swear it.

438
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,471
What do you want me to say?

439
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,438
Just tell me what to say,
and I'll say it.

440
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,402
Don't you even try
and play that game with me.

441
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:51,024
I've been doing this a long time,
and I can tell the difference,

442
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,179
especially when a man is under duress,
if he's got information that I need

443
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:56,604
or if I'm just wasting my time.
And I promise you,

444
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,621
I am not wasting my time.

445
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,209
The next jolt
is gonna be in your throat.

446
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,178
Anything above your neck

447
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,131
runs the risk
of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.

448
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:11,364
That means you run
the risk of becoming paralyzed.

449
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,088
Please.

450
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,393
Mr. Burnett, you built
the entire federal case against me.

451
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:18,038
You of all people should know

452
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:21,060
how far I am willing to go
to stop this attack from happening.

453
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,604
So, I'm gonna ask you one last time.

454
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,064
Where is the target?

455
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,986
Okay, okay, okay.

456
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,442
- I'm listening.
- Soldiers.

457
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:34,993
- How many?
- A unit.

458
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:37,702
- Juma's presidential guard.
- When?

459
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,702
It already started.

460
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:41,686
Where?
Where?!

461
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:44,304
<i>Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.</i>

462
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:47,767
- Where is the target?
<i>- Mr. Bauer... </i>

463
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:50,892
<i>Mr. Bauer,
I am ordering you to answer this page.</i>

464
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:54,794
<i>- Mr. Bauer, do you hear me?</i>
- Damn it!

465
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,347
Madam President, this is Jack Bauer.

466
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,184
I don't know what you've heard,
but it's not over.

467
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,978
There is another terrorist attack
going to take place within minutes.

468
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,564
There will be no discussion
until you unlock this door.

469
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:09,692
The attack window is open.
Juma's men are moving.

470
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,361
What you're doing is against the law,
Mr. Bauer.

471
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,240
I am your commander in chief,
and I am ordering you to stand down.

472
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:23,482
- How much longer, Sergeant?
- Good to go, ma'am.

473
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,624
Do it.

474
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,454
Where's the target?
Where is the target?

475
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,016
Where is...

476
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,087
I had him!

477
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:42,645
Man down.
EMTs to the visiting dignitary suite.

478
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,106
You're done, Bauer.
You're finished.

479
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:53,526
He was talking. Whatever's going
to happen is happening now,

480
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,502
and it's on your conscience.

481
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,032
My conscience has
a lot less to answer for than yours.

482
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:06,469
Mr. Bauer,

483
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,668
you say an attack is imminent.

484
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:12,083
- My source intel is good.
- Who is your source?

485
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:15,571
- I'd rather not say.
- The name, Mr. Bauer.

486
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:23,683
- Tony Almeida.
- Tony Almeida... the man's a fugitive.

487
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,857
Without Tony Almeida, we would never
have recovered the CIP device.

488
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,639
I don't care if his source
is the blessed Virgin Mary.

489
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:33,121
Nothing justifies
what went on in this room.

490
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:35,037
Even if he's right, Blaine?

491
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:37,512
Even if it means
we could save lives?

492
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:40,917
Look at that,
and tell me it's not barbarism.

493
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,516
Is that something you can live with?

494
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:47,391
Earlier today, Madam President,
two airplanes were brought down.

495
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,458
Is that something you can live with?

496
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,878
- You're reprehensible, Bauer.
- And you, sir, are weak!

497
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,463
Unwilling and unable

498
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,190
to look evil in the eye
and deal with it.

499
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,579
Ethan, step out for a second.

500
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,941
Suddenly, it's not
so hypothetical, is it?

501
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:13,566
In your opinion,
is Bauer's intelligence actionable?

502
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,333
If Bauer says there's going
to be an attack, my belief is,

503
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,820
there's going to be an attack.

504
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,796
Torture was originally intended
to force false confessions.

505
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,632
Now we use it to try
and find the truth.

506
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,584
These people murdered your son,
Madam President.

507
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:33,995
They attempted to murder
your husband.

508
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,920
They will stop at nothing.

509
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,605
Sergeant, take Mr. Bauer away.
He's under arrest.

510
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,807
You should have come to me.
You should have presented your case.

511
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:02,432
We didn't have time.

512
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,567
And would it really have made
a difference, madam?

513
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:16,629
Madam President,

514
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,598
- you're doing the right thing.
- 271 dead already.

515
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:22,420
I wish to God it felt more
like the right thing.

516
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:24,745
Raise the threat levels.

517
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,695
Tell Homeland they have until 7:00
to come up with a response scenario.

518
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,277
And get Tim down here.

519
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,228
Also, I want to talk
to Mr. Burnett myself.

520
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:35,971
Let me do that.

521
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:37,346
I know the man.

522
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,626
Apparently, you don't.

523
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,291
Got it.

524
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,131
Tim, I understand
the threat level has been raised,

525
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:04,375
but only for first responders
and federal agents.

526
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,515
There's a concern
that mass evacuation by the public

527
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,769
could hamper efforts
to thwart an attack when it comes.

528
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,577
What about the airspace
over Washington?

529
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:13,160
Restricted.
Military flyovers are commencing.

530
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:15,659
DOD has recommended
that we deploy mobile teams

531
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:18,367
to sweep the area for radioactive
and biological signatures.

532
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,885
I'll call Phillip at the Pentagon
and push it through.

533
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,944
What about NSA?

534
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:24,361
There's elevated
anti-American chatter

535
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,824
coming from the usual Web sites
and telephone traffic,

536
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,663
but nothing specific to the attack.

537
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:29,719
Thank you, Tim.

538
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,121
- I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes?
- Yes, madam.

539
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,497
Which means our best source
of intelligence

540
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:36,657
is still right here under our noses.

541
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:39,723
You realize we're gonna have
to offer this bastard a free pass.

542
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:42,548
With coercive measures off the table,
it's our only option.

543
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,949
Bauer's going to prison,
and a traitor walks.

544
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:48,546
What's wrong with this picture?

545
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,252
I need a minute with the prisoner.

546
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:59,138
You will be charged with treason

547
00:30:59,263 --> 00:31:02,902
under Title 18, Section 2381,
of the United States Code.

548
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:04,915
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy

549
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,948
and directly causing the death
of American citizens.

550
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,502
Do you understand?

551
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:14,622
Surely, you have something
to say for yourself.

552
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:17,374
I demand my right to counsel.

553
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:20,819
You'll have your counsel,
Mr. Burnett,

554
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,173
but first, you're going to tell me
everything you know.

555
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,258
Not in this lifetime.

556
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,803
- What did you say?
- I said, not in this lifetime.

557
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,072
Don't be so quick
to make up your mind, Mr. Burnett.

558
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,416
In exchange for information

559
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,608
which stops or significantly
mitigates this attack,

560
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:46,862
the president is prepared to grant you
full immunity from prosecution.

561
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:48,918
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:50,908
I can't help you.

563
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,244
If you and your family
are being threatened in any way...

564
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:58,666
Do you realize
what the president is offering you?

565
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:03,869
Treason is a capital offense,
Mr. Burnett.

566
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,460
If you don't cooperate
with us right now,

567
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:08,202
I will make it my personal mission

568
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:11,011
to see that you pay
the ultimate price for your crimes.

569
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:13,589
I won't condone torture,

570
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:17,132
but in your case, I would have
no problem with the death penalty.

571
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:20,985
Where's my lawyer?

572
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:18,871
It's me. That situation
at the hospital you told me about?

573
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,529
I'm on it, Larry.

574
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:23,138
I traced a license plate
to an import/export firm.

575
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,826
- Tell me.
- The orderly I mentioned

576
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,800
he just joined up
with about a dozen soldiers.

577
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:29,044
- Africans. Heavily armed.
- Where are you?

578
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,958
44543 Lambourne Marina,
near Johnson Park.

579
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,218
I'm in the basement.

580
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,619
Renee, we have intel
on another attack by Juma's people.

581
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:39,475
It's happening in D.C.,
sometime after 1900 hours.

582
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,519
- This is it, Larry. No question.
- All right, listen, sit tight.

583
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,191
I'm on my way with back up.

584
00:33:44,986 --> 00:33:48,108
Janis, scramble a chopper.
On the roof in two minutes.

585
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,336
- Okay. But also...
- Janis, just do it.

586
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,464
This is Larry Moss.

587
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:56,139
Put me through to Metro Police.

588
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:57,868
Charters, Turner, with me.

589
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,179
General,

590
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,585
there is no sign of my father.

591
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,539
I just spoke with him.

592
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,340
Unfortunately
he won't be able to join us.

593
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:13,384
- Why not?
- Because he got delayed

594
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,720
in his attempt to secure safe passage
for us from the country.

595
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:21,157
Then, sir, let me take his place
on the assault team.

596
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:22,893
Spoken like a true Dubaku.

597
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:26,427
But you are also
my only reconnaissance officer.

598
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:28,648
- But, General...
- No, I need you on the perimeter

599
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:29,936
to provide intelligence

600
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:33,362
and also to disrupt whatever
rescue operations there may be.

601
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:35,218
Understood?

602
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,283
Understood, sir.

603
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:40,859
Make your final preparations.

604
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:43,288
- It is time for us to go.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:53,674
- Larry, hurry, they're moving out.
- We're ten minutes away.

606
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,462
Is it possible that Juma himself
is leading this attack?

607
00:34:56,587 --> 00:34:58,334
Juma?
Why do you say that?

608
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:01,214
I know it sounds crazy,
but I swear that I just saw him.

609
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:02,814
What? Here?
Are you sure?

610
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,039
Unless he has an identical twin.

611
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,780
All right, I'll alert Homeland.
Good work.

612
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:10,434
- Any idea what the next target is?
- Negative.

613
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,713
See if you get a fix on that.
But, listen, don't take any chances.

614
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:15,538
- All right?
- I won't.

615
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:17,888
Okay, thank you.

616
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,339
Sir. You should have
an EMT take a look at you.

617
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:23,325
I'm fine.
Is Bauer in custody?

618
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,534
- Yes, sir. He's in holding.
- That'll be all.

619
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:37,170
<i>It's Bill.</i>

620
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:40,293
Jack's under arrest.
They've got him locked down in a cell.

621
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,434
- Listen to me, Bill...
- No, you listen.

622
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:45,148
We still don't know
where this attack's taking place.

623
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:46,717
- Burnett didn't break?
- No.

624
00:37:46,842 --> 00:37:49,274
They stopped Jack
before he could get the information.

625
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,310
And Burnett didn't go
for the immunity deal.

626
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,396
You brought Jack the intel, right?

627
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,647
That's right.

628
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,022
<i>How real is it?</i>

629
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,066
Very.

630
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,785
<i>Who was your contact?</i>

631
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,584
It was a guy in Emerson's crew
with a direct line to Juma.

632
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,449
- Any chance we get a crack at this guy?
<i>- That's highly unlikely,</i>

633
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,523
- to say the least.
<i>- What are you telling me, he's dead?</i>

634
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,121
That's right.

635
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,274
I wish to God
you'd brought me in on this.

636
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,419
Jack didn't want
to put you in that position.

637
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,503
For what it's worth,
he was trying to protect you.

638
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,714
Did you have
a fallback plan, at least?

639
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,955
Immunity for Burnett
was the fallback.

640
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,177
That's it?
Nothing else?

641
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:28,642
Nothing.

642
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:35,562
I keep trying Renee, and I get
her voice mail. What's going on?

643
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,832
- Something's wrong with her phone.
- What do you mean?

644
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:40,525
I just spoke to her five minutes ago.
Can you triangulate her position?

645
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,444
- I can't.
- Why not?

646
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:43,737
There's no signal.

647
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:47,684
Either the battery's dead,
or her cell got damaged somehow.

648
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,744
All right, keep trying.
Get back to me when you know something.

649
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:51,869
Okay.

650
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,111
From our location, it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

651
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,226
From this point forward,

652
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,128
we maintain radio silence

653
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,168
until the target is secured.

654
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,004
Understood?

655
00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:44,006
- Yes, sir.
- Understood.

656
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:52,384
You all have your assignments.

657
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,308
May God be with us.

658
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:19,021
Laurent,

659
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:21,537
- take your position.
- Yes, sir.
