1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,760
Tell me about Ron Wieland.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,680
- He's going public with the rumour.
- About the bomb?

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,960
We're holding him at the OC.
When the crisis passes l'll let him go.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360
You better come out here.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,680
What l find most troubling is that

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,440
our president knows about this threat
and is saying nothing.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
- Who was controlling that room?
- Armus.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
l want to see him now.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
Kim, l'm scared!

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
Where are you taking her?
She can't go back to LA.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
l checked you out.
Your father does work for CTU.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,720
Now you tell me, what did he tell you
was gonna happen today in LA?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
lt's a nuclear bomb.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
What's my father's connection to all this?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,960
He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,200
in return for consulting services.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,800
Maybe they were doing business.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,800
Syed Ali's only business
is bankrolling terrorists.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,320
l'm a consultant for the ClA.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's go!

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
(speaks Arabic)

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,120
(Michelle) Nina, how big is the bomb?

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,440
What did he tell you?

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,400
- Everything.
- No!

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
We're losing him!

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,080
- Jack...
- Secure her!

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,640
l know where the bomb is.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,880
l was illegally detained inside the
president's retreat for the last six hours.

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,040
That tells you how much he did not
want this information come out.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
No, Karen.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,160
- That does me no good.
- What am l looking for?

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,200
Wieland has a source inside of this
administration, and l need to know who.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
- l'm on it.
- Fine.

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Then you get back to me with that. OK.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
No, l need the information. Good.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,400
- What does that mean?
- Wieland's been contained for six hours.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
After you met with him,
someone let him out.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
And you think it was me?

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,320
Even if l had the resources, which l don't,

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,760
why in God's name would l want to see
Wieland cause a panic, especially today?

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
- l don't know.
- David, l had nothing to do with this.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,880
l swear on the lives of our children!

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,520
Mr President...

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Wait here.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,600
You find Armus yet?
l wanna know how Wieland got past him.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Take a look.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
What's this?

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,800
A digital playback from
the surveillance feeds at OC.

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,560
That's Armus.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,000
This happened 25 minutes ago.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
- Armus let him out?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,440
- Where is he?
- We haven't found him.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,040
Mr President, if Armus is
working covertly against you...

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
lt's not covert now! lt's in my face!

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,520
- We will find him, sir.
- We'd better.

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,640
Because whomever he's working for
is trying to keep me from finding this bomb!

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
- How long till we go down?
- Any minute.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,520
The pilots found us a place to crash land.
l've gotta get the coordinates to George.

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,760
- George?
- Jack, what's happening?

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,960
We're going down.
The pilots don't know what's going on.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,920
lt felt like some kind of explosion.
We're losing all kinds of power.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,440
They think they can make
a safe crash landing

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,680
on a soft riverbed located in sector J.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,880
The coordinates are 34-30-44 north,

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,880
119-0-niner-0-5 west.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, we got it.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,440
Nina, there's a chance we're
not gonna make it through this.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
We need to know the location
of the bomb now!

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,920
We've given you everything
you've asked for! Please!

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Can she hear me?

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Hold on, l'll put you on speaker.

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,400
Nina, you got your pardon from the
president. What more do you want?

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Even if l survive this, Jack's gonna kill me.

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,280
- Phillips is there to protect you.
- He can't protect me from Jack!

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,440
Nina, all l want is the location of the bomb.

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
l give you my word,
l will not harm you in any way!

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,760
l don't believe you!

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,240
- Where is the bomb?
- Rick, holster your weapon!

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,440
- Do one last good thing with your life!
- Phillips, what is going on?

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat!

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the captain. We're not
going to make it to the riverbed.

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Everyone assume crash position
and get ready for impact.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,360
George, we're going down!
We're not gonna make the riverbed.

85
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
The coordinates l gave you,
they're going to be off...

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,840
(white noise)

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,040
Get the crash-site coordinates from ATC
and send in search and rescue.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,960
ATC, this is CTU.
l need the exact coordinates.

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,720
l'll prepare a statement in the next hour.
ln the meantime, let's find Armus.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Sherry... l owe you an apology.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Why? What did Mike say to you?

93
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,520
Richard Armus was the one
who let Wieland go.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,640
But Armus doesn't have his own agenda.
He must be working for someone else.

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
We're looking into it now.

96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,440
l'm sorry l jumped to the wrong conclusion.

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
lt's all right.

98
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,720
l don't expect you to change
your attitude towards me overnight.

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Apology accepted.

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
David...

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,960
What are you gonna do?

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Talk to the press.

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,880
l'm not sure how, but l may have to
go after Ron's credibility.

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
- Ron's credibility?
- Yes.

105
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Make it look like his report was motivated

106
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,800
by personal dislike,
that it's not based in fact.

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,640
Yes, but it is based in fact.

108
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
- Believe me, l wish there was another way.
- Maybe there is.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Why don't you just tell the truth, David?
lt's what you do best.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,480
l mean, you pulled it off with Keith,
with our divorce.

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,920
You've earned the public's trust. Just use it.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,120
l'm just wondering if you've really changed,

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,560
or if you've just gotten better at pretending.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,600
- Sir?
- Yes, what is it?

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,600
We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,520
The plane Jack Bauer was returning in
just went down.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
lt crashed?

119
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
We're still waiting for details.

120
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Oh, my God!

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
(yells)

122
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,200
Rick. Rick!

123
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Rick!

124
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,720
Myers...

125
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,760
l haven't found her.
l don't even know if she made it.

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
Find her...

127
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,400
l'm gonna find her. You gotta hang in there.

128
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Hang in there. Search and rescue
will be here any minute.

129
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
Just hang in there. l'll be right back.

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,200
Come on, come on.

131
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,720
(breathes deeply)

132
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,400
These images were taken around the time
the pilot reported the explosion.

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,720
- They were shot down.
- By some kind of ground-to-air missile.

134
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,360
Compile a list of anybody that might
have had access to their flight plan.

135
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,120
lf Nina didn't die in the crash,
whoever it was will want to finish the job.

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,440
l have search and rescue scrambling now.

137
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,160
Make sure they're well armed.
Get me their ETA as soon as you have it.

138
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,120
George, Richards told me you had Warner
and Naiyeer transferred to room seven.

139
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,880
- That's right.
- l separated them for a reason.

140
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,560
lt's not working, so let's put them together
and play them off each other.

141
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,440
One minute you're trying
to save your own ass,

142
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,120
then you act like you give
a damn about anybody...

143
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,560
- Back off!
- No, l'm not gonna back off.

144
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,800
Not today. Now, what's going on?

145
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,600
Remember the warehouse
in Panorama City?

146
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,080
Weapons-grade plutonium,
airborne in the firefight.

147
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
- You were exposed?
- Yeah.

148
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,160
Said l'd be lucky
if l made it through tomorrow.

149
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,360
l don't know what to say, George.

150
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
l'm sorry.

151
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Me too.

152
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,680
Does anybody else know about this?

153
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Just Jack. You. Can we keep it that way?

154
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Do you need anything?
ls there something l can do?

155
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,720
Just do you job. Let me do mine.

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,080
(door opens)

157
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,800
So you both claim not to know Syed Ali.

158
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,640
- lt's not a claim. lt's the truth.
- Sit down.

159
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,280
- l'd rather stand.
- Sit down!

160
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,960
Where the hell do you think you are?
Wake up!

161
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
A cache of weapons-grade plutonium was
found in a warehouse in Panorama City!

162
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
A nuclear weapon was assembled there
and it's set to be detonated today.

163
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
A nuclear bomb?

164
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,080
We also found this in the warehouse.
What do you make of that, guys?

165
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
This is a bill of lading from our company.

166
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,680
For a container sent to Syed Ali,

167
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,400
which means at least one of you
is lying right now.

168
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,560
l'll let you two work that out
between yourselves.

169
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Whoever talks first gets immunity.

170
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,360
lt's a one-time offer.
lt expires in ten minutes.

171
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,600
- They're gonna come for us soon.
- What's taking them so long?

172
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
l don't know, but they'll be here.

173
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
- We're leaving soon.
- Where are we going?

174
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,680
- Central booking.
- LAPD? That's downtown.

175
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
- l know where it is.
- Aw, man.

176
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,160
What did l tell you? l don't believe this.

177
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Someone from CTU is supposed to pick
us up. Can you call George Mason?

178
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,120
Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction.

179
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,120
Look, you're both suspects
in a capital crime.

180
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,080
- We told you why we can't go back to LA.
- The bomb.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
- Yes.
- l checked it.

182
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,040
There's been no departmental alert
or elevated threat status.

183
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,200
They do not want the entire city
to panic at once.

184
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,920
Do you think we're making this up?
Call CTU. They'll tell you.

185
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
l'm a cop. l have my orders, OK?

186
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,560
l'll sign you two out
before l take you back to the city.

187
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,000
- l don't believe this. We can't go back to LA.
- When my dad finds out, he'll fix things.

188
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,800
We shouldn't be counting on your father.

189
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,200
No offence, but you were right
when you said how messed up he is.

190
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,360
Everything l've said about my father
is because l was angry

191
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,280
and l blamed him for
what happened to my mom.

192
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,960
- Maybe you were right.
- No.

193
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,640
No, listen, it wasn't his fault,
and he did the best he could.

194
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,040
lt just all turned out wrong.

195
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,840
No, this is crazy.

196
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,920
How can they keep us here
without letting us see a lawyer?

197
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Huh?

198
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,520
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Because nothing we say
will make any difference.

200
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,840
They'll make it look like we're involved.

201
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,320
With a nuclear bomb? l've done nothing
wrong! This is crazy! l have nothing to hide!

202
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,440
- What about you, Bob?
- What about me?

203
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,600
- You got anything to hide?
- Of course not. No.

204
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
You made the authorisation to Ali.

205
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
- No, l didn't.
- Then who did?

206
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,400
Don't interrogate me.
That's exactly what they want.

207
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,840
Yeah? l'm not asking for them.

208
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,040
lf you didn't make the authorisation...

209
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,280
Naiyeer's levels are even.
Warner's spiking all over.

210
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
(Reza) They also said...
that you work for the ClA.

211
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,400
l let the ClA pass information through
our distribution network a couple of times.

212
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
- That's it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,040
- Because it is none of your concern!
- l think it concerns me now!

214
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,400
l think a nuclear bomb pretty much
concerns everyone! Don't you?

215
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
You know what l'm thinking, Bob?

216
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
l'm thinking that all your generosity

217
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
and acceptance is just a load of crap.

218
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,400
Reza, you better sit down and shut up

219
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,960
before you say something you will
regret for the rest of your life.

220
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
You lied to me.

221
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
l can track the shipping order!

222
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Bob's code signature will show that
he authorised the transaction order!

223
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,800
- Get off of me.
- No, just stop it.

224
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,200
The database is at the office.
l'll take you there.

225
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Step outside.

226
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,920
- l'm not taking the fall for you, Bob.
- Come on. Take it easy.

227
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
All right, all right.

228
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,480
- Hey, where's George?
- With Naiyeer. He broke.

229
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Could you tell him the search and rescue
is about 12 minutes from the crash site?

230
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,920
OK.

231
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
- Tony.
- Yeah?

232
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,560
- What's going on with George?
- As far as what?

233
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,760
He's sick, isn't he?

234
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,760
He's got some kind of
radiation poisoning, doesn't he?

235
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Where'd you get that?

236
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Hazmat's all over the warehouse he
raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot.

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,360
His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me
he was throwing up in the bathroom.

238
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
And it doesn't take a doctor to figure it out.

239
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,800
Besides, l can read your face
pretty well by now.

240
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,160
Look, he doesn't want
anybody else to know, OK?

241
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,000
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

242
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Can he run things in his condition.

243
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,120
- Yeah, l think so.
- That's not good enough.

244
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
lf he's compromised mentally
or physically, we can't...

245
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
He can do his job, Michelle.

246
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,280
He wants to do his job like l've never seen.
He's determined to stop this bomb.

247
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,600
So am l, which is why l think
he should step down.

248
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,200
l'll keep an eye on him. And the second he
misses a step, l'll make sure he backs off.

249
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,320
- No, you can't baby-sit him.
- l'm not baby-sitting him, Michelle.

250
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
Now, you gotta trust me on this.

251
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Can l see that information
as soon as you get it?

252
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,680
l made some notes on David's speech.

253
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
l thought maybe you might
want to incorporate them.

254
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
l haven't even shown that
to the president yet.

255
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,800
- Jenny showed me a draft.
- She shouldn't have.

256
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,680
She's known me for a long time, Lynne.
She knows what l have to offer.

257
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Mrs Palmer, the president believes

258
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,240
that you can be an asset to him
during this time of crisis.

259
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,800
That's why you're here. He did not give you
licence to insinuate yourself into...

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,840
Wait, wait, wait.
Put your back down, Lynne.

261
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
l am not here to trespass on your territory.
l am here to help.

262
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,600
That's why l'm coming to you first
before l go directly to David.

263
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me.

264
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,480
Unless David's speech is pitch-perfect,
which it is not,

265
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,000
Wieland's allegations might
bring down this presidency.

266
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,320
l don't need you to tell me
how important this is.

267
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,440
Then you owe it to David
to look at my revisions.

268
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Give me your hand.

269
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Come on.

270
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
(man) We got a survivor here.

271
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,920
This doesn't look like search and rescue.

272
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,280
(gunshot)

273
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,520
- Who are they? Are they coming for you?
- l don't know!

274
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,400
(screaming)

275
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,760
Don't even think about it! Keep going!

276
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,760
Go, go!

277
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,000
Keep going! Keep going!

278
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Take cover in the creek bed.

279
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,480
There's too many of them for me to handle.
l need your help. Give me your hands.

280
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,160
l need you to run recon for me
and handle the ammunition.

281
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
You screw with me now, and we both die.
Do you understand?

282
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,080
Jack, we need to get to higher ground
so l can spot for you.

283
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,600
Take the ammunition. Go. Go!

284
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
(male Arabic voice over telephone)

285
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,640
(speaks Arabic)

286
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
(clicks)

287
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,120
Would you like some water, Kate?
Maybe some tea?

288
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,320
- How do you know my name?
- l know more than that.

289
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
l know you are 29 years old, unmarried.

290
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,800
l know you have an economics degree
from Stanford.

291
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Who are you?

292
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,560
My name is Syed Ali.

293
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
You know who l am?

294
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,800
l've heard your name mentioned.

295
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,160
What else have you heard about me?

296
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Nothing.

297
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Kate, what have you found
in your father's files?

298
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,520
You were looking in places you do not
belong. You must have seen some things.

299
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,200
l don't know what you're talking about.

300
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Really?

301
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,360
Let go of me! Let go of me!

302
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,320
l told you, l don't know what you are
talking about. You got the wrong guy.

303
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
Paul? Oh, my God. What are you doing?

304
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,480
He tells us your father works for the ClA.
This is not new information.

305
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Tell us what you saw and who you told.

306
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,640
We didn't tell anyone
because we didn't see anything!

307
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,920
He's telling you the truth!
Please don't do this!

308
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
Listen to me. Nothing can get
in the way of this sacred day.

309
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,680
- Tell us what you saw and who you told.
- We didn't see anything, l swear!

310
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,160
- The files deleted themselves...
- Don't lie to me, Kate!

311
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,120
- l'm not lying!
- She's not lying!

312
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
They were self-deleting files!
We don't know anything!

313
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,040
- What are you...
- No! Stop it!

314
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,280
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

315
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Jack, l can spot you from here.

316
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,720
l'm set. Where are they?

317
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,080
11 o'clock, 90 metres, moving left.

318
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
- l'm out!
- Last pack, Jack.

319
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,360
- Where are they?
- Ten o'clock, within 50 metres.

320
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
That's it!

321
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,120
- Where are they now?
- Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground.

322
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,960
(helicopter overhead)

323
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
lt's a CTU chopper!
They're gonna make a sweep! Stay down!

324
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
Stay down!

325
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
(gun cocks)

326
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,120
Drop it, Jack. l said drop it!

327
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,840
l don't wanna shoot you just yet,
but l will if l have to!

328
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Drop the gun! Drop it! lt's over!

329
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
Stand down! Stand down or he's dead!

330
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,840
Stand down! She's the only one
who can get us to the bomb!

331
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,000

332
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,520
Now!

333
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,840
Megan.

334
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
Megan!

335
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
- Come here.
- Kim!

336
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

337
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,160
- l'm scared.
- l know.

338
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,880
- lt's scary, but you're doing so good.
- Let's go.

339
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,920
Wait. Where are you taking her?

340
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,120
Do you know where you're going, baby?

341
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,800
Aunt Emily. She's my mom's sister.

342
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Do you know where she lives?

343
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,200
- Santa Barbara.
- Santa Barbara?

344
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,560
Santa Barbara. That's so good.

345
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,800
- Why can't you come with me?
- Oh...

346
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,080
Oh, l will soon, OK?

347
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,560
- l don't wanna go.
- l know.

348
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,680
OK, let's go. Your aunt's waiting.

349
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Go on, OK? You can go now.

350
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,440
Go on. Go on. Don't cry.

351
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,400
No, no, shh. l'm gonna see you soon, OK?

352
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Santa Barbara, that's like, what,
50 miles outside of LA?

353
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
- lt's more like a hundred.
- Oh, God.

354
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,880
She's gonna be OK.

355
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,040
- Mr Mason, Tony.
- Yeah.

356
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,400
Jack's alive. Seven hostiles were killed,
but there's a complication.

357
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,000
- What?
- Nina Myers took Jack hostage.

358
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,520
She's demanding to speak to the president.

359
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Have Richards and Maccabee
take him to Bob Warner's office.

360
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,160
- Let me talk to her.
- She'll be here when you get back.

361
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,400
We were supposed to get married in an hour.
Just let me explain everything to her.

362
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,800
You have one minute.
Watch him. l'm gonna make a call.

363
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
- What did they do to you?
- They just asked me questions.

364
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,840
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

365
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,320
Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer.
He's one of the top guys in the city.

366
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,440
l'm not gonna need a lawyer.
But your father might.

367
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,760
l don't understand.

368
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,120
Reza, what's going on?

369
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,520
lt's your father, Marie.

370
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,000
They think that he might have
something to do with Syed Ali.

371
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,320
My father?

372
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,240
- Yeah, he tried to use me.
- Used you how?

373
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,240
To do business with Ali,
who they say is part of this terrorist group.

374
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,640
- My father? Part of a terrorist group?
- They have proof.

375
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,520
They have this transaction
that's connecting one of us to Ali.

376
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
And l know l didn't write it.

377
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,680
l'm sorry to put you in
this impossible situation.

378
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,200
l love you, and l wanna be with you.

379
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,360
But right now, something really bad
might happen if l don't help them.

380
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,560
After everything he's done for you,
to turn on my father...

381
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,680
He turned on me. He turned on us.

382
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,520
What else was l supposed to do?

383
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
Marie...

384
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
- Come on, let's go.
- Marie.

385
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,280
We have a secured line ready.

386
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,400
- (rings)
- That's Nina Myers.

387
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,240
Mike, you should talk to her first.

388
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,640
l don't want to give her access to me
until she gives us something in return.

389
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,840
Miss Myers... this is Mike Novick.
l'm the president's Chief of Staff.

390
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,160
- l asked to speak with the president.
- He's not available.

391
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,920
Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not?

392
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,720
- Of course we do.
- Then put the president on.

393
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,640
l'm authorised to negotiate on his behalf.

394
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
What l want is nonnegotiable.

395
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,640
What do you want?

396
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,880
l'll tell you where the bomb is
in exchange for immunity.

397
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,560
The president's already
granted you a total pardon.

398
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Except this is a crime l haven't committed yet.

399
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,240
(Mike) What crime?

400
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,600
The murder of Jack Bauer.

401
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,360
Add that to my pardon,
and l'll tell you where the bomb is.

402
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
And if we don't comply?

403
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
We don't have a choice.

404
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,640
- ls that you, Mr Bauer?
- Yes.

405
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,400
Please tell the president that he has
no other choice but to accept her deal.

406
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,360
- ls CTU on a secured line?
- Yes. This is George Mason.

407
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,400
We're on a designated channel.
Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.

408
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,400
Do you have alternatives
to what she's asking?

409
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,880
Any weaknesses that we can exploit?

410
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,840
None. She's a survivor, sir.
She knows Bauer.

411
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,280
She knows if she doesn't kill him now,
he'll hunt her down and find her later.

412
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,240
So, in your assessment, Nina Myers
is our best chance to stop this bomb?

413
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,200
Sir, she may be our only chance.

414
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,520
- Ms Myers, this is President Palmer.
- l'm listening.

415
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,760
- ls Jack Bauer there?
- Yes, Mr President. l'm here too.

416
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Ms Myers... if the information you provide

417
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,040
culminates in the successful interception
of the nuclear device,

418
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,240
you will get everything you asked for.

419
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,360
You will be pardoned in advance
for the murder of Jack Bauer.

420
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
l can live with that.

421
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Start talking, Nina.

422
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,680
The bomb will be detonated
by a man named Syed Ali.

423
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,320
We know about Ali.
We need to know where he is.

424
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,560
He's at a house in Chatsworth,
on Starling Court.

425
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,960
18 Starling Court.

426
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,360
Contact the local law enforcement
to set up a perimeter.

427
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Coordinate among the relevant agencies.

428
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,960
Ms Myers, you're not to take any action
until we put our hands on this bomb.

429
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Agreed.

430
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,440
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

431
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,160
ls there anything you want me to do?

432
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,800
Please make sure that
my daughter is safe, sir.

433
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,280
- Tell her that l love her.
- l'll do that.

434
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,720
Thank you, Mr President.

435
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,680
- Jack?
- Mr President...

436
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,960
Please, you don't need to say anything, sir.

437
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,520
There was only one right choice to make,
and you made it.

438
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,920
- l'm sorry, Jack.
- (hangs up)

439
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,920
He's right, Mr President.

440
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,720
lt's the only way we're going to
find this nuclear device...

441
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
before it's too late.

442
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Sir...

443
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,200
The press corps is waiting.

444
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,160
- You've made some changes.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,880
- lt's better.
- Thank you, sir.

446
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,800
For God's sake, stop it!

447
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,280
What do you want?
l don't know what you want!

448
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,280
Yes, you do.

449
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
We didn't see anything.
We didn't tell anyone anything!

450
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,720
l swear! l don't know anything!
How can l tell you what l don't know?

451
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
l believe you.

452
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,400
lf she knew anything,
she would have told us. Kill her.

453
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
(all chattering)

454
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,840
lt won't take them long to find Ali.

455
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,320
This isn't how you thought
it would end, is it, Jack?

456
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,560
This isn't over yet.
