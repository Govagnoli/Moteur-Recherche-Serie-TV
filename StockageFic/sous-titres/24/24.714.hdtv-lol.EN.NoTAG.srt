3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,222
We need to pick him off
to save the president.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,910
I'll make a run for the lockdown room.
There are five canisters of CH-4.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:23,064
- All we need is one stray bullet.
- A suicide play, Jack.

6
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,425
We don't have a choice.

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,675
Don't you move!

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,909
We have the president!
The president is secure!

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,619
I'm so sorry, Jack.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,288
- I know that he was your friend.
- It was supposed to be me.

11
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,707
Juma and his men
were not working alone.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,294
The only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
He knew about the attack,

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,963
and chances are, he's gonna know
who Juma was talking to.

14
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:52,492
I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on
as a special advisor.

15
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,072
Nobody's forgotten
what she did during the campaign.

16
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:59,684
Leaking damaging personal information
about your opponent to the press.

17
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:00,851
She's changed.

18
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,937
It's not the past that concerns me.

19
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,972
Do you think this would've happened
if my mother had a chief advisor

20
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:08,192
who knew what was going on
in her administration?

21
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,653
I just got off the phone
with Ethan Kanin.

22
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:13,698
He's ordering me
to let Bauer interrogate Burnett.

23
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,553
I didn't want to go behind your back,
but you didn't leave me any choice.

24
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:20,871
I want you to clean out your office and
hand in your badge. I'm suspending you.

25
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:24,458
Jack Bauer's on his way
to Kennedy Memorial Hospital.

26
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,206
Burnett will tell him everything.

27
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,463
I have already sent somebody
to the hospital to deal with Burnett.

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,465
He can take care of Bauer
at the same time.

29
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,823
- You lay one finger on him, it's over.
- All right.

30
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,972
Juma's attack failed.

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,515
He's dead, so are his men.

32
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,351
<i>Get me the hell out of here!</i>

33
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,978
You're not going anywhere.

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,105
What happened? What's going on?

35
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,241
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

36
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:02,090
I want a high-priority APB
issued for Jack Bauer.

37
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:05,082
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.
I'm being set up.

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,012
Don't let them get away with this.
This threat is not over.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,681
I dropped my wife off here
five hours ago,

40
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:15,945
and now no one can tell me
where she is.

41
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,198
The White House has been attacked. We're
in the midst of an urgent protocol.

42
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,704
Exactly. That's why I'd like to know
if my wife is all right.

43
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,080
- She is. She's fine.
- Where is she?

44
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,735
- Tell me.
- In a holding room on the third floor.

45
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,501
- What?
- She's been arrested.

46
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,338
That's absurd. What's she charged with?
I want to see her.

47
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,245
I've told you
more than I should have.

48
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,300
Agent Moss'll tell you
all you need to know.

49
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:41,834
In the meanwhile, I have to ask you
to wait in the conference room, okay?

50
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,140
Please. I'm sorry. Please escort him
to the conference room. Thank you.

51
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,478
Larry's calling for you.
He says it's urgent.

52
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,752
- What line?
- Three.

53
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,315
Sign here, verifying you understand

54
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,936
the terms of your suspension,

55
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,527
and again here...

56
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,363
- Agent Walker?
- Go ahead, I'm listening.

57
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,200
- Larry, it's Janis.
- Ryan Burnett is dead.

58
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:04,869
How?

59
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,955
Bauer was interrogating him
when it happened, and we're responsible.

60
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:11,139
- You say that Bauer killed Burnett?
- I don't know.

61
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,252
He escaped before I could get to him.
He called me,

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,154
said he was being set up
and he wouldn't come in.

63
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,868
I lost him, Janis.

64
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:24,096
- I lost him and it's on me to find him.
- Just tell me what you need.

65
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,309
I already sent out a all-agency APB.
I need you to follow up on that.

66
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,576
I'm coming back
to the office right now.

67
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,272
I'll coordinate the search operation
from there.

68
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,234
Open an all-agency channel

69
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,334
with flags for immediate action
on Jack Bauer.

70
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,490
I'll make sure the police departments
are linked in.

71
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,790
- On it.
- Thank you.

72
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,367
Janis, what did Larry say?
Jack get anything out of Burnett?

73
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,745
You're suspended.
I cannot discuss this with you.

74
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,123
Janis, this was my case. Tell me
if Jack got anything out of Burnett.

75
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,417
Burnett is dead.

76
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,116
Well, tell me what happened.

77
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,172
Bauer was there,
and now he's missing.

78
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,673
- Janis, the channel's open.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,302
That's all I know, honestly.

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,914
So, please,
let me get back to work, okay?

81
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,877
Please attach Jack Bauer's profile
to the APB.

82
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:28,653
Got you.

83
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,223
<i>Renee, it's Jack.
Don't hang up the phone, please.</i>

84
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,433
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

85
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,846
Bill was right.

86
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:59,975
There are still powerful people involved
that were not named in Dubaku's drive.

87
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,876
They're trying to cover their tracks.
They killed Burnett, and they framed me.

88
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,722
Even if I wanted to help you,

89
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:08,376
Larry has every law enforcement agency
looking for you,

90
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,078
- and I have been suspended.
- All I want you to do is make an I.D.

91
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,051
I got a frame grab
from the surveillance.

92
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,133
I sent you a photo
of the man who killed Burnett.

93
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,690
It's in your inbox.

94
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,078
This man i's the only connection I have
to whoever else is involved.

95
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,905
Please, I need your help.

96
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,426
Look, I know you don't agree
with some of the things I did today,

97
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:33,942
but I'm telling you the truth.

98
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,293
You know what?

99
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,967
Forget it. I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

100
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:45,029
I'll call you back at this number.

101
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,787
<i>Metro police,
this is the FBI reporting.</i>

102
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,413
<i>We have a suspect, Jack Bauer,
that's escaped custody.</i>

103
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,083
<i>All available units, please respond.</i>

104
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,218
Yes, Quinn.

105
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,095
Bauer got away from the FBI.

106
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:11,642
How?

107
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,640
<i>Bauer is
an extremely impressive operative.</i>

108
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,392
You don't have to tell me that.

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,270
But the FBI has launched
a major effort to apprehend him.

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,461
<i>He won't be able
to avoid them for long.</i>

111
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:21,732
We'll see, won't we?

112
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,193
Monitor the situation,
keep me apprised.

113
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,361
Yes, sir.

114
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,860
If Bauer connects us to Juma, it could
seriously impede this operation.

115
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:33,483
Yes, it could.

116
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:36,955
Is the shipment on time?

117
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,541
Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

118
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,773
Then I don't foresee a problem.

119
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:43,495
Once the weapons are deployed,

120
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,911
then it doesn't matter
what Mr. Bauer or anyone else knows.

121
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:49,927
Something wrong?

122
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:52,513
No, sir.

123
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,246
Mr. Seaton,

124
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:56,562
I get no pleasure

125
00:07:57,086 --> 00:08:00,634
from the knowledge
that people will die at our hands.

126
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:05,359
One single soul,
the loss of one soul is tragic to me,

127
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,408
let alone the numbers
we're talking about.

128
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,534
But do not forget
that every war worth fighting

129
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,032
involves collateral damage.

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,582
And what we're doing

131
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,245
is fundamentally
and absolutely necessary.

132
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,247
And I know you understand that.

133
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,206
Of course.

134
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,511
Wake up our colleagues
and have them assembled in one hour.

135
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,384
And tell them to pack
their pajamas and their toothbrushes.

136
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,093
It's gonna be a long night.

137
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:52,865
- I have an I.D.
- Who is it?

138
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,032
John Quinn.

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,492
Black Ops combat vet.

140
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,829
Served tours all over the world.
Now he works for Starkwood.

141
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,650
- The defense consultant?
- yeah, they started out as consultants,

142
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,104
but over the past few years,
while you were out of the country,

143
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,137
the Pentagon outsourced billions
of dollars in contracts to them.

144
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:09,251
- What kind of contracts?
- Manpower.

145
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,183
Starkwood's basically
a private army.

146
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:14,067
They recruit ex-soldiers and SWAT team
members from around the world,

147
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,418
then they hire them back
to the military security teams.

148
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,283
We're talking thousands of men
deployed here and abroad.

149
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,811
- Starkwood work with Juma?
- If they did, it wasn't on the books.

150
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,856
But, you know, if anyone knows,
it's Senator Mayer.

151
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,627
- Why Mayer?
- After he dismantled CTU,

152
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,696
he launched several investigations.
One of them is looking at Starkwood.

153
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,616
- What were they accused of?
<i>- The hearings are classified, but</i>

154
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,577
supposedly, Mayer has enough
to put them out of business.

155
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,136
Okay, I'm gonna need to talk to him.
See if you can access the CIRG logs.

156
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:44,402
- They should have a location on him.
- Okay.

157
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:47,318
- I'll send you Mayer's location ASAP.
- Thanks.

158
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,359
- Agent Walker's still here?
- She was just in her office.

159
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:56,628
But there's somebody waiting to see you
in the conference room. They need to...

160
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,539
Just have a few more forms to fill out,
then I'm taking off.

161
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,375
You hear what happened?

162
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,546
After everything that Jack's done today,
you really believe e murdered Burnett?

163
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,232
I don't know.

164
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:37,594
I don't care. He's a federal fugitive
and needs to be found.

165
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,139
But you think it's possible
that he did this?

166
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:43,638
'cause I'm not sure that I do.

167
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,355
It's been a long day.

168
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,440
Go home, get some sleep.

169
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,583
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

170
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:05,691
Excuse me, Larry.

171
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:07,916
Morris O'Brian is waiting
in the conference room.

172
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,459
He wants to know
why his wife is in holding.

173
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,130
Renee talked to Bauer.

174
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,649
How do you know?

175
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,429
Access her phone log
for the last 15 minutes

176
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,086
and get into her workstation,
find out what she's been doing.

177
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:24,266
All right.

178
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,134
If we want to catch Bauer,
she's our best shot.

179
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,187
<i>We've received confirmation
that President Taylor</i>

180
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:40,552
<i>will be making a statement
to the country shortly.</i>

181
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:42,902
<i>She is expected to address
the attack on the White House</i>

182
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,506
<i>that ended an hour ago
in a startling rescue.</i>

183
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:47,331
<i>Based on the few details we have,</i>

184
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,858
<i>we do know the rescue resulted</i>

185
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,376
<i>in the death of General Juma
and all of his forces.</i>

186
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,603
Angela, how much lead time
does the media need,

187
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,790
once I'm finished with my revisions?

188
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:00,093
The major outlets
will put us on immediately.

189
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,721
I'll be done shortly.
Thank you, Angela.

190
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,146
I have a thought about the speech,
if you'd like to hear it.

191
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,271
Of course.

192
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,899
Right now your main thrust
is reassurance.

193
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:17,313
The attacks are behind us,
everything's going to be back to normal.

194
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,301
But I think you're missing
an opportunity here.

195
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,490
To do what?

196
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:22,929
Claim victory.

197
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,949
To say that Juma's death
means standing up to tyranny works,

198
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:29,178
and that your decision to send troops
into Sangala was the right one.

199
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,095
I'm not sure that this is

200
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,627
the appropriate time
to sound triumphant, Livy.

201
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:36,233
A lot of lives were lost today.

202
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,419
And by addressing those deaths,
you give them meaning.

203
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:42,552
Those people are heroes who died
in a war that was worth fighting.

204
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,765
Let's work it in.

205
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,022
Come in.

206
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,216
Madam President,
I have some troubling news.

207
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,155
May I speak with you alone?

208
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,282
You may speak freely
in front of Olivia.

209
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,806
Just after the attack
on the White House,

210
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:14,480
Jack Bauer came forward
with a disturbing claim.

211
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:15,609
He said

212
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:19,047
there were people still at large
who were involved in the conspiracy,

213
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,669
persons unknown

214
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:23,776
who had helped Juma
plan and execute the attacks.

215
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,887
Did Bauer have any evidence of this?

216
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,472
Nothing concrete.

217
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,944
But he promoted the notion
that Ryan Burnett

218
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,706
was our best chance
of identifying these people,

219
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,439
and Bauer asked to be allowed
to question him.

220
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:39,526
This was supposed to be
a controlled situation.

221
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,947
A ploy to intimidate Burnett
into giving up intel.

222
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,342
So,

223
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:48,660
I granted Bauer's request.

224
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,080
It was a terrible mistake.

225
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,416
What happened, Ethan?

226
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,126
Burnett is dead.

227
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,878
My God...

228
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:01,298
The evidence suggests
that he was killed by Bauer.

229
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,675
I don't believe it!

230
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,190
His claim of another party
being involved in the attacks

231
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,805
appear to have been a fabrication.

232
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,276
A fabrication.

233
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:14,102
It may have something to do with
Bill Buchanan's death, no one knows.

234
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,698
But Madam President,
I take full responsibility.

235
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,368
I was trying to insulate you.

236
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:23,028
To provide you with deniability
in case anything went wrong.

237
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,864
Or was it because you thought
the president would say no?

238
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:32,496
Where is Bauer now?

239
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,821
At large.

240
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:37,042
The FBI is devoting its full resources
to the manhunt.

241
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:40,003
Let me know
the minute they find him.

242
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:41,426
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:49,829
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:02,883
Looks like everything.

245
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,204
She's on the move.

246
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,005
Where's Bauer?

247
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:26,299
- I don't know.
- Don't you lie to me.

248
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:29,511
We traced two calls from your cell
to a phone that was reported stolen.

249
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,472
And we know you accessed
a classified government database

250
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,141
and sent someone's
name and address to Bauer.

251
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,353
That makes you an accessory
after the fact.

252
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,372
Now tell me where he is.

253
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,148
I can't.

254
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,563
- Damn it!
- I still don't believe he did this.

255
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:47,862
Then explain to me
why he's not turning himself in,

256
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,115
letting us help him find
this mysterious third party.

257
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,264
Because he was framed and he doesn't
trust our ability to work through it.

258
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,704
And after what we've put him through,
how can you blame him?

259
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,667
You're actually willing to sacrifice
everything to protect him.

260
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,714
Once Jack finds the evidence,
he will call us.

261
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,319
You know,
Janis is decrypting what you sent.

262
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:12,679
It's not going to take her a long time.
We are going to find him.

263
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,390
Renee, tell me
whose information you sent.

264
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,699
I'll let the AG know
that you're cooperating.

265
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,153
I'm sorry, Larry.

266
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,780
Put her in holding.
Mirandize her.

267
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:50,386
- Good night, Senator.
- I see you in the morning.

268
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,777
Keep your hands
where I can see them, Senator.

269
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,659
Take a seat.

270
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:01,454
I know what you did to Ryan Burnett.

271
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,207
I'm not going to let you butcher me
like you did him.

272
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:06,168
You want me dead, Bauer,

273
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,587
- you'll have to kill me where I stand.
- If I wanted to kill you, Senator,

274
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,090
you'd be dead already.
Now take a seat!

275
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,894
You're a real enigma, Bauer.

276
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,981
An hour after you save
the president from terrorists,

277
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,483
you murder a federal witness
in cold blood.

278
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,482
I didn't kill Burnett.

279
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,196
This man did.
Do you know who he is?

280
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:39,451
His name is John Quinn.
He works for Starkwood.

281
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:42,287
What does Starkwood
have to do with this?

282
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,748
I don't know yet.

283
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,332
I know they sent someone to kill
Burnett and frame me to cover up

284
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,961
their involvement in what's happened,
including the attack on the White House.

285
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,048
That's a hell of a theory, Bauer.

286
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:58,219
But you'll have to spin a better story
if you want it to get you off the hook.

287
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,138
I did not come here
to clear my name.

288
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:04,142
I'm trying to understand the connection
between Juma and Starkwood.

289
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:06,476
There isn't one.

290
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:11,560
I've spent the better part of six months
investigating Starkwood.

291
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,861
If there was a connection
to Juma or Sangala, I would know it.

292
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,198
I want to see every file you have
concerning that investigation.

293
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,570
Look...

294
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:26,425
Starkwood has let their security teams
run amok all over the world,

295
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,887
with no oversight.

296
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,754
They've bribed their way
into large contracts,

297
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,469
they've tried to influence
foreign policy to their own benefit,

298
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:34,940
all good reasons

299
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,008
why this country should not be

300
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,815
outsourcing its military operations
to private corporations.

301
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,520
And I am going to shut them down.

302
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,686
But there is nothing
to remotely suggest

303
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,254
they'd be involved in terrorist attacks
on their own country

304
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,059
for any amount of money.

305
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:56,528
Maybe they have different reasons
for helping Juma.

306
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:59,362
- Like what?
- I don't know.

307
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,794
I believe this country
is still under attack,

308
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,409
and there has to be a reason.

309
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,247
And I'm supposed to believe this, coming
from a man who's holding me hostage?

310
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,167
I need access to those files.

311
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,838
And if the connection

312
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,882
between Juma and Starkwood
isn't there,

313
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,654
will you turn yourself in, then?

314
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:26,176
Just open the files, sir.

315
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:44,144
Ladies and gentlemen,

316
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:47,453
the president will be making
a brief statement tonight.

317
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,879
Good luck, Mom.

318
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,097
I'm sure you'll understand,
based on the events of today,

319
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:55,125
there will be no opportunity
for follow-up questions.

320
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:00,313
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

321
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,251
Thank you very much.

322
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:14,376
Thank you.

323
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:25,325
My fellow Americans, John Adams,

324
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:28,661
the first president to take up
residence in the White House,

325
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:32,874
once prayed for Heaven
to bestow its blessings on this place.

326
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,281
Tonight,

327
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,821
those blessings have seen us
through a brutal attack

328
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:39,546
by a desperate tyrant.

329
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,733
We have lost
friends and loved ones here,

330
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:45,722
but we have prevailed.

331
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,211
I have commanded
law enforcement agencies,

332
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,364
emergency services
and first responders

333
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:52,852
- to keep their deployment...
- Mr. Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.

334
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,836
I'm wondering if you can confirm some
information I received a short time ago?

335
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:58,904
Ken, this is clearly not the time...

336
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,675
I'm going to be reporting
in this evening's broadcast

337
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,863
that a rogue ex-federal agent
named Jack Bauer

338
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,602
is the prime suspect
in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

339
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,290
... cannot forget today's events.

340
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,956
The lives we lost...

341
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,731
Where did you get this?

342
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:16,584
- So, it's true, then?
- I'm not confirming anything.

343
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:20,088
I'll also report that you authorized
Bauer's release from custody

344
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,906
and arranged
for his access to the victim.

345
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,614
... daughters and sons,

346
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:27,514
brothers and sisters,

347
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,889
but they have not taken our spirit.

348
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,732
Make no mistake,

349
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,443
today's attacks were intended
to crush our resolve.

350
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,869
- Mr. Kanin.
- I said no comment.

351
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:40,775
But America is not so easily broken.

352
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,588
Our military action in Sangala has been
a success.

353
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,302
At this hour,

354
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,575
our forces have taken
control of Sangala City.

355
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:51,584
We have won.

356
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,331
- I see you're back to your old tactics.
- What?

357
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,339
You leaked the story of Burnett's murder
and my involvement to the press.

358
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,643
Ethan, I don't know
what you're talking about.

359
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,089
<i>... all our men and women,</i>

360
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,961
<i>and to the families of those
who have made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

361
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:11,511
Don't bother denying it.
I can count on one hand

362
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:14,600
the number of people who knew
I'd authorized Bauer's release.

363
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:17,551
So another one
of your errors in judgment

364
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:18,938
bites you on the ass.

365
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,310
And you think
you can lay the blame on me.

366
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,152
Do you realize what you've done?

367
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,462
In trying to hurt me,

368
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:29,782
you'll have caused
tremendous damage to your mother.

369
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,392
The president has gone on record

370
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:35,717
that torture is unacceptable
under any circumstances.

371
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:37,860
When this gets out,

372
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:40,502
it will look like Bauer was sent
exactly for that.

373
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,838
It'll be a political disaster.
You've gone too far this time.

374
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm not listening to you anymore.

375
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,302
- You will not get away with this.
- Get your hands off me.

376
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:52,512
As Americans,

377
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:56,059
we should stand together
proud of what we have achieved.

378
00:23:57,327 --> 00:24:00,975
Thanks to the efforts
and the sacrifices of so many,

379
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:02,854
this place,

380
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:04,795
our national home,

381
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,088
stands tall tonight.

382
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:11,508
And all our citizens can sleep soundly
with the knowledge

383
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,926
that the blessings of freedom
continue to shine upon us all.

384
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,764
No, there's been no sign of Bauer
in the Northeast sector,

385
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:22,539
so expand your cordon
to the 25-mile mark.

386
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,378
And be prepared to back up Metro.

387
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:27,465
I'm directing them
to begin random traffic stops, citywide.

388
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:29,495
Thank you.

389
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:32,556
I isolated the data
Renee uploaded to Bauer,

390
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,515
- but I can't get past the file header.
- What does that mean?

391
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,664
She encrypted the name and address
she used,

392
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:39,932
- and I can't seem to crack it.
- You can't?

393
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:43,307
She used her personal computer.
This is very serious encryption.

394
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,730
There are some high-level people
who can do it.

395
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,323
- Like who?
- Chloe O'Brian,

396
00:24:47,448 --> 00:24:50,474
but from what you've told me,
she's too loyal to Bauer.

397
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:54,649
- Is her husband still here?
- Yeah, he's waiting to see you.

398
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:58,162
According to her file,
he's a level-six analyst, too.

399
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,384
I have no idea
how much longer I'm going to be here.

400
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:02,909
Just do me a favor

401
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,711
and give Prescott his babu
before you put him down.

402
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,889
Yeah,
I'm going to have to call you back.

403
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:13,636
- Mr. O'Brian, I'm Larry Moss.
- Yeah, I'd like to see my wife.

404
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,295
All right.

405
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:25,939
What the bloody hell
are you holding her for?

406
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,164
Obstruction, evidence tampering.

407
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,591
I think you should be more concerned
about what you can do to get her out.

408
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,446
Sorry?

409
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,365
Help us find Jack Bauer.

410
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,912
Last I heard from Chloe,
Jack was working for the Bureau.

411
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,080
That's you, if I'm not mistaken.

412
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,205
He was.

413
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,499
Until he snapped and murdered
a federal witness.

414
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:46,404
Really?
I find that hard to believe.

415
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:49,063
All that's relevant here is
that your wife is going to be prosecuted

416
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:51,940
for colluding with Bauer,
unless you help us find him.

417
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:57,403
A short time ago, one of our agents
was in touch with Jack Bauer.

418
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:00,921
She sent a name and address
that we assume is his next destination.

419
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,686
Unfortunately,
it's encrypted with Blowfish 148.

420
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,776
No one here knows how to crack that.

421
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,851
Therefore, we need your help.

422
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:09,552
Please.

423
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:11,924
You have to understand something:

424
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,198
Jack Bauer and my wife have
a very long history.

425
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:19,075
- I consider him to be a friend.
- And he'll have his day in court.

426
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
But the case against your wife is
rock solid.

427
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,498
I can't.

428
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,107
We're talking about her serving
a minimum sentence of 15 years.

429
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:31,382
Your son will 19
by the time she gets out of prison.

430
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:47,092
I want guarantees of full immunity,

431
00:26:47,217 --> 00:26:50,191
no jail time, expulsion of all charges
from her record.

432
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:51,607
You have my word.

433
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:53,486
You are a witness to this agreement.

434
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:56,186
Show me the file.

435
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,839
Original information...
16- or 32-bit word length?

436
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:00,826
32.

437
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:05,642
- Native or modified data points?
- Native.

438
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:10,881
The designer of this algorithm

439
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,844
built a backdoor into his code.

440
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:15,292
Decryption's a piece of cake
if you know the override codes.

441
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,202
- And you do?
- Yeah.

442
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,012
Will this take long?

443
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:22,343
Course not.

444
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,397
Can you tell me specifically
when you'll have the file decrypted?

445
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:30,686
Yes.

446
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,486
Now.

447
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,658
Your agent sent Jack
to 951 Deerbrook Avenue, Georgetown,

448
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:42,868
residence of Senator Blaine Mayer.

449
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,935
Assemble the field teams. Tell them
we have a probable location on Bauer.

450
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,960
And get Metro PD on the way.

451
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,862
No luck reaching Mayer
on his cell or at the house.

452
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,340
The phone company said
the line was shorted out on-site.

453
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,282
- That's Bauer.
- Why is he doing this?

454
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:14,148
Because Mayer spent
the last 6 months

455
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:17,081
trying to send Bauer to prison
for the rest of his life.

456
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:18,206
All right,

457
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,546
Metro PD is closing in
on Mayer's residence.

458
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,423
I've authorized them to move in when
they're in position and at strength.

459
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:28,315
I told them, and I'm telling you,
it is impossible to overestimate Bauer.

460
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:31,500
He has more training and experience
than anybody in this room,

461
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,996
and that includes myself.

462
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:34,471
Okay, let's move.

463
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:38,605
Agent Moss will be running
on-point tactical with FBI teams on 5.

464
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,556
All units must register and log
their com through me,

465
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:45,031
and I will distribute
recognition codes and credentials.

466
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:52,520
I can't believe you.
You're helping them catch Jack.

467
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:53,647
I did it for you.

468
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,235
This is the last thing
I would have wanted. How could you?

469
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,336
Let's see, for a start,
I thought it might be nice

470
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:02,229
to spare Prescott the inconvenience
of having a convict for a mother.

471
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:05,201
- Jack saved your life.
- I don't deny that I owe him.

472
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,945
But my child

473
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,347
and my marriage comes first,

474
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:11,322
and it should for you, too.

475
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,835
Chloe, love,
you've helped Jack enough.

476
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,003
You have.

477
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,704
And you can't go deciding
to make this...

478
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:21,292
sacrifice

479
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:23,346
on your own anymore.

480
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,096
But he didn't do what they say.

481
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,890
Then he can prove that
when they take him into custody.

482
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:30,612
If they give him the chance.

483
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,079
At the hearing this morning,
you said you had no regrets

484
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,756
about what you've done.

485
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:53,791
But what I saw

486
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,668
was a man full of regret.

487
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:58,143
Of course I have regrets, Senator.

488
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:04,009
I regret losing my family.

489
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:07,605
My wife was murdered
because I was responsible

490
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,002
for protecting David Palmer
during an assassination attempt.

491
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:14,228
My daughter can't even look at me.

492
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:19,191
Every day, I regret looking into
the eyes of men, women and children,

493
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,149
knowing that, any moment,

494
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,738
their lives might be deemed expendable
to protect the greater good.

495
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:29,577
I regret every decision
or mistake I might have made

496
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:32,976
that resulted in the loss
of a single innocent life.

497
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:36,584
But you know what I regret the most?

498
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,250
Is that this world
even needs people like me.

499
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:44,002
So you think I'm naive to believe

500
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,510
we need to hold ourselves
to a higher standard of combat?

501
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:50,877
Doesn't even matter what I think.
You need to understand where I work,

502
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,934
things get a lot messier
than where you work on the Hill.

503
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:59,315
What you've lost, Mr. Bauer,
is tragic.

504
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:01,726
What you've been compelled to do

505
00:31:02,316 --> 00:31:04,946
in the name
of saving innocent life is tragic.

506
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:09,945
Sometimes we need to incur
the most horrible losses

507
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,878
in order to uphold the ideals
that this country was founded on.

508
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:17,014
How can we presume to lead the world

509
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,251
unless we set an example?

510
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:23,797
You make it sound so simple.

511
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:27,718
Well, maybe it's simpler than you think.
Maybe all the things that you've seen

512
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:31,528
and all the things that you've done
have clouded your vision.

513
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,561
Look at this.

514
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,148
Tell me about this car accident.

515
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:44,735
- That has nothing to do with Juma.
- Who was the victim?

516
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,064
A source inside of Starkwood.
A whistle-blower.

517
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,906
Unfortunately, he was also a drunk.

518
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,451
He was killed when he wrecked his car
on the way home from Atlantic City.

519
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:54,870
Blood alcohol off the charts.

520
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,669
Senator, this was no accident.

521
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,381
He was murdered by the same man
who took Ryan Burnett out this evening.

522
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:08,376
- What does this mean?
- They were scared of him.

523
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,125
What did he have on Starkwood?

524
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,389
He made a lot of wild accusations,
but not a single one of them panned out.

525
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,518
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough.
I need to know exactly what he told you.

526
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:21,355
He alleged that Starkwood
was blackmailing Pentagon officials

527
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,349
and were involved
in assassination plots.

528
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,318
Even that they were seeking
to acquire their own WMDs.

529
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:29,405
- Specifically what?
- Well, I don't remember, but I'm sure

530
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,051
that his interview transcript
should be there.

531
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,438
Okay, I got it.

532
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,164
Oh, my God. That's it.

533
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,458
- What?
- Your informant claims that Starkwood

534
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,587
was trying to acquire a bioweapon.
That's your connection to Juma.

535
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,381
- I don't understand.
- When Juma was in power, it was rumored

536
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,218
that he was running an illegal weapons
program. He was developing a bioweapon,

537
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,096
but nobody could prove it.
But the people that I knew in Sangala

538
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,251
believed he was testing these weapons
on his own population.

539
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,439
He used a remote village,
released some kind of pathogen.

540
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:04,064
Everyone there was struck with dementia,
paralysis and eventually died.

541
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:05,649
Why wasn't this pursued?

542
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:08,527
'Cause Juma destroyed all the evidence.
He firebombed the village

543
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,702
before anyone could get there,
and UN couldn't believe

544
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:14,867
that Juma had the technology
or expertise to develop such a weapon.

545
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:16,465
But Starkwood...

546
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,622
they had both.
The technology and the expertise.

547
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,751
- What did Juma have to offer Starkwood?
- A safe haven to develop the weapon

548
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,545
and an endless supply of victims
to test it on.

549
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,068
Even if all this was true,

550
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:32,064
why in the world
would Starkwood want a bioweapon?

551
00:33:32,189 --> 00:33:34,928
Senator, you've been trying
to dismantle Starkwood

552
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,599
for the last six months.
Maybe they planned on fighting back.

553
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,684
But regardless,
if they have a weapon like this,

554
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,829
you better believe
they intend to use it.

555
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,525
Senator Mayer!
This is Metro PD!

556
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,900
Don't you move.

557
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:54,977
Hold on. Hold on!

558
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,813
You're obviously on to something.

559
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,690
They can help you find the evidence
you need to prove your case.

560
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:04,859
Everyone thinks I killed Ryan Burnett.
No one's gonna listen to me.

561
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:07,711
I can protect you.
I can order them to help us.

562
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:10,050
Starkwood infiltrated
the White House.

563
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,641
As soon as they find out
you're going after them for a bioweapon,

564
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:14,126
they'll bury the evidence.

565
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,886
Then we'll keep the circle small.

566
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,846
I can make this happen.

567
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,307
It's time for you
to start trusting the institutions

568
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:23,512
that you've sacrificed so much
to protect.

569
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,399
- Trust isn't my greatest asset.
- Son, you have to start somewhere.

570
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:33,289
Senator!
This is Metro PD!

571
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,531
You really think you can do this?

572
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:36,962
I know I can.

573
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:40,752
Let 'em in.

574
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,310
You wanted to see me?

575
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:56,721
Yes, Livy.

576
00:35:57,673 --> 00:36:00,631
Ethan's just come to me
with something very disturbing.

577
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:03,327
I assume it's about the press leak
regarding Jack Bauer.

578
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,998
Ethan seems to think
you had something to do with it.

579
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,084
I didn't.
I already told him that.

580
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:15,088
Well, given the past experience
between you, he's not convinced.

581
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:18,281
- And what do you think?
- I think

582
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:20,177
I need to hear what you have to say.

583
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,095
There's nothing she can say.

584
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:25,475
She was one of the few people
who knew all the details.

585
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:28,435
More people knew than you think.

586
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:32,022
I just got off the phone with the
White House segment producer at CNB.

587
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,014
He won't give me the source's name,

588
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:38,195
but he's willing to confirm the leak
came from someone inside the Federal

589
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,199
Marshal's Office. He'll guarantee
it didn't come from the White House,

590
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:43,484
or from me.

591
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,037
This is verifiable?

592
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,874
Producer's name is Charlie Isakson.

593
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,378
Here's his number.
You can call him yourself if you'd like.

594
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:05,097
I offered Isakson some exclusive time
with you if he killed the story,

595
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:06,812
and he agreed.

596
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,817
So as long as we get
Bauer in custody,

597
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:10,936
we should be able
to keep the fallout contained.

598
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,114
Ethan, under the circumstances, I think
it seems clear that you were mistaken.

599
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:20,943
I'm satisfied.

600
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:22,531
Are you?

601
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:24,992
Yes, Madam President.

602
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,642
I'm sorry, Olivia,
if I misjudged the situation...

603
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:31,582
and you.

604
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:36,336
I want to know if the FBI
is any closer to finding Bauer.

605
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:37,735
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:39,986
That's all.

607
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,186
- I'm sorry I put you on the spot.
- I understand.

608
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,798
Ethan didn't give you
much of a choice.

609
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:58,985
I just hope they find Bauer
before this gets any worse.

610
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,184
You're dying.

611
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,665
Just tell me where the weapons
are coming in.

612
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:25,362
When are they getting here?

613
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:27,943
They're already here.

614
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,159
Janis, it's Larry.

615
00:42:06,945 --> 00:42:09,484
We got here too late.
Bauer murdered Senator Mayer.

616
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:12,447
Escalate the search for him
to region-wide.

617
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:16,324
I want reinforcements from every branch
within 50 miles brought into this.

618
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,495
- Copy that.
- At this point...

619
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:21,146
orders are to shoot on sight.

620
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,822
<i>Tony, it's Jack.</i>

621
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:31,047
I've been monitoring the FBI bandwidth.
What the hell's going on?

622
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,966
I need your help. Where are you?

623
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:34,426
3rd Street and B.

624
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,009
I need you to meet me
at the Port of Alexandria.

625
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,306
I need you to bring a weapons
and a surveillance package.

626
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,433
- <i>Get there ASAP.</i>
- Jack, wait.

627
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,207
I can't. I'll get back to you
as soon as I'm en route.
