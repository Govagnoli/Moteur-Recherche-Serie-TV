3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,421
Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.

4
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:17,558
Jonas Hodges is in possession
of a military-grade bioweapon.

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,543
I was contaminated
when trying to intercept the canisters.

6
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,563
I promise you,
the weapon is on your base.

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,149
<i>- Do you know where they might be?</i>
- Think I might.

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,402
I have an order from the president
of the United States.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,322
To search this building.
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,865
Are there weapons of any kind?

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,285
You've got 5 minutes to get
these helicopters flying out of here

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,703
with all of you on board.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,331
I want you and your men
to pull out on Hodges' timetable.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,408
You're gonna need
to find a way to stay behind.

15
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,301
We're gonna get your vectors
over to a man inside Starkwood.

16
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:47,962
This is Douglas Knowles. He believes
he knows where the weapons are.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,883
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

18
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:54,887
We need a medic!

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,640
The bioagent is more virulent
than we thought.

20
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,817
All we're doing here
is just masking the symptoms.

21
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:00,851
I understand.

22
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,754
There's something
you may want to consider.

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,730
What's that?

24
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,962
A possible treatment using stem cells
from a genetically compatible donor.

25
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,860
I saw your file,
you have a daughter.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,321
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

27
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,199
It should be her choice.

28
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,618
Well, it's not.
I'm the one who's dying.

29
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:20,788
I'm in. But they got Knowles.

30
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,353
A little loyalty.

31
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,458
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

32
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,877
You can't take on
the federal government.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,842
I have a visual on the weapon.

34
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,482
Okay, those are the canisters.

35
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:37,763
I'll notify Admiral Smith
the target is confirmed.

36
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,142
<i>You remember
Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan,</i>

37
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,978
that we requisitioned
a missile system at that time.

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,065
<i>Well, three of those missiles
are now loaded with a pathogen</i>

39
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,811
and aimed at cities
on our eastern seaboard.

40
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>You will keep this conversation
to yourself and turn the planes around.</i>

41
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,067
And if you do not comply,
Madam President,

42
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:58,576
I will have no choice

43
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,369
<i>but to launch those missiles.</i>

44
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,370
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

45
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,180
- With all respect...
- Damn it.

46
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:06,505
Abort the air strike immediately!

47
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:38,191
<i>- Tony, it's Jack. Do you copy?</i>
- Jack, what the hell is going on?

48
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,884
<i>Where are those F-18s?</i>

49
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,942
Tim Woods just called
from the White House.

50
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,845
The president canceled
the air strike.

51
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,270
What? Why?

52
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:48,827
She doesn't believe our intel is strong
enough to justify military action.

53
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,564
Is she out of her mind?

54
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,881
I saw those canisters with my own eyes.
So did you. They're in that bunker.

55
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,909
<i>- She's not gonna get any better intel.</i>
- I know. It doesn't make sense,

56
00:02:57,034 --> 00:03:00,942
but we've got order to pull you out,
along with the perimeter teams.

57
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,055
Larry's been told
the president's decision.

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,861
He'll move his teams out,
but he's got to get you out first.

59
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,021
He'll be sending you
coordinates for an exfiltration point.

60
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:13,597
Hold on a second.

61
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:22,952
Tony, what's going on?

62
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,922
I might know why the president
called off that air strike.

63
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,298
What do you mean?

64
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:31,456
I think Starkwood's
got surface-to-surface missiles.

65
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,611
That's how they're gonna
deploy the bioweapon.

66
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:35,286
How do you know this?

67
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,602
A fuel truck just pulled up
next to the bunker

68
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,443
where they're storing the weapons.

69
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,924
They're pumping RP-7
into an underground depot.

70
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,149
What's RP-7?

71
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,766
It's a propellant only used
in surface-to-surface missiles.

72
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,145
- Are you sure?
- I'm looking right at it.

73
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,191
Do you have any C-4?

74
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,359
I've got 3 charges
and a remote detonator.

75
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:59,299
Do you think you can gain access
to the underground fuel depot?

76
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:02,232
Yeah, I think we've got a play,
but I've got to move soon...

77
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:03,868
before that fuel truck pulls away.

78
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,871
I want you to maintain your position.
I'm gonna call the president.

79
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,342
Come with me.

80
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:14,792
What is it, Tim?

81
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:20,759
Madam President, the Joint Chiefs
are beginning to question your decision

82
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,721
to call off the air strike
against Starkwood.

83
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,324
They think the intelligence we received
from Tony Almeida was sufficient,

84
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,438
that we may be missing an opportunity
to destroy the bioweapons.

85
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,055
I gave my orders, Tim.

86
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,638
No air strike.

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,959
No military action of any kind
against Starkwood.

88
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,322
Now, I asked you to handle
the Joint Chiefs, handle them.

89
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,110
I'll do my best, ma'am,
but if I may...

90
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:46,137
what is our next move?

91
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:50,456
Jonas Hodges is coming
to the White House.

92
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,168
He wants to speak with me alone.

93
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:57,296
- For what possible reason?
- I don't know.

94
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,767
Shouldn't your advisors
be at that meeting?

95
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,842
Tim, stop asking me questions.

96
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,223
If you want to help,

97
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,601
make sure as few people as possible know
that Jonas Hodges is coming here.

98
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,020
And bring him in through
the southeast service entrance.

99
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,917
<i>Madam President, Jack Bauer
and Renee Walker are calling from FBI.</i>

100
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,610
- You did speak to FBI?
- Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.

101
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,825
I gave them your reason for calling off
the air strike, but I must warn you,

102
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:28,790
they were skeptical as well.

103
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,204
Be ready for Hodges.

104
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,294
<i>Mr. Bauer, Agent Walker,
this is the president.</i>

105
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,353
- Madam President, we need to talk.
- No, Mr. Bauer, we don't.

106
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:43,928
You need to listen.

107
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,040
I appreciate what you have done
in gathering this intel,

108
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:50,228
but I still need more
before I can authorize an air strike.

109
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,542
- I'm sorry.
- Madam President, with all due respect,

110
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,567
I don't believe
you're being truthful with us.

111
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,799
- Excuse me?
- I think you called off the air strike

112
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,510
because Jonas Hodges is in possession
of missiles armed with the bioweapon,

113
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:06,420
<i>and he's threatening to use them in case
you try to take action against him.</i>

114
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,783
Madam President, Tony Almeida witnessed
a truck pumping RP-7 rocket fuel

115
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,459
into an underground depot
situated right next to the bunker

116
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,507
where the bioweapons
are being stored.

117
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:19,086
The only purpose for RP-7 rocket fuel
is to launch missiles.

118
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,717
Madam President,
please just tell us the truth.

119
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,054
Hodges has 13 Python missiles

120
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,166
armed with the bioweapons.

121
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,091
Three are currently aimed
at American cities.

122
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
He demanded that I recall the planes,
or he would launch.

123
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,292
- What does Hodges want?
- I don't know...

124
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,476
he's requested a face-to-face meeting.
He'll be here in a few minutes.

125
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,590
The only reason he wants a face-to-face
meeting is to lay out his demands,

126
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,975
and whatever they are,
you cannot negotiate with him.

127
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,229
I'm not planning
on negotiating with him, Jack.

128
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:54,931
Once he places his cards on the table,
I am sure that I can...

129
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,789
I can make him realize
the futility of what he is trying to do.

130
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,167
Jonas Hodges is a traitor
and a terrorist,

131
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,756
and after what's happened today,
are you really naive enough

132
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,586
to believe that you can simply talk
to him and change his mind?

133
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:08,302
I'm not new at this, Jack,

134
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,501
<i>and right now,
I don't have another option.</i>

135
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,973
You do.
Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood.

136
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,756
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.
What's he still doing there?

137
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,853
I asked him to stand by
until I could talk to you.

138
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,021
He believes
he can gain access to the fuel depot

139
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:24,091
and lay a series of explosive charges
and take the missiles out.

140
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:26,688
Now, I believe this can work,
but we need to act quickly.

141
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,254
What about the bioweapons?

142
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,594
RP-7 rocket fuel burns
at 5,000 degrees.

143
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,081
- There will be nothing left.
- Once the weapons are destroyed,

144
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:36,330
Larry Moss and his teams can move in
on Starkwood and lock it down.

145
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,707
Hodges gave
standing orders to his men

146
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,918
<i>to launch the missiles
at the first detection</i>

147
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,878
<i>of government interference.</i>

148
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,853
<i>If Almeida is detected,
thousands of Americans will die, Jack.</i>

149
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,427
I know that there's a risk,
but I would not be asking you to do this

150
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,111
if I didn't think it would work.

151
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:55,039
Please, I am begging you.

152
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,326
Trust me.

153
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:04,817
How long did
the doctors give you to live?

154
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,029
They're not sure,

155
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:12,664
but the pathogen
has started to take effect.

156
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,539
Then there's not much
I can threaten you with, is there?

157
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,578
I expect you'll do

158
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,830
what you think is right.

159
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,493
What the hell does that mean?

160
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:36,723
She wants us to go in.

161
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:40,502
- But she didn't authorize it.
- She can't.

162
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,010
She needs this
to be a covert operation.

163
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,904
If something were to go wrong
and those missiles were to be launched,

164
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,816
she needs to be able to swear under oath
that we were working on our own.

165
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,478
She wants us to go in.

166
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,903
Notify Larry.
We need to move fast.

167
00:08:58,241 --> 00:09:00,763
I told you I'd get you
to the White House. I just didn't...

168
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,488
think it would be
under these conditions.

169
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,359
It was brilliant, you know.

170
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,957
What was that, sir?

171
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,092
Your idea to make Almeida think
that you were betraying me.

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,670
- Quite brilliant.
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:22,242
You put yourself in harm's way,
Greg,

174
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,348
and I'll never forget that.

175
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,769
I can't believe...

176
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:30,292
I'm feeling nervous.

177
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,217
You're gonna do fine, sir.

178
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,076
- Thank you, Tim.
- You're welcome.

179
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:41,025
So, it sounds to me like the president
didn't actually authorize this.

180
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,150
Technically, no.
It was more of an indirect order,

181
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,776
but believe me, Larry,
she wants this to happen.

182
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:50,005
She's gonna meet with Hodges,
and we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

183
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,270
Larry,
do you have a problem with this?

184
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,108
As a matter of fact, no.

185
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,431
None whatsoever.

186
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,949
These bastards drew on my men.

187
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,900
I'm looking forward
to getting back in there.

188
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,791
All right, have your teams hold
their position and be ready to move.

189
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,626
Believe me,
you'll know when it happens.

190
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:09,751
All right.

191
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:27,349
Tony, do you copy?

192
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,379
- I'm here.
- You were right about the missiles.

193
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,438
The president confirmed it. We have
to carry this out as a covert operation.

194
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,441
Larry is standing by
to lock down Starkwood

195
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,777
as soon as the missiles
have been destroyed.

196
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:39,909
I need to know that you can do this
without being detected.

197
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:42,601
Hodges's given his men standing orders
to launch those missiles

198
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,262
if there's a breach of any kind.

199
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:45,787
Yeah. I can do it.

200
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:47,896
Okay. Good luck.

201
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,423
We're done here.

202
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,495
I'm going to go run
a perimeter check.

203
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,320
- You said you just finished one.
- I know.

204
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,272
But I don't think
we can be too careful right now.

205
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,902
- Yeah.
<i>- It's me.</i>

206
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,235
Auxiliary tanks
are fueled and ready.

207
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,429
Confirmed.

208
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,658
- I'll be down in a few minutes.
- Copy that.

209
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
Freeze!

210
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,998
Let me see your hands.

211
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,299
Put your gun on the ground. Slowly.

212
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,555
Kick it.

213
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,771
Drag him under the truck.
Now! Let's go!

214
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Hands up.

215
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,280
What do you think you're doing?

216
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:29,764
You're going to take me down
to the fuel tanks.

217
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:31,092
Let's go.

218
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:49,351
Open it up.

219
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:57,651
Go ahead.

220
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,696
President will see you now.

221
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:26,552
Very good. Thank you.

222
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:34,229
- Mr. Hodges.
- Madam President.

223
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,523
This is Greg Seaton,

224
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:37,992
my associate.

225
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:41,194
He's a remarkable man.
Doesn't look remarkable,

226
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,362
but believe me, he's a genius.

227
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,365
Yes, I know Mr. Seaton.

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,830
Thank you, gentlemen.

229
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,618
It never gets old, does it?

230
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,452
Stepping into the...

231
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:56,877
the Oval Office.

232
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,003
Almost

233
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,799
smells of history.

234
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,639
Can we sit?

235
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:02,931
Please.

236
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,345
This is the first time I've been
in this room since you were elected?

237
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,272
- I'm aware of that, yes.
- Under your predecessor,

238
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:13,268
I used to drop by every...
couple of months.

239
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:17,948
I'd brief President Daniels on
what was really going on in the world.

240
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:21,109
And you've been excluded now.

241
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,029
- Is that what this is about?
- No, ma'am.

242
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:29,095
It's about allowing Starkwood to fulfill
the purpose for which it was founded:

243
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,619
protecting this country.

244
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,187
You have been attacking
this country.

245
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:35,040
You and General Juma

246
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,758
have killed
hundreds of innocent people,

247
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,843
including my son.

248
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,580
Madam President,

249
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,707
I'm deeply sorry or your loss,

250
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:50,608
and my heart breaks for all the lives
that were taken today,

251
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,619
but I'm shocked that you would think
that I had anything to do with this.

252
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,937
We have evidence
that you've been working with Juma.

253
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,565
Your intelligence agencies
have failed you.

254
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,934
If I had known what Juma was up to,

255
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,237
I would have done
everything in my power to stop him.

256
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,601
So let's push aside all
these baseless accusations

257
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,617
and maybe we can do
some business here.

258
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:12,661
I'm listening.

259
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,090
Madam President,

260
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,015
I know you're a student of history,

261
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,250
and so you're well aware
that our nation's independence

262
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,362
was won
with the aid of private armies,

263
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,550
and we can't survive without them.

264
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,292
Look how easy it was
to get bioweapons into this country.

265
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,430
Our defenses are fragile.
They're on the verge of collapse.

266
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,475
But it's not too late
to do something about it.

267
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,686
So what are you suggesting?

268
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,826
In short,

269
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:41,648
I want a seat at the table.

270
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,189
Starkwood needs to be involved
in the shaping of military policy,

271
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,696
domestic and global.

272
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:52,033
It sounds more like you want
a seat at the head of the table.

273
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,577
Madam President, I'm not here
to supplant your authority.

274
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,805
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

275
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,203
Think of Starkwood
as the fifth branch of the military.

276
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,340
This contains the protocols

277
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,358
that will serve
as the basis of our agreement.

278
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:13,931
I suggest that
we review them together.

279
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,065
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting
because...

280
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,144
I wanted to hear
what you had to say.

281
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:21,980
But what you're proposing
is blackmail.

282
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,889
That's putting it
in the worst possible light.

283
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,179
You are threatening to kill
thousands of people.

284
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,870
I'm not proud of this chapter.

285
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,801
I'm the first to admit it.

286
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,789
It's time to turn the page. This country
has seen enough bloodshed today.

287
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,808
For the sake of the American people,
Madam President,

288
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,983
I implore you to work with me,

289
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:47,308
and let's move past this.

290
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,829
Pick up the document,
Madam President.

291
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,604
Let's go. Come on.

292
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:27,088
Get up now, or I'll leave you down here.
And you don't want that believe me.

293
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:22,505
What is it?

294
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,113
Code 363.

295
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:26,438
That's a government breach.
We're supposed to launch.

296
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,268
- Are you sure it's not a false alarm?
- No way to tell.

297
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:32,444
We've got standing orders, though.
Let's start the launch sequence.

298
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:40,677
Too late.

299
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:55,091
Launch sequence complete.
Target is locked.

300
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,468
Enter the firing codes.

301
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,804
- Sir, we need to confirm this.
- That's not the correct protocol.

302
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,426
We're about to kill 10,000 people.
We should get someone on the phone.

303
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,851
Enter the codes.

304
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:05,935
Now!

305
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,490
No, sir.

306
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:48,299
That's it. That's us. Let's go.
We're a go! We're a go!

307
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,851
- It's done.
- Tony?

308
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,334
Tony, do you copy?

309
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,996
An explosion of that magnitude
would have shorted out his com.

310
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,374
We're gonna have to wait
for Larry and his men to move in.

311
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,405
It says here
that you want active status

312
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,667
in the Pentagon's
Strategic Planning Group.

313
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,114
That's correct.

314
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:27,136
That would give you access
to Level 6 classified material.

315
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,609
Not even the vice president
has that clearance.

316
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,613
These points are nonnegotiable.

317
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:33,905
I'm not here to debate them.

318
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:37,927
Let's review the next section,
which concerns Senate oversight

319
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,333
of Starkwood field operations.

320
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,245
I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam,
but I need to speak with you.

321
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,394
Can it wait?

322
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,142
No, ma'am, it can't.

323
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,733
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Of course.

324
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:04,421
SATCOM has just detected a massive
explosion on the Starkwood compound.

325
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,818
The bioweapons facility
has been destroyed.

326
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,393
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am.

327
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,616
Judging by the explosion,
nothing could have survived.

328
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:12,880
But I don't know how this happened.
This wasn't us.

329
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,000
Call FBI and have them
lock down Starkwood.

330
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,858
- They're already moving in.
- Good.

331
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,485
And when this is over,
I want to speak to Jack Bauer.

332
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,078
You know...

333
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:27,588
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

334
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,129
I think you handled it
perfectly, sir.

335
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:32,985
We'll see.

336
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,503
What the hell is this?

337
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,314
Put this document into evidence,
and take these men into custody.

338
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,051
Have you lost your mind?

339
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,720
Jonas, we've taken out
your missiles.

340
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:47,288
It's over.

341
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:50,877
That's impossible.

342
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:52,743
It's the truth.

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,103
And you're under arrest.

344
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,444
You are a terrorist and a murder,

345
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,413
and I'm gonna do
everything in my power

346
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:02,445
to make sure that you pay dearly
for your crimes.

347
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:08,331
My only crime is that I'm trying
to protect my country.

348
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,823
You think this ends with me?

349
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:13,648
I'm just a small cog
in a very big machine.

350
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:14,773
Hold on.

351
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:20,296
You can't even begin to imagine
what you're up against.

352
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,840
What are you talking about?

353
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:25,864
You'll find out.

354
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,430
Get him out of here.

355
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:06,300
The biohazard team is reporting no trace
of the bioweapon near the blast sight.

356
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:08,372
It was incinerated in the explosion.

357
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:10,857
- Good. Any word on Tony?
- Not yet.

358
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:13,792
Larry's searching the compound now.
We should hear something soon.

359
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,811
Mr. Bauer, you have a phone call,
it's the President.

360
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,815
I'll take it in the conference room.
Thank you. I'll be right back.

361
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,111
Madam President.

362
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:36,291
Mr. Bauer,
Jonas Hodges is under arrest.

363
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,084
That's good news.
That's very good.

364
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:44,505
Jack, you and your team
provided me with an option.

365
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,080
<i>And for that, I am deeply grateful.</i>

366
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,549
And so are the American people.

367
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:50,974
<i>Madam President,</i>

368
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:54,932
<i>it was Tony Almeida who risked his life
to destroy those missiles.</i>

369
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,743
And as you know, he's facing arrest
for things he did leading up to today,

370
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,479
and I was hoping that maybe...

371
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,747
you could...

372
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:03,777
Yes, Mr. Bauer?

373
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:13,703
I'm sorry, I...

374
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,537
completely forgot what I was saying.

375
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,999
You were talking about Mr. Almeida.

376
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,975
And my answer is yes,
I will take his actions into account.

377
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Thank you.

378
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:28,634
What's happening?

379
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,257
I'm not exactly sure.

380
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,363
<i>Jack, I am so sorry
you're going through this.</i>

381
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,850
I wish that there were
something I could do.

382
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,769
Madam President,
I appreciate this phone call.

383
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:43,523
But I'm sorry. I have to go.

384
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,491
<i>- Of course.</i>
- Thank you.

385
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,851
Jonas Hodges has been arrested.

386
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:57,702
Let me know as soon as you got Tony.

387
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,497
I need to go see Dr. Macer.

388
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,030
<i>Yes, Madam President?</i>

389
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:05,670
Call Ben Landry at CDC.

390
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,470
Tell him that I want real-time updates
on Jack Bauer's condition.

391
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,826
We've secured all entry points
and command posts

392
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,578
and are sweeping the compound
on a grid-by-grid basis.

393
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:30,008
- Are you meeting any resistance?
- No.

394
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:32,822
They're surrendering peacefully
and cooperating.

395
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:34,991
Most of the men on this base,

396
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,742
I don't think they had
any idea what was going on.

397
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,412
What about Almeida?

398
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,998
He's here. We found him.

399
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,750
- Is he OK?
- Some cuts and bruises,

400
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,543
but otherwise, he's in good shape.

401
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,004
Good.
Jack will be glad to hear that.

402
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,429
<i>Listen, Renee...</i>

403
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,058
we've known each other
a long time, you know.

404
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,104
So much stuff has happened today.

405
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:56,223
Yeah.

406
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,406
We have a lot to talk about.
I know.

407
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:00,141
Excuse me.
Your visitor has arrived.

408
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,368
- She's in the waiting area.
- Okay, thank you.

409
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,512
Larry, I've got to go.
Kim Bauer's here.

410
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:07,149
- Jack's daughter?
<i>- Yes. I asked her to come.</i>

411
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,043
<i>There's this experimental treatment
for Jack's disease,</i>

412
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,079
but he needs compatible stem cells.

413
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,933
It's a long shot,
but it's the only hope he's got.

414
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,560
- Let me know how it goes, all right?
<i>- I will.</i>

415
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:20,663
<i>- I'm going off com.</i>
- All right.

416
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:26,392
Did they say something
about Kim Bauer?

417
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:27,939
Yeah, she's at FBI

418
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:32,439
helping with a treatment for Jack,
some kind of stem cell therapy.

419
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,845
So they think
he's gonna be all right?

420
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:37,018
Didn't sound promising.

421
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,236
Listen, Tony,
this isn't easy for me, but...

422
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:45,728
I'm under orders to take you
into federal custody.

423
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:49,023
- Yeah, I know.
- You did a brave thing here.

424
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:51,233
Probably saved thousands of lives.

425
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:53,666
For the record,

426
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,033
I don't think this is
how you should be repaid.

427
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,675
I appreciate that, but...

428
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,452
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.

429
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,075
Get the cuffs off him, will you?

430
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:08,326
Chopper's on the way.
I'll be taking you back to FBI.

431
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:15,191
Memory loss is consistent
with the disease, Mr. Bauer.

432
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:18,471
I just wouldn't have expected it
to manifest this quickly.

433
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,386
It's not just memory loss.

434
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,475
It feels like...

435
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,819
I don't know exactly
how to explain it.

436
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,640
I feel like...

437
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,801
like I'm losing some part of myself.

438
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:37,249
The disease profile includes
personality changes,

439
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:39,615
sometimes even hallucinations.

440
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:43,324
But this is a weaponized pathogen
we don't know much about.

441
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:47,429
Military's combing through the remains
of the bioweapons lab in Sangala, so...

442
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,606
we expect to learn
something very soon.

443
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:52,628
You were able to give me something
that controlled the shaking.

444
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,215
Is there anything
that would help me with this?

445
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:00,148
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,033
Thank you. Excuse me.

447
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,974
Is it all right?

448
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:25,283
I'm gonna need to go on record
about everything that happened today.

449
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:27,832
We need to do it soon. I'm not sure
how much longer I'll be able

450
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,411
- to provide you with the details.
- Okay.

451
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,336
First, there's something
that you need to know.

452
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:34,920
What?

453
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,341
It's about Kim.
She's here, Jack.

454
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,186
I told her that you were sick
and that she might be able to help.

455
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,815
You did...

456
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:48,708
You did what?

457
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,719
Come here.

458
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:58,438
Who the hell do you think you are?

459
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,197
Who the hell do you think you are?

460
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,267
You think this is easy?

461
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:07,806
You think you understand what I'm going
through? Because you don't.

462
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:08,788
I am dying.

463
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,248
And I was okay with it.

464
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,119
I could handle it.

465
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:16,882
And now you've put in front of me
the one thing,

466
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,507
the one thing that is
gonna make this unbearable.

467
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,467
- Jack, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

468
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,678
I specifically told you
do not drag my daughter into this.

469
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,306
No one dragged her into anything.

470
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,909
She's been trying
to see you all day.

471
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:36,774
What?

472
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:39,576
She was at the Senate hearing
this morning.

473
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:44,496
She came from L.A. to be there, but we
pulled you out before she could see you.

474
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,591
She's been leaving messages
at our office all day.

475
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,562
They just didn't get to me till now.

476
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:56,264
If you want, I can tell her that you're
not here. I can tell her that you...

477
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:57,639
can't see her.

478
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:02,184
Can't do that.

479
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,848
Where is she?

480
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,259
Down the hall.

481
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:13,303
Show me.

482
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:51,348
How are you feeling?

483
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:54,768
I'm okay.

484
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:57,313
You're not in any pain?

485
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:03,072
Come sit down.

486
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:21,016
Did Agent Walker tell you
that I was trying to find you?

487
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,550
I've tried everything
to track you down:

488
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,847
State Department,
private investigators.

489
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,295
Every time I got a phone number
or an address, you were already gone.

490
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
I'm sorry.

491
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:38,896
I thought I was doing
the best thing for you by staying away.

492
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,828
Daddy, I've missed you so much.

493
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:49,965
I've missed you, too.

494
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,825
You need to know how sorry I am
for everything you had to live through

495
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,948
- because of me.
- No, don't do that.

496
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:00,621
Don't put that on yourself.

497
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:03,212
I'm the one that should apologize.
I pushed you away.

498
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:05,372
And instead of taking responsibility

499
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:08,847
for all the mistakes I've made
in my life, I blamed you.

500
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:11,253
And it was stupid

501
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,242
and immature.

502
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,532
And now, all the time
that we've lost...

503
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,516
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

504
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,408
a small chance,
that I could help you,

505
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:32,674
- and you don't want me to.
- The treatment is experimental.

506
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:34,827
And I don't think
it's going to work.

507
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:38,579
And you don't want to
because you're afraid to ask me.

508
00:32:42,034 --> 00:32:43,210
There's a risk.

509
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:47,673
A small risk...
worth taking.

510
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,799
Not to me.

511
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:53,637
I'm dying.

512
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:58,417
And whatever small chance there is
to stop that from happening,

513
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,658
it is not worth the pain

514
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:04,587
for me to let you sit there
and watch me die.

515
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:05,712
Daddy,

516
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:08,531
- I don't want to lose you.
- Come here.

517
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:10,594
I don't.

518
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:14,065
Sweetheart,
it's going to be all right.

519
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,029
It's gonna be all right.
I promise you.

520
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:23,566
What is it?

521
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,682
What?

522
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,699
Sweetheart, I'm sorry...

523
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:35,939
but you need to go.

524
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,559
Please, baby, I'm begging you.

525
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,896
I love you so much.

526
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,814
Honey, I love you, too.
Please, baby.

527
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,293
Thank you. Go.

528
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,530
Perimeter 2 to Dispatch:

529
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,162
Auxiliary Gate 6 is clear.

530
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,537
<i>Copy that, P-2. Hold your position.</i>

531
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,533
Freeze!
Show me your hands.

532
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,010
Get 'em up!

533
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,269
P-2 to Dispatch.

534
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,100
I have an agent down
and a suspect in custody. Code red.

535
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:09,287
<i>Copy that, P-2.</i>

536
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:11,934
<i>All available agents respond
to Auxiliary Gate 6.</i>

537
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:12,985
Drop the bag.

538
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,840
Hands on the hood.

539
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,557
P-2 to Dispatch. Put me through
to Agent Moss. It's urgent.

540
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,351
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at Auxiliary Gate 6.

541
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,494
I have a Starkwood Op in custody.

542
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,806
He killed one of our agents. He was
carrying a canister of the bioweapon,

543
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:59,132
trying to smuggle it out
using one of our vehicles.

544
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,367
- What?! Are you sure?
- I'm looking at it right now.

545
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,744
Renee, we got a breach
in the cordon at Gate 6.

546
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:22,504
One of the Starkwood Ops,
he's got a canister of the bioweapon.

547
00:36:22,629 --> 00:36:24,740
- What?
- It was ID'd by Agent Davis,

548
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:26,480
who I believe has just been shot.

549
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:28,681
The suspect may be fleeing
in an FBI vehicle,

550
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:30,631
so I need you to close
down all access roads,

551
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,617
alert perimeter units
and Metro Police.

552
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:35,179
- Get me DC Metro.
- I'm gonna pursue it from the air.

553
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:36,854
Let's go!
Let us up!

554
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,617
<i>Alert Homeland,
let them know what's going on.</i>

555
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,408
Are we thinking
this is another attack?

556
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,907
I don't know, but there's enough
prion variant in one canister

557
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:47,782
to take out a small city.

558
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,144
Agent Miller,
are there any major roadways

559
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,858
in our perimeter that Starkwood
operatives could have used?

560
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,140
<i>Yes, sir.
We're coming up on Highway 42.</i>

561
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,740
<i>Should I turn us that way?</i>

562
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:21,765
Yeah let us up that way, until
we hear something from Agent Walker.

563
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,940
<i>Roger that.</i>

564
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,225
Yes, sir. We'll keep Homeland apprised
with real-time updates.

565
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,672
- Did you access the GPS locator system?
- I'm scanning transponders

566
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,947
- for the stolen FBI vehicle.
- How long will that take?

567
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:36,545
As long as it takes for the satellite
to reposition.

568
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:39,590
When you spoke to Larry,
you mentioned an attack?

569
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:44,052
The Starkwood operative we're trying
to find stole a canister

570
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,570
of the bioweapon.

571
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,083
I thought Tony Almeida
destroyed all the weapons.

572
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,273
Apparently not.

573
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:51,446
How did this operative
get past our perimeter?

574
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,437
Shot and killed two of our agents.

575
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,198
This is it.

576
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,318
The suspect is getting off
Highway 42 at Smoketree Avenue.

577
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:01,650
He's heading toward
the industrial corridor.

578
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:03,878
- Put me on the interagency channel.
- Go ahead.

579
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:05,936
All units,
this is Agent Walker with FBI.

580
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,463
<i>Suspect has exited Highway 42
at Smoketree.</i>

581
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:10,621
<i>He's heading north
into the industrial corridor.</i>

582
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,491
Units in the vicinity,
please respond.

583
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,315
We're over Smoketree right now.

584
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,415
We're redirecting,
and we'll tighten our pursuit.

585
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,004
Got it. I'll reroute
Swat Team Alpha to the scene.

586
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,812
Swat Team Alpha, we need to set up
a roadblock at the Fairfax County line.

587
00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:26,984
DC Metro's covering the district line
in case he tries to double back.

588
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,652
<i>Copy that. Okay, county line.</i>

589
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:36,586
Sir. I have a visual.

590
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,101
Yeah. Got him.

591
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,380
Send us lower.

592
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,203
He's pulling off the road.
Get us down there now.

593
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,714
Suspect is on foot. We can't wait
for backup. We're moving in right now.

594
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,086
All right. SWAT team's
a few minutes out.

595
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,428
Careful, Larry.

596
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,805
Remember, suspect has a canister,
so pick your shots.

597
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,519
- If possible, let's take him alive.
- Yes, sir.

598
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,654
We got to get out of here.
Almeida, cover. Let's go.

599
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,197
Come on!

600
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:57,201
Sir, relax.

601
00:39:59,044 --> 00:40:00,594
- Relax.
- I'm okay.

602
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:06,987
Swallow.

603
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:19,936
What...?

604
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:24,118
I'm sorry, Larry.

605
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,576
Oh... God...

606
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:18,458
Let me see it.

607
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:43,165
How the hell do we get out of here?

608
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,627
I want you to take this,
find a place to hide.

609
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,420
- Wait for my call.
- What about you?

610
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,692
I'm gonna wait on the FBI,
figure out a way to get you out of here.

611
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Go!
