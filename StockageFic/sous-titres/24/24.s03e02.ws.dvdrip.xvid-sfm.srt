1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,073
Someone just dropped off a dead body
infected with a virus.

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,075
Based on the autopsy, by the end of the first
week, nine per cent of LA will be infected.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,920
That's over a million people.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,718
(distorted) We want the release
of Ram Ãn Salazar.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,912
If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,196
You know Salazar better than anybody else
here. Who are we dealing with?

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,795
(Jack) His brother.
Hector was next in command.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,320
He went underground
when Ram Ãn was taken into custody.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,151
Have you made the call to the FBl?

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,869
Y es, I did.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,920
- What about our boy?
- I'm watching him now.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,036
What are you into here, man? Selling dope?

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,120
This guy paid me five grand to bring some
coke over the border. I did that last night.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,111
Today I drop it off, I get another five.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,112
When did the FBl get this call?

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,551
- About 20 minutes ago.
- We don't know who we're dealing with?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,310
- It was a scrambled voice on an open line.
- Do we cancel the debate?

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,353
They are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,315
Chase, no day is a good day.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,320
We said that we would tell him if we were still
together after two months. It's almost three.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,276
Why don't we just get it over with?

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
Listen, Jack.
You were under with Salazar for six months.

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,915
I know what they did to you.
You look like hell.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,279
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,920
The president won't make any decisions
until he knows what we're dealing with,

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,593
so give me all the parameters, Tony.

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,115
What we have here
is a terrorist demand.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,518
Someone close to Salazar, we're guessing
his brother, is demanding his release.

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,548
If we don't comply, he'll initiate an outbreak
of a very deadly, fast-acting virus.

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,115
How do we know they're in possession of it?

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,720
Wayne, I've got Dr Sunny Macer on the line.

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,320
She's technical director
of National Health Services.

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,871
Mr Palmer, about an hour ago, a dead body
was anonymously delivered to our office.

35
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,720
It was infected with a type lll
pneumonic virus, deliberately introduced.

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,748
This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure
and there is no known antidote or vaccine.

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,636
What's particularly disturbing
is how fast it spreads. Take a look.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,920
It's latent for several hours but once it
presents, it consumes the host rapidly.

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,040
We will send you preliminary projections
of casualties in case something's unleashed.

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,920
And, Wayne, I gotta tell you,
it's pretty bleak.

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,436
I don't understand this. I thought we knew
what biological threats were out there.

42
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,430
How do we find ourselves up against the wall
with something that isn 't even on our radar?

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,435
This is a strain we 've never seen. The autopsy
confirms someone has engineered this virus

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
to kill ten times faster
than its ordinary genotypes.

45
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,911
OK. OK, I see.

46
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
Sir, I can 't underscore enough

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,920
how potentially devastating it would be
if this virus were released by terrorists.

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,832
What options will the president be looking at?

49
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,277
It's the unwavering policy of the US
to stand firm against any terrorist demands.

50
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,029
I know the president, Tony.

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,079
He will not free Salazar.
No matter what the threat.

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
We can't waste any time
on standard protocol today.

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,869
We've been given five hours to comply.
If we're gonna stop this threat,

54
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
then CTU has to have every
possible resource at its disposal.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,913
- You'll have it.
- I'd like to get my team back to work.

56
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,997
- Understood.
- Thank you.

57
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
- Bauer.
- Dad, it's me.

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,519
- What, Kim?
- Adam and I just found something on Goss.

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
We should have
an address for you pretty soon.

60
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,480
OK. Good work.

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,473
- And, Dad, remember I wanted to talk to you.
- Why? Is something wrong?

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,674
No, I was just wondering ifl could come up
for a few minutes. It's something personal.

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,119
Sweetheart, now's not a good time. As soon
as I've got a moment, I'll come down, OK?

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,430
Yeah. Thanks.

65
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,033
They're getting close to Goss.

66
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
You didn't shoot up, did you?
You think you can hide it from me?

67
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,033
I'm not trying to hide it from you.
I'm trying to quit.

68
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,999
People don't just quit, Jack.

69
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I've been tapering off. OK?
Now it's time to stop.

70
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,714
Doesn't look like it's time. Today is
not a good day for you to be needing a fix.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,119
Why don't you go work with Chloe
and pin down a location on Hector Salazar?

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
What's wrong with
the methadone programme?

73
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,878
It takes a little time, but it works.

74
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,310
I am not going on record with this addiction,
do you understand me?

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,552
You're the only person who knows,
and it's gonna stay that way.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,080
This is nothing to be ashamed of.
You did this in the line of duty.

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,072
Doing junk was the only way
to get close to Salazar.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,677
I know what I did. This conversation's over.
Just get back to work.

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,349
Yeah.

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,598
- Chase.
- What?

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,080
I was playing back
the Health Services briefing.

82
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,833
- What about it?
- The government can't let this happen.

83
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Salazar's just one person,
no matter how bad.

84
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Forget that. We need to operate under
our orders and find the carrier of this virus.

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,358
Find the carrier? In the next four hours?
Come on, Chase, that's not likely, is it?

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,032
Not if we sit and debate it. Weren't you meant
to find a list of the Goss associates?

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,913
Kim's bringing it up now.

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,880
Great. Then go over the autopsy report.
See if there's anything they overlooked.

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,915
Fine.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,110
Here are the files on Goss.

91
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,036
I heard you talking to your dad
when I was in his office.

92
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,680
- Why do you wanna tell him today?
- Cos it's not a big deal.

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,150
It is a big deal. Not only do I work for him,
but I'm also a field agent.

94
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,078
- It's the last thing he wants for you.
- How do you know?

95
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,750
I know. OK? I mean, he talks about things.

96
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,150
About how he was never there for you.
Or your mom.

97
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,038
He doesn't believe a field agent
can have a relationship.

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,675
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe it would make him happy?

99
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,590
That his daughter's
found someone she loves?

100
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,437
Look, I love you too.
I just don't think today's a good day.

101
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,838
Chase, I need you to copy me on that list.

102
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,039
- What's this column keyed off at?
- That's family and that's legal.

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,396
- Great.
- OK.

104
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,880
(Jack) I want you to cross-reference
those files with our Latin American files.

105
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,317
Yes, I want all the names printed out. OK,
just get that intel over to my office. Thanks.

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,590
(knocks)

107
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,160
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

108
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,391
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why? What's going on?

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Chase said you were really stressed out.

110
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,638
- Stressed? What do you mean, "stressed"?
- You know.

111
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,399
Salazar and the terrorist threat.

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,390
Yeah. Yeah, but I think we're gonna get it
under control. We just got a lot of work to do.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,360
- Listen, can I talk to you now?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

114
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,191
Take a seat.

115
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,390
Hey. What's going on?

116
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,280
After all we've been through,
I find it very difficult to keep things from you.

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,476
OK. What's up?

118
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,271
Chase and I have been going out for a while.
And it's starting to get serious.

119
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,354
Wow.

120
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,793
I think he wanted to be the one to tell you
but he was worried it would cause a problem.

121
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,237
I see.

122
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,396
How long have the two of you
been seeing each other?

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,835
Three months.

124
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,713
I really care for him, Dad.

125
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,557
So what do you think?

126
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,190
I don't know what I think.

127
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,235
I'm really surprised.

128
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,477
I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted
with everything going on...

129
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,632
I know, but...

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,715
- Forget it. I just had to let you know.
- No, I'm glad you told me. I am.

131
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,560
OK.

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,120
- I love you.
- Love you too.

133
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,596
Told him.

134
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,360
What did he say?

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,157
Nothing.

136
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,511
(phone rings)

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
- Dessler.
- It's Sunny. I have something that might help.

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,994
We found something odd in Goss's system.
We found an unmetabolised virus particle.

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll skip the technobabble. It looks like
the virus was delivered in a crystalline form.

140
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,960
Maybe what you're looking for
is a white powder.

141
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,600
- So it would look like cocaine? Or heroin?
- Yeah, that may even be the strategy.

142
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,990
Someone thinks they're selling coke,
but they're handling the virus.

143
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,872
Look, Kyle.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,835
I'm not gonna do it. OK? I don't care
how much you pay me, it's dealing drugs.

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You're my best friend.
You gotta come through for me here.

146
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,000
You should have talked to me before
you went to Mexico and bought the coke.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I only want you to wait in the car.
I'll make the delivery.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,356
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna go with you.

149
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,394
Fine.

150
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,833
(phone rings)

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,718
- Yeah.
- It's Zach.

152
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,633
- Zach, hey. What's up?
- We need to talk.

153
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,916
Hold on a second, man.

154
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,430
- Who's Zach?
- It's nobody.

155
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
What's with you today?
Everything's a secret.

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,912
He's got family stuff going on.

157
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
What's going on?

158
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,039
- You tell me. You got the powder?
- Yeah, of course I do.

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
- What time you want me to drop it off?
- Tonight. Come by around 7.30.

160
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,200
7.30, yeah. Can we just go over one more time
how this whole thing's gonna go down?

161
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,000
Go over what? You drop off the coke, I give
you the money. Is that too much for you?

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,560
No! No, no, that's totally cool, man.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,275
It better be.

164
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,749
(phone rings)

165
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,554
- Yeah.
- It's Michelle.

166
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,348
We got an address on David Goss, the
infected body that was left at Health Services.

167
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,960
- How recent?
- Two months.

168
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,590
OK, have LAPD send over a perimeter team.
Tell 'em hands off until Chase and I get there.

169
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,429
Got it.

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,749
Chase! Let's go. We're on.

171
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,196
- Get an address?
- Yeah.

172
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,879
Make sure they don't go in
until Jack gets there.

173
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,593
Hey.

174
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,360
- Peter just told me you got an address.
- Yeah.

175
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,272
- I'm bringing it over now.
- There's nothing more recent?

176
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,318
We could look for another hour
and not find anything better.

177
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,797
We don't have an hour to waste, do we?
Put transmitters on Jack and Chase.

178
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I wanna analyse their interactions
so we can work it up in real time.

179
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,957
OK.

180
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,560
- Jack.
- What have you got?

181
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,916
Here's the address
where Goss was arrested for dealing.

182
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,118
- How recent?
- Two months ago. It's all in the file.

183
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,116
Good.

184
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,033
Medical kit.
Health Services had us put it together.

185
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,635
Thanks, baby.

186
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,035
Be careful.

187
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,116
Let's go, Chase!

188
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,960
We'll have to wait till we get there
to see the setup.

189
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,554
LAPD is locking it down now.

190
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,954
I know Kim told you about us. I was gonna
tell you, I just couldn't find the right time.

191
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,512
We thought you should know.
It's getting serious.

192
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,630
That's what she said.

193
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,558
- And what did CTU have to say?
- That it could be a very dangerous situation.

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could
happen if this virus is released. It's not good.

195
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,716
Give CTU carte blanche.
Whatever they need, make sure they get it.

196
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,395
- I did.
- We should cancel the debate.

197
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,398
- What?
- It's a mistake to continue prepping

198
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,312
- while there's an imminent bioterrorist threat.
- We don't know that it's imminent, David.

199
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,757
And you know just as well as I do
that we get threats every day.

200
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,440
Not like this one. They said the body
was infected with a weaponised virus.

201
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,556
OK, let's say you're right.

202
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,840
What do you really think you could do
if you put your full attention on it?

203
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,755
I want to make sure you're not advising me
out of fear my image will suffer if we cancel.

204
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
Oh, no, it will suffer.

205
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,919
But I still think the best thing to do
is to proceed as planned

206
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,233
and respond when we have more information.

207
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,395
(car door)

208
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,153
Keeler's here.

209
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,676
- Come on. Let's go in this way.
- Don't worry, Wayne.

210
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,432
- John.
- Mr President.

211
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,040
- You didn't have to come to welcome me.
- It's no trouble.

212
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,157
(Keeler) I spoke with
your friend Jacob Weiss yesterday.

213
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,040
- (Palmer) You stopped in South Dakota?
- Just for dinner.

214
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,431
- How's he feeling?
- Better. He's playing a few rounds of golf.

215
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,593
That's him.
Well, I don't want to keep you, John.

216
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,355
You have last-minute cramming to do
if you want to survive this debate.

217
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,840
I won't argue with you there. Your
research staff outnumbers mine three to one.

218
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,035
I have to do
some of the shoe leather myself.

219
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,196
Touch Á.

220
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,871
- I'll see you inside, sir.
- You certainly will.

221
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,400
- (Wayne) No one, I mean no one, hears...
- (Palmer) Wayne.

222
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,240
We're ready.

223
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,118
I'll give you a call, all right?

224
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,440
What were you talking to him about?

225
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,670
I think we may have an opportunity.

226
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,910
What kind of opportunity?

227
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,674
Not now. After.

228
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,078
I'm sorry if you think
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

229
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,078
But I can't help the way I feel.

230
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Chase, why do you think I put Kim at CTU?
Behind a desk, working at a computer?

231
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,112
So I can keep an eye on her. Make sure she's
safe. Not so she can date some field agent.

232
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Safe? You're talking about her like she's 12.
She's a grown woman.

233
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,835
Dammit, you've seen
what this job can do to you.

234
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
- It's ruined every relationship I've ever had.
- That's you, Jack.

235
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,638
No! No!

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,872
- It's the job.
- I don't think so.

237
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,316
You don't think so.
What the hell do you know?

238
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,153
My wife died because of this job.

239
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,916
And I almost lost Kim, too.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

240
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,359
I will do everything I have to to protect her,
do you understand me? Everything.

241
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,834
Dammit, Chase. You cannot have
a normal life and do this job at the same time.

242
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,080
You're saying I shouldn't
have a relationship with anyone?

243
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,674
That's exactly what I'm saying.

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,440
And especially with my daughter.

245
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,916
(phone rings)

246
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,029
This is Bauer.

247
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,480
- Jack, it's Luis.
- What's up?

248
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I tried to move Salazar to solitary. There was
a lock on it from Division. What's that about?

249
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,315
- I can't tell you right now.
- He murdered his attorney right in front of us.

250
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,280
What the hell is Division doing
protecting him?

251
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,874
- They're not protecting him.
- Then what?

252
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,680
- I can't get into it right now.
- Can't go into it?

253
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,592
You're not the only one who gave up
his life to put this guy away.

254
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,830
I need to be in the loop, Jack.

255
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Jack?

256
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,713
This doesn't go anywhere
after you hang up the phone.

257
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,518
What?

258
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,638
- Salazar might walk.
- Walk? What're you talking about?

259
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,880
I don't think it's gonna get to that. Someone
on the outside's got a lot of leverage.

260
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,518
Who?

261
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,638
I think it's his brother Hector.

262
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,080
- I don't believe this.
- Just hang tight.

263
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,551
- I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
- Yeah, all right.

264
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
You better start thinking about
what we're going to do when we get there.

265
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,594
- We'll talk about this later.
- Fine.

266
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,869
Open the door. Let's go.

267
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,117
- Open 12.
- (man over radio) Opening 12.

268
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,630
Step forward. Let's go.

269
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,872
Luis,  ïya has encontrado nuevo abogado?

270
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,072
No, I haven't found you a new lawyer.

271
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,236
- How about an execution date?
- Someone's not happy.

272
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,517
- What do you know, Ram Ãn?
- About?

273
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,148
(coughs)

274
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,080
- Talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

275
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,469
What is your brother trying to do?

276
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,948
Hector?
Have you heard from him? How is he?

277
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,190
His birthday's coming up next week.
I don't even know what to get him.

278
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,558
You keep talking trash, man,
you're not going anywhere.

279
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
Maybe not.
But let me assure you of one thing.

280
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,917
If something does happen,
and I am unexpectedly allowed to go free,

281
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,670
I have no doubt
that you'll come looking for me.

282
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,314
Especially after the death of your wife Elyse.

283
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,719
And your two boys. What are their names?
Tom Às and Luis Jr?

284
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,834
- There's no follow-up call from the terrorists?
- No.

285
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
So there's nothing to report to the president?

286
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,709
Not till I hear from Bauer.
He's following up on the Goss lead right now.

287
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,316
All right, Tony. Thanks.

288
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
So, if you'll excuse me,
until this evening's debate. Thank you.

289
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,270
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
for all of your questions.

290
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
- That went well.
- Yes, it did.

291
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,278
- So what's the latest?
- Nothing yet.

292
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,392
CTU's trying to figure out
who dropped off the dead body.

293
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
We still don't know who's behind this?

294
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,237
They're still speculating
that it's Salazar's brother.

295
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,873
What they don't know is if it's a bluff
staged to release Salazar.

296
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
How can it be a bluff?
The virus has been confirmed.

297
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,400
Yes, but dropping off a dead body is one
thing. Being able to infect an entire city,

298
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,356
that's something different.

299
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,360
All right.
I guess we'll know soon enough.

300
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,000
OK.

301
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,831
Hey, Wayne.

302
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,788
- You spoke earlier about an opportunity.
- Yeah.

303
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,795
Yeah, I'm not really sure that's something
we need to discuss right now.

304
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,400
Which means whatever it is fell through.

305
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,358
Or I won't like it,
so you're proceeding without me.

306
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
No, that's not it.
I just think that, because of this threat,

307
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't want to divert your attention.

308
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,515
I can walk and chew gum at the same time.
What is it?

309
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,759
Keeler's playbook.
What if I can get us a copy?

310
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,800
- What exactly do you mean by playbook?
- His entire prep for tonight's debate.

311
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,588
How he's gonna answer the questions, what
issues he's gonna try and trip you up on.

312
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,479
Everything.

313
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,790
- And how would we get it?
- You don't need to know the details.

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
- I'm surprised.
- About what?

315
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,200
The question. You know there's no way
on earth that I would ever agree to this.

316
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
David, I'm not...

317
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,788
I am not talking about
pulling a Sherry and stealing it.

318
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,000
It may just drop in our laps
and, if it does, why shouldn't we look at it?

319
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,551
Wayne.
You are not in the private sector any more.

320
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,439
You have to get used to
how my administration works.

321
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,828
I am just trying
to give your administration four more years.

322
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,958
OK. OK, if that's how you want it.

323
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,875
That's how I want it.

324
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,957
(woman) All right, we're just about to start.
Can you all please take your seats here?

325
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,120
- Kim. Are you all caught up?
- Pretty much.

326
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,839
I just have to refresh the data
on my dad's panel.

327
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,951
Great.

328
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,796
Can I ask you a question
about you and Tony?

329
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,111
Me and Tony what?

330
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,720
I don't know, I was just wondering.
Is it... a problem?

331
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,792
Working with your husband
in the same office?

332
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,676
No. No, it's not a problem. Why do you ask?

333
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
- It's not a big deal.
- No, it's OK, we have a minute.

334
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,194
Well, l, um...

335
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,191
been dating Chase
and I don't think my dad's too happy about it.

336
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,432
I see. Well, um...

337
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,559
I'm sure your dad's just trying to protect you.
But, ultimately,

338
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,120
it's just between you and Chase.

339
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,634
Yeah, I know.

340
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,193
- Let me know when you finish those panels.
- Sure.

341
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,514
Hey.

342
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,433
Analysis just called. If Hector Salazar's
orchestrated this biothreat,

343
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,320
he's probably operating out of Northern
Mexico. We need a list of his properties.

344
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,915
Chloe's going through the files
Jack turned in after the bust.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,673
All right. I'll talk to her.

346
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,835
Fire up all our contacts there in case Hector
has shown his face in the last couple of days.

347
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,594
OK.

348
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
- Is the boy still in place?
- Yeah.

349
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,070
And the president's been informed?

350
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,788
Yeah, and he's not cancelling the debate.

351
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
He's got some cojones, I'll give him that.

352
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,996
Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when
there's a couple of million lives on the line.

353
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,033
S Ãlo quiero lo mejor para ti
y no quiero preocuparme.

354
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Papa, no tengo miedo.
S Á lo que estoy haciendo.

355
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,469
No sabes, hija.

356
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,720
Soy suficiente grande
para hacer mis propias decisiones.

357
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,199
Claudia!

358
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,112
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

359
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,395
Don't tell me nothing.

360
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,514
- Why you argue with your father?
- Please, Hector. It doesn't matter.

361
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,557
He's not happy with how I live my life.

362
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,269
He doesn't like you being with me?

363
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,278
-  ßOriol!
- Si, se Íor.

364
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,358
(in Spanish)

365
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,913
Don't raise your voice
to your father ever again.

366
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,309
Claudia, no!

367
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,069
How I conduct myself with my father
is my concern. Not yours.

368
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,318
Good. Now that's settled.

369
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
Tell Luc Âa to prepare supper. OK?

370
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,076
We eat early tonight.

371
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,360
OK, I'll tell him.

372
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,351
(phone rings)

373
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,920
- Almeida.
- I just got off the phone with Jack.

374
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,160
- Theyjust arrived.
- Is there a problem?

375
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,515
- Jack won't use the transmitters.
- Why not?

376
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,960
He says it would take too long
to wire them up.

377
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,035
Whatever. Look, any information he digs up,
I want it right away. You got it?

378
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,960
OK. You don't have to yell.

379
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,160
No one's yelling, Chloe. We got
a body infected with a deadly virus.

380
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,038
We have to tie it to Salazar
in the next three hours.

381
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,360
Right now, Jack's location is our only lead.
So I need you to keep me up to the minute.

382
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,157
- Understood?
- I said OK.

383
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,593
Good. Then get on it.

384
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,160
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah. You Bauer?

385
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,799
This is my partner Chase Edmunds.
What's the activity?

386
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,160
- No one's gone in or out since we got here.
- What's the layout?

387
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,390
Probably 30 people.
Spread out on all floors.

388
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,155
The apartment you asked us to case
is the corner one, third floor.

389
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,799
- You didn't go in?
- Orders were to wait till you got here.

390
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,799
- Good.
- How much backup you want?

391
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,869
- None. I want your men to cover the exits.
- There's 30 scumbags in there.

392
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
We don't want to set off any alarms.
We can sneak in without a fight.

393
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,032
- Sure about that?
- (Jack) Yeah.

394
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,550
Keep this on channel one.
We'll tell you when we want you to come in.

395
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,149
- Let's go.
- You got it.

396
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,479
( "3000 Miles" by Hawaii)

397
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,833
- This area's not open to the public.
- Take it easy, sport.

398
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,356
- We just want a little information.
- Beat it.

399
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,391
- Zach, cops!
- Go, Chase!

400
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,272
Get back!

401
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,233
Cover me.

402
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,158
(Jack) Reloading!

403
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,989
Chase, we got a runner!

404
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,756
- Don't even think about it!
- I'm clean! You've got nothing on me!

405
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,549
Shut up, stupid.
You just fired at a federal agent.

406
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,200
You better start talking to me.
Or I will let you bleed to death here.

407
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,591
- Chase! I got him. We're down here.
- Fisher, we're good. We got our suspect.

408
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,879
- Who is David Goss?
- He's a dealer. I score from him sometimes.

409
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,953
- Not any more. He's dead.
- OK. He's dead.

410
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,429
Don't be a smartass. Who was his supplier?

411
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,151
Who was his supplier?

412
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,352
Chase.

413
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,200
A guy named Carlos Corretja.
He works outta Tijuana.

414
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,192
Corretja was one of
Salazar's mid-level distributors.

415
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,678
- You doing business with him?
- I'm calling him tonight.

416
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Corretja wanted me to find a mule.
Someone clean, without a record.

417
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,312
- What for?
- To move a bag of coke across the border.

418
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,198
- It didn't make any sense to me.
- Why not?

419
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
He paid ten grand to bring it up.

420
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,510
- Coke isn't even worth that much.
- Where's the bag of coke now?

421
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,995
The guy who brought it across still has it.

422
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,078
- What's his name?
- His name is Kyle. Kyle Singer.

423
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
(man, indistinct) Sorry, Helen...

424
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,273
- What is... what is this?
- It's the final notice.

425
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,675
If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow, 8am,

426
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,236
I'm calling City Services
and they start the eviction process.

427
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,678
(Helen) Don, don't do this. Please.
I'm gonna have it in a couple of days.

428
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,636
(Don) I can't carry you...

429
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,638
( "Suddenly"
by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club)

430
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll be back.

431
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,069
- Kyle.
- How much do you owe him, Ma?

432
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,880
- Stay out of this.
- How much?

433
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,193
$1800. And don't you worry about it, because
your father is gonna talk to Uncle Sandford.

434
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,910
Hey, 1800, right?

435
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,716
Here.

436
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,839
From now on if you have a problem,
talk to me or my dad. OK?

437
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,796
Leave my mom out of it.

438
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,310
I expect a receipt in the mailbox.

439
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,670
- Where did you get that money?
- It doesn't matter. We needed it, I got it.

440
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,638
Can I have everybody's attention, please?

441
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,910
Everyone should work up
the name Kyle Singer.

442
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,755
I want point sheets from department heads
on my desk in five minutes.

443
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,080
Everything about Kyle Singer, I want it.

444
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,959
Where he lives, works and, most importantly,
where he's likely to be now.

445
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,478
Keep an open channel to Field Ops so Chloe
can forward anything that comes in to Jack.

446
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,879
Let's go.

447
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,319
- What are you doing?
- Narrowing the search space.

448
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,880
I can't believe you're this stupid, Kyle.

449
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,880
This is how you're gonna help your family?
By dealing drugs?

450
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,113
I'm not dealing 'em. It's a stupid delivery. It's
quick money which my folks need right now.

451
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,910
Where are they gonna get
the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle?

452
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,036
You're right.

453
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,869
It was stupid. I know that.

454
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,189
But I did it. I'm in this now.

455
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,274
I'm in the middle of this.

456
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,238
Look, I'm gonna make
this delivery tonight, all right?

457
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,669
And I promise it's gonna be over.
I promise you.

458
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,672
I'm not waiting until tonight. It's over now.

459
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,553
What you talkin' about?

460
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,311
I can't be with someone
who does stuff like this.

461
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,075
I'm sorry, Kyle.

462
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,277
Hold on. Linda!

463
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,553
- Come on, Linda, please!
- It's over, Kyle.

464
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,999
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

465
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,480
- Look... we just had a disagreement.
- Where did you get the money to pay Don?

466
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,677
- Mom, forget about it, please.
- What's your dad gonna say?

467
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,039
He's not gonna take
"forget about it" as an answer.

468
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,874
I don't know.

469
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,632
(door slams)

470
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,910
- Would you excuse us, please?
- David.

471
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,069
- Sorry, Anne. Our schedule's been way off.
- I thought you couldn't join me.

472
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,588
I can't. I only have a couple of minutes.
I'm having your security level upgraded.

473
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
- I'm gonna need your advice today.
- What's going on?

474
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,431
What do you know
about type lll pneumonic viruses?

475
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,594
Not a lot, they're fairly new.
As far as I know, there are several strains.

476
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Most of them are fast-acting
and all are deadly.

477
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,560
- Someone's threatening to release a virus.
- Oh, God.

478
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,916
I need you to talk to a Dr Sunny Macer
at National Health Services.

479
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,594
Yeah, I know Sunny. But, David,

480
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,760
if you think there's a remote possibility
that this thing is for real,

481
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,796
you need to get outta Los Angeles.

482
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
That's not possible.
The debate is in little over two hours.

483
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,160
You're talking about an outbreak
here in the city.

484
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,039
This isn't something
the Secret Service can protect you against.

485
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,760
I know. I know. And we are prepared
to leave if the situation warrants it.

486
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,551
But right now, I need you to talk to Dr Macer
and learn everything you can about this thing.

487
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,309
- I will.
- It's OK. It's all right.

488
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,716
(knock at door)

489
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,916
Yes.

490
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,593
- Your brother would like to see you, sir.
- Send him in.

491
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,752
He's downstairs.
He requests that you come see him.

492
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,196
- Come see him?
- Yes, sir. He has something to show you.

493
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,952
You go ahead. I'm gonna call Sunny.

494
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,155
See you later.

495
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,430
(Jack) No, I'm gonna check that out myself.

496
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,960
Chase is bringing the suspect into CTU. I
want you to set up a white room for him now.

497
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,394
- Take Parker to CTU.
- What about Singer?

498
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,360
I'll take care of Singer.
You take care of Parker.

499
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,193
Anybody can take him to CTU.
I'm going with you.

500
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,352
- No, you're not.
- Why are you trying to get rid of me?

501
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,960
I'm not. I think Parker's got more information.
I want you to get it out of him.

502
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,589
Is it about Kim? Are you punishing me
for dating your daughter?

503
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,360
If that kid's got a bag of cocaine that's
got the virus in it and he doesn't know it,

504
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,560
- I need to stop him putting it into circulation.
- I know. That's why I wanna help you.

505
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,279
- You can't. It's too dangerous.
- Too dangerous?

506
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,960
You can't have it both ways, Chase.

507
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,999
My daughter loves you. You wanna be with
her, I have to stop putting you in danger.

508
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,038
You're kidding, right?

509
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,038
Take Parker to CTU. That's an order.

510
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,916
- Yeah. Call you right back.
- (man) All right. Same number.

511
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,110
Excuse us for a minute.

512
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,794
What is it, Wayne?

513
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,193
Don't be angry,
but I got a copy of Keeler's playbook.

514
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,760
- I told you to drop that.
- Will you listen to me?

515
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,912
If you don't want to use it, then don't.
But there is something you need to see.

516
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
There's nothing I need to see.

517
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,554
It's about Anne.

518
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,191
Keeler's too smart
to play the race card orthe girlfriend card.

519
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,917
It's neither one of those,
which is why I'm bringing this to you.

520
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,591
It's something that we didn't know about her.

521
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,315
Something that, if true, could...

522
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,752
David, it could damage all of us.

523
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,590
Just take a look at it.

524
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,876
(phone rings)

525
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,920
Yeah.

526
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,672
Give me an update.

527
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,720
- Kyle's still in his house.
- What about the package?

528
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,915
- It's with him.
- And Ram Ãn?

529
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,078
- Just waiting to come home.
- Good.

530
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,915
- Gael. Chloe's been looking for you.
- Where is she?

531
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,309
- She's in lT.
- All right.
