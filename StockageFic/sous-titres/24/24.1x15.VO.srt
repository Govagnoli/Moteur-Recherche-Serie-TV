1
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,371
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate,

2
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,921
my wife and daughter are in danger,

3
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:24,688
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,762
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,

5
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,651
and this is the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:39,127
There's an ambulance waiting to take you
to a clinic where a doctor will examine you.

7
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:42,603
- Can't we stay with you?
- No, sweetheart, I've gotta stay at CTU.

8
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:47,922
I have to place you under house arrest. You'll
be held here until we hand you to the FBl.

9
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:52,484
Unfortunately, as you know, our procedures
don't allow for any deviation from protocol.

10
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,530
I can't reinstate you, Jack.

11
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:57,323
I was raped.

12
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:02,043
- Excuse me, Dr Kent. Teri, we need to go.
- I'm sorry, we're not finished here yet.

13
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,489
We need to move them
to the safe house now, rather than wait.

14
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:08,371
They're leaving now.

15
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:11,646
We have to leave the state this afternoon.

16
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,009
They've done a threat assessment.
It's too dangerous for us to stay.

17
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,653
- You asked me to check out Jack Bauer.
- Who is he?

18
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:21,521
- He was in the Special Forces.
- That's what it was. The Drazen Mission.

19
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,605
- Senator Palmer, can I help you?
- I'm here to see Jack Bauer.

20
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,728
- Mr Drazen, I can fix it foryou.
- I appreciate the offer, Kevin,

21
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,611
but plan B is already in effect.

22
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,805
Can you get this to Mrs Palmer?
I didn't have time to pack it.

23
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,532
- Aren't you coming?
- No, I'm taking a later flight.

24
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,532
- Elizabeth.
- I can't stay long, Alexis.

25
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,922
Then we shouldn't waste any time.

26
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,009
I can go over your head, Mr Almeida.

27
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,687
And I assure you, there will be consequences.

28
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,412
I apologise, Senator, but we do have protocol.

29
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,405
Our director, Ryan Chapelle,
is working on a clearance.

30
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:37,772
- But if I could tell him why you're here...
- All he needs to know is I need to see Bauer.

31
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,764
And I need to do it now.

32
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:44,133
- Can I get you anything while...?
- No.

33
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,207
Chapelle.

34
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:09,571
I don't think I can stall him much longer.
He wants to know why he can't see Jack.

35
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:12,008
What did you tell him?

36
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:14,687
Well, I told him you were workin' on it.

37
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,172
- And he still didn't say why he was here?
- No. He just wants to see Jack.

38
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:23,401
Well, until I know more,
I don't wanna put those two together.

39
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,291
- I'm checking it out now.
- All right.

40
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:34,685
- So? You find out what Palmer's doin' here?
- Not yet.

41
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:39,369
- Any new intel on the backup shooters?
- Yeah, uh, an Alexis Drazen.

42
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,447
Looks like he's connected to two other
shooters, but he stopped in DC for two days

43
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,967
before landing in LAX on Saturday.

44
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,931
There's other inconsistencies.
I'm working on it.

45
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:52,050
- Where's the report?
- I routed it to Nina's computer.

46
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,363
- Send me a copy, would ya?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:04,571
Weren't we supposed to answer
some questions at Jack's office?

48
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:08,123
- We're gonna do that at the safe house now.
- Is my dad gonna be there?

49
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:11,650
Not right away.
Maybe when he's done at CTU.

50
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,486
- Are we OK, Nina?
- Everything's fine.

51
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,890
A small, controlled environment
is the most secure place for you.

52
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,931
- Does Jack know you're taking us?
- Of course. Myers.

53
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:27,768
We're moving Teri and Kim to the
safe house now. We should be there soon.

54
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,332
Mom...

55
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,688
you never told me what the doctor said.

56
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,412
No, I'm not worried about that.

57
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,768
It was a cyst that burst.

58
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,048
She said it wasn't serious.

59
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:44,365
- Then why did she...?
- There's nothing to worry about.

60
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:47,047
She said it would go away all by itself.

61
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:53,723
Gaines first contacted me on my cellphone,

62
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,566
directing me to a car
parked at St Mark's Hospital.

63
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:01,249
- The transmitter was in the car?
- That's when he asked me to put it in my ear.

64
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,327
Can we take a break? Could you find out how
my wife and daughter are doing at the clinic?

65
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:10,571
- Teri and Kim have already left the clinic.
- What?

66
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:13,326
They're fine.
Nina's moving them to a safe house.

67
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:17,042
You knew they were moving my wife
and daughter and you didn't tell me?

68
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,841
That's it. This is over.

69
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,403
I don't say another word.
I wanna speak to Chapelle.

70
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,685
Now, Alberta!

71
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,804
You're exhausting.

72
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:41,683
I was surprised you called last night.

73
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,131
I didn't think I'd see you again after DC.

74
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,927
I'm not really that easy, you know.

75
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:54,365
Will you have another break later in the day?

76
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:06,486
The senator has to leave town this afternoon,
and he's going to... Nevada.

77
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:13,005
Only a few of us were told about it, and I am
one of the ones who has to go with him.

78
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,805
- You have to hold his hand?
- In so many words.

79
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:23,647
Would it be too much to hope that
you might have some free time in Nevada?

80
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,968
You would wanna come?

81
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,408
If you want me.

82
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,809
This is a pretty big shower.
There's room enough for two.

83
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,884
I'm on my way.

84
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:56,972
- Alan.
- Senator Palmer, what can I do foryou?

85
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,726
I'm trying to talk to
a CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

86
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:02,452
- Where are you?
- CTU, Los Angeles.

87
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:05,491
They say I need clearance,
but it's taking forever.

88
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:09,361
- Not a problem. Who's in charge over there?
- Ryan Chapelle.

89
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,445
Yeah. OK, I'll take care ofthis right away.

90
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,728
Thank you, Alan. I owe you.

91
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,250
Senator Palmer, Ryan Chapelle.

92
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:25,921
What seems to be the problem, Ryan?
Why can't I get in to see Agent Bauer?

93
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,688
Please forgive the wait. When an agent
is under internal investigation,

94
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:33,448
procedure is to keep him isolated
until he's been fully interrogated.

95
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,093
It's... really out of my hands.

96
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,802
Even if I can help you
with your investigation?

97
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:43,364
Mr Chapelle? Alan Optican from
the Pentagon's on the line for you.

98
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,164
Excuse me.

99
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:49,692
- Chapelle.
- This is Optican, Department ofDefense.

100
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,206
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:55,445
Senator Palmer is to be given carte blanche.
Make sure he gets whatever he needs.

102
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:56,761
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

103
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,367
- Of course, sir.
- Thankyou.

104
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:02,047
Bring Jack Bauer down here right away.

105
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:13,649
Thanks... for helping me...
cut through the red tape.

106
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,606
Mm-hm.

107
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,766
I want all your cameras
and recording equipment shut down.

108
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:23,486
This is going to be a private conversation.

109
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:26,770
I understand. I'll make sure
the room is secure.

110
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,564
Thank you.

111
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:34,806
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

112
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:39,729
Listen, Nina called and wanted me
to tell you that Teri and Kim are fine.

113
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,407
- Who's guardin' the house?
- Paulson and Breeher.

114
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,846
OK, good.

115
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:47,209
Also, Chapelle wants to see you
in the conference room.

116
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,885
Good.

117
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,928
- Thanks a lot, Tony.
- You got it.

118
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:04,531
Milo, I'm sorry I had to switch the cards
on you last night. I had no choice.

119
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:07,207
We understand what you were goin' through.

120
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,284
Thanks for your help.

121
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,769
Senator Palmer.

122
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,844
Leave us.

123
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,924
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,004
Close the door.

125
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:31,287
Sit.

126
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,724
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,003
I wanna know who's working with you.

128
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:44,008
- In which context, sir? I'm sorry, I don't...
- Right here, right now. We're gonna end this.

129
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:47,005
- I don't know what they told you...
- I know why you want me dead.

130
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:50,369
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Kosovo!

131
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,843
- Kosovo?
- I know you hold me responsible

132
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:59,085
for the men you lost there
two years ago today.

133
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:03,963
- You know about Operation Nightfall?
- I authorised the mission.

134
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:08,922
I know you took out Victor Drazen and his
inner circle. And lost six men in the process.

135
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:11,562
- And you think I want revenge?
- Yes, I do.

136
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,362
With all due respect,
I almost died today trying to protect you.

137
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:18,843
And if I blame anyone for the death
of my men in Kosovo, I blame myself.

138
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:22,892
- What were you doin' at the power plant?
- I was trying to...

139
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,487
The reason I went for that agent's gun, sir,

140
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:32,805
was to try and get you out of the room
without giving myself away.

141
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,571
The people that want you dead
had kidnapped my family.

142
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:41,852
They threatened to kill them if I didn't
assist them in the assassination attempt.

143
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:48,205
They didn't tell you any of this
when you came in, did they, sir?

144
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,885
No.

145
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:03,523
It's the truth. You can verify it with Chapelle.

146
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:27,802
- OK, they're just arriving at the safe house.
- Copy that. Show visual.

147
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,684
This way, Mrs Bauer.

148
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:44,448
These are Agents Paulson and Breeher.
They've worked with Jack for many years.

149
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,931
- This is Jack's wife, Teri, and daughter, Kim.
- Hi.

150
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,891
Hi, Kim. Where do you want us?

151
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,964
One in and one out.

152
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:08,411
Well, it's not exactly home,
but it's relatively comfortable.

153
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,491
There are motion detectors every ten yards.

154
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:23,522
- How long do we have to stay here?
- We'll worry about that after we debrief you.

155
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:28,004
- Nina, where's the bathroom?
- There's one in each bedroom, through there.

156
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:32,291
If you'd both like to clean up
before we get started, please do.

157
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:20,848
I was the head of the Special Defense
Appropriations Committee in the Senate,

158
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,209
which is just a euphemism
for covert operations.

159
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,648
Three years ago,
the CIA brought to my attention

160
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,964
atrocities committed by
Victor Drazen in Kosovo.

161
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:34,248
Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing.

162
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,564
The man was a monster,
and was gaining support.

163
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:43,282
I tried to go through the usual channels, but
I couldn't get anyone to work quickly enough.

164
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:47,605
So I contacted the one person
I knew who could get the job done,

165
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,491
have him terminated, off the books.

166
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:53,804
- And that would be Robert Ellis.
- That's right.

167
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,764
Ellis was funded through
a discretionary fund of my committee.

168
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:03,927
His job was to implement the covert missions
and see to it that no names were leaked.

169
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,561
Now we're both on somebody's list.

170
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:13,289
So this is payback for
what happened that day.

171
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:15,648
It's the only thing that makes sense.

172
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:19,169
But if someone could put your name
and my name on a list together,

173
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:23,041
that means they should be
able to find Robert Ellis, too.

174
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,248
You're right.

175
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,964
Four sixes.

176
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,084
Let's see 'em.

177
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,167
I knew it! I saw it in your eyes!

178
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:49,450
If you could read what's in my eyes,
you'd crawl under a rock and cry.

179
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:56,244
Go again.

180
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,725
- Ellis.
- Bobby, it's David Palmer.

181
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,692
- You gotta be kidding.
- I'm not. I'm here with Jack Bauer.

182
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,530
Get lost.

183
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:20,802
What are you doin' with Bauer? I went to a lot
of trouble to make sure you two never met.

184
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:24,602
Someone close to Victor Drazen
seems to have connected us.

185
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:27,571
- Explain.
- Someone wants me dead.

186
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:30,292
And it appears they want Bauer, too. Today.

187
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,247
The two-year anniversary of Nightfall.

188
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,370
I'm the only one who knows
you both were involved.

189
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:40,810
Apparently not. And if we're
on the list, it's likely you are, too.

190
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:43,248
- Let me talk to Bauer.
- I'm right here, Bob.

191
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,764
- Jack. You still at CTU?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,408
To source this we need each other's help.

193
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:53,202
Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours,
I've had to cut a few corners.

194
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:56,126
I'm being investigated right now.
My hands are tied.

195
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:59,205
Well, get them untied.
David can help you there.

196
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,524
It has to be someone either
connected to your team...

197
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:05,889
No. No one on my team knew
of the senator's involvement.

198
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,203
Well, then it has to be Drazen's group.

199
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:14,129
I'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall. It'll
contain the names of Drazen's associates.

200
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:18,001
That'll take a few minutes. Meantime,
you need to pick up a trail on the money.

201
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,881
Odds are it's funded through Belgium. Can
you get to your K-3 accounts from there?

202
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,965
- Yes, if I get reinstated.
- All right, start there.

203
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,490
We'll compare names when we talk again.
Where can I reach you?

204
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,962
CTU, Los Angeles office.

205
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,611
All right.

206
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:21,010
Teri?

207
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:24,605
- Yes?
- I put some clean clothes on the bed.

208
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,724
Thank you.

209
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:42,441
They called me and said you decided
not to fly out. Aren't we going to Nevada?

210
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:47,004
Apparently not. The senator needed to do
something. He thought we'd be safest here.

211
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,732
- Are you taking a later flight?
- I don't know. I hope so.

212
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:52,771
Call the Times. Tell them
I'll do that phoner, 45 minutes.

213
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,445
Sure.

214
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:13,128
- Hello.
- You miss me yet?

215
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:16,011
- Of course.
- I hope you didn't bookyour flight to Nevada.

216
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:19,085
I was just about to. Why?

217
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:21,963
We might not be going.

218
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:25,087
- When will you know?
- In about an hour.

219
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:29,766
If you stay in town,
will you remain at the hotel?

220
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:33,129
I don't know. They might
switch us for security reasons.

221
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,727
Either way, I'll let you know where I am.

222
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:39,683
I can still smellyour perfume on my skin.

223
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,802
I'll call you as soon as I know.

224
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,208
- Is that the girl?
- Yes.

225
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,487
Palmer might not be leaving after all.

226
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,287
- Better for us.
- Mm-hm.

227
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:56,252
Was there any problem
getting rid of Gaines's people?

228
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,925
No.

229
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:02,329
You should never have used him.
I told you it was a mistake.

230
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:06,441
Fine. You fixed the mistake,
now let's move on.

231
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,683
She looks like Martina.

232
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,408
Our sister's dead, Andre.

233
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,885
Leave it alone.

234
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:34,327
- Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko?
- They have their targets in sight.

235
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:39,123
And as for Palmer, I give you my word
he will be dead by midnight.

236
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:51,446
- Hey. Do you have any toothpaste?
- Yeah, it's right there.

237
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:05,284
That's nothing. The doctor just
wanted me to take it as a precaution.

238
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,888
You scared me.

239
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,611
Kim.

240
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,285
What?

241
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,044
You're pregnant.

242
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:31,489
I don't understand. What happened today...
How is that possible?

243
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:35,202
It was Dad, of course,
but a test like this, it takes time before...

244
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,727
You were trying to have a kid
and didn't tell me?

245
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:40,452
No, honey, it wasn't like that.

246
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,444
Kim. Kim!

247
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,771
- What?
- Please!

248
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,209
This is just as much
a shock to me as it is to you.

249
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:52,206
Dad and I use birth control.
It's protection, but it's never 100%.

250
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,568
Whatever. You don't need my permission.

251
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,770
I'm not asking for your permission, Kimberly.

252
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:04,207
Once in a while, you have to think about
what another person is going through.

253
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:06,761
Honey, I just found out I'm pregnant.

254
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,442
You don't think that terrifies me?

255
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,924
Well, it does.

256
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,926
Mom...

257
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,004
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,563
Are there any other names
on the HK list thatyou recognise?

259
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:42,602
- Rich Goen, Michael Redman. That's it.
- No, they weren't cleared until after the op.

260
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:45,526
- I'll use what we have so far.
- I shouldn't be here.

261
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:47,922
- Green's got me on priority.
- I cleared it.

262
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:50,329
- OK, Bob, he's here.
- Milo.

263
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:53,811
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Don't worry about me.

264
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:57,770
Ah, I see you opened some sockets up to Ml5.

265
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:00,003
- How did you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

266
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,210
We're tryin' to hook up some names.
I'm gonna help you.

267
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:06,365
Now, what's your login ID and password?

268
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,444
Give it to him.

269
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:12,243
The login ID is LFN.

270
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:16,243
Password's foothill 94022.

271
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,324
Lower case.

272
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,884
OK, hang on.

273
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,971
OK, looks like we got some partial results.

274
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,682
- Partial?
- Yeah. Looks like there's something missing.

275
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:29,922
What do you mean, Bob?

276
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,889
Something's been removed.

277
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:38,248
I'll look into it.

278
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:43,327
Meanwhile, Milo, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna send a file to your server.

279
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:48,762
Why don't you print out
hard copies for Jack and David?

280
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:51,242
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks, Milo.

281
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:07,004
All right, here we go.

282
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:12,041
Feels like I haven't eaten in years.

283
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,642
Feels good, doesn't it?
Not being afraid any more.

284
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,325
Yeah.

285
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,409
I'm sorry, Mom, I was being
really stupid before.

286
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:32,962
So, when are you gonna tell Dad?

287
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:39,084
You know what?

288
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,644
Right now. Come on.

289
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,685
Um...

290
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,366
- CTU. Almeida.
- Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling.

291
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:03,889
- Could I talk to Jack, please?
- Hi, Teri. Actually, it's a bad time.

292
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:09,366
- He's... he's kinda busy right now.
- Could you tell him to call? It's important.

293
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:11,091
Sure.

294
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:17,450
- I really want to hear his reaction.
- I'm so lucky to have you.

295
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,371
Aw, baby.

296
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:31,289
Hi. Sorry, but we need to start the debrief.
CTU's eager to find out what you know.

297
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:32,886
- We're ready, huh?
- Yeah.

298
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,728
- Great. I'd like to start with just you, Teri.
- Fine.

299
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:45,966
- I think I'm gonna go to my room.
- That's a good idea. You should try and rest.

300
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:51,363
This is standard procedure.
We're gonna put you on videotape.

301
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:53,250
OK.

302
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,884
- Yeah?
- Hi, Rick?

303
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:25,402
Hey.

304
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,484
- Kim.
- Are you OK?

305
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:30,208
Yeah. I just lost a little blood.

306
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,171
You need to see a doctor.
You don't sound good.

307
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:37,690
- I just need a few days' rest.
- Turn yourself in. You can get medical help.

308
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,082
And I'll also get arrested.

309
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:43,404
- But you helped us escape. I'll tell them that.
- No!

310
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,763
Don't tell them anything about me.

311
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:52,884
Well, it's too late. My mom's already being
questioned. They're gonna ask about you.

312
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:55,362
I'm next. I can't lie.

313
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,444
OK. Don't.

314
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:02,925
Tell them that I didn't know
anything about what was goin' on

315
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,732
and that Dan threatened me, he had a gun.

316
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:10,805
OK, but promise me you'll turn yourself in.

317
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:16,364
I gotta think this through. I'm not like you,
Kim. I don't come from a good family.

318
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:21,402
- System's not gonna give me a break.
- It's your only way out of this, Rick.

319
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:24,485
I brought you to Gaines. That's kidnapping.

320
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:28,370
They could put me in jail
for the rest of my life.

321
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:44,284
What's incredible is that none of this has
anything to do with me running for president.

322
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:49,242
It has nothing to do with... the primary.

323
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:55,005
It has nothing to do with my being black.

324
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,567
It's just revenge for
taking out... Victor Drazen.

325
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:05,566
Yes, sir.

326
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,802
- Hello.
- David, it's Sherry.

327
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,965
- Oh, hi. Are you back at the hotel?
- Yes. Where are you?

328
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:18,567
I'm at CTU, a government agency.

329
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,245
Why?

330
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:25,769
- There's some things I have to take care of.
- David, what's going on?

331
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:30,407
I'm trying to find out
who's attempting to kill me, Sherry.

332
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:34,168
- I've got to go. Wait for me at the hotel. OK?
- OK.

333
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,845
Bye.

334
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,684
Just doesn't stop.

335
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,892
I'm sorry this is happening to you, sir.

336
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,443
You've been detained.

337
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,888
Your family's been kidnapped.

338
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:59,168
And you're concerned about me.

339
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:07,643
That didn't have anything to do with
the election. That was about my son.

340
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,768
Is he OK?

341
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:13,003
I just realised today...

342
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,930
that I haven't always been there for him.

343
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:20,963
And what's killing me...

344
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:25,047
is that he's always been there for me.

345
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:32,491
Being the son of a politician isn't easy.

346
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:37,126
Being a son... or a daughter...

347
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:40,125
or a father...

348
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:43,043
none of it's easy.

349
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:50,168
Your wife and daughter OK?

350
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:54,084
I don't know.

351
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,964
I hope so.

352
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,968
- OK. Just try to be relaxed.
- OK.

353
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:12,248
I just have a few questions.

354
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,529
This just came in from Ellis.
I organised it into three sections.

355
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:21,164
Cross-references are in the first part. Then
there's a summary of Operation Nightfall.

356
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:23,483
Details that may not be
important are at the end.

357
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:26,133
- Any word on the missing file?
- No, not yet.

358
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:28,204
OK, thanks, Milo.

359
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:35,487
What is the Ambassador
to Libya doing on this list?

360
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,565
Probably kept Drazen's money
separate from the government.

361
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:41,645
We've had our eye on him
for quite some time.

362
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:44,727
Do you know a Rene Bonniere?

363
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:47,122
- No. Who's he?
- He's out of North Africa.

364
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:53,004
A couple high-ups over at District thought he
was trying to set up terrorist cells in the US.

365
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,848
Jack. Page four.

366
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,283
Second paragraph down.

367
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:15,967
Drazen's wife and daughter
were in the bunker?

368
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:19,887
Did you know about this?
This wasn't in our initial report.

369
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:22,487
They died in the explosion.

370
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,211
My God.

371
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:29,771
This is an eye for an eye.
We took out Drazen and his family.

372
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:32,048
Now someone wants mine.

373
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,125
Who's in charge of protecting your family?

374
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:39,806
Jack! Who has the authority to add
security to your wife and daughter?

375
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:41,485
Chapelle.

376
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:45,246
- Yes, Senator?
- Send in Mr Chapelle right away.

377
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,324
Yes, sir.

378
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:51,932
There was nothing else you saw or heard
that gave you a glimpse into their operation?

379
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:55,892
No, that's it. They really didn't
talk much in front of us.

380
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:59,172
- Tell me about this boy Rick. He helped you?
- Yeah.

381
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:00,481
How?

382
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:05,522
Well, different ways, but mainly
he gave us a gun and he helped us escape.

383
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,411
- How'd he get a gun?
- I don't know.

384
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:11,123
- And you don't know his last name?
- No.

385
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:15,365
- I don't think Kimberly knows either.
- How did she meet him?

386
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:17,762
Through her friend, Janet York.

387
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:23,406
Everyone used to say
"Wait until she's a teenager,

388
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:27,532
you'll finally understand
the meaning of the word 'worry'."

389
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:32,243
I'm sure she'll grow out of it.
Jack says she's basically a level-headed kid.

390
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,528
Jack talks about Kim?

391
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:37,081
Just the usual stuff.

392
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:41,849
It surprises me. Jack's work always
seems so serious and secretive.

393
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:46,688
It's hard to picture him sitting around
the office talking about his family.

394
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:51,369
Sometimes at lunch he'll bring up something
if something's on his mind.

395
00:31:54,973 --> 00:32:00,411
So, do you think Rick had the confidence
of Ira Gaines, the leader of the group?

396
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:02,882
I really couldn't tell you that.

397
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:06,531
- Nina, could I ask you a question?
- Sure.

398
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:10,002
When Jack and I were separated...

399
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,642
did he ever talk about me?

400
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:20,888
Jack never discussed his marriage.

401
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,606
Oh.

402
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:25,605
Sometimes he would... talk about Kim,

403
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,684
you know.

404
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:36,642
We all knew he was
going through a very hard time

405
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,327
and that he missed you both very much.

406
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:50,729
When Jack and I got back together again...
he told me that he'd been with someone else.

407
00:32:55,293 --> 00:33:00,162
I told him it didn't matter what I did,
what he did... when we were apart -

408
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:05,373
that was in the past. The only thing that
mattered was what we did from that point on.

409
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,524
It was you, wasn't it?

410
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,925
Teri.

411
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,490
I saw it... when we got off the helicopter.

412
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,328
I saw it when you looked at him.

413
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:44,688
After you were separated,

414
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:48,211
yes, we saw each other.

415
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:53,447
But it didn't last long. He realised
it was a mistake and he went back to you.

416
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,445
- What about you?
- What about me?

417
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,041
Did you think it was a mistake?

418
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:06,367
- Are you still sleeping with him?
- No.

419
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:08,531
Teri...

420
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,447
it was over before he went back to you.
That is the truth.

421
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:21,691
Look, I realise this is a terrible time
for you to discover all this.

422
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,207
When do you think
a good time would be, Nina?

423
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,724
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:32,445
It's just we have to
get through the rest of this.

425
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,683
I need to take a break.

426
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:54,606
Yeah, Mike, I know.
We'll be leaving in about five minutes.

427
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:59,003
I can't wait for Ellis. I've got to go.

428
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:04,884
Senator, they're not gonna let me continue to
work here. I am technically still under arrest.

429
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:05,849
Come on.

430
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,565
Ryan!

431
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:14,449
- Yes, Senator?
- I understand you have Jack under arrest.

432
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,001
I told the senator I was being detained.

433
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:22,406
There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes
any charges that might be filed against him.

434
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:26,728
- But Senator...
- I want him reinstated immediately.

435
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:29,611
Sir, you don't have the authority
to make that decision.

436
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,082
Alberta, please.

437
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:38,248
Sir, what you are asking isn't possible.
The charges against Agent Bauer are serious.

438
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:43,009
We'd be in contempt of agency regulations
if we reinstated him without a hearing.

439
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:46,802
Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me.
Not permanently.

440
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:50,249
Nobody here has as much information
about this situation as I do.

441
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,052
Give me provisional status
till the end of the day.

442
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:57,092
Then you can take me back into custody,
do whatever you want.

443
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,408
Fine, Jack.

444
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:10,566
You work the case out of CTU,
but you answer to me.

445
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:15,606
Good luck with your campaign, Senator.

446
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,649
Thank you.

447
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,604
Walk with me.

448
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:29,452
Secret Service wants me to leave the state.
They say it's not safe.

449
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,728
Well, I agree with them.

450
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:37,682
The one thing we know... is that Drazen's
people are here, and they want us today.

451
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,288
And it's almost three o'clock now.
The day is more than half over.

452
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:44,443
I'm going to stay.

453
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:47,605
Let's flush them out into
the open and deal with them.

454
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:49,888
Otherwise you and I and our families

455
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:53,443
will be looking over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

456
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:57,242
I understand. I'll follow up with Ellis.
I'll keep you posted.

457
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,927
- You know how to get in touch with me.
- Jack.

458
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:05,007
I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

459
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:11,644
Thank you, Senator.

460
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,084
Excuse me.

461
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:24,930
Before my mom came, nobody talked to me.
They put me in the room, I was locked in.

462
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:28,767
- What about Rick?
- Rick? What about Rick?

463
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:32,562
- Well, he was one of your kidnappers, right?
- Not exactly.

464
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,121
I thought he and Dan brought you to Gaines?

465
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,886
Well, it was mostly Dan. I mean, not Rick.

466
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:41,932
I think he was actually just as surprised
as we were about what was happening.

467
00:37:42,013 --> 00:37:43,412
Really?

468
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:47,008
Well, yeah. He was fighting
with Dan the entire time.

469
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,243
He actually helped us escape.

470
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,528
Hold on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

471
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:55,684
Hold on.

472
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,844
- Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

473
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,404
Chapelle reinstated me to provisional status
for the rest of the day, at Palmer's request.

474
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:14,122
- That's great, Jack.
- Yeah. How's everything going over there?

475
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:17,489
- Not bad.
- Look, we're sending over two more teams.

476
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:20,451
- Why?
- Looks like Teri and Kim were targets as well.

477
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:24,651
Nina... this is not information
they need to know, OK?

478
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:27,088
- No, of course.
- Good, thanks.

479
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,403
- Let me speak to Teri, OK?
- Sure.

480
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,521
Teri?

481
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:42,404
It's Jack.

482
00:38:45,853 --> 00:38:49,243
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, sweetheart. You OK? How you doin'?

483
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:52,012
I'm OK.

484
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,084
- How's Kim?
- She's fine.

485
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:59,481
Tony gave me a message that you
wanted to tell me something important.

486
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:01,768
No, it's nothing important.

487
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:05,043
Are you sure? You sound funny.

488
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:08,289
It's nothing, I just...

489
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:10,250
I just...

490
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,210
I'm so tired.

491
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,452
Why don't you try and get
some rest, sweetheart?

492
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:20,004
Listen, if... if you need anything
from the house, Nina will make sure

493
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:23,290
- someone can go and get it for you, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

494
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:28,412
I've gotta go. I love you, OK?
I'll call you as soon as I can.

495
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,004
OK. Bye-bye.

496
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:47,162
Mom!

497
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,244
I'll be right back.

498
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,410
- So, what did he say?
- I didn't tell him.

499
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,801
- Why not?
- It wasn't the right time.

500
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,412
You should go back
and finish with Nina, honey.

501
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:07,484
What's wrong?

502
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:12,723
Nothing. I just think you should
finish answering Nina's questions.

503
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:20,046
Bauer.

504
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:22,727
- Jack, it's Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

505
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:27,762
Yeah, I shot over a few more things to Milo,
but I still can't locate the missin' file.

506
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:32,085
- How can I help?
- I gave Milo enough to try it on your end.

507
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:37,770
The more I look at this thing, the more I'm
convinced the file was taken out deliberately.

508
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:43,443
Which leads me to believe...
it contains what we're lookin' for.

509
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:46,650
Can you give an estimate of
when you think the file was stolen?

510
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:50,248
Also a list of people you think
could've had access to even get in there?

511
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:53,166
Not yet, but you tell Milo
I got some ideas on how to...

512
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:54,288
Urgh!

513
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:56,643
Bob?

514
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,405
Bob?

515
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,725
Bob?

516
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:08,244
Can you hear me?

517
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:10,845
Bob?

518
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,966
