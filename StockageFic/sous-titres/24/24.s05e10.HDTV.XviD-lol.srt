1
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:16,034
AUDREY:
I'm on the phone with a man
who claims to James Nathanson.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,334
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

3
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,034
He says he has information
about the terrorists,

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,534
but he will only talk to you.

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,534
JACK:
What do you want with me?

6
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,933
CUMMINGS:
Protection.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,734
The terrorists you're after
are trying to kill me.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,034
What makes you think
I'm not gonna kill you myself?

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,434
Because you want to stop

10
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,267
the Sentox gas from being
released on American soil.

11
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,267
So do I.

12
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:33,167
Nathanson, stay down!

13
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,434
Stay down!

14
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:42,234
What's on the chip?
Please, what's on the chip!

15
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,768
O'Brian.

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,467
I have a thumb drive that's
gonna help us find the Sentox.

17
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:48,267
CHLOE:
The decryption element
kicked out a company

18
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,867
called Omicron International.

19
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,601
Pull up their
senior executive roster,

20
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,401
See if a man named Christopher
Henderson's on the list.

21
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,734
Okay, here it is.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,367
Senior Vice President
of Research and Development.

23
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,267
Send me the decrypted files
over to my PDA.

24
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,334
That's gonna be a little bit
hard to do right now, Jack.

25
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,234
The two of you are up
to something, and I'm
not gonna stand for it.

26
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,967
This is a deliberate attempt
to circumvent my authority.

27
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:07,100
Lynn, we're all
on the same side.
If you're father wasn't

28
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,833
the Secretary of
Defense, I'd have you
thrown out of here.

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,434
I don't have that problem
with you.

30
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,933
I spent a year securing a weapon

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,634
that would bring Moscow
to its knees.

32
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,800
And you waste it.

33
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,668
We were betrayed, Bierko.

34
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,734
Someone must pay.
I agree.

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,301
( grunts )

36
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,100
This is President Logan.
What is it you want?

37
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,768
I want the route
of Suvarov's motorcade.

38
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,833
If you refuse to cooperate,

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,067
I will have no choice
but to release

40
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,601
all the Sentox nerve gas.

41
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:38,367
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

42
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:39,933
Don't negotiate with them!

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,634
Isn't that the point of the
treaty you just signed?

44
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,900
Mr. President, I'm glad
that we have this opportunity

45
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,000
to thank you

46
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,501
and Mrs. Logan

47
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,634
for your hospitality.

48
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,167
The motorcade will take

49
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,100
service roads to the 118...

50
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,501
Mrs. Logan...
Aaron,

51
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,933
I've decided to drive to
the airport with the Suvarovs.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,100
I'll ride up front.

53
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,668
No, that's not necessary.

54
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,833
Yes, it is.

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,467
( phone rings )

56
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:23,067
Yes?

57
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:25,634
Where is the motorcade now?
Just getting on the 118.

58
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,434
How long before they reach
the ambush point?

59
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,100
About 40 minutes.

60
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,734
Good. We'll be waiting.

61
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:36,034
Get everything ready.

62
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,134
Mr. President,
I asked Secret Service

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,034
to sent a threat assessment

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,034
for President
Suvarov's route.

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,601
The most vulnerable point

66
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:54,701
is here,
the downtown corridor.

67
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:57,900
This is the most likely
point of attack.

68
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,100
If an ambush were to occur.

69
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,734
It's going to happen, Mike.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,301
We gave the terrorists
Suvarov's route.

71
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:11,234
I need to come up
with a public response.

72
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:12,734
I need to convince
the world that

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,668
Suvarov's death
only underscores the importance

74
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,200
of this antiterrorism treaty

75
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,067
that we just signed.

76
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:23,601
I'll, uh, begin working
on a statement, sir.

77
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:26,267
Yes?

78
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:32,434
Thank you. I'll...
let the president know.

79
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:35,867
What? What is it, Mike?

80
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,401
What's going on?

81
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,301
Who was that?

82
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,601
( exhales )

83
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,800
Agent Pierce. Um,

84
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,634
I don't know how
to tell you this.
Just tell me.

85
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:51,800
Mrs. Logan is riding
with the Suvarovs.

86
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:56,900
What are you talking about?
Sir, she got into
that limousine.

87
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,800
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,768
Didn't-didn't the
Secret Service

89
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,434
try to stop her?!

90
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,167
There was no reason to stop her.

91
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,134
The motorcade is under
Secret Service escort.

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,867
As far as they're concerned,
she's not in any danger.

93
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,734
She wants me to call back

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
the motorcade-- she's trying
to save the Suvarovs.

95
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,434
Should I alert them?

96
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,067
Yes!

97
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,768
No, stop, wait.

98
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,301
( exhales )

99
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:25,000
If we warn them, the terrorists
are going to set off the gas.

100
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,668
Where are they now?

101
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:32,434
They're still on the 118.

102
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,000
Get my wife on the phone.

103
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,768
( exhales )

104
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,234
MRS. SUVAROV:
My aunt visited Los Angeles

105
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:54,501
in the 1950s.

106
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,000
She told me this area
was filled with orange groves,

107
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,534
but I haven't seen any.

108
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:03,000
I suppose it's all been
built over, no?

109
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,833
Martha?

110
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,501
Yes. I-I...
I was just trying to remember.

111
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,367
Um, I think your aunt's memory
is better than mine.

112
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,167
I visited here when
I was a child,

113
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,067
but I don't recall
the orange groves.

114
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:16,467
( phone rings )

115
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,434
Yeah, this is Pierce.

116
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,833
Mrs. Logan,

117
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,401
it's the president
for you on line one.
Thank you, Aaron.

118
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,867
Hello, Charles.

119
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,200
Listen to me carefully.

120
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,401
I want you...

121
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,401
Yes, I think they had
a wonderful visit.

122
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,933
And they would very much like
for us to come to Moscow.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,933
Wouldn't that be lovely?

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,100
I want you to tell the Suvarovs
that I need you back here.

125
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm gonna have one of the
follow cars bring you back.

126
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:50,501
I don't think so, Charles.
Tell them now, while
I'm on the phone.

127
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,668
Martha,

128
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:56,534
I know that you want me to call
the motorcade back, but...

129
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,833
the terrorists were
very specific:

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,567
if-if I don't allow them
to attack the motorcade,

131
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:01,867
they're gonna release

132
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:04,900
canisters of nerve gas
in multiple locations.

133
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, I... guess we'll just have
to figure something out

134
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,867
before that happens.
We're trying! We're trying,

135
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,234
but we haven't found them yet.

136
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,967
You need to get out of the car.

137
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,100
Okay, I should go now,
but you'll call me
Martha...

138
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,134
if there's any change of plans?
Damn it, Martha!

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, bye-bye.
I'll-I'll talk to you soon.

140
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,534
She won't get out
of the limousine.

141
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,367
My God.

142
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,067
We got to do something, Mike; we
got to get her out of the car.

143
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,234
I could have, uh, one
of the trail cars

144
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,933
stop them and force her out,
say that I need her back here.

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,134
You could, but... if Martha

146
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,234
is desperate to save
the Suvarovs,

147
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,267
she might feel that
the only remaining option

148
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,668
is to tell them the truth.

149
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,634
And Suvarov will know that
I gave him up for assassination.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,267
Sir,

151
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,668
do you want me to recall
the motorcade or not?

152
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,034
Edgar, meet me
in the server room

153
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,800
in a few minutes.

154
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,401
Am I in trouble?
No, but there's
something

155
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,634
very important
that we need to discuss.

156
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:30,867
Okay.
And, Edgar,

157
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,634
don't tell anyone
where you're going.

158
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:35,401
This needs to stay
between us.
Sure.

159
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,467
What did Audrey Raines want?

160
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:47,167
She was just going over
some DOD protocols.

161
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,401
I thought you were supposed
to be monitoring chatter.

162
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,467
We are.
Why isn't it on
my screen, Carrie?

163
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:53,701
I didn't think
you wanted us to mirror

164
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,200
everything
to your system.

165
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,367
I thought you wanted
to save time.
I do want to save time.

166
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,367
It saves me time by not having
to clean up more mistakes.

167
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,401
Mirror everything until
we've secured this nerve gas.

168
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,534
Is that clear?

169
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,267
Yes, sir.

170
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:15,900
The thumb drive data
Jack sent us checks
out as authentic.

171
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,034
It's time-stamped
by DOD and CIA.

172
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
So Omicron International
did make Sentox gas
for the military.

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,334
Yeah, and some terrorists
found out about it.

174
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:27,167
Or worse-- they were in contact
with Omicron.

175
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,200
Who is this Henderson?

176
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,668
CHLOE:
Christopher Henderson,
Senior Vice President, R&D.

177
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,167
Jack said he knew him,
but he wouldn't talk about it.

178
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,701
Is he connected with the Sentox?

179
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,800
Doesn't say;
it just said he was a senior VP.
All right.

180
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,034
( phone rings )

181
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,701
Yeah?

182
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,601
Jack, we've authenticated
the thumb drive data.

183
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,200
Omicron definitely made the
Sentox for the military.

184
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,701
Okay, I'm almost there--
look, I need you

185
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,234
to work something up
that gets me through

186
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,768
the front door
without them knowing I'm CTU.

187
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,601
Do you think it's necessary
to go in covertly?

188
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,167
Yeah. There's someone
I need to talk to.

189
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,768
I don't want him
to see me coming.

190
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,933
Christopher Henderson?

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,067
Who is he?

193
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,601
Someone I used to work for.

194
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:07,900
Where?

195
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,867
CTU. He was the man
who recruited me.

196
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,100
You've never mentioned him.

197
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,234
I know.

198
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,668
Things ended badly between us.

199
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,933
What happened?

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,701
I was part of an investigation
that uncovered evidence

201
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,501
that implicated him in the sale

202
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,933
of classified intelligence
to defense contractors.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,100
We never had enough evidence
to indict him,

204
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,768
but he lost his job,
his command.

205
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,900
Even as he was walking
out the door,

206
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,867
he maintained his innocence.

207
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,734
He never forgave me for being
part of the investigation.

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,434
Are you convinced he did it?

209
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,134
I was at the time.

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
Jack, Chloe can't find
a direct connection

211
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,334
between the Sentox
and Henderson.

212
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:44,634
Trust me,

213
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,000
if Omicron was making Sentox,
legally or illegally,

214
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,900
Henderson knew about it.

215
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,000
Get back to me as soon

216
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,234
as you got my cover.
All right,

217
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:53,334
I'm on it.
What are you doing
here, Chloe?

218
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,701
Same thing you're doing here.

219
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,367
Edgar, thank you for coming.

220
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,933
Look, whatever this
is about, I don't
have a lot of time.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,234
We don't have a single active
lead on this nerve gas.

222
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,634
That's not exactly true.

223
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,567
Jack is following a lead
out in the field.

224
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,434
How do you know?
I just spoke with him.

225
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:09,967
Everyone's looking for him.
Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

226
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:11,734
That's why we wanted
to talk to you, Edgar.

227
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,634
Lynn is losing it--
first he went after Jack,

228
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:15,501
and then he took Bill Buchanan
out of play.

229
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,301
Lynn is incapable of leading us
through this crisis.

230
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,833
So you're both working
behind his back?
We're afraid that if

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
we bring him into this,
he might derail the only
good lead that we have.

232
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,800
We have to help Jack
locate the nerve gas

233
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:28,534
before it's too late.
What do you want from me?

234
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:31,067
Cover for Chloe until
Jack reports back.

235
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,701
Please.

236
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:39,067
Okay.
Thank you.

237
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,401
Okay, fine. Yeah.

238
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,833
That was Secret Service.

239
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,601
As you can see,
the motorcade continues

240
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,768
to make its way to the airport
without incident.

241
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,367
There won't be
any warning, Mike.

242
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,034
When these people
attack,

243
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,933
they will be fast
and they will be merciless.

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,467
You can count on that.

245
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,833
I have to talk to this man.

246
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,267
M-Maybe I can convince him
to hold off.

247
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,467
Hold off?

248
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:04,900
Just until Martha
gets out of the car.

249
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,234
She wasn't supposed to be a part
of this in the first place.

250
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,833
Sir, I don't think that would
change his plan.

251
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,567
He has to know that my wife's
in the car!

252
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:14,534
I can't lose her, Mike.

253
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,567
The only way
to keep Martha safe

254
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,100
is for me to call Secret Service

255
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,768
and tell them to turn

256
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,000
the motorcade around.

257
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,367
What about...
what about CTU?

258
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:23,900
Do they have any active leads

259
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,100
on the nerve gas?

260
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,367
As of five minutes ago,
they don't...

261
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:27,867
nothing that would help
our situation.

262
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,933
What am I missing, Mike?!

263
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,100
There's got to be some way out,

264
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,434
something
that I'm not seeing.

265
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,067
You're not missing anything.

266
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:36,967
Any action we take
to save Martha

267
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,701
would also save
the Suvarovs,

268
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,367
and if that happens,

269
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,634
the terrorists
will release the gas.

270
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,067
Unfortunately,

271
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:46,034
it's that simple.

272
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,467
Then there's nothing more
we can do, Mike.

273
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,267
Unless I warn them.

274
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,501
Martha's going to die
with the Suvarovs.

275
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:10,367
Aaron...
have there been any changes?

276
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,401
Excuse me?

277
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,434
Changes to what,
Mrs. Logan?

278
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,668
I-I was just wondering

279
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,167
if there had been any changes
to our route.

280
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,601
We haven't gotten

281
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:21,034
any revised
instructions, ma'am.

282
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,867
Thank you.

283
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,567
You sure you're all right,
Martha?

284
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, yes.
I just wanted to make sure

285
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,100
we don't run into
any heavy traffic.

286
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,960
Understood.

287
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,414
Those protocols should be
coming over shortly.

288
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,868
Who were you
on the phone with?

289
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,623
Homeland Security.

290
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,082
I gave you specific orders

291
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,773
to have everyone's systems
mirrored to mine.

292
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:12,102
I've been doing that.

293
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,028
But you're not finished,
yet somehow you have time

294
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,290
to chat with Homeland Security.

295
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,475
They needed us to give them
updated code sets.

296
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,332
It'll just take
another minute.
No, it won't.

297
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:20,562
Stiles, finish her task.

298
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,687
Carrie, you're done.

299
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,110
What do you... mean, done?

300
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,664
Fired. You don't
work here anymore.

301
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,259
STILES:
Mr. McGill,

302
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,584
it's not her fault.
She just...

303
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,509
Edgar, one more word out of you,
you walk out with her.

304
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,565
What's it gonna be?

305
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,820
( scoffs quietly )

306
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,404
Where's Agent O'Brian?

307
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:41,130
She had to step away
for a minute.
Where?

308
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,318
I don't know.

309
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,939
Jack, I'm still trying
to get your credentials
into Omicron's system.

310
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,639
You can't get into
the building without them.

311
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,208
What's the problem?

312
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,506
Omicron's systems
don't refresh
often enough.

313
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:10,074
We need to push
this page in manually.

314
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:11,441
Okay, I'm in.

315
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,076
You're going in under the name
of John Barrie.

316
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,509
B-A-R-R-I-E.

317
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,977
You're with a company called

318
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:16,978
Eclipse LLC.

319
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,144
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.

320
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,479
I got it.

321
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:20,512
Hold on a second;

322
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,712
she hasn't
planted it yet.

323
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,282
Chloe. What are you
doing in here?

324
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,849
I asked her to help me.

325
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,781
She doesn't work for you,
Ms. Raines; she works for me.

326
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,048
But I don't,

327
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,349
and DOD has assignment
priority

328
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,616
over CTU.

329
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,017
We're in the middle of a
real-time investigation,

330
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,585
and we're understaffed.

331
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:34,984
Chloe's a department head--
you can't just take her

332
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,986
away from me.
AUDREY:
I'm not taking her from you.

333
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,419
We needed a system patch
on a server,

334
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,720
and Chloe's the only one
who could fix it.

335
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,988
Well, then you come to me
and you ask me.

336
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,821
Everything in this office
runs through me!

337
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,224
Lynn, we are all trying
to do the same thing.

338
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,557
Can we please
just get past this?

339
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,592
Yeah, I'm past it.
I want Chloe back.

340
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:54,327
Okay, I'm finished here.

341
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,460
Sorry, Mr. McGill,
it won't happen again.

342
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,600
Good afternoon.

343
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:13,999
John Barrie
with Eclipse.

344
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:15,434
I've got a 4:30
with R&D.

345
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,769
( typing )

346
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,874
Thumb print, please.

347
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,044
Go on in.

348
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,744
Thank you.

349
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,884
MAN ( over intercom ):
Well, I'll tell you what you do.

350
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,786
You kick the McAvoy meeting
to next week on Thursday,

351
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:57,918
but you keep everything else.

352
00:15:57,987 --> 00:15:59,552
What about your trip
to Washington?

353
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,254
That's right. Okay.

354
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,486
Well, I got to talk to Kagan
tomorrow morning.

355
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:03,955
I'll get back to you then.

356
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,354
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

357
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,022
I'm a little lost. I was looking
for the men's room.

358
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,423
Over there, second door.

359
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,856
Thank you.

360
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:20,961
( line ringing )

361
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,455
Audrey Raines.

362
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,535
It's Jack. I need you
to lose the secretary.

363
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:26,766
Her name is Joanna Tandy.

364
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,933
All right, I'll take care of it.

365
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,099
Thanks.

366
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,955
( phone rings )

367
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,284
Christopher Henderson's office.

368
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,773
Ms. Tandy?
Yes?

369
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,492
Jane Espenson
from accounting.

370
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:53,981
We need you
to come down now

371
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,082
and double-check some
of these invoices.

372
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,638
What invoices?

373
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,776
It's a little difficult
to explain over the phone.

374
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:01,207
Would you mind popping down
just for a minute?

375
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:02,211
Fine.

376
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,668
Thank you.

377
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,807
Mr. Henderson, there's a problem
down in accounting.

378
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:07,167
I'll be right back.

379
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,615
( electronic buzzing )

380
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,497
Jack? Jack?

381
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:39,825
( gasps )

382
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,418
( Jack groans )

383
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,960
( panting )

384
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,467
Just for the record,
I never believed you were dead.

385
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:57,646
What are you doing here?

386
00:17:58,588 --> 00:17:59,947
Earlier this morning,

387
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,597
terrorists gained control
of a large quantity

388
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,315
of Sentox VX
nerve gas.

389
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,642
Omicron
manufactured it.

390
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,906
When I pulled up
the executive list,

391
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,041
your name was on it.

392
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,724
Sure my name's on it--
I work here.

393
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,827
Omicron had
the contract.

394
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,091
We manufacture
this stuff.

395
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,354
But every single gram of it

396
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,390
went to the Department
of Defense.

397
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:14,558
It's all been accounted for.

398
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,242
Well, that can't be true,
now, can it?

399
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,992
We have confirmation
that terrorists

400
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,064
are in control
of 19 canisters of Sentox!

401
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,362
What are you accusing me
now of, Jack?

402
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,045
Being in bed with terrorists?

403
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,147
I'm following
the leads!

404
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:25,509
Well, the leads are wrong.

405
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:27,939
DOD destroyed
the entire stockpile.

406
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,726
Sentox was responsible
for the death of the people

407
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,992
in the Sunrise Hills Mall
less than two hours ago.

408
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,780
The news said it
was chlorine gas.

409
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:36,751
That was a cover story
to stop

410
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,306
a widespread panic!

411
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,093
Come on, Christopher,
you know how this works!

412
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:50,037
The terrorists have threatened
to release the rest of the gas.

413
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,259
( quietly ):
Good God.

414
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,761
Well, whoever's implicating me
in this

415
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,210
knows my history with CTU.

416
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,884
I mean, I'm
an easy target.

417
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:15,311
This is not
a coincidence.

418
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,984
Look, Jack, I know
there's dirt between us,

419
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,432
but I swear to you,

420
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,220
I got nothing
to do with this.

421
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:24,141
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I can't afford to take

422
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,252
your word
on this.

423
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,094
Well, you're gonna have
to take my word.

424
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,881
11 people died in that mall!

425
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,172
Hundreds of thousands of others
will if they release

426
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:31,285
the rest
of the Sentox.

427
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,833
You're not hearing me, Jack!

428
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,451
I had nothing to do with this!

429
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,608
Then prove it to me.

430
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,021
I need complete access
to Omicron's Sentox program.

431
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,705
I'm doing it now.

432
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:00,165
The entire operation
was run from a bunker
across the campus.

433
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:02,897
Let me see the bunker.

434
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
NSA chatter analysis
just came in.

435
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:47,701
I decoded some
words and phrases.

436
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,133
What were they saying?

437
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,601
It's too scrambled to make
any complete sentences,

438
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,701
but number strings
keep coming up.

439
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,834
5, 110, 10.

440
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,367
Freeways?

441
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,501
Those are the routes
President Suvarov's
taking to the airport.

442
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,167
The only other phrase
I could decode

443
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,968
refers to the downtown corridor.

444
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,567
How long ago did
this chatter start?

445
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:08,334
About 30 minutes ago.

446
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:14,501
Come on.

447
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,200
Can we expand the search area?

448
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,400
I've got CTU air surveillance
on everything east of Glendale.

449
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,167
What about the north?
Edwards Air Force Base

450
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,968
is giving us
support there.

451
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,133
We're still at a dead end

452
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,634
on finding new leads
with the nerve gas.

453
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,767
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think
there might be an attack

454
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,767
on President Suvarov's
motorcade.
What?

455
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,033
Edgar just monitored

456
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,801
some chatter from
NSA and ran a threat assessment.

457
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,100
What are you doing
analyzing chatter

458
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,834
that isn't related to finding
the nerve gas?

459
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,801
It came through
on one of my filters.

460
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,501
The point is, sir,
we found something.

461
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't you want to alert
Secret Service

462
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,167
considering that Suvarov
is on his way to the airport?

463
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,767
Based on
an unsubstantiated theory

464
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,367
from a couple of analysts?

465
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:50,033
I think I've been embarrassed
enough for one day.

466
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,834
Can we at least devote
some limited resources

467
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,434
to try to confirm this threat?

468
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,434
I'm sorry.

469
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:56,701
Maybe I wasn't clear. No.

470
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:57,968
Now go downstairs

471
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,968
and focus on what
you're supposed
to be doing.

472
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:15,868
I don't think it would be
a bad idea

473
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,601
to pass along
the intel.

474
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,167
Well, I do.

475
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,767
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

476
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,567
Yes?

477
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:31,767
Our men are in place.

478
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,534
How far out are they?

479
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,801
The motorcade will be there
in less than 20 minutes.

480
00:22:36,868 --> 00:22:38,734
Are you sure no one is going
to interfere with us?

481
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,234
I don't think so.

482
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,067
Logan knows the consequences
if that happens.

483
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,567
But be alert.

484
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:47,400
Make sure they haven't
placed any of their
people near you.

485
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,934
If police show up,
we'll deal with them.
Good.

486
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,434
I'll call you when it's over.

487
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:56,467
Let's go, let's go.

488
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,701
Keep them out.

489
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:05,501
If things don't go as planned,
I'll use them here.

490
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,968
I'm busy, Ms. Raines.

491
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,901
Lynn, I just looked
at this chatter report

492
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,300
and I definitely think
that we need

493
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,934
to let Secret Service know
of the threat.

494
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,300
I'm not going to repeat
my orders

495
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,634
to every person
in this office individually.

496
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,601
My people are not going
to chase that white elephant.

497
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,000
They're busy trying
to locate 19 canisters

498
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,300
of Sentox nerve gas.

499
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,701
Has it occurred to you
that if this threat is real,

500
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,334
then it's likely

501
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,300
that the terrorists who have
the Sentox nerve gas

502
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,334
are the same ones
that are planning this attack?

503
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
This is an unverified threat!

504
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,467
If you want to hand
it off to NSA, be my guest.

505
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,400
NSA can't recall the motorcade
without going through

506
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,167
a time-consuming
approval process.

507
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:45,534
Good.

508
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,834
That process helps eliminate
false threats.

509
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,667
Look, we don't have that time.
According...

510
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:50,868
Ms. Raines, Ms. Raines,

511
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:53,167
this office has
made enough mistakes

512
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,000
for one day, and I intend
to stop the bleeding.

513
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,367
Now let my people

514
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,634
focus on their work

515
00:23:57,701 --> 00:24:00,634
or I will have you
escorted out of here.

516
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,067
Thank you.

517
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,701
( beep )

518
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,534
I need to call this in
to Secret Service,

519
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:55,934
but they won't act on it

520
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
unless Lynn verifies it.

521
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,868
He's never going
to back you up on that.
Yes, he is.

522
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,868
I need you to hack
into Lynn's account for me.

523
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,200
I'll forge a message
to Secret Service

524
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:05,033
and make it look like
it came from him.

525
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,434
That's illegal.
Fine.

526
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,334
Edgar, I need you to put
a blanket on my sub-net

527
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,901
to make it look like
I'm doing something else.

528
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,033
We could all
end up in jail.

529
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,200
Think about it
for a second.

530
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,701
The Russian president,
his wife,

531
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,834
about 35 Secret Service,
all dead in a few minutes.

532
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:22,367
All right, but for the record,
this is not a good idea.

533
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:23,968
All right, I'll
compose a message.

534
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,734
As soon as you have the forged
verification file, call me.

535
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,601
Curtis.

536
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,968
Excuse me.
We need to talk.

537
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,968
What is it?

538
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:54,434
We've got a problem
with Lynn.

539
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,534
Yeah, I know.

540
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:56,634
He's not listening
to anybody.

541
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:58,334
Well, it's going to start
costing lives.

542
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,934
Just give him some time.
He'll come around.

543
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,234
Curtis, we don't have time.

544
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,767
We've got to get Bill
back out here.

545
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:04,667
That's not going
to happen, Audrey.

546
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:06,234
We need to make it happen.

547
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,434
What are you suggesting?

548
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,734
Section 112.

549
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,834
On what grounds?

550
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,868
Lynn is mentally incapable
of running CTU.

551
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,467
I may not agree
with all his choices,

552
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,734
but going from there

553
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,133
to mentally unfit?

554
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,434
That's a stretch.

555
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:21,467
No, it's not and you know it.

556
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:23,300
You've seen him.

557
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:25,100
With Bill in custody,
you are the ranking agent.

558
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,133
You are the only one

559
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,267
that can invoke it.

560
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:30,200
I don't know, Audrey...
Yes, you do.

561
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:33,567
Curtis, CTU is barely
functional.

562
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,767
You are the one
that can turn it around.

563
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:39,701
Even if I agreed, Section 112
requires documentation,

564
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,133
testimony, a lot
of groundwork.

565
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,634
The record of what is going on
right now

566
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:46,133
is documentation enough.

567
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,434
Curtis...

568
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:49,834
please.

569
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:50,968
Think about it.

570
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:54,501
I will.

571
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,267
Good. Thank you.

572
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,033
( knocking )

573
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,834
Mr. President.

574
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,634
Come in, Mike.

575
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:32,901
The motorcade

576
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:36,067
is only 15 minutes
away from the airport.

577
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,167
Yeah.

578
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:49,000
My father always told me that
life was about problem solving.

579
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,834
That every problem
had a solution.

580
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,367
You tell me where
the solution is

581
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,534
on this one.

582
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,767
I don't have an answer,
Mr. President.

583
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:13,200
But if you want
the Suvarov motorcade

584
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,100
to turn back,

585
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,701
I need to do it now.

586
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:30,734
We know the terrorists are
willing to kill civilians.

587
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:34,968
And the low... the low end
of the casualty range

588
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,467
on this one is...

589
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:39,367
100,000 lives.

590
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:41,167
Yes, sir.

591
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:47,667
I decided before that I couldn't
risk all those lives

592
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:50,400
to save one man--
the Russian president.

593
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:55,334
I can't risk those lives now...

594
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,701
( voice breaking ):
even to save my own wife.

595
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,667
Damn you, Martha,

596
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,267
for putting me in this position.

597
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:06,067
You brought it on yourself.

598
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:16,000
Mike...

599
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,434
Pray with me, Mike.

600
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:36,801
Uh, Mr. President,
with all due respect,

601
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:40,834
this is a personal matter.

602
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:42,567
I don't...

603
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:44,300
Please, Mike.

604
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,467
How much longer
until we can send this out?

605
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,033
A couple of minutes.
I've almost hacked in.

606
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,834
We don't have
a couple of minutes.

607
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,334
EDGAR:
I'm almost there.

608
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,300
Oh, no.

609
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,567
Lynn cut us off.

610
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,734
What do I do?

611
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,701
I think it's too late
to do anything.

612
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:19,734
Mr. Stiles,

613
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,567
did you really think
I wouldn't notice

614
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:22,934
that you were trying
to access my com?

615
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,033
Lynn, listen, we need to talk...
Shut up!

616
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,567
These people are working
against CTU protocols.

617
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,868
That means they're
working against me.

618
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:29,000
Lynn, what is this?

619
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:30,100
We were trying to warn
Secret Service

620
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,734
on an attack
on Suvarov's
motorcade.

621
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,067
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles
and Ms. O'Brian--

622
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,367
put them in holding.

623
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,234
And then escort Audrey Raines
out of CTU.

624
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,567
I can't do that.

625
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,934
Yes, you can, Curtis.

626
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,634
It's a direct order.

627
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:41,701
Now do it.

628
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,200
You forced them
to work covertly.

629
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,434
They had no choice.

630
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,567
You're not behaving
rationally, Lynn.

631
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,200
LYNN:
You and you,

632
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:49,200
take them all into custody
including Mr. Manning.

633
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:51,133
CURTIS:
If you try to carry out
that command,

634
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,467
I will draw my weapon.

635
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,267
If he draws his weapon,
shoot him.

636
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,067
CURTIS:
This situation is already
getting out of control.

637
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,100
Don't make it worse.

638
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,701
McGILL:
Why are you hesitating?!

639
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,234
I gave you an order.
Now do it!

640
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:08,267
What would you like me to do,
Mr. Manning?

641
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,567
What?!

642
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,467
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you
of your command

643
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,033
under the incapacity clause
of Section 112.

644
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,767
You'll do no such thing.

645
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:16,934
Take him away.

646
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,133
You can't do that.

647
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,400
He can't do this.
Don't touch me.

648
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,634
This is an unjustified
usurpation of my authority.

649
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:28,667
Do you hear me?

650
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,968
We're in the middle
of a crisis.

651
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,167
There are going to be
repercussions.

652
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:36,133
Everyone involved in this
is going to face prosecution.

653
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,067
This is Curtis Manning.

654
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,367
Release Bill Buchanan
from holding

655
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,133
and inform Division that
he's been reinstated

656
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,801
as director of CTU

657
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,434
under Section 112 provisions.

658
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,934
Everyone, get back

659
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,367
to your stations.

660
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:10,134
Fill me in.
Chloe and Edgar
detected chatter

661
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,467
indicating a possible attack on
President Suvarov's motorcade

662
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,000
en route to the airport.
How'd they get
Suvarov's route?

663
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,534
We don't know, but
the most likely

664
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,534
point of intercept
is the downtown corridor.

665
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,000
Has Secret Service
been notified?
Lynn refused to do so.

666
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,668
Notify Secret Service now.
I need your

667
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,900
level one access
code to override the
firewall Lynn put up.

668
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,267
Here.
I need Carrie back.

669
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:29,900
He fired her for no reason.
Have security reinstate her.

670
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,200
Edgar, pull up satellite and all
possible intercept points,

671
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:33,833
and call the president.

672
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,401
Yes, sir.
Where are we on

673
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,567
the location of the
nerve gas canisters?
No substantial progress.

674
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:40,768
What about the lead
Jack was following?
He traced the Sentox

675
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,734
back to Omicron International
where it was manufactured.

676
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,301
Is that where Jack is now?

677
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,401
Yes.
EDGAR:
Mr. Buchanan,

678
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,267
president's on the line.

679
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,000
Mr. President,
we have intelligence

680
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,933
that indicates
President Suvarov's motorcade

681
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,301
may be attacked
in the next few minutes.

682
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:01,467
Is that so?

683
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes, sir.

684
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:05,234
We are in the process
of notifying Secret Service.

685
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,933
What we can tell you is that
if the attack happens

686
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,301
it will occur
in or around the downtown area.

687
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:15,034
The motorcade is approaching
that area now, sir.

688
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,768
Mr. President?

689
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,867
Bill. Mike Novick.

690
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:33,734
The president is at a loss
for words.

691
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,701
His wife is
in the Suvarov's limousine.

692
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:42,800
( clears throat softly )

693
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,701
Thank you.
You've done a good job.

694
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,401
What do we do?

695
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,467
There's nothing we can do, sir.

696
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:57,967
CTU is informing
the Secret Service.

697
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:02,134
They'll no doubt take
defensive measures,

698
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,367
which makes the attack

699
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:06,167
substantially less likely
to succeed.

700
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,234
AARON:
Yes, sir.

701
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,800
Protocol red.

702
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:25,467
Protocol red.
Hold on tight.

703
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:27,334
We're turning around--
we just received intelligence

704
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,601
about a threat
to the motorcade.

705
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,234
They're turning around!

706
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,567
( gunfire )

707
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:39,301
We're under attack!

708
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,367
We need backup now!

709
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:44,900
( gasping )

710
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,067
( yells )

711
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:58,501
It's a missile fire.
The motorcade's been hit.

712
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,967
A-Aaron?

713
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,401
Aaron?

714
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,567
Oh, my God...

715
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,034
( gasping )

716
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:32,000
( two gunshots )

717
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,434
( sirens wail in distance )

718
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,134
( gunshot )

719
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,401
( garbled radio transmission )

720
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:54,367
( softly ):
Aaron... Aaron...

721
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,067
It's okay.

722
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,634
Are you okay?

723
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,567
( phone rings )

724
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,134
( ringing continues )

725
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:14,768
Novick.

726
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,734
Yeah, Frank.

727
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,567
How badly?

728
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,601
And what about
Mrs. Logan?

729
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,867
I will. Thank you.

730
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:30,134
Your wife survived
the attack.

731
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,967
CTU intervened in time.

732
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:38,534
Thank God.

733
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,800
What about the Suvarovs?

734
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,467
They were shaken up,
but, uh, they'll be okay.

735
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,933
He's going to think
I tipped off CTU.

736
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,434
It won't matter to him
that I tried to keep

737
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,967
my end of the bargain.

738
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,933
I agree.

739
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:22,234
All the work
on the Sentox project
was run out of here.

740
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,234
How restricted
was the access?

741
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,767
Extremely. For security reasons,
each defense contract

742
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,801
was run out of its own
separate dedicated bunker,

743
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,934
each bunker's a completely
sealed environment.

744
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Nothing gets in
and nothing gets out.

745
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,300
This is gonna
take some time.

746
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:48,901
I've got to merge some files,

747
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,467
find out who's working
on this project.

748
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,567
You're Senior Vice President
and you don't know?

749
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,968
Give me a break, Jack--
there's 8,000 people

750
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,400
that work for this company.

751
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:59,667
I got to run a sort--
it's gonna take me a minute.

752
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:02,868
So who's the honcho
over at CTU now?

753
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:06,033
Bill Buchanan.

754
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,701
( chuckles ):
Buchanan. What a stiff.

755
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,868
No wonder everything's
going to hell over there.

756
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,567
You guys keep getting rid

757
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,400
of everybody
who can do their job.

758
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:14,634
You made your own bed.

759
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,400
You accused
the wrong man, Jack.

760
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,167
I wasn't the lead investigator;
I showed them what I found.

761
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:21,000
I was framed.
By who?

762
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:24,667
Nina Myers, George Mason...
Who knows?

763
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,934
But I'll tell you, the one thing
that just hangs on me,

764
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,767
I'll tell you,
the one thing that just...

765
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:34,501
hurts me is that
you didn't believe me.

766
00:38:35,868 --> 00:38:38,334
You made it impossible
to believe you.

767
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,434
How could I possibly defend you?

768
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:43,601
You wouldn't even
defend yourself.

769
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:47,033
No one gave me the chance.

770
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Okay, we got
something here.

771
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,300
Lead scientist,
head of Project Sentox--

772
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,334
Alan Burkett, PhD.

773
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm gonna need
to speak to him.

774
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,868
Well, you're gonna
have a problem.

775
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:06,267
Died in a helicopter crash
in Geneva two years ago.

776
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:10,100
Let's see what else we got.

777
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,567
This is bizarre.

778
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,334
Two other senior
scientists

779
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,801
on the Sentox project--
one drowned on a diving trip

780
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:17,834
in the Bahamas,
the other burned to death

781
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:19,701
in a car accident
two weeks later.

782
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,334
What the hell is going on?

783
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,701
CTU's gonna have

784
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,100
to break it down.

785
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,634
How do I upload the files
and get them ready to transfer?

786
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:27,634
We need I.T.

787
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,667
They're next-door.

788
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,634
I'll get somebody to help us.

789
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,968
I'll CTU know that

790
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,167
we're sending the files over.

791
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:43,901
Hello?

792
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:45,901
Damn it.

793
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,067
( mechanical clicking )

794
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,200
( grunts )

795
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:11,767
( mechanical clicking )

796
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,634
Oh, my God.

797
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,868
How could I be so stupid?

798
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,100
WOMAN ( over phone ):
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

799
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,200
I listened to everything
Bauer had to say

800
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:34,300
about the thumb drive--
CTU does not have

801
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,133
enough information to hurt us.

802
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,968
What about Bauer?

803
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:42,033
Well, in about one minute,
he'll be dead.

804
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:48,167
( panting )

805
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,133
( loud grunt )

806
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,801
Tell the media we don't know how

807
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:07,834
the terrorists found out
about the Suvarovs' route.

808
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,300
We're looking
into it now.

809
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:11,634
( hangs up phone )

810
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:14,000
Mike, I've been thinking that...

811
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:17,667
diplomatically, we should
play up the fact that Martha

812
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,868
was in the vehicle.
Why is that, sir?

813
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,200
It will get rid of any suspicion
that we might have been...

814
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:24,801
( phone rings )
shortchanging
Suvarov's security.

815
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:29,267
There he is.

816
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,834
( ringing continues )

817
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:37,033
Hello.

818
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,834
I thought we had
an understanding.

819
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:40,534
I had nothing
to do with this.

820
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,801
You have to believe me.
It was your job

821
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:44,100
to make sure no
one interfered

822
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,601
with the attack
on the Suvarovs.

823
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,534
It happened outside
of my authority.

824
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:49,133
I told no one.

825
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,234
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

826
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,067
then its new ally,
the United States,

827
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:56,767
will pay with the lives
of its citizens.

828
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,767
Mr. President,
this is our final conversation.

829
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:01,567
Good-bye.
No. Wait!
