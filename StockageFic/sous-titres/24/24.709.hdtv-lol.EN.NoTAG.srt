<i>PRÉCÉDEMMENT DANS</i> 24

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:15,410
You son of a bitch.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,674
You're behind my son's death.

6
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,478
<i>Madame President,
I have your husband.</i>

7
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,914
You will have your forces withdrawn
from around my country, Sangala,

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,483
immediately and permanently.

9
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:28,277
Or your husband will die
a slow and certain death.

10
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:31,955
I just wanted to make sure
you were still coming to dinner tonight.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,241
Marika, I can't.
I'll make it up to you.

12
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>If you're looking for Marika,
she's not with me.</i>

13
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,454
I'm looking for you, Samuel.

14
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>Or whatever your real name is.</i>

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,387
Now, I don't know
who you really are, and I don't care.

16
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:45,461
I just want you
out of my sister's life.

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,432
Keep an incident quiet until
what Jack and I are doing goes down.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,840
- What incident?
- Vossler's dead.

19
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,772
Jack killed him at the hotel
on 18th and Reagan. It was self-defense.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,306
Damn it, Renee, what the hell
are you doing with this guy?

21
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,819
You're supposed to bring suspects in,
not murder them.

22
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,989
Until we know who Dubaku's source is,
handle this outside of the Bureau.

23
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,084
Dubaku is the only person with the names
of the people who betrayed you.

24
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,577
It's imperative we find him.

25
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,624
You resigned from government service

26
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,457
and the Senate regards you
as having been a renegade agent.

27
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:27,628
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

28
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:30,275
With all due respect,
Madame President,

29
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:31,763
ask around.

30
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,051
I got an address for Henry Taylor.

31
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,099
Get an ambulance!

32
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:51,325
CES ÉVÈNEMENTS SE DÉROULENT
ENTRE 16 H 00 ET 17 H 00.

33
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:02,755
No one else gets through here.

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Follow me.

35
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,863
It's the president's husband,

36
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,827
but that information
is not to be disseminated. Clear?

37
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,974
Mr. Taylor, don't speak.
I need you to save your energy.

38
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:26,553
Over here!

39
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:29,940
Excuse me.
Step back, please.

40
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,569
This is Unit Six.
We have a gunshot trauma to the chest...

41
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,400
- 9 mm round.
- 9 mm sub-sternal. Pulse is rapid.

42
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,313
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,443
I'm gonna call the president.
Search all the rooms,

44
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:44,169
get anything off their hardware
that could tell us where Dubaku went.

45
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,012
This is Jack Bauer.
I need to speak with the president.

46
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,381
<i>Hold one moment, please.</i>

47
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,592
Madame President,

48
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,621
I would encourage you
not to lose hope.

49
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,846
Dubaku knows
we tried to deceive him, Ethan.

50
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,281
He has no reason
to keep Henry alive.

51
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,822
<i>Madame President,
Jack Bauer is on line one.</i>

52
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,227
Put him through.

53
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,730
Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.

54
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:12,817
We have your husband.
He is alive, but he sustained

55
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,834
<i>a gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

56
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,154
How bad is it?

57
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:20,908
EMTs are stabilizing him. They're ready
to transfer him to Arlington Hospital.

58
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:25,371
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.
Is my husband going to be okay?

59
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,893
We're not gonna know anything
until the doctors see him.

60
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,042
I have to warn you,
he has lost a lot of blood.

61
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,086
Jack, it's Bill.
Do you have Dubaku?

62
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,142
Negative.
He was gone before we got here.

63
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:37,380
Madam President, since your husband was
the only leverage that Dubaku had left,

64
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,051
it's safe to say that he's trying
to leave the country now.

65
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,263
Have you any idea
how he intends to do that?

66
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,974
Not at this time. All his men
were killed during the assault.

67
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:48,143
Agent Walker and I will stay behind.
We'll continue to search the area.

68
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,230
We have to assume that Dubaku
has an exit strategy already in place.

69
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,712
Whatever we're going to do to find him,
we're going to have to do it fast.

70
00:03:56,312 --> 00:04:00,239
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.
Please keep me apprised on everything.

71
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,470
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,910
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,914
I am so sorry, Madame President.

74
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,461
Ethan, I'm going to the hospital
to be with my husband.

75
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,422
Ma'am, that's not possible.

76
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,738
You're executing
a military invasion.

77
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:21,930
My generals can execute it
perfectly well without me.

78
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:26,188
We can't ignore the fact
the Secret Service has been compromised.

79
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,878
There's no way we can ensure your safety
outside the White House.

80
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,780
I don't give a damn. I am not going
to be held prisoner in this office

81
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,405
while my husband
is fighting for his life.

82
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,943
Now, either find someone to take me
to the hospital or I'll go there myself.

83
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,238
Madame President,
you know my record of service.

84
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,198
If it's acceptable to you,
I'm willing

85
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,347
to assume responsibility
for your security.

86
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,162
Bill, you're no longer credentialed.
You don't have the authority.

87
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,122
Until we capture Dubaku
and interrogate him,

88
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,228
we have no idea who
in the government is working for him.

89
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,127
You do not know who you can trust.

90
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:56,962
But I can trust you.

91
00:04:57,462 --> 00:05:00,709
I brought this conspiracy
to your attention, Madame President.

92
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,631
I would hope that I've earned it.

93
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:07,181
- What do you need from me?
- Reinstate my government clearance,

94
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,850
allow me the authority
to vet White House staff,

95
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:13,057
and allow me to bring
one of my own people into FBI

96
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,189
to provide Larry Moss
with tactical support.

97
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,690
Who do you want to bring in?

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,745
Chloe O'Brian. I can vouch for her.
She's the best there is.

99
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,197
Her clearances were also revoked
when CTU was decommissioned.

100
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,658
Isn't there anyone
capable of handling

101
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,826
these duties
without our having to reinstate her?

102
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,746
Someone in the Bureau
is on Dubaku's payroll.

103
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,082
Until we find out who it is,
Larry Moss can't take

104
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,668
the chance of bringing his own people
into a manhunt for Dubaku.

105
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,138
All right.

106
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,341
The Director of White House Secret
Service Operations is Agent Hovis.

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,195
I'll order him to turn over
security protocols to you.

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,055
I know Ted Hovis. He's not gonna
like this, he's gonna fight us.

109
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,824
Considering that agents
under his charge are responsible

110
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,894
for what happened to my husband,
I don't give a damn what he likes.

111
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,898
You have your provisional appointment,
under the authority of this office.

112
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,024
Thank you.

113
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,026
Thank me
by getting me to the hospital.

114
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,643
I'll make the arrangements.

115
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,882
- Madame President...
- Your concerns are clear to me, Ethan,

116
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:09,076
- but I've made my decision.
- I'm only trying to do my job,

117
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,767
- looking out for your interests.
- My interest right now

118
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,456
is catching Ike Dubaku.

119
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,875
He has killed
scores of Americans today,

120
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,470
he tried to kill my husband,
and he has corrupted our government.

121
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,454
Whatever it takes,
I want that son of a bitch found.

122
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:29,976
Marika...

123
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,019
Samuel, what are you doing here?

124
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,520
We need to talk.

125
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,357
- Okay, I get a break in 20 minutes.
- No, now.

126
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,362
- Come.
- What is it? You're scaring me.

127
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:49,165
Something has come up.
I need to leave the country.

128
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,936
- What? When?
- Right away.

129
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:55,093
I don't understand.
When are you coming back?

130
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:58,245
Marika, listen to me.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

131
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,754
My visa expired a couple of months ago
and I've been in the country illegally.

132
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,370
I'm afraid the immigration people
have caught up with me.

133
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:09,011
It was my sister, wasn't it?
She reported you, didn't she?

134
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,765
That doesn't matter now.
I have to leave the country tonight,

135
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:15,184
- and I want you to come with me.
- Tonight?

136
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,519
Marika, we've talked about this.

137
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,773
I promised you I would take you away,
give you the happiness that you deserve.

138
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,693
Samuel, I want that, too, but...
but not tonight, not so soon.

139
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,368
Marika, I don't have time
to argue with you!

140
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,992
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:36,538
I can't leave Rosa. She needs me.
I'm the only one she has

142
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,782
- to takes care of her. You know that.
- I know, I know.

143
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,836
- Which is why she's going to join us.
- Join us?

144
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,403
As soon as possible.

145
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,001
I could only arrange tickets
for both of us tonight,

146
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:49,829
but I want you to promise
not to tell your sister of our plans,

147
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,721
- at least not yet.
- I have to. I can't just run off.

148
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,893
No, no, she might cause trouble for us,
make it impossible for us to leave.

149
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:00,813
I promise you

150
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:04,149
your sister will join us
within a couple of days of our arrival.

151
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,568
- Okay?
- Our arrival where?

152
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:09,571
Belize. I have shown you
the photographs of my home there.

153
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:14,910
Do you love me?

154
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,274
You know I do.

155
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,685
Then trust me.

156
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:21,458
Say you'll come.

157
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,548
I'll get my things.

158
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,536
I still need to finalize
our arrangements.

159
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,168
I want you to go home and pack.
Wait for my call.

160
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,293
All right.

161
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,157
It's me.
Have you made the preparations?

162
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:56,154
Almost. It's been tricky
clearing a flight corridor

163
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,829
since FAA still has most private
and commercial aircraft grounded.

164
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,871
I have faith you'll manage.

165
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:04,126
- The arrangements are for 2 passengers?
- Just as you requested.

166
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,584
Are you sure
you want to leave now, Colonel?

167
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,090
General Juma will not be pleased
to learn you're abandoning your mission.

168
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,695
The mission is over.

169
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,011
I have done what I can do.
If that is not enough for Juma,

170
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,596
then to hell with him.

171
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,228
I've got your passports
and itinerary in hand.

172
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,094
We meet at our usual spot
in half an hour.

173
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,901
- I'll bring them.
- No,

174
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,671
we'll meet in the lobby
of the Roosevelt Continental Hotel.

175
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:29,568
That's not a good idea.
It'll be crowded there at this hour.

176
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,548
I know. I want to make it earlier.

177
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,097
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

178
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:39,846
Go.

179
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,210
I can't get it to boot.
Hard drive must be fried.

180
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,831
Let's search the bodies.
Start with him.

181
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,805
- Yeah.
<i>- Renee, it's me.</i>

182
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,766
Buchanan just briefed me
on your situation.

183
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,267
What's Henry Taylor's status?

184
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,895
They've got him in an ambulance
en route to Arlington Hospital.

185
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,556
I don't know his condition.

186
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,017
Buchanan told me
you and Bauer were in a firefight.

187
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,198
Yeah, we took down
six of Dubaku's men,

188
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,270
but Dubaku was gone
before we got there.

189
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,709
- You all right?
- I've been in worse.

190
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,435
<i>You sure?</i>

191
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,485
- I'm fine, Larry.
<i>- Really?</i>

192
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:24,289
I'm not so sure about that.

193
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,982
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- I'm looking at a report

194
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:30,155
faxed to me from Metro Police.

195
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:32,130
A Mrs. Carol Vossler

196
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,917
is claiming an unidentified woman held
her and her child hostage at gunpoint.

197
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,287
She says the woman threatened
to kill her son.

198
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:41,136
Larry, we discussed this.

199
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:43,587
We had to get Vossler to tell us
where Taylor was being held.

200
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,728
- It was the only leverage we had.
- Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.

201
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,815
Jack Bauer's rationalization
for every unethical action he takes.

202
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,067
It worked, Larry.
Doesn't that count for something?

203
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,051
Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be
strung up by a senate subcommittee,

204
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,738
and you are following his playbook.

205
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,976
<i>The AG's office looks into that thing
you pulled with Tanner's respirator,</i>

206
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,181
<i>and now this.</i>

207
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,995
No one was actually hurt.

208
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,163
No one...?

209
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:06,999
Renee, Bauer killed
the woman's husband!

210
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>Renee, I swear to you here,
I am scared of what is happening to you.</i>

211
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:15,951
<i>You put these people through hell
and it doesn't bother you.</i>

212
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,344
I didn't say that it doesn't bother me.
I said that it worked.

213
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,089
Of course it bothers me.

214
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,062
I can see that woman's face.

215
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,023
She and her child
staring at me with such...

216
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:33,903
She had no idea that her husband
was a killer, a traitor to his country,

217
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,621
and she looked at me
like I was the monster.

218
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,821
Agent Walker.

219
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,989
Hold on.

220
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:41,486
I cross-referenced the information
on these PDAs.

221
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,561
I came across
some banking transactions.

222
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,330
All from a series of accounts
registered to the same address.

223
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,498
- It's a safe house?
- It's worth a shot.

224
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,625
We may have an address on Dubaku.

225
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,969
21917 Euclid Street. Apartment six.

226
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,621
21917 Euclid Street, unit six.

227
00:11:57,746 --> 00:12:00,061
We're moving out now.
Can you provide sat surveillance?

228
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,389
Bill Buchanan's sending
somebody over to run tech,

229
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,804
but until she's up and running,
you'll have to go in blind.

230
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,513
Okay. We'll be in touch.

231
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,113
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

232
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,896
Let's go.

233
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,109
<i>Federal investigations continue
into the terrorist acts</i>

234
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:04,116
<i>that have gripped
the nation's capital,</i>

235
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,243
<i>as well as
the people of Kidron, Ohio.</i>

236
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:09,659
<i>Despite assurances by President Taylor
in her national address</i>

237
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,366
<i>that the threat has passed.</i>

238
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,807
<i>Sources at the White House
will not confirm</i>

239
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,748
<i>that all those responsible
have been accounted for.</i>

240
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:22,008
Are you sure you don't need my help?

241
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,551
I'm just running FBI ops temporarily
until they catch Dubaku.

242
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:27,458
Once they find him,
he'll tell us the names

243
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,766
of all his people
that are inside our government.

244
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,518
And then, we can go home?

245
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,261
Then, we can go home.

246
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:37,107
Well, just be careful. All right?

247
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,961
'Cause if Buchanan's right and Dubaku
has someone working inside the Bureau...

248
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,883
I'll watch my back.
You just watch Prescott.

249
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,221
Okay, sweetheart, Mommy has
to go to work. You be good, okay?

250
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,750
Bye, Mommy.

251
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,368
- You be good, too.
- I will.

252
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:03,048
And if you get all jammed up,
you know where to find me.

253
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,489
I need you to cross-reference
our deployments with Homeland.

254
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:13,689
Make sure the numbers match up.
After that, catch up on the hourlies.

255
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:17,004
Are you joking? That is busy work,
administrative crap you're handing me.

256
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,129
Janis...

257
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:21,067
I don't have the time or the inclination
to explain my assignments to you.

258
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,131
Get it done.

259
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,254
Agent Moss,
Chloe O'Brian just cleared security.

260
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,072
- She's on her way up.
- Thank you.

261
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,493
Janis, set up a secure VPN socket.
Port it to the conference room.

262
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,744
Why do you need it?

263
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,730
I'm bringing
a consultant from Homeland

264
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,956
to confirm there are no lingering gaps
in the firewall.

265
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,134
That's fine. Take that downstairs.

266
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,188
Ms. O'Brian,

267
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,000
Larry Moss. Welcome to the FBI.

268
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,555
- Hi. You can call me Chloe.
- All right, we're right in here.

269
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,601
- Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.
- I'm up.

270
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,925
Good. Agent Walker and Bauer
are pursuing a potential lead on Dubaku.

271
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,101
They're en route to this address
in the Mount Pleasant District.

272
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,403
Agent Walker's requesting
satellite support.

273
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,362
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

274
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:10,859
I'm feeling a little exposed.

275
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,954
If someone here is working for Dubaku,
shouldn't we do this more covertly?

276
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,831
As far as anyone knows, you're working
on shoring up our firewall.

277
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,396
Besides, this is the only space
where you'll have access to our server.

278
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,026
Our network doesn't support
remote modules.

279
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:24,195
That's inefficient.

280
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,675
Whoever set your network up
didn't know what they were doing.

281
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:30,428
I set our network up that way.

282
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:33,557
Okay.

283
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,151
Something else?

284
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,113
You worked with Bauer
for a long time, didn't you?

285
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:50,824
Seven years, on and off.

286
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:53,118
That's impressive.

287
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,621
That you survived the experience.

288
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,333
- What are you talking about?
- Only that a lot of people didn't.

289
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,502
Curtis Manning, Ryan Chapelle.

290
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,962
His own wife.

291
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,799
Are you saying it's Jack's fault
his wife was killed?

292
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,175
You tell me.

293
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:13,657
Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy,
honorable man I know and he's my friend.

294
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,286
You should worry less about him

295
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:18,655
and more about the mole in your office
working for Dubaku.

296
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,915
- Is that Chloe O'Brian?
- What?

297
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,044
In the conference room. Chloe O'Brian.
She was senior analyst at CTU.

298
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,437
I once took a seminar she gave.
What's she doing here?

299
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:43,096
Larry said Homeland sent her over

300
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,850
to check for residual breaches
from the firewall attack.

301
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:48,357
What?

302
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,467
It just doesn't sound
like her area of expertise.

303
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:54,094
As far as I know, she's been inactive
since CTU was decommissioned.

304
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,159
Your passports and travel itinerary.

305
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,590
A Hawker-Siddley 748
is fueling at Taft Airfield.

306
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:16,618
Be ready to fly within a half hour,
get you to the Cayman Islands.

307
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,900
You shouldn't have trouble
to get to Belize from there.

308
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,122
I need a car to the airfield
and a driver.

309
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:23,124
I assumed you had
your own transportation.

310
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:24,751
It's not for me.

311
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,212
I see. It's for the girl.

312
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,800
Well, I'm not sure I can find
someone I trust on such short notice.

313
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,968
Really?

314
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,764
- What about your man at the bar?
- Excuse me?

315
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,891
Or one of the two on the balcony
watching us now?

316
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,895
Or the two in the black Town Car
waiting for me to leave?

317
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you think I am a fool,
Mr. Burnett?

318
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:49,476
I know you people
see me as a liability now.

319
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,696
These men are here to guarantee
your safety, not to threaten it.

320
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,419
Guarantee my safety.

321
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:56,797
How nice.

322
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,661
And said with such sincerity.

323
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,127
I want you to take
this message back with you.

324
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,921
If anything should happen to me
on my way out of the country,

325
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,605
an accident or

326
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,789
an assassination attempt,
anything...

327
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:18,680
if the plane that you were so generous
to donate decides to explode,

328
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,942
a data file with all the names and bank
transactions of all those involved

329
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,055
will be sent
to the Justice Department.

330
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,613
That is completely unnecessary.

331
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,106
The same holds true if anything
should happen to Marika Donoso.

332
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,775
I swear to you,
she knows nothing of this.

333
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,359
She is no threat to you.

334
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,155
Make sure your driver knows this
before he brings her to me.

335
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,119
Do you understand what I am saying?

336
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,465
I want you to tell me
you understand what I am saying to you,

337
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,405
so there will be no mistakes.

338
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:44,748
I understand.

339
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,916
Good.

340
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,279
The one thing I have learned
in company of mercenaries, Mr. Burnett,

341
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,467
is that ultimately, they care
about nothing but their own survival.

342
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,274
Good day.

343
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:12,101
I was right. Dubaku suspected
we were gonna take him out,

344
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:15,354
and apparently, he's assembled evidence
to use as an insurance policy.

345
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:17,777
We need to make sure
he gets out of the country.

346
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,509
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

347
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:21,074
I'll make the calls.

348
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:27,668
What are you doing?

349
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,043
Rosa.

350
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,644
- Where are you going?
- Rosa, listen to me.

351
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,083
We're going away from here.
All of us.

352
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,135
What do you mean, all?

353
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,096
Samuel told me the truth.

354
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,063
He's an illegal,
just like you thought.

355
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:48,645
He has to leave the country,
and I've agreed to go with him.

356
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,606
You're leaving me?

357
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,043
No, no, only for a short time.
You're gonna come, too.

358
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,238
Samuel's made plans. We're gonna
live with him in his home in Belize.

359
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,563
Marika...

360
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,658
he's lying to you.

361
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,669
- He's not.
- I won't let you do this!

362
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,329
My God, Rosa.

363
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,123
I have taken care of you
my entire life.

364
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,334
I've sacrificed everything for you.

365
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:14,087
- Why can't you let me have this?
- I don't trust him.

366
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:17,465
You never liked any man
who's ever shown an interest in me.

367
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,025
Every chance I've ever had at happiness,
you found some way of ruining it.

368
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,262
But not this time.

369
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,597
I'm begging you, listen to me.
Marika, please.

370
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,598
Stop.

371
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,016
Move!

372
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:30,224
Marika, please. Listen to me.
I'm begging you, Marik...

373
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,021
FBI, don't move!

374
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,107
Get on your knees now!
On your knees!

375
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:37,110
Both of you, put your hands behind
your head, interlock your fingers.

376
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:39,463
Now! Do not move.

377
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,217
We're clear.

378
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,132
- Where is Dubaku?
- Who?

379
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,089
Don't play games with me!
Ike Dubaku.

380
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,666
We traced bank accounts to this address.
Now, where is he?

381
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:54,622
We don't know
who you're talking about.

382
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,547
Let me try and make this easier for you.
You know this man?

383
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,718
No.

384
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,360
You're lying to me.
Why are you lying to me?!

385
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,221
Let me see.

386
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,853
That's him. We know him.

387
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,712
- He calls himself Aboa, Samuel Aboa.
- Rosa, shut up!

388
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,733
She was going to meet him
to leave me.

389
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:18,581
Where were you gonna meet him?

390
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:20,695
- Where were you going?!
- I don't know.

391
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,971
How do you know him?
You work for him?

392
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,046
- Do you work for him?
- No.

393
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:31,008
You know what he's doing here
in this country?

394
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:34,973
Do you have any idea...

395
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,045
what this man is?

396
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,552
He's everything to me.

397
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:12,672
- Nurse...?
- Mitchell.

398
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,723
Nurse Mitchell,
I'd like to see my husband.

399
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:16,674
Ma'am,
I don't know if that's possible.

400
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,841
I was told that Dr. Schulman
will be doing the surgery. Where is he?

401
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,866
Excuse me, Madame President.

402
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:24,557
I'm Lee Schulman,
your husband's surgeon.

403
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:27,089
You can see him now,
but you'll need to keep it brief.

404
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:28,214
Thank you.

405
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:29,967
You should know that

406
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,684
that Mr. Taylor's looking
at a minimum of 5 hours in surgery.

407
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,976
The bullet lacerated
his pulmonary artery

408
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,761
and lodged in his thoracic region.

409
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,585
He's also suffered
massive internal bleeding.

410
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,010
Can you offer any kind of prognosis?

411
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:46,155
I'm a blunt woman, Dr. Schulman.
I appreciate bluntness.

412
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,950
His chances aren't good, ma'am.

413
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,068
But I'll do everything I can.

414
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:54,516
If you'll excuse me.
I need to scrub up now.

415
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,208
Darling, can you hear me?

416
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,371
Yes, sweetheart.

417
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:09,984
I'm here.

418
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,487
I'm so sorry
I didn't listen to you about Roger.

419
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:16,284
You were right.
It wasn't suicide.

420
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,108
I know that now.
You were always right.

421
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:22,199
- He was a hero.
- Yes.

422
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,895
He was, and so are you.

423
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,240
I'm sorry, Madame President,
but the anesthesiologist is ready now.

424
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,046
Mr. Buchanan?

425
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,147
Yes, Madame President?

426
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,906
There's something
I need you to do for me.

427
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:08,529
Have someone find my daughter Olivia
and bring her to me.

428
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,691
Have you had a chance to tell her?

429
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,495
My daughter and I

430
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,900
haven't spoken for some time,
Mr. Buchanan.

431
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,425
She'd never get on the phone
with me.

432
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:27,090
She works for a consulting firm.
Martling/Norris.

433
00:24:27,954 --> 00:24:30,554
Do have someone trustworthy
you can send?

434
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,676
Yes, ma'am. I believe I do.

435
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:46,157
And here he is again
in the uniform of the Presidential Guard

436
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,032
at the gates
of the notorious Mukatu prison.

437
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:53,241
And here, inside the soccer stadium
after the Barakar Massacre.

438
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:57,328
The event that earned him the nickname
The Butcher of Sangala.

439
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,753
Please. No more.

440
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,970
What did you say
his real name was again?

441
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:07,095
Dubaku.

442
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,347
Ike Dubaku.

443
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,263
I've seen firsthand
what he's capable of.

444
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,240
I was in Africa a few months ago.

445
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,600
He was responsible
for murdering a friend of mine.

446
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,067
I know this is a shock.
And I'm sorry.

447
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,861
I really am. But here's the situation.
We need your help, and we need it now.

448
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,089
What kind of help?

449
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:35,967
We need to put this man in custody
before he can leave the country.

450
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,202
She already told you.
She doesn't know where he is.

451
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,902
But you said earlier
that you were going to meet him.

452
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:42,027
Where?

453
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,650
He didn't say.

454
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,170
Just told me to go home and pack
and wait for his call.

455
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:50,173
Give me your phone.

456
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:53,654
Why?

457
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,794
When he calls,
I want you to answer it.

458
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,139
- No, no. I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

459
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,574
Listen to me. Just listen to me.

460
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,661
It's over.

461
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,836
The man you thought you knew,

462
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,589
the man you had feelings for...

463
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,272
he doesn't exist.

464
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:14,005
All you've been left with
are his lies and his betrayal.

465
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,325
Is that him?

466
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:23,539
Marika, please.
All I want you to do is answer the phone

467
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:27,150
and talk to him so that we can find out
where he wants to meet you.

468
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,975
Please. You can do this.

469
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:30,588
Please just try.

470
00:26:39,352 --> 00:26:40,723
- Hello.
<i>- Marika?</i>

471
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:42,089
Yes.

472
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,185
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- I'm fine.

473
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:46,808
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

474
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:48,746
I was in the bedroom packing.

475
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:49,960
Where are you?

476
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,235
What's wrong?
You sound strange.

477
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:54,279
It's... It was Rosa.

478
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,754
She caught me packing,
and we argued.

479
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,492
- Is she going to be a problem for us?
- No.

480
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,870
I'm sorry, Samuel.
I had to tell her everything.

481
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,086
It was the only way.
But...

482
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:06,902
but she understands now.

483
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:08,282
Are you certain?

484
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,002
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.

485
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:13,943
Now that she knows she and I
will be together again in a few days.

486
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:18,052
She should thank heaven
she has such an angel for a sister.

487
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,638
<i>- Are you ready to go?</i>
- Almost.

488
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,890
Hurry up then.
I've had a car sent for you.

489
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,310
It should be there very shortly.
Go downstairs and wait for it.

490
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:30,273
- Where is it taking me?
- Don't worry. The driver will know.

491
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:34,494
I just want the woman I love to get
downstairs as quickly as possible.

492
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,696
Okay.

493
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:44,532
It's all right. You did great.

494
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:48,082
- Did we get the rendezvous point?
- No. He's sending a car with a driver.

495
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:50,266
Come here.

496
00:27:58,142 --> 00:27:59,719
There's no one on the street yet.

497
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,388
We could grab the driver
to tell us Dubaku's location.

498
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,180
There's no guarantee.

499
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:06,578
And if we take too long,
Dubaku's not gonna wait around.

500
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:07,685
What do we do?

501
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,066
We can get her to go meet with him.

502
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:16,504
- What?
- We could track her.

503
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,943
We could use
her cell phone as a transponder.

504
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:22,116
- You want to send that girl to Dubaku?
- We don't have another choice.

505
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:24,994
You want to get Dubaku,
this is our shot.

506
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,626
Marika?

507
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,770
I have a favor to ask of you.

508
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:40,203
We can't make you do this.

509
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,010
But when the car arrives,
we would like you to go with the driver

510
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:44,903
so that we could follow you back
to Dubaku.

511
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,225
What are you talking about?
You want her to go to him and face him?

512
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:51,379
It's the only chance we have
of finding him before he disappears.

513
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,604
I'll do it.

514
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:55,929
- I'll do it.
- No!

515
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:58,652
I'm your older sister,
and I won't allow it.

516
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:02,332
It's not your decision to make, Rosa.
It's mine.

517
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,285
And it's the right thing to do.

518
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,044
Let me see your phone.

519
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,599
- What are you doing?
- Getting your SID number.

520
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,632
It's how we're going to track you.
You're not gonna be out there alone.

521
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:23,065
We will be following you.
We'll never be more than a mile behind.

522
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,555
As soon as you reach the destination...
that's when we'll move in.

523
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Marika.

524
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,101
A mile! Are you crazy?

525
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,419
Rosa, enough.

526
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,489
You heard what he said.
He's a murderer!

527
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,399
- He could hurt you.
- He won't.

528
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,944
Rosa, I should have listened to you.

529
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:41,302
Sweetheart.

530
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,345
- You warned me about him.
- Listen,

531
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,889
the only reason why I said those things
was because I was jealous.

532
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,517
And I didn't want to lose you.

533
00:29:53,504 --> 00:29:56,419
Larry, it's Jack. Renee said you had
someone running operations support?

534
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,222
Yeah. She's right here.
I'll put you on speaker.

535
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Jack, it's Chloe.

536
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:03,344
- Chloe.
<i>- What do you need?</i>

537
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,078
How long's it gonna take you to set up
a SAT beacon for a mobile line?

538
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,948
With the backward way
they have the system set up,

539
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,558
it's gonna take a few minutes.

540
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,677
Okay,
let me give you the SID number.

541
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:16,084
1-C-4-8-6-8-9.

542
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:18,452
- You got it?
- Got it.

543
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:19,817
Who are you tracking?

544
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:23,832
A woman who's involved with Dubaku.
He's sending a car to take her to him.

545
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,843
She's one of his operatives?

546
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:28,268
No. It's more complicated than that.

547
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:07,286
Arthur,
you're not going to find another firm

548
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:09,171
that's done
more high-level consulting work

549
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:11,619
for a small pharmaceutical company
like yours.

550
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,397
Remember, my firm helped
the governor craft a plan

551
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,939
to swap property taxes for sales taxes
in his last budget reform.

552
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,255
Tell me that didn't save
Dexter-Carr a bundle.

553
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,630
It did, Olivia.

554
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:24,048
But since
I'm specifically looking to hire you,

555
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:26,120
I need to know
what you yourself can do.

556
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:27,558
Whatever you need.

557
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,434
You know my accomplishments,
you've seen my resume.

558
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,509
I mean White House influence.

559
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,763
Considering your family.

560
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:38,979
We're not lobbyists, Arthur.
It states that clearly in the contract.

561
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,607
I just thought,
since you had the president's ear...

562
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,810
I don't.

563
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,943
Is that going to be a problem?

564
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,668
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor?

565
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:51,404
- Do I know you?
- My name is Aaron Pierce.

566
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,817
Your office told me you'd be here.

567
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,539
I've been dispatched
at the request of the president.

568
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,652
Your credentials say
you've retired, Mr. Pierce.

569
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:02,920
Perhaps no one informed you I refused
Secret Service protection months ago.

570
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,465
I'm aware of that, ma'am.
This is a special circumstance.

571
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,510
Well, as you can see,
I'm a little busy right now.

572
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,429
- This isn't a good time.
- I'm sorry, but I have to insist.

573
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,515
- It's really... It's all right.
- No.

574
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:16,500
No, it's not all right.

575
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:19,388
What is it that's so important

576
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:21,855
for my mother to steal me away
while I'm trying to do business?

577
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,825
I'm not at liberty to say, madam.
That information is confidential.

578
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,949
- We can pick this up at a later time.
- Arthur, wait...

579
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,474
We'll be in touch.

580
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,203
Madam, please?

581
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:39,707
I'm not going anywhere with you
until you tell me what this is about.

582
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,794
It's your father, Ms. Taylor.

583
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,600
He's been shot.

584
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:49,105
He's in surgery
at West Arlington Hospital.

585
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,508
Your mother's there now.

586
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:53,178
None of this is public knowledge.

587
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:57,004
My God, I...

588
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,210
My car is just outside.

589
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,235
Excuse me, Sean.

590
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,613
Can I please get the digital
beta key for the server?

591
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,364
Why?

592
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:14,269
Larry asked for it.

593
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,395
Something to do
with the firewall assessment.

594
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,369
If Larry wants it,
why doesn't he come to me?

595
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,565
I don't know.

596
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:24,001
- Maybe I ought to go ask him.
- No.

597
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,750
Okay.

598
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:30,916
I think Larry brought in this woman,
Chloe O'Brian, to replace me.

599
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,892
And I just want to get a bead
on what they're working on. That's all.

600
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:36,305
That's all?
That's enough to lose us both our jobs.

601
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:39,600
Well, maybe I should stop
covering for you.

602
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,393
What are you talking about?

603
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,804
Erika and you, and your little
sexual indiscretions.

604
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,982
I've said nothing
to Larry or your wife.

605
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:49,524
I'm sure you'd like me
to keep it that way.

606
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:17,387
- You're a little bitch, you know that?
- You're a little bitch.

607
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,188
Jack. The link's up,
I've got the signal.

608
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,253
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

609
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:31,873
We're on.

610
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,433
Marika...

611
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,853
we got to go.

612
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:54,698
You. FBI.

613
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,428
You keep her safe, you hear me?

614
00:34:58,836 --> 00:34:59,836
We will.

615
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:10,638
I'm really scared.

616
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:13,580
You're going to be fine.
Just remember, we're right behind you.

617
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:14,855
Move up here.

618
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:18,208
Now, listen,
if you get into trouble,

619
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,702
- you can signal us by dialing one-zero.
- No, I don't want you to do that.

620
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:25,039
Don't do anything that's going to raise
the suspicion of the driver.

621
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:26,793
You're ready?

622
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:28,894
- I'm ready. Yeah.
- OK.

623
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:42,086
- What the hell are you doing?
- She was scared.

624
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,975
I wanted her to know there was another
option than waiting for us to swoop in.

625
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:49,021
If we're going to find Dubaku, there are
no other options, you understand?

626
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,564
You ran operations like this.

627
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,435
Not without full tactical support,
and two backup units on the scene.

628
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,320
- She's naked, Jack. I don't like it.
- This isn't about you.

629
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:59,078
This is about her and Dubaku.

630
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:03,819
Listen, life gets ugly, innocent people
get hurt, that's a reality.

631
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,865
At least she got to make a choice
to be involved, to do the right thing.

632
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,362
Which is a lot more than I can say
for Dubaku's other victims.

633
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,035
We have one job here.
That's to get Dubaku.

634
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,204
Outside of that don't get involved.

635
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,112
Chloe, the car's here.

636
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:20,625
<i>Copy that.</i>

637
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:29,143
She's getting in the car.

638
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:30,409
<i>Copy.</i>

639
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,571
She's moving.
Are you locked in?

640
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:42,241
Yeah, I've got them
heading south on 14th.

641
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,452
Can you upload the tracking grid
to Agent Walker's PDA?

642
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,037
No, I'll have to direct you.

643
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:50,062
- Just keep us close.
- Understood.

644
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,959
Head towards 14th, make a right.

645
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,127
Copy that.

646
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:42,384
How much further?

647
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:57,106
Continuing west on R Street,
crossing Hampshire Avenue.

648
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
You're a mile behind the target car.

649
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:00,282
<i>Copy that.</i>

650
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,280
Target car is turning,

651
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:04,852
<i>left on Connecticut.</i>

652
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,808
<i>OK, rounding Dupont Circle.</i>

653
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:09,453
<i>Agent Moss, is there anything
in the northern quad of the grid</i>

654
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,225
<i>that would indicate where Dubaku
can hide a plane or a helicopter?</i>

655
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,541
<i>No. Nothing definitive.
Could be any number of launch sites.</i>

656
00:38:18,184 --> 00:38:19,588
What was it?
What happened?

657
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:23,966
<i>Jack, we've got a problem.</i>

658
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:27,054
- Chloe, what's wrong?
- We just lost the tracking grid.

659
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,218
- What?
- I don't know. It just glitched out.

660
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,969
We can't afford to lose them. I gave
this woman my word we'd protect her.

661
00:38:32,094 --> 00:38:33,727
I know. Chloe, get it back up.

662
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,312
We're doing our best, here.

663
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:37,484
Wait.

664
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:40,316
- It's back up.
- What the hell happened?

665
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,569
I don't know,
I'm running a diagnostic right now.

666
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,068
Jack, they're moving southeast
on Massachusetts Avenue.

667
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,782
You've closed the gap
to a half mile.

668
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,201
- You may want to back off a little bit.
- OK, copy that.

669
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,432
- What?
- Somebody was in the system.

670
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,790
What?

671
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,582
I'm saying someone in this office
was mirroring my terminal.

672
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,711
Whoever it was
he knows exactly what we were doing.

673
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:09,864
Can you backtrace the breach?

674
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,141
No. The link was severed.
It could have come from anywhere.

675
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:20,148
<i>Jack, you getting this?</i>

676
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,527
<i>We might have a security breach.
Someone is mirroring our comm.</i>

677
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:25,279
Jack, they're coming from all sides.

678
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,483
- Larry, we got a situation here.
- What's going on?

679
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:32,327
I got Metro PDs trying to build
a roadblock around us.

680
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,499
<i>What?</i>

681
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:37,624
- <i>Why would they be doing that?</i>
- I don't know. Just get 'em off us!

682
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:50,971
Larry, do something!

683
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,515
Agent Moss. Connect me
with Metro District Command.

684
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,350
Hands in the air!

685
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:58,186
- My name is Jack Bauer.
- Get out of the car right now!

686
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,897
- My passenger is a Federal Agent.
- Get out of the car right now!

687
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,570
- On the ground!
- She's a federal agent!

688
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:07,210
Put your hands
behind your back, sir.

689
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:11,407
Come on, Larry, do something!

690
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:14,419
Captain, you've got to release
these people immediately! No.

691
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:15,714
No, that is a mistake.

692
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,280
No Federal warrants
have been issued for them!

693
00:40:18,405 --> 00:40:20,744
Yes, they have.
A warrant was called in for the vehicle.

694
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:24,041
"Occupants armed and dangerous,
to be apprehended with decisive force."

695
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,044
- Issued by whom?
- FBI. This office.

696
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:28,187
There's no attribution,
but the routing code's real.

697
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:30,536
This was definitely done
by someone here.

698
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,929
Marika's car just turned east
onto N Street.

699
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,342
Captain, listen carefully.

700
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,429
I'm the Special Agent
in charge of this operation,

701
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,435
and I am revoking
these warrants immediately.

702
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,210
No... No, I don't have time to deal
with your chain of command.

703
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:45,441
You need to release
these people right now.

704
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:50,653
Thank you.

705
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:54,076
- So is O'Brian here to replace you?
- I don't know. No.

706
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,871
Larry's using her for some kind
of covert operation with Jack Bauer.

707
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,915
- They're tracking a car to Dubaku.
- Why would he keep us in the dark

708
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,841
- about something like that?
- I don't know.

709
00:41:02,966 --> 00:41:04,666
I don't know, but I don't like it.

710
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
<i>Yes.</i>

711
00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:20,060
Hey, I took care of Bauer and Walker.
They're pinned down.

712
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,646
Why am I being brought in
on this so last minute?

713
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:24,689
Moss is running this Op on his own.

714
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,900
It took me some time

715
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,925
to tap into his phone line.

716
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,486
He's on with Metro right now.

717
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:33,781
Can you at least disable the tracking
signal they're using to follow the girl?

718
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,225
No, not from my console.

719
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,328
But judging by the frequency,
they're using her cell as the tracker.

720
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:39,453
All right.

721
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,747
Good work.

722
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:45,539
You told me that once Dubaku served
his purpose, you'd take him out.

723
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:48,155
- Why are we still helping him?
- He's threatening to expose us

724
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,091
using the database he's kept with names
and accounts of everyone involved.

725
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,011
Including mine?

726
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,220
I mean, everyone.

727
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,766
We don't know where the file is,
so you better pray that he gets away.

728
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:14,070
Yes, it has to do with the terrorist
threats that happened this morning.

729
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:29,378
- <i>You got a problem.</i>
- What is it?

730
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,465
Your girlfriend's been turned
by the FBI.

731
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:33,300
I don't believe you.

732
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,344
They met with her a half hour ago,
told her who you really are.

733
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:39,191
That's impossible.
Marika would never do this.

734
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:42,224
I got it from my source
inside the Bureau, it is definite.

735
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,463
She agreed to lead them to you,
using her cell phone as a tracker.

736
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,453
Look, my source managed to stall
their surveillance team for a while,

737
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:51,200
but you need to get
to the airfield immediately.

738
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:53,431
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

739
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,003
No. I'll do it.

740
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:57,908
Colonel, I told you,
they are tracking her.

741
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:00,660
If you let her come to you,
you're risking your chances of escape.

742
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,161
I said, I'll take care of her!
