1
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,834
I'm reprogramming

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,734
a CTU key car right now.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,333
Good.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,101
Our couriers are delivering
the canisters to the targets.

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,000
They'll be in place soon.

6
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,101
When are you launching
your attacks?

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,366
After you're done at CTU.

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:28,767
GARDNER:
When these terrorists attack,

9
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,067
you're going to need
to maintain order.

10
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:32,600
I believe we should be thinking

11
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,134
of a preemptive declaration
of martial law.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,700
in the Greater
Los Angeles area.

13
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:37,967
If CTU

14
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,533
can't find
this man, Bierko,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,767
we're gonna get hit!

16
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,201
Why didn't you
just tell me

17
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,333
you were alive?

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,667
JACK:
If you knew I was alive,

19
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,000
you would have been at risk,

20
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,101
and I had no choice.

21
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm happy
that you're alive-- I am,

22
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,500
but I can't give you
what you want right now.

23
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,500
Michelle's murder
was part of a bigger plan.

24
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:59,467
to supply terrorists
with Sentox nerve gas.

25
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,700
Who's behind it?

26
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,700
BUCHANAN:
Christopher Anderson.

27
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,700
Whatever he's not telling us
is important.

28
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:07,167
And he's willing to tolerate
an inhuman amount of pain.

29
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,567
Thousands of lives
are at stake.

30
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:12,034
There is enough time for you
to tell me what I need to know

31
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,633
to stop this insanity, please!

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,700
I'm sorry, guy,

33
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,201
but I can't tell you
what you want to know.

34
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,633
( phone ringing )

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,500
This is Bauer.
BUCHANAN:
We've been compromised!

36
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,233
Someone used a stolen key card
to access CTU

37
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,967
less than an hour ago.

38
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,333
JACK:
Freeze!

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,101
Drop the gun!

40
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,867
Bill, it's Jack.

41
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:35,034
I think he tried to deploy nerve
gas throughout the building.

42
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,633
BUCHANAN:
Code six, everybody out!

43
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,633
Go, go!

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,567
Seal all the rooms.

45
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,233
Oh, no.

46
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,567
Chloe.

47
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,233
MAN ( over P.A. ):
All CTU personnel.

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,834
This facility
has been contaminated

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,366
with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

50
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,034
Repeat: this facility
has been contaminated.

51
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,734
There are two safe zones
on the main floor--

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,500
the Situation Room and Medical.

53
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,433
On the second floor,

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,201
the safe zones
are Mr. Buchanan's office

55
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,934
and Holding Room Four.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
These areas will remain sealed,
pending the arrival

57
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,233
of the Chemical Response Team.

58
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,700
If you are in any of these
sealed areas, do not attempt

59
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,500
to leave until the CRT
clears the environment.

60
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,201
I'm on my way, but it could take
20 to 30 minutes

61
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,101
to gather all the CRT
personnel you'll need.

62
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,734
I understand, Curtis,
but we need CRT

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,266
here now!

64
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,700
This is a high priority.

65
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,500
Get here as fast as you can.

66
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,167
All right, copy-- I'll call you
in a few minutes with updates,

67
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,366
( phone ringing )

68
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,567
This is Bauer.

69
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,934
Jack, it's Bill.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,101
I just talked to Curtis.

71
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,533
He's with the Chemical
Response Team.

72
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,467
They won't be able to get here
for at least 30 minutes.

73
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,767
Why not?

74
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,600
Most of their units
were sent to Tyler Memorial.

75
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,167
The rest are en route
to high probability targets.

76
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,567
Okay, we're going
to keep working here.

77
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,000
Our networks
are still up, right?

78
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, the phones are working,
the computers are up.

79
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,967
I can coordinate with Division
from here.

80
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,667
What do you need where you are?

81
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,300
I need to know if Henderson
is still alive.
Where is he?

82
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,467
Agent Burke was transferring him

83
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,067
over to the Isolation Clinic
in Medical.

84
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,700
I don't know if they made it
before the barriers went down.

85
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,266
You can tell if you pull up
a building grid.

86
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,800
What about CTU's
chemical response plan?

87
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:58,767
Chloe, my name
is Dr. Landes.

88
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,834
Now, he was a friend of yours--
what was his name?

89
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,968
Edgar.
Edgar.

90
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,767
LANDES:
I'd like you to turn away
from Edgar

91
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,501
and focus on me, please.

92
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,267
Chloe,
you're in shock,

93
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:11,968
and I'd like to help you
through it.

94
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,167
The only thing
I'm going to ask you to do

95
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:16,901
is sit in this chair
and collect your breath.

96
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,300
Let's do that now.

97
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:31,934
Just collect your breath,
just for a second.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,601
He was such a good guy.

99
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,701
I just treated him
like crap all day.

100
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:46,133
This is my fault.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,667
Sir?

102
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,300
Someone stole my key card

103
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,200
and used it to get
into the building.

104
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:56,067
It was missing,
and I didn't say anything.

105
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,801
Why not?

106
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:01,234
I thought they just stole
my wallet for the money.

107
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,734
How could you not report it?

108
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:06,033
I was embarrassed.

109
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,567
I didn't want anyone to know
I got beat up.

110
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:13,334
So we're all going to die,
because you were embarrassed?

111
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,200
( man groans )

112
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,567
Mr. Almeida, what are you doing?

113
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:23,834
I want to know
what's going on.

114
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,000
No, I can't allow that.

115
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:26,567
I'm not sitting
in this damn bed

116
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:27,968
while CTU is under attack--
got it?

117
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,934
Fine.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,767
How long are we supposed to
be sectioned off like this?

119
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,000
I haven't received
any news.

120
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,367
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,200
Jack, we've got
the building grid.

122
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,200
( dialing )

123
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:47,501
( ringing )
Buchanan.

124
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,234
Bill, it's Jack--
the grid's up.

125
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,634
All right, check the isolation
zones that have logged in.

126
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,434
You'll have survivors.

127
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,033
Two zones have logged on
in Medical.

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,534
Try them.

129
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,701
I'm going to keep
this line open.

130
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, hold on.

131
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,601
( phone ringing )

132
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,834
Clinic.
Dr. Besson, it's Jack Bauer.

133
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,200
Jack, what's going on?

134
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,801
One of the terrorists
infiltrated CTU

135
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,534
and deployed a canister
of Sentox nerve gas

136
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,968
through the ventilation system.

137
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,567
That's why we needed to seal off
as many rooms as possible.

138
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,300
I need to know if Agent Burke
got to Medical with Henderson.

139
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,300
Yes, he did.

140
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,801
Henderson's here right now?

141
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,634
Tony, is that you?

142
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,968
Jack, how much longer
are we going to be locked down?

143
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,801
Right now, we're in standby--
we're trying to figure out

144
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,934
how to clean out the air supply.

145
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,133
Dr. Besson?

146
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,133
Dr. Besson?

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,234
Tony!

148
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,567
Get me a security feed
over at Medical.

149
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,467
Jack, I don't think this
program is set up for that.

150
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:41,767
Try a redirect.
All right.

151
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,434
Dr. Besson!

152
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,000
( phone beeps off )

153
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,167
BURKE:
What are you doing?
Move aside.

154
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,701
( system beeps )

155
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,934
My God, he's got a gun.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,968
Patch me through
to their intercom.
Do it.

157
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,467
We'll be able to hear them,
but they can't hear us yet.

158
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,834
BURKE:
You can't kill him.

159
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,767
He's got information
we need.
He killed my wife!

160
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,067
Tony, please, don't kill him.
Move aside, Rick!

161
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,934
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,667
Move it!

163
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:27,267
Henderson!

164
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,267
You remember me?

165
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,801
My name is Tony Almeida.

166
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:34,801
You killed my wife,
Michelle Dessler, this morning.

167
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:35,901
He's going to kill him-- hurry!

168
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,334
Hurry!

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,167
She was my life,

170
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,300
and you took her.

171
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,667
And now,
I'm going to take yours.

172
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,734
I got it.

173
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,067
Tony, it's Jack.

174
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,400
I've got you
on the security feed.

175
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,534
Stay out of this, Jack!

176
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,067
Tony, please, just listen to me.

177
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,601
You can't do this.

178
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,734
I know how you
feel right now.

179
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,701
I lost Terry
the exact same way,

180
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,567
to one of our own.

181
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,901
I know what it feels
to be betrayed like this.

182
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:10,033
But, Tony, Henderson
has information

183
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,000
that can save thousands
and thousands of lives.

184
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,400
And I know that doesn't make you
feel better right now,

185
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,734
but I know you, Tony.

186
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,734
I know you don't want to make
this situation

187
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:25,000
any worse than it is.

188
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,434
Please?

189
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:34,200
Please, just let us finish
our interrogation.

190
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,634
Hurry up.

191
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,868
Agent Burke, please continue.

192
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,734
We have to get him talking.

193
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,100
He's our only lead to Bierko

194
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:54,534
and the rest
of the Sentox canisters.

195
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,267
Tell me where to find Bierko.

196
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,734
( grunts )

197
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,901
Where?

198
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,100
Nowhere.

199
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,400
BURKE:
What is your computer password?

200
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,300
No.

201
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,367
I know no password.

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,467
JACK:
Agent Burke,

203
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,400
can we increase
the dose?

204
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,501
Not without killing him.

205
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,234
Okay, take a short break
and then start again.

206
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,400
Get back to me as soon

207
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:28,534
as you've got anything.

208
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,968
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:35,667
GARDNER:
How could CTU have been hit?

210
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:38,067
We're not sure,
Mr. Vice President.

211
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,300
Are you telling me

212
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,167
they didn't have
any safeguards in place?

213
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:44,133
They had partial containment,
but our early reports indicate

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,767
that 40% of their personnel
have been taken out.

215
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,834
You mean
they've been killed?

216
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,968
We're afraid so, sir.

217
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,567
CTU is protecting
this city.

218
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,501
Are you saying
they're no longer
capable of doing that?

219
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:59,267
I'm saying they've been
seriously compromised, yes.

220
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,767
So what are we going
to do, Ms. Hayes?

221
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:01,734
We've got terrorists

222
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,100
with nerve gas canisters
out there.

223
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,868
Who is going
to stop them?

224
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,701
Mr. President, I suggest
an emergency restructuring.

225
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,200
Meaning what?

226
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,567
Meaning that the Chemical
Response Team

227
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,601
will go in

228
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:12,767
neutralize the nerve gas
at CTU

229
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,801
and I will take a team
in there and personally

230
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:15,868
manage the operation.

231
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,734
How soon can you do that?

232
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,968
Within the hour.

233
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,701
Fine. Do it.

234
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:22,968
Yes, sir.

235
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,367
All right, they're still
somewhat operational.

236
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,767
It's not a complete
disaster.

237
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:27,601
Mr. President, it is.

238
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,801
I can see no other option
right now

239
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,601
but to impose martial law
on the city of Los Angeles.

240
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,501
Hal, my advisors believe if the
military takes over the streets

241
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,000
and starts detaining people,
it could create mayhem.

242
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,501
Sir, it's only a matter of time

243
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,467
before more canisters
are released

244
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,467
in public places

245
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,701
and then you will have
mayhem.

246
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:44,834
Except without the soldiers

247
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:46,000
you'll need to contain it.

248
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,467
So what do I tell
the public?

249
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,501
That we've got nerve gas
canisters all over the city,

250
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,067
but we don't know
where they are?!

251
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,067
No, no, you don't have
to get into that.

252
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,234
Tie it to that earlier
incident at the airport.

253
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,033
I'm going to get resistance
from all sides.

254
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
That's true, sir.

255
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,534
We may have to swallow

256
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,467
some saltwater,
but wouldn't it be worth it,

257
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:06,167
if we can keep
the people off the streets,

258
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:08,767
safe from
another public attack?

259
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,701
I don't know, Hal.

260
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,200
Sir, consider this--

261
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,400
if we clear the streets
of everybody

262
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,367
except the military,
these terrorists won't be able

263
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,300
to move as freely
as they are right now.

264
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:21,801
We have to do
whatever we can

265
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,367
to stop the people behind this.

266
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,033
CTU is no longer
an obstacle.

267
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,567
At least for
the time being.

268
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,234
Good.
Have our men move

269
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,968
from their current positions
and go to the new target.

270
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,601
How much of the nerve gas
will they release there?

271
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,334
All of it.

272
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,334
Excuse me.

273
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,334
Chloe, are you ready
to go back to work?

274
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,767
What do you need?

275
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,868
I need you.

276
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,000
We can't break Henderson.

277
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,133
I need you to keep trying
to decrypt the files

278
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,234
that we took
from his computer.

279
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,234
I already tried that.

280
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,267
It didn't work.

281
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:19,634
Maybe somebody else
could do it.

282
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:23,167
Chloe, you're the only person
in the room qualified.

283
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,400
Chloe, please.

284
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,934
Don't shut down on me now.

285
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,667
I'm upset about everything
that's happening too,

286
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,367
but you know how
things work around here.

287
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,968
We do not quit
until it's over.

288
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,367
You're not helping her.
You're just making things worse.

289
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,734
I am sure that you
are qualified

290
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,501
to help someone through
this kind of distress

291
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,834
over an extended
period of time,

292
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,367
but you see, we do not have

293
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,167
an extended
period of time.

294
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,267
So if you don't mind
stepping aside

295
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,934
so I can do my job,
I would appreciate it.

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Believe it or not, Jack,

297
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,567
you don't have to be
qualified to help people.

298
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,000
You just have to be there
for them.

299
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,067
Like you were there
for my daughter.

300
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,734
What does that mean?

301
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:04,501
You're 20 years older
than she is.

302
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,501
I know exactly

303
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:07,934
what you're doing.

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,267
I've done nothing but try
and help her deal with her loss.

305
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,334
How dare you accuse me
of taking advantage of her.

306
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
You did...

307
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,200
Dad, stop!

308
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:16,601
You can be angry
at me all you want,

309
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,234
but before I met Barry,
I didn't want to live.

310
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,400
Do you understand that?

311
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:25,267
Fine, I'll get back to work
if everyone could just relax.

312
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,667
Jack, we have a problem.

313
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:33,267
What?

314
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,601
( beeping )

315
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,234
Chloe, I just saw

316
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,767
the alarm.
What's going on?

317
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,734
The seal pressure indicators
in the contaminated zones

318
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,834
are showing traces
of sublimated polymer

319
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,100
near the partition seal.

320
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,334
What does that mean?

321
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,267
It means that the nerve gas
must be mixed

322
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,434
with a corrosive agent--

323
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:50,467
an acid.

324
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:51,734
The acid's breaking down
the seal

325
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:54,234
between the rooms.

326
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,400
How long till
the seal fails completely?

327
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,901
CHLOE:
It's hard to say for sure.

328
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,133
Can you give me an estimate?

329
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,968
It's deteriorating quickly.

330
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,734
I'd say 15 minutes,
20 at the most.

331
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,234
And then what?

332
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,067
As soon as the gas
permeates the seal,

333
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,634
it enters the room.
Then it's over.

334
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:11,767
Get me schematics
on all the isolated zones.

335
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,133
( typing rapidly )

336
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,501
Mr. Vice President,
with all due respect,

337
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,167
I'm not trying
to usurp your position.

338
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,501
I'm simply trying to serve
the president

339
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:32,167
the best way I can.

340
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,100
( sighing ):
Yes, sir.

341
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,033
What was that about?

342
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,434
I was trying
to convince Gardner

343
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,968
to let me help him draft
the president's statement.

344
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:47,701
Charles is letting Hal
write his statement?!

345
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,133
He's insisted.

346
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,467
And the president
gave him the go-ahead.

347
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,467
But that means Gardner
is effectively

348
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:55,467
making policy.

349
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,467
We've got
to stop him.

350
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,567
I'm trying.

351
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,234
But you know what kind
of pressure

352
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,834
the president's
under today.

353
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,667
He wants all the counsel
he can get.

354
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,234
And Hal's only too eager
to help out.

355
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,434
Of course he's too eager.

356
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,234
He's got his eye
on the Oval Office.

357
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,534
Anything he can do
to speed up Charles' downfall

358
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,200
puts him one step
closer to the presidency.

359
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:16,334
Martha, you have to intervene.

360
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,033
Hal feeds
the president ideas.

361
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,434
We saw it
at the WTO,

362
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,667
we saw it in Chicago.

363
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,601
When they work,
Hal takes the credit for them.

364
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:25,868
When they don't,

365
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,067
the president
takes the hits.

366
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,767
Have you reminded
Charles of that?

367
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,100
I can't.

368
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,033
Hal's the vice president.

369
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,300
I'm just the chief of staff.

370
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:40,167
You have influence
that supercedes

371
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:41,834
any constitutional rank.

372
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,434
And now's the time
to use it.

373
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,767
I want to see the statement
as soon as it's issued.

374
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,367
You will.

375
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:04,300
I just checked the readings
from all uncontaminated zones.

376
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,934
The testing you've been doing

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,167
in your respective areas
is consistent.

378
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:10,868
The Sentox nerve gas
that was released

379
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,868
into the air duct system
contains a corrosive agent

380
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:15,033
that is eating away
at the barrier seals

381
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,434
protecting the safe zones.

382
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,267
I'm not going
to pull any punches.

383
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,968
CRT will not be here
to help us.

384
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,534
At this point, our only hope
is to help ourselves.

385
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,567
We need to find a way
to either neutralize

386
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:28,567
or flush the Sentox
out of the contaminated areas

387
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,067
before the barrier seals fail

388
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,734
and the gas enters
the safe zones.

389
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,834
I want all personnel
working on this problem.

390
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,133
We don't have much time.

391
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,968
Do what you can.

392
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,667
We'll hope for the best.

393
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:45,167
Maybe we can do something
from in here.

394
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,801
Access the ventilation
system?

395
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,300
Even if I could,
it doesn't mean

396
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,234
we could do anything to stop
the seals from breaking down.

397
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Just try.

398
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,334
Maybe it's not
as bad as we think.

399
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,234
Maybe the numbers are off.

400
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,834
They're not.

401
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:04,968
Even if the seals leak,
CRT could get here in time.

402
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,534
The only reason
she's here

403
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,334
is because I asked
her to stay.

404
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,767
If something happens to her,
it's going to be because of me.

405
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,100
Because of what I did.

406
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,801
There was no way that
you could know

407
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,133
that CTU was vulnerable.

408
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
CHLOE:
Jack.

409
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,901
You've got something?

410
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,133
I think if I can slow
the seals from breaking down

411
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,434
I can flush
the contaminated areas

412
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,334
using the air conditioning.
Do it.

413
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,033
Something's wrong.

414
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,334
The control isn't responding.

415
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,100
Why not?
It's being blocked
by some program

416
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,834
that I can't
get to remotely.

417
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,667
It's probably on a computer
near Holding Four.

418
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,634
Can you get me in there?

419
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,033
This is a false wall.

420
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,901
The air in there
is not contaminated.

421
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,534
Can he get to
the computer
through there?

422
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,567
Yes, but once he makes
it through the safe zone,

423
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,300
he'll be in
a contaminated area.

424
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,534
What are you talking about?

425
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:51,968
He can't go through
a contaminated area.

426
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:53,400
I can hold my breath.

427
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,634
The Sentox won't be
absorbed by my skin

428
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,000
over that short
a period of time.

429
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,834
As long as I don't inhale it,
I'll be fine.

430
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:59,501
Jack, you can't
hold your breath that long.

431
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,567
I only have to hold my breath
long enough

432
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,767
to get to the computer,
disconnect the program

433
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:04,934
and get back
to the ventilated room.

434
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,234
Once I'm back
in the safe room,

435
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,033
how long will it take you
to clear out the Sentox?

436
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,634
About 20 seconds

437
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,067
based on
the cubic footage.

438
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,367
AUDREY:
Jack, even if you
get to the computer,

439
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,234
what if we can't
ventilate that room?

440
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,200
Chloe thinks we can.

441
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,734
Right now, this is
our only option.

442
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,868
CRT is not going
to get here in time.

443
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,167
The seals are now
80% gone.

444
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:23,868
What's the bottom line?

445
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,934
We have less
than 20 minutes.

446
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,567
AUDREY:
All right, Jack,
Chloe and I

447
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,701
are on channel one.

448
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,067
If you need to communicate
with anyone else

449
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,100
we'll patch you through.

450
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,467
As soon as I go through,

451
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,000
you have to replace this
behind me.

452
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,067
Jack, it's time.
Go now.

453
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,601
Now.

454
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:51,834
Chloe, it's Jack.
I just completed the airlock.

455
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,367
I'm getting ready to move

456
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,434
into the ventilation room.

457
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,434
I'll tap my com unit
three times

458
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,734
when I'm back
in the safe room.

459
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,968
All right. Jack,
I don't have to remind you

460
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,334
if that airlock leaks,

461
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,334
we'll all be dead
within the next three minutes.

462
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,067
It's not going
to leak, Chloe.

463
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,667
Okay...

464
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,167
I'm going in.

465
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,200
Okay.

466
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,100
( inhales deeply )

467
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,868
* *

468
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,067
( computer blipping )

469
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,467
Seal corrosion is now
at 86 percent.

470
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,601
Is there anything

471
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,300
we can do from here?
No, we just have to wait.

472
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,734
There's nothing we can do to get
your dad out any faster.

473
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,767
Don't talk down to me, Chloe.

474
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,300
Listen, we're in a crisis
situation here, okay?

475
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,667
Tempers are bound to flare.

476
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,200
Let's just everybody breathe.

477
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,400
What's with you
and the breathing?

478
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,167
Is that your solution
to everything?

479
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,534
It's Jack,
he's back in the room.

480
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,400
It's too soon, he couldn't
have found the program

481
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,501
and disabled it yet.

482
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:52,334
He's got 15 more seconds
before the room clears.

483
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,534
What's it mean that
he finished so quickly?

484
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,834
I don't know.

485
00:22:57,901 --> 00:22:59,200
Well, it could be
a good thing, right?

486
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:00,834
It could be a good thing
or it could be a bad thing.

487
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,601
That's what
"I don't know" means.

488
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,534
( computer blips )
All right, Jack,

489
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,267
the room is clear, you can
breathe. Are you okay?

490
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:10,467
( gasps )

491
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,200
I couldn't get to it.

492
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,534
Chloe, you're right.
I saw it.

493
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,701
There's a computer

494
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,767
program running on
the AC control unit,

495
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,100
but there's a security grate
in the wall behind the vent.

496
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,834
I don't see it on my system.

497
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,000
Trust me, it's there.

498
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,067
I just found it.

499
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,567
It was a security upgrade

500
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,033
in the last two years.

501
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,367
Somebody didn't file it
properly,

502
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:33,868
that's why
I didn't see it.

503
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,000
Are there any other vents

504
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,901
that could help us
get into that wall?

505
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:38,267
No, they've all been upgraded.

506
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, it's a room,
there's got to be a door.

507
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,067
Where does it lead?

508
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,300
To a corridor
above Holding Four.

509
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,901
None of us can get there
from where we're at.

510
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,434
Who's in holding room four?

511
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,601
Lynn McGill.

512
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,267
Are there any other vented rooms

513
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,367
we can get him to?

514
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:51,534
No, Jack, there's nothing.

515
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,133
Patch me through to him.

516
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,334
( phone rings )

517
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,734
( phone beeps on )
McGill here.

518
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:05,234
Lynn, it's Jack.

519
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,567
We found a computer interrupt
in the AC control unit.

520
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,033
Now if we can shut that down
in the next

521
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,234
few minutes, we can stop the gas
from permeating the safe zones.

522
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
Well, that's good news.

523
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,834
The problem is
you're the only person

524
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,234
close enough to get to it.

525
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,434
Chloe?

526
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,567
CHLOE:
It's directly above

527
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:20,834
the holding room
where you are now.

528
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,367
Take the stairs, go to the left
around the corner.

529
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,567
It's the room on your left.

530
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:25,934
Okay...

531
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,567
How are we going
to do this, Jack?

532
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,734
Lynn, the truth is

533
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,934
if I can get there,
I would do this myself,

534
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,434
but I'm not close enough.

535
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,200
No one who's
still alive in CTU is.

536
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,434
You're the only person
who can do this.

537
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,667
And I'm going to have to ask you
to do it without any protection.

538
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:39,767
I see.

539
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,534
No, you don't.

540
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,634
As soon as you open the door
to the hallway,

541
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,634
your room
will become contaminated.

542
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,434
You can hold your breath long
enough to fix the problem,

543
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,300
but we have nowhere else
to send you.

544
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,334
We can't airlock you.

545
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,834
There are two of us
in here, Jack.

546
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,968
Sir, this is Harry Swinton.

547
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,767
So you're saying
that if he does this,

548
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,801
then we're both going to die?

549
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm so sorry.

550
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,968
We don't have a choice, Harry.

551
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,267
How do we know that you're not
just making this story up

552
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,467
so you don't have to make
the sacrifice yourself?

553
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:12,701
You don't.

554
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,667
All I can ask you to do
is believe me.

555
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm telling you the truth.

556
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,601
Well, that's easy for you
to say, sir.

557
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,100
You're not the one
who's about to die.

558
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,067
It's not easy for me to say.

559
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,067
Hold on.

560
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,567
( keypad beeps )

561
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,434
We have to do this, Harry.

562
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:30,734
We're going to die anyway.

563
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,033
If we don't,
so will everyone in CTU.

564
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,567
We have to do this.

565
