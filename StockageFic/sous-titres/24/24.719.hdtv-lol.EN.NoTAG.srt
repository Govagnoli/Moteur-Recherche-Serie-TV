3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,850
We need a medic!

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,519
It's more virulent than we thought.

5
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:23,689
- We're just masking the symptoms.
- I understand.

6
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,568
- There's something you could consider.
- What's that?

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,882
A possible treatment using stems cells
from a genetically-compatible donor.

8
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,531
Your file says you have a daughter.

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,533
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

10
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,077
Daddy.

11
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,431
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

12
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:44,251
a small chance that I could help you,
and you don't want me to.

13
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,462
I'm dying,

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,007
and whatever small chance there is
to stop that from happening,

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,791
it is not worth the pain

16
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:54,762
for me to let you sit there
and watch me die.

17
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,227
Hodges has 13 Python missiles
armed with the bioweapons.

18
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,604
He demanded that I recall the planes,
or he would launch.

19
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,648
Tony Almeida is still
inside Starkwood.

20
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,849
He believes he can gain access
to the fuel depot,

21
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,653
and lay a series of explosive charges,
and take the missiles out.

22
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,910
- What do you think you're doing?
- You'll take me down to the fuel tanks.

23
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,496
You're too late.

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,007
Jonas, we've taken out
your missiles.

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,959
It's over, and you're under arrest.

26
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,011
You can't even imagine
what you're up against.

27
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,681
- What are you talking about?
- You'll find out.

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,064
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at Auxiliary Gate Six.

29
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,270
I have a Starkwood op in custody. He was
carrying a canister of the bioweapon.

30
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,124
- Are you sure?
- I'm looking at it right now.

31
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:52,858
One of the Starkwood ops.
He's got a canister of the bioweapon.

32
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,864
I need you to close down
all access roads,

33
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,841
and alert perimeter units
and Metro Police.

34
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,909
- Get me D.C. Metro.
- I'll pursue from the air.

35
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,119
Let's go!

36
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:12,965
- I'm okay.
- Tony!

37
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,534
- Yeah?
<i>- Patricia, Matt.</i>

38
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,335
<i>I got off the phone
with Secret Service.</i>

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,247
<i>You're cleared with White House security
at the south entrance.</i>

40
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,119
<i>How soon do you think
you'll get there?</i>

41
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,514
Within the half-hour.

42
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,835
- Do you know why Hodges was arrested?
- <i>They didn't give me a lot.</i>

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,877
<i>Apparently, Jonas was in some kind
of policy meeting with the president,</i>

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,348
<i>and things got out of hand.</i>

45
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:53,849
<i>That's when he requested
his favorite attorney.</i>

46
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:56,967
I'm flattered.
I'll call you after I've spoken to him.

47
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,268
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

48
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,885
Hurry it up.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,009
We just got an ID on the suspect.

50
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:14,336
A security camera picked him up
leaving the compound with a backpack.

51
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,429
Robert Galvez, two-year Starkwood
employee, former special forces.

52
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,718
Relay that to Larry,
he needs to know who he's tracking.

53
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,595
He's not answering his comm.

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,436
- How far away is backup?
- They're still a few minutes out,

55
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,951
but Agent Park's teams
have secured a four-block perimeter.

56
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:31,680
The bioweapons canister
is secured within the cordon.

57
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,565
Get Galvez' picture out to Tactical
and distribute department wide.

58
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,483
- Got it.
- And keep trying Larry.

59
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,841
<i>To all units, I'm uploading
a photo of the suspect</i>

60
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,722
<i>to all agents' PDAs.</i>

61
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,925
<i>His name is Robert Galvez.</i>

62
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,481
<i>Be advised he has
advanced military training,</i>

63
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,222
<i>so proceed with caution.</i>

64
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,607
Almeida, are you there?

65
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,114
Are you in a secure location?

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm holed up in a storage yard
near the projects on Jefferson.

67
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,703
But I just spotted a patrol.
I better keep moving.

68
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,871
No, don't.

69
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:35,283
The FBI's got the entire perimeter
locked down. And they know who you are.

70
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,127
- How?
<i>- They have a picture.</i>

71
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:40,047
Which means the search teams
can ID you on sight.

72
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,306
Just stay put until I can get a read
on their search protocols,

73
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:46,136
- and I'll guide you out.
- I shouldn't have helped you.

74
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:49,175
I promise you,
that canister you stole for me

75
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,535
is worth a lot of money
to the people I'm working for.

76
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,477
What good that money's
gonna do me in prison.

77
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,354
Just shut up and do what I tell you.

78
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,691
Guard the canister, stay put,
and wait for my call.

79
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:11,870
We've got agents down.

80
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,840
Get a med team out here now.

81
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,503
Almeida, can you hear me?

82
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,308
What happened?
Where's the suspect?

83
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:24,954
He ambushed us.

84
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,223
Did you see where he went?

85
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,476
I don't know.

86
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,183
I just got confirmation
the Tac Team has arrived at the scene.

87
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,227
- Do we have a 20 on Larry?
- Not yet.

88
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,368
Excuse me, Agent Walker.
I know you're busy.

89
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,681
I just came to say good-bye.

90
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:44,111
- Good-bye? Where are you going?
- Back to L.A.

91
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,867
I don't understand. You're not
going through with the treatment?

92
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,828
- It's his only chance for a cure.
- I know that, and so does he.

93
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,473
But it's a slim one,

94
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:59,252
and he believes
it's not worth taking, so...

95
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,382
If he's going to die,
he wants it to be on his terms.

96
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:03,797
Can't you change his mind?

97
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,045
I would think you'd know by now

98
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,803
that no one can change
my father's mind when it's made up.

99
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,267
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I put you in this position.

100
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,540
No, don't be.

101
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,645
I'm grateful to you, Agent Walker.

102
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,529
My father and I got to say
a lot of things to each other.

103
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:24,902
I wish I could have said more,
but I don't want to cause him more pain.

104
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,196
Renee, Agent Park
is on the phone for you.

105
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,021
- I need to take this.
- I understand.

106
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:34,985
Good luck.

107
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,918
- This is Walker.
<i>- It's Park.</i>

108
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:42,461
Agent Moss is dead.

109
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,881
What?

110
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,634
<i>Apparently, he was killed
in an ambush by the suspect.</i>

111
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,312
<i>The chopper pilot, too.</i>

112
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,097
<i>Tony Almeida's been shot,
but he's alive.</i>

113
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,349
I've got medical personnel
working on him now.

114
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,898
Do we have any lead on Galvez?

115
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,859
No, but the area's been cordoned off.
He couldn't have gotten far.

116
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:09,738
<i>We're setting up an operations base here
on the scene to coordinate the manhunt.</i>

117
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,393
<i>- How do you want to proceed?</i>
- Me?

118
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:14,878
<i>You're the ranking agent
in charge now.</i>

119
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:21,083
Maintain the perimeter.

120
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,289
Begin a south-north sweep.

121
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:27,339
I'll chopper out a team
and meet you there as soon as I can.

122
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,384
I have more than enough personnel.
You don't need to be involved

123
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,094
<i>- in the search.</i>
- Yes, I do.

124
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,948
- Keep me posted if you hear anything.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

125
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,979
He was killed in a shootout
with the suspect.

126
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:43,698
Oh, God.

127
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,524
I need you to brief the White House.

128
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,661
Call Dr. Macer and have her deploy
a HazMat team to the perimeter line.

129
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,796
Assemble a team
to chopper out with me.

130
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:54,423
I'm so sorry.

131
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,670
Someone's going to need
to notify Larry's ex-wife.

132
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,637
Probably shouldn't be me.

133
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:04,918
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

134
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,344
All right.

135
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,181
We've debriefed
on hours 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

136
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,685
pertaining to the CIP recovery
and the capture of Ike Dubaku.

137
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,810
Now, Mr. Bauer,

138
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,302
- maybe you'd like to take a break.
- No.

139
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,608
We need to finish this
while I still can. Let's go.

140
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:30,209
Now, according
to your earlier statement,

141
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,154
it was about this time
you received intel

142
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,323
regarding the imminent attack
on the White House.

143
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,909
Tony Almeida provided me
with the intel,

144
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,357
but we didn't know the White House
was a target at that time.

145
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:41,701
And who was Mr. Almeida's source?

146
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,856
He was interrogating a mercenary.

147
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:45,997
Did Almeida give you a name?

148
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,050
Yeah. Sorry.

149
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,618
Cardiff. He said his name
was Vincent Cardiff.

150
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,339
Did you yourself
question the source?

151
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,201
He didn't survive
Tony's interrogation,

152
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:05,906
but he was the one who provided us
with the intel on the upcoming attack.

153
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,637
But we did not know that the White House
was the target at that time.

154
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,525
We did not know
the White House was...

155
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:15,422
You sure you don't want
to take that break?

156
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,368
I'm repeating myself again.
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,597
Here's the data file
you asked for, sir.

158
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,501
Tom, we need to move.
Agent Walker's got our assignments.

159
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,311
Excuse me.

160
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,638
We won't lose control
of this situation.

161
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,224
I know that most of you are tired,
working double shifts,

162
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:46,591
but I need each of you focused and alert
if we are going to locate the suspect

163
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,006
and secure the bioweapon canister
that he's carrying.

164
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,671
While I am out in the field,
you will pass all pertinent information

165
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,301
out of this office through Janis.
Let's get to work.

166
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,113
Adams, you and your men are with me.

167
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,324
I'll meet you at the helipad.

168
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,994
- The bioweapon's still out there?
- We have it contained.

169
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:04,705
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

170
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,965
Just tell me
what the hell is going on.

171
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,440
A Starkwood operative, Robert Galvez,
stole a canister of the pathogen.

172
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,625
We have him trapped inside a perimeter
a mile or so from Starkwood's compound.

173
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,596
- Is Larry in command of the perimeter?
- He was killed in a firefight.

174
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:17,551
What?

175
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,679
Tony was injured.
He's at the scene with the advance team.

176
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,556
Larry's dead?

177
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:25,392
We have two agents down.
Yes. I have to go.

178
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,099
You're lucky.

179
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:37,779
An inch to the left, the bullet
might have nicked your splenic artery.

180
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,139
You need to get yourself
checked out at the hospital.

181
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:43,114
- I can't do that right now.
- Let me get you something for the pain.

182
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,287
No, I need to keep my head clear.

183
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,586
Sweep 9, this is Mobile Command,
what's your status?

184
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:51,715
<i>Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9,
Southeast grid 211 clear. Moving on.</i>

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,220
Copy that, Sweep 9.
Sweep 7, what's your position?

186
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,042
<i>Clearing 214. Nothing so far.</i>

187
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:59,011
- No sign of him?
- Don't worry. We'll find him.

188
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,054
You should get some rest.

189
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,691
Thanks.

190
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,665
They're sweeping north,
clearing grids.

191
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,415
You've got a clear path on Jefferson
all the way up to 12th and 13th Street.

192
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,887
That should be
the last sector they're searching.

193
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,453
Judging by their progress,
it'll give you about 30 minutes.

194
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:24,328
Should be plenty of time.

195
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,653
Time for what?

196
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,915
- You still got that C-4 I gave you?
- Yeah. I got it.

197
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
All right.

198
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,014
I want you to find a structure,

199
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,253
a store, warehouse, something big enough
where they have to enter and search.

200
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:38,548
We need to draw as many of them
into the building as possible,

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,050
then blow it.

202
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,719
You want me to blow up
a couple of dozen FBI agents?

203
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,621
- You got a problem with that?
- The perimeter will be still locked.

204
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,016
How doing this is gonna
get me out with the canister?

205
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,893
I've got that worked out.

206
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,327
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

207
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,495
You're ill.

208
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:10,848
If my condition
interferes with your operation,

209
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,097
I will stand down.
I give you my word.

210
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,626
You want keep arguing about this,
waste more time?

211
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,212
I'm not getting out.

212
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:41,769
Good morning.

213
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,044
Good morning.

214
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,532
Ms. Eames.

215
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:48,635
- You're Jonas Hodges' attorney.
- That's right.

216
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,495
They told us to expect you.

217
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,578
I just need you to place
your thumb against the glass.

218
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,729
Sergeant Cadden will escort you
to the holding area.

219
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,432
Thank you.

220
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,320
How could this man have gotten out
of Starkwood with the bioweapon?

221
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:19,457
No one's sure.
But he's already murdered 4 people.

222
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:20,942
Including Larry Moss.

223
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,018
The FBI has tracked him
to a nearby residential district.

224
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:30,241
They've sealed off the area
and are conducting a thorough search.

225
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,979
Mom, this man Galvez
is a Starkwood operative.

226
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,789
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

227
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:36,212
Maybe.

228
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,751
What do you mean, maybe?

229
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:43,401
As Hodges was taken away,
he said it wasn't over.

230
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,905
He alluded to others,

231
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,762
called himself a small cog
in a very large machine

232
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,097
- that I wouldn't be able to stop.
- He was ranting.

233
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,517
That doesn't mean
he wasn't telling the truth.

234
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,813
We need to find out
what Hodges knows about this.

235
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,788
I want him taken to the FBI
for interrogation.

236
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,095
He's a sociopath, Mom.
He's not going to talk.

237
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,743
He's going to want to make some kind
of deal in exchange for his cooperation.

238
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,618
- Mom, you're not considering that...
- Olivia...

239
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,663
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

240
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,331
Just get him to FBI.

241
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:30,307
Mr. Hodges.
Your attorney's here to see you.

242
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:32,847
It's about damn time.

243
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:45,777
We're going to need some privacy.

244
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:53,846
You're a little taller than her.

245
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,921
But it's a good look for you.

246
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,349
Hello, Jonas.

247
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,161
I'm not going to ask how you got in.

248
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,503
But I'm interested
in how you're going to get me out.

249
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,824
Jonas,
you're in a very difficult position.

250
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:13,607
Your actions today have put
everyone else in a difficult position.

251
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:14,732
Oh, I see.

252
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,283
I've upset the cart, have I?

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,950
Everyone's bent out of shape.

254
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,957
Where the hell were they when
the government came after my company?

255
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,794
When Senator Mayer
and his subpoena-waving goon squad

256
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,322
were trying to ruin me
and everything I've built?

257
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,980
You would have been protected,
Jonas.

258
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,451
You and Starkwood.

259
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,563
But you jeopardized the plan.

260
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,905
That bioweapon that you developed for us
was not intended for personal use.

261
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,584
The consensus
is that you've had some sort of...

262
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,656
psychotic break.

263
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,917
Well, the consensus is wrong.

264
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,979
Coming from you right now,
that's not much comfort.

265
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,044
I want to talk to them.

266
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,934
Get some form of communication
between us. I want to talk to them.

267
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:02,722
I think it's a little late for that,
Jonas.

268
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,856
You've brought undue attention
by showing your hand. Exposing yourself.

269
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,898
And I'm sure you could understand
their concern that you may, in fact,

270
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:12,023
- expose the others as well.
- How can I do that?

271
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,652
- I don't know who they are.
- You know enough,

272
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,340
and they need to be certain.

273
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:20,330
I think we can agree
that there's no reason for your family

274
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,403
to pay for your mistakes.

275
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,264
Is that why you're here?
To threaten my family.

276
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,689
On the contrary.

277
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,611
I came to guarantee
your family's safety.

278
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,629
If you do the right thing.

279
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:44,555
This will induce cardiac arrest,
and leave no trace in your system.

280
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:47,357
A natural, dignified death.

281
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:50,568
Without you to prosecute,
the case against you

282
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,488
and your company will be difficult,
likely impossible,

283
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,875
preserving at least some small part

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,868
of Starkwood's legacy
of patriotic service.

285
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,705
Which I know
is very important to you.

286
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,146
Party's over, counselor.
We're moving him to the Bureau.

287
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,764
My client has invoked
his right to silence and to counsel.

288
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,828
No one speaks to him unless
in my presence, is that understood?

289
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,863
In some countries
they'd have shot him by now.

290
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:36,948
Process him out.

291
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,303
- Yes?
<i>- I met with him.</i>

292
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,411
And?

293
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,351
I'm quite certain
he understands our terms.

294
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:03,567
They're transferring him to the FBI
for interrogation.

295
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,309
- Will that be a problem?
<i>- Hopefully,</i>

296
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:08,774
<i>it'll just pressure him to resolve
the situation sooner rather than later.</i>

297
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,985
I'll be happy when this is behind us.
Have you heard from Almeida?

298
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,510
He called in
before I met with Hodges.

299
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,248
- Has he secured the canister?
- Soon.

300
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,468
He's your guy.
Better not screw this up.

301
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:24,107
Tony's been the one bright spot
in an otherwise dreary day.

302
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,789
I have faith he'll come through.

303
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,505
I found a place to set up.

304
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,674
It's an abandoned apartment building
just shy of the north perimeter line.

305
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,232
1297 Rincon, corner of 12th.

306
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:41,726
Yeah, I see it.

307
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:45,893
Sweep teams are just entering
3 sectors to the south.

308
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,770
- You've got less than 20 min.
- That's not much time.

309
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,415
No, it isn't, maybe you should
get off the phone and get to it.

310
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,320
I lost 2 partners in a row.

311
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:38,319
Early on.

312
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,372
I couldn't handle it.

313
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,449
I guess that's why
over the last 10 years,

314
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:49,574
I've pretty much worked alone.

315
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:55,805
It's all right for you
to be feeling what you feel.

316
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:00,967
And if you can't do this tonight,
that's all right, too.

317
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,685
Just don't try and pretend
like you're not feeling anything.

318
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,891
- That's how you make a mistake.
- Please, Jack,

319
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,613
don't tell me what to feel
and don't tell me how to feel it.

320
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:44,416
He's over there.

321
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,145
- Where is he?
- This way.

322
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,719
- You okay?
- I got lucky.

323
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,525
The bullet went straight through.

324
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,212
- Didn't think I'd see you out here.
- I'm only here for observation.

325
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:02,528
You do not have to do this.

326
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Show me.

327
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:41,606
Cover him up.

328
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:45,905
I'm sorry about Larry.

329
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:47,824
How did this happen?

330
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:50,737
It all went down pretty fast,
I mean...

331
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,080
We were ambushed
before we got out of the helicopter.

332
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:57,065
The chopper pilot was hit first.

333
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,753
I was unarmed, so Larry laid down cover
so I could get clear.

334
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,257
I don't remember a lot,
but I definitely heard auto-fire.

335
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:10,013
As I was tagged, Larry came over
to help me and that's when he was hit.

336
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,206
I blacked out after that, but...

337
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,601
I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life.

338
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,147
Larry was hit with heavy ordnance.
Shotgun rounds, armor piercing.

339
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,311
You were hit
with something smaller. Jacketed.

340
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:24,950
I treated Mr. Almeida. His wound
was consistent with a nine millimeter.

341
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:26,623
You sure it wasn't a .45?

342
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:29,041
Not likely, the entry was too small.
Why?

343
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:32,285
Because you have spent
.45 casings in evidence.

344
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:36,429
Galvez had access to the weapons
inside the FBI vehicle he stole.

345
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:40,542
- He probably switched in the fight.
- That many weapons?

346
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:43,144
In the time frame that you described
the ambush? It doesn't add up.

347
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,935
- Okay, so what are you saying?
- Someone was with him.

348
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,880
Like I said,
it all happened pretty fast, but...

349
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:51,939
I didn't think so.

350
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:55,425
I guess it makes sense.

351
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,977
One man didn't do this alone.
He had help.

352
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:00,271
I'll tell Park to alert the field.

353
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,129
You sure you're okay?

354
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,817
Yeah, I'm fine.

355
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:06,163
Good.

356
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:25,836
Hello?

357
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,227
Did I wake you?

358
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:29,133
<i>Who could sleep
after what happened today?</i>

359
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,538
How did it go with your father?

360
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,529
Sweetheart.

361
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:37,391
What happened?

362
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:40,686
He's dying, Stephen.

363
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:42,438
What?

364
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,723
He was exposed to something.

365
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,730
Like a biological agent.

366
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,988
It had something to do with the attacks
that took place earlier today.

367
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:54,857
Kim, honey, I'm so sorry.

368
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,391
<i>Isn't there anything
that they can do?</i>

369
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,119
No.

370
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,295
- <i>I'm coming back home.</i>
- Don't you want to stay?

371
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,763
<i>Don't you wanna be with him
as long as you can?</i>

372
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,895
My presence,

373
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:14,637
with what he's going through right now,
will only make things worse.

374
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,034
Did you at least...

375
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,160
Did you tell him
about his granddaughter?

376
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:22,285
Hi, honey.

377
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,640
<i>Kim?</i>

378
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,870
I couldn't.
I couldn't bring myself to tell him

379
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,847
I wasn't the only person
he was leaving behind.

380
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,645
<i>Telling him about Teri
would've only made it worse.</i>

381
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:40,319
<i>I'm gonna try and get on the 6:10.
If I do, I'll be back in L.A. by 9:00.</i>

382
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,183
<i>You can always leave later,
if you change your mind.</i>

383
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,625
I won't.

384
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:50,508
I love you both.

385
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:53,342
We love you, too.

386
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:55,141
Bye.

387
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,109
<i>Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9.</i>
<i>221 is clear.</i>

388
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,053
- Copy, 9. Proceed to 224.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

389
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,753
Why has that area of the grid
not been cleared?

390
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,159
Sweep 3,
why have you not cleared 219?

391
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:21,610
<i>Mobile Command, we're encountering
resistance from neighborhood residents.</i>

392
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:24,957
<i>They're not happy about their homes
being searched at 2:30 in the morning.</i>

393
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,943
It's about their safety,
not their happiness.

394
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,962
Whoever is helping Galvez
may be providing him shelter.

395
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,550
If those civilians are interfering
in that sweep, arrest them,

396
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,640
but get that area cleared.
Do you understand?

397
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:35,765
<i>Copy that.</i>

398
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,077
Excuse me.

399
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,510
It's an antiseizure medicine.

400
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,399
I should've used it earlier.

401
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:22,428
Jack, what are you doing out here?

402
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:25,351
Why don't you go back to FBI medical
and let them treat you?

403
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,514
There is no treatment.

404
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:30,213
- There's no cure.
- Wait.

405
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
I'm sorry.

406
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,056
I didn't know.

407
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,969
Why are you in the field?

408
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,482
Agent Walker just lost
her partner, Tony.

409
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,623
I thought I could help.
I owe her that much.

410
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,972
<i>Agent Stoller to Mobile Command.
Code Yellow.</i>

411
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:55,047
Go ahead, this is Mobile Command.
Are you reporting a Code Yellow?

412
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,215
Affirmative.

413
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,093
I have a confirmed visual
on the target suspect

414
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,511
with the canister.

415
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,265
<i>Repeat, confirmed visual
of suspect and canister.</i>

416
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,684
Agent Park, may I?

417
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,508
Agent Stoller, this is Jack Bauer.

418
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,223
Is Galvez with someone?

419
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,814
<i>- Agent Stoller?
- Negative. He's alone.</i>

420
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:16,958
<i>Repeat, he is alone.</i>

421
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Copy that.

422
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,730
What's his 20?

423
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:24,785
Entering an abandoned apartment building
on the south side

424
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,328
<i>of Rincon and 12th.</i>

425
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,215
<i>I am in pursuit.</i>

426
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,154
Maintain a visual, wait for backup.
Do not engage until we get there.

427
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:32,716
Copy that.

428
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,739
<i>All primary units
respond to 12th and Rincon.</i>

429
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,467
Suspect sighted entering a building,
with canister.

430
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,426
- Code Yellow.
- Agent Park?

431
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,611
I want a secure net around the building,
agents at all exits and sharpshooters

432
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:46,129
- covering all the four exposures.
- Yes, ma'am.

433
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:51,354
I can't.

434
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:57,035
It's all right, I'll be fine.

435
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,778
I'll stay back,
I'll watch operations.

436
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:01,309
You be careful out there.

437
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:04,784
I still think Galvez has a partner.
You watch your back.

438
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:38,835
Thank you.

439
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,563
Alright, let's go.

440
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,327
"Hellfire."

441
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:02,216
You served with the 27th
in Pakistan.

442
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,053
Two tours, sir.

443
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,346
Did you, by any chance,
encounter any Starkwood units?

444
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,472
There was a force protection team
attached by my C.O.

445
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,197
They fought with you.

446
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:16,452
Yes, sir. Side by side.

447
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:18,737
Soldier...

448
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,242
How would you rate
their professionalism?

449
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:25,030
Their performance under fire.

450
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,868
They were good men, sir.
Well trained.

451
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:31,998
Thank you, son.

452
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,039
Just made my day.

453
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:54,235
Let's go.

454
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:07,315
Our orders are to deliver the prisoner
to the rear entrance at FBI.

455
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:11,051
The White House
wants to keep this low-key.

456
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:48,584
Sarge!

457
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,534
This is Sergeant Cadden.

458
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:06,229
Prisoner's in severe cardiac
and respiratory distress.

459
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:09,277
We are rerouting
to West Arlington Hospital.

460
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,292
Need emergency
medical team standing by.

461
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,431
Go, go!

462
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,987
- Assemble the teams.
- Got it.

463
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:31,043
Agent Stoller, this is Agent Walker,
do you copy?

464
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,450
<i>- I copy you, Agent Walker.</i>
- What is your position?

465
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,870
East stairwell between the first
and second floor.

466
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:39,582
Suspect with canister
has moved to the top floor.

467
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,500
Any indication that he's not alone?

468
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,315
<i>Negative. Not at this time.</i>

469
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,861
Stand by.
We're coming to you.

470
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,804
Agent Stoller puts the suspect
somewhere on the 2nd floor.

471
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:50,501
There's no guarantee that he is
the only hostile in the building.

472
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:53,340
Therefore, we stick to SOP,
clearing room by room.

473
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:55,437
Agent Park and I will lead 2 teams,
East and West.

474
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:57,749
Check your weapons and headsets.
We move in 60 seconds.

475
00:32:57,874 --> 00:32:59,627
You heard her,
you guys are with me...

476
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:02,479
- Mobile Command, this is Walker.
<i>- Go ahead, Agent Walker.</i>

477
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,516
<i>We enter the building. Have HazMat teams
on alert, if the canister gets breached.</i>

478
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:10,029
- How you holding up?
- Better, thanks.

479
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,471
Excuse me.

480
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,209
- This is Bauer.
- <i>Mr. Bauer, this is Agent Mizelli.</i>

481
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,545
Sorry, but I need to follow up
on something from our debrief.

482
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,964
This isn't a good time.

483
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:30,299
<i>Some new information has come to light,
and I need </i>

484
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,551
- <i>to clear up a discrepancy.</i>
- What discrepancy?

485
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,029
<i>You told me Tony Almeida's source
on the White House attack</i>

486
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:38,655
<i>was a man identified to you
as Vincent Cardiff?</i>

487
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,726
That's right.

488
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,614
Is there a possibility
you misrembered the name?

489
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,730
- No, I don't think so.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

490
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,193
<i>You yourself have voiced
some concern about your own acuity.</i>

491
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,318
Hold on.

492
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:50,903
What is this here?

493
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:52,752
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

494
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,436
Locator codes for all units'
radio transponders.

495
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,855
Are they in real time?
Can you do a map overlay?

496
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,728
- It'll take a minute.
- Get it done.

497
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:00,996
What's going on?

498
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,313
I'm not sure yet.

499
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,129
It's Stoller's transponder.
He's not in the building.

500
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,548
Agent Walker, get your men
out of the building.

501
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,049
<i>- It's a trap.</i>
- What?

502
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,719
Stoller's not even in there.
Get your men out now.

503
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,722
Code Blue. Repeat: Code Blue.

504
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:15,696
Agent Walker, Agent Park!

505
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:18,321
Get us a vehicle now!

506
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,007
All perimeter teams, this is Park.

507
00:35:20,132 --> 00:35:22,374
Agents are down.
Report to 12th and Rincon.

508
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:25,412
- We need assistance.
- Negative, disregard that order.

509
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,583
Maintain your positions.

510
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:30,753
- What the hell are you doing?
<i>- They try to pull you off the line.</i>

511
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,660
You leave a hole in that perimeter,
we are going to lose the canister.

512
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:36,122
Tell your men to stand fast.
Medivac is on its way.

513
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,510
Get them in the air now!

514
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,076
Jack, I'm going in.

515
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,581
- How many men are unaccounted for?
- Still assessing.

516
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:19,626
We were at least 30
when the building went up.

517
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,804
- And Agent Walker?
- I don't know.

518
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,032
Renee, this is Jack.
Do you copy?

519
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:27,267
Renee, this is Jack.

520
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:28,721
Do you copy?

521
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,202
- You got the canister?
- Yeah.

522
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,411
Let me see.

523
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:53,711
Hurry up, we need to get moving.

524
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,533
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, but he's not breathing.

525
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,356
We need a medic!

526
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,569
They've got him.
I want to get you out of here.

527
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,029
Let's go now.

528
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:44,339
- How'd you know it was a trap?
- Stoller's transponder was outside.

529
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,682
They were trying to thin our ranks,
create a diversion.

530
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,103
- Was the cordon breached?

531
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,764
I told them to maintain their positions.
The perimeter's secure.

532
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:52,181
It's almost like they knew.

533
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,423
They'd have need time
to wire here with explosives.

534
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,795
This was the last sector
we were due to search.

535
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,192
- They knew your sweep patterns?
- They must have.

536
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,698
- Oh, my God.
- Jack, what is it?

537
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,741
I'll meet you back at your vehicle.

538
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:10,121
- You want me to take him?
- No, I got him.

539
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,221
They need your help inside.

540
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:20,694
This is Bauer.

541
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:23,884
You said you wanted to talk to me
about Tony's suspect Vincent Cardiff.

542
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,674
Yes, thanks for getting back to me.
Listen, you told me that he expired,

543
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,837
during the course
of Almeida's interrogation?

544
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:31,348
That's what Tony told me.

545
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:33,809
- Well, it can't be him.
- What are you talking about?

546
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:36,548
Vincent Cardiff was picked up
over an hour ago by Customs,

547
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:38,960
- trying to cross the border to Canada.
- Are you sure?

548
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:40,859
I'm positive,
I've got his arrest report

549
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,659
<i>right here. Cardiff's alive.</i>

550
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:44,816
Were there any signs
from his interrogation?

551
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:47,893
- Physical violence, abuse, anything?
<i>- Nothing's indicated on the report.</i>

552
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:51,119
That's why I was asking if maybe you had
mistaken the name Almeida gave you.

553
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,798
- I've got him.
- Thanks.

554
00:39:18,578 --> 00:39:20,362
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

555
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:23,817
What's going on?

556
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,206
I told you earlier today,

557
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,660
if you were lying to me
I'd kill you myself.

558
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,330
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Cardiff. Vincent Cardiff,

559
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,000
- you said he was killed?
- Yeah, so?

560
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,426
He's alive and well, in custody,

561
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,517
and he's showing no signs
of physical abuse.

562
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:43,630
Explain that.

563
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,149
All right, look, Jack, I'm sorry.

564
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:51,179
Cardiff knew by spilling that intel,
he was going to get himself killed

565
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,312
so I cut a deal with him. I told him
I'd let the FBI think he was dead,

566
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:59,146
so he could walk away and disappear.
I thought it was just a meaningless lie.

567
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,018
We've been doing this
long enough to know

568
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:03,650
that there is no such thing
as a meaningless lie.

569
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,222
- How are you involved in this?
- You're not making any sense.

570
00:40:06,347 --> 00:40:07,639
That intel was good.

571
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:09,990
Without it you'd have never
save the president.

572
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,858
What is your involvement?

573
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:14,411
You're not thinking straight.

574
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:16,249
How were you shot?

575
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,890
Does Galvez even have a second man,

576
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,641
or was it just you?

577
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,086
Just stop and listen to what you say.
It's insane.

578
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:24,636
It's paranoia.

579
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,104
- Now, why don't you put the gun down?
- Don't you move!

580
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:30,886
The toxin is starting
to affect your judgment.

581
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,361
That's what's happening.
You can see that, right?

582
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,337
Is this what you're looking for?

583
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,650
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.

584
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,109
I told you to stay out of it.

585
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:03,835
But you wouldn't listen, would you?

586
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,464
Can we get some help here?
This man's having a seizure.

587
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:10,039
Stand back, please.

588
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,470
Go get my bag
and call Dr. Mason, stat.

589
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:54,378
I don't see anything.

590
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:58,140
The wound must be posterior.
Sir, I need to turn you on your side.

591
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,525
Put it down and keep driving. Now!
