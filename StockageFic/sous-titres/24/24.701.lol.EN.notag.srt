3
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,403
- Put the phone away.
- One more minute.

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,962
That's what you said five minutes ago.
Now put it away.

5
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,040
I got you the phone
for emergencies, honey.

6
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:35,682
Well, this is an emergency.

7
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:38,226
Fine.

8
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:43,793
How come you get to talk
on the phone? That's not fair.

9
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,086
Life's not fair.

10
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,254
Hello.

11
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,429
Hello?
Who is this?

12
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,285
Are you okay?

13
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:10,903
Go! Move!

14
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,409
Everybody down!

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,881
Dad... Dad...

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,180
- Dad! Dad!
- Emily!

17
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:28,981
- Dad! Dad!
- Emily! Emily!

18
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,134
Go! Get in there!

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,204
- Daddy!
- Let's go!

20
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:51,559
Please don't hurt my daughter.
I've got money.

21
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:54,395
We don't want your money,
Mr. Latham.

22
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,477
We just need you
to fix something for us.

23
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,747
Let the record show this is
the third day of this Senate hearing

24
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:14,910
investigating human rights violations
by the recently disbanded

25
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,554
Counter Terrorist Unit.

26
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,821
Yesterday, when we adjourned,
we were discussing

27
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:21,682
brutality and torture

28
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:25,406
by CTU agents
in the course of their operations.

29
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:29,065
Will the witness please
state his name?

30
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,237
I don't see your counsel present.

31
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,418
Is he or she not aware
that we're about to start?

32
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,659
I have chosen not to retain counsel.

33
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,498
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you

34
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,253
that many of the questions
that we're about to pose to you

35
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,753
are of a legal nature

36
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,834
and might result in answers
that could incriminate you.

37
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,673
I understand that, Senator.

38
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,881
We can postpone your testimony
until this afternoon

39
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,869
if you'd like
to bring in representation.

40
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,250
Something
that I would strongly advise.

41
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,100
What is the first question, Senator?

42
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,898
All right, then.

43
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:11,607
Let's begin.

44
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,931
Who is Ibrahim Hadad?

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,657
That information is classified.

46
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,993
We represent the people
of the United States,

47
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:26,122
and we have declassified
those files on their behalf.

48
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:28,720
Now, I'm going to ask you
one more time:

49
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,331
Who is Ibrahim Hadad?

50
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,936
He was a member
of a terrorist sleeper cell

51
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,445
CTU had under surveillance in 2002.

52
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,972
And isn't it true that you detained

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,904
Mr. Hadad without due process,
and that you used

54
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:50,371
extreme interrogation methods on him

55
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,443
until he answered your questions?

56
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,038
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,485
Would you say
that you broke procedure

58
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,242
with this interrogation?

59
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,363
Probably.

60
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:00,766
Probably?

61
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:05,452
Well, that's a...
very cavalier answer.

62
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,699
You don't seem to care
about the implications here.

63
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,036
Well, Mr. Bauer?

64
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,956
I'm sorry, Senator.
I didn't hear a question.

65
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,198
All right, then.

66
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,236
Did you torture Mr. Hadad?

67
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:27,349
According to the definitions set forth
by the Geneva convention,

68
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,810
yes, I did.

69
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,813
Senator,
why don't I save you some time.

70
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,054
It's obvious
that your agenda is to discredit CTU

71
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:40,529
- and generate a series of indictments.
- My only agenda is to get to the truth.

72
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,110
I don't think it is, sir.

73
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:43,949
Excuse me?

74
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,293
Ibrahim Hadad had targeted
a bus carrying 45 people,

75
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,136
ten of which were children.

76
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:52,541
The truth, Senator,
is I stopped that attack from happening.

77
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,043
By torturing Mr. Had.

78
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:57,212
By doing what I deemed necessary
to protect innocent lives.

79
00:04:57,545 --> 00:05:00,055
So, basically,
what you're saying, Mr. Bauer,

80
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,336
is that the ends justify the means,
and that you are above the law.

81
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,608
When I am activated, when I am brought
into a situation, there is a reason.

82
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:11,424
And that reason is to complete the
objectives of my mission at all costs.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,707
Even if it means breaking the law?

84
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,441
For a combat soldier, the difference
between success and failure

85
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:20,277
is your ability
to adapt to your enemy.

86
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,364
The people that I deal with.
They don't care about your rules.

87
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:25,501
All they care about is a result.

88
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,078
My job is to stop them from
accomplishing their objectives.

89
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,716
I simply adapted.

90
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,934
In answer to your question,
am I above the law? No, sir.

91
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,880
I am more than willing to be judged
by the people you claim to represent.

92
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,800
I will let them decide
what price I should pay.

93
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:46,202
But please do not sit there
with that smug look on your face

94
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,289
and expect me to regret
the decisions that I have made,

95
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,398
because, sir, the truth is,

96
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:52,895
I don't.

97
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,066
Excuse me, Senator.

98
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:13,393
Sorry for interrupting, Senator.
I'm Renee Walker with the FBI.

99
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,121
We have a subpoena for Jack Bauer.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,696
I need him remanded
into my custody immediately.

101
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:22,014
I'm not surprised that anyone
has a subpoena for Mr. Bauer,

102
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,260
right now, you have to wait your turn.
He's being questioned by the US Senate.

103
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,762
We need Mr. Bauer immediately.

104
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:41,671
Well, apparently,
we're going to have to let you go

105
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,652
for now,

106
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,279
but we're not done with you.

107
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,683
We'll reconvene with you
tomorrow morning at the same time.

108
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,064
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

109
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,978
All right.
Then you go along with these agents.

110
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,041
Well,
let's proceed.

111
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,223
Bailiff, call the next witness.

112
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,192
What is this about?

113
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:18,393
I'm Special Agent Walker.
This is Agent Teller.

114
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,196
We need you to come with us
to our office. It's just down the block.

115
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,840
- Why?
- You'll be briefed when we get there.

116
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,948
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Janis, it's me. Where's Larry?

117
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,897
He's briefing Dornan's group.

118
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,295
Tell him I've got Bauer,
we're leaving the hearing now.

119
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,471
That's good,
'cause the situation's heating up.

120
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,999
- What are you talking about?
- That crew we've been tracking?

121
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,651
They just grabbed
a man named Michael Latham.

122
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,963
Latham? He worked
on Homeland's Firewall Project.

123
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,194
He didn't just work on it,
he designed it. He's the chief engineer

124
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:50,888
of the government's
<i>infrastructure security system.</i>

125
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,513
All right, I'll be there soon.

126
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,186
- Did you get Bauer through security?
- Not yet.

127
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,730
Renee's bringing him in.
They're only a couple of minutes out.

128
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,617
Then you won't need him cleared
for a couple of minutes.

129
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:08,094
- Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep...
- You're not my friend.

130
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,363
Sure. As someone as close to a friend
as you are ever going to get,

131
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,477
let me give you some advice.
Most people don't like sarcasm.

132
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:20,207
I myself have no problem with it, 'cause
I'm cheerful. I'm a cheerful person.

133
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,793
You're a cheerful person?

134
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,213
Just get Bauer cleared.

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,671
For the past eight weeks,

136
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:31,552
this office has been investigating
a series of technology thefts.

137
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,389
Software, custom gate array chips,
neural networks.

138
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,392
Forensics concluded that the break-ins
were the work of the same crew,

139
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,998
but we didn't know what
their end game was until now.

140
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,223
This is Michael Latham.
He's chief engineer

141
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:51,079
on the Classified Infrastructure Portal,
Homeland's Firewall Project.

142
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,367
He was abducted ten minutes ago

143
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,540
by the same group
behind the technology thefts.

144
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,335
You think they're using this guy Latham
to get through the CIP firewall?

145
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:01,152
That's our concern. The hardware they
stole could be used to build a device

146
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:04,347
to do just that. And Latham's one of
the few people that could do it.

147
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:08,312
We assume he's being forced to work on
the device, or that he's already dead.

148
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,898
Excuse me.
Renee's on her way in with Jack Bauer.

149
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:12,023
Thank you.

150
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,928
We've tasked your people
to help this investigation.

151
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,785
- See Sean. He's got the packets.
- We're on it.

152
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,507
We're on line with GSA 117.

153
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,493
- How many systems?
- Communications, navigation...

154
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:34,364
But we need the other systems working.
Check on Latham.

155
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:58,528
All right...

156
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,432
It's done.

157
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,609
Northeast 3, this is Global Skies 117.
We are ready for clearance.

158
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:14,154
GSA 117, Roger.
You're clear to JFK Airport as filed.

159
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:15,531
Maintain 5 000.

160
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,909
Expect flight level of 280
ten minutes after departure.

161
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,662
Cleared to JFK.
Expect flight level 280.

162
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,375
<i>Welcome to Global
Skies Flight Number 117,</i>

<i>passenger service

164
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:32,413
<i>Weather in New York is cloudy

165
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>so we may run into some

00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,207
GSA 117, that's correct.

169
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,333
I'm Agent Larry Moss.
I'm the head of this office.

170
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,819
You're here because Agent Walker thinks
you might be able to help us

171
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,824
with an investigation.
Now, personally,

172
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:18,927
I have my doubts,
but I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

173
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:21,471
Well, lucky for me,
I'm not here to apply for a job.

174
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:25,509
I don't care what makes you happy,
so let's just get this over with.

175
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,271
Take him to Renee's office.

176
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,377
Do you want me in the room with you?

177
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,102
Renee...

178
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,909
You've read his file.

179
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,829
Bauer's the kind of guy
you say the wrong thing, he can go off.

180
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,706
I'll be fine, Larry.

181
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,585
If he goes off, I'll call you.

182
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:55,848
All right, but if he doesn't produce,
don't waste our time. Throw him back.

183
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,386
What do you want?

184
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,587
We've a national security matter
that has gone critical.

185
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,749
I'm hoping you can help us with it.

186
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:09,603
Please sit down.

187
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,613
I sent the differentials
to Homeland.

188
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,839
Was there anything
else you need me to do?

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,874
Has Bauer been indicted yet?

190
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,535
No, but he will be
after the Senate hearings.

191
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:37,995
The CIP firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country.

192
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,744
If it were breached, telecommunication,
transportation, power grids.

193
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,429
- They would all be vulnerable.
- Agent Walker, right?

194
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,139
I'm not active.

195
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,400
The DOJ is about to file
criminal charges against me

196
00:12:50,527 --> 00:12:53,648
I'm not exactly in a position
to help you with your situation.

197
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,483
As much as I understand,
how dire it is...

198
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,331
No, I don't think you do.

199
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,697
One of the men behind this threat...

200
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,459
is someone you know.

201
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,073
That's not possible.

202
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:30,684
Tony Almeida is dead.

203
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:34,354
- Apparently not.
- I was there when he died.

204
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,016
And he was rushed away
by the Emts a minute later.

205
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:38,820
You never saw him after that,

206
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,133
and hours later you were
abducted by the Chinese government.

207
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,916
If Tony were still alive, I would know.
He would have contacted me.

208
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,793
We recovered this
from a security camera

209
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,522
where one of the technology thefts
took place.

210
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,882
It's time-stamped and dated.

211
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:08,279
- Images can be manipulated.
- Not this one.

212
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,468
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.

213
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,762
I had Almeida's grave exhumed.

214
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:29,733
DNA tests confirmed that it was not
his body that was buried.

215
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,117
The evidence is right here.

216
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,966
If you want to leave
without looking at it,

217
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:37,412
go ahead.

218
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,569
- <i>GSA 117 on a roll.</i>
- Masters?

219
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:08,281
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:13,785
- Are we in their system?
- Yes.

221
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,024
<i>Roger Tower, GSA 117, switching
to departure 126.8. Have a good day.</i>

222
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:47,633
- What's the problem?
- The CIP module it stopped working.

223
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,282
What do you mean it stopped?

224
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:52,892
It keeps going out of phase.

225
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,288
Latham said it was good to go.

226
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,056
Well, it's not.

227
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,911
All right, let me have it.

228
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,437
What did you do?

229
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,398
I didn't do anything.

230
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:24,928
I swear.

231
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:26,443
Then why isn't it working?

232
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,420
I don't know.

233
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,476
Fix it.
Now.

234
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,348
You're gonna want
to move faster than that.

235
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,823
See, 'cause if you can't make this work
in the next few minutes,

236
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:48,819
I won't need you anymore.

237
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,517
You understand what that means?

238
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,011
Good.

239
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,173
Now fix it.

240
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,570
<i>Officials say
that an estimated 300,000 civilians,</i>

241
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,244
<i>Men, women, and children,
have been killed</i>

242
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,966
<i>as part of General Benjamin Juma's
campaign of ethnic cleansing.</i>

243
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,878
<i>Survivors
in the African nation of Sangala,</i>

244
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:27,730
<i>believe American intervention
is necessary</i>

245
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,486
<i>to prevent further bloodshed.</i>

246
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,549
<i>The White House has made
no public statements...</i>

247
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:34,625
Juma's perpetrating
the worst mass murder

248
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,521
Africa has seen since Rwanda.

249
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,540
- But if you read the columns...
- I do.

250
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,006
Half of them
are against our taking action.

251
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,268
But if we don't...

252
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,514
six months from now,
those same members of the press

253
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,439
will be accusing us
of moral bankruptcy.

254
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:51,977
- We can always revisit the UN option.
- The UN's paralyzed, Ethan,

255
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,698
while people are being butchered
by that madman.

256
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:56,463
We have to lead.

257
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,855
Even if it means going it alone.

258
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:03,553
I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands
of lives on my conscience.

259
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:07,285
General Juma has to be stopped.

260
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,255
He will be, Madame President.
As soon as you give the order.

261
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,250
Are the Joint Chiefs here yet?

262
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,891
They're gathering in the Situation Room.
They'll call as soon as they're ready.

263
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:19,840
I just heard Kevin Aldrich
is doing a piece for CNB.

264
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,863
He's still pressing his case
against sending our troops in.

265
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:25,270
As if getting through this day
won't be hard enough.

266
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,128
I can sit down with him
and try to get him to hold off.

267
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:32,485
- I'm not sure that's a good idea.
- It's the last thing you need right now

268
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,951
especially
with public opinion so split.

269
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:45,520
If you think you can talk Aldrich down,
do it.

270
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:49,755
Madame President,
the Joint Chiefs are ready.

271
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,006
Here's your briefing package.

272
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,810
Wish me luck.

273
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,962
Good luck.

274
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,820
- Is this everything?
- It's all there.

275
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,111
I don't mean to sound
like a broken record,

276
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,409
but I'm not sure your husband
is up to handling Aldrich.

277
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,630
- Henry's fine.
- He's better, I realize that, but...

278
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,239
It's going to take
more than a few months.

279
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:38,093
He lost a son.

280
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,344
So did you.

281
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,879
And you haven't let your loss
interfere with your job.

282
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,564
Your husband is a strong man,

283
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,151
but he doesn't have your resilience.

284
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:58,093
It's not a matter
of resilience, Ethan.

285
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:01,592
There's not a day that goes by,
not a moment

286
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,936
when I don't think about my son.

287
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:07,204
But I'm about
to take this nation to war

288
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,635
and grief is a luxury
I can't afford right now.

289
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,194
Before we begin,

290
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,396
let me thank each of you for the time
and work you've put into this operation.

291
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,747
Putting American lives at risk

292
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,742
is the hardest decision
I've ever had to make...

293
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,535
but it is one that has to be made.

294
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,416
What was that?

295
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,218
- It's working.
- What was wrong?

296
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,790
It was overheating.
I came up with a workaround.

297
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,346
Try it now.

298
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:20,278
There. Yeah.
It's transmitting again.

299
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,908
We can send and receive.

300
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,075
<i>Double A-123 maintain course.</i>

301
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,833
- What was that?
- I just got it, too.

302
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:37,959
- Did you guys lose synch?
- Yeah. I did, but we're back up now.

303
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,498
- Anybody else lose synch?
- No, I'm fine.

304
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:45,493
- No, I'm good.
- What's going on, Phil?

305
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,641
This is gonna sound crazy,
but we just got bumped for a second.

306
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:51,946
But the log file doesn't
show a power surge.

307
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,348
This came from the system kernel.

308
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,857
What are you talking about?
The kernel's protected.

309
00:21:58,563 --> 00:21:59,896
Let me have a look.

310
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:07,688
All we know for sure is that Almeida
is part of a homegrown terrorist group

311
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,360
that's targeting our infrastructure.

312
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,955
He could be working undercover,
some kind of sting operation.

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,415
- Check every federal agency...
- We have. State and city, too.

314
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,038
He's not working for any of them.

315
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:18,169
- There must be some other explanation.
- There is.

316
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:21,470
His wife was murdered by a faction
operating inside the government,

317
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:23,007
led by the President himself.

318
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:26,010
Everybody involved in that
is either in prison or has been killed.

319
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,889
The government gave President Logan
a slap on the wrist, cut him a deal.

320
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,293
Sentencing him to house arrest
on a hundred-acre ranch...?

321
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,939
And you think Tony's looking for justice
by attacking this country?

322
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,939
Almeida lost everything he had,

323
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,627
and he's blaming it on the government
he spent his life serving.

324
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,282
But you'd know better
than me how that feels...

325
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:50,996
how far a man might go.

326
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,331
Not that far.

327
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:57,706
And not Tony Almeida.

328
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:01,963
There's a logical explanation for this.
It's just something you're not seeing.

329
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:04,799
Help me find Almeida
and you can ask him yourself.

330
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,469
You know how he thinks.

331
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:11,305
You had the same training.
You know the same people.

332
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,733
I need complete access
to everything you've got on this.

333
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,155
<i>- Come out here. Something just came in.</i>
- Be right there.

334
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:31,024
Everything we have on Almeida's crew
is in this directory. Start here...

335
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:32,785
I'll be right back.

336
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:42,974
What's going on?

337
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:44,839
Northeast Air Traffic Control
just called.

338
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,592
They reported a possible intrusion
into their communication systems.

339
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,552
- It just happened.
- Can they source them?

340
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,015
They're trying, but so far, nothing.

341
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,931
Why do we think
this has to do with Almeida?

342
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,987
I don't think you get intrusions
like this unless someone's driving it,

343
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:59,520
and the only way to drive it
is through the CIP firewall.

344
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:02,482
So they're going after
air traffic control.

345
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,900
That's what it looks like.

346
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:07,278
Put me through to the White House.

347
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,841
You doing a turnaround in New York?

348
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:14,734
Nope. Got two days off.

349
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:18,640
- I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.
- Oh, that'll be fun.

350
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:29,342
Well, Doug said
we were going to hit some weather.

351
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,385
I'm going to need tech support
to cross-reference your files.

352
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,751
You'll be working with one
of my analysts, Sean Hillinger.

353
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:43,022
He can get you all you need
to help us find Almeida.

354
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,756
- They raise the threat level yet?
- Yeah.

355
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:48,471
We think Almeida's group
got into air traffic control.

356
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,360
What? It doesn't make sense.

357
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:52,698
I don't need you to figure it out.
Just help me find him.

358
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:56,232
Sean, this is Jack Bauer. He's going
to be working with the Almeida files.

359
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,788
- Give him whatever he needs.
- What about interfacing with FAA?

360
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,040
Janis is working
with some of Dornan's people on that.

361
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,583
- You just help Jack.
- Fine.

362
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:05,079
- I'll check in.
- Thanks.

363
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,336
What do you want to see?

364
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,031
Let's start with the technology thefts.
How many were there?

365
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:12,802
- Six.
- Let's run a comp on all of them.

366
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:14,684
Fantastic.

367
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,395
The Expeditionary Strike Force and
its Carrier Air Wing are now on scene.

368
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,773
This gives us full spectrum dominance
of the battle space.

369
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:29,443
What kind of resistance are you
anticipating from Juma's military?

370
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:30,923
Minimal.

371
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:33,698
Our air strikes will take out
whatever defenses they've got.

372
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,034
We can expect an open path
to Juma's front door.

373
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,286
Good.

374
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,580
All we need to launch
is a go order from you.

375
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,341
You'll get a green light
as soon as I've gone over

376
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,764
Secretary Stevens'
post-invasion report,

377
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,743
which I'm still waiting for.

378
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:50,048
I'll have it for you
in a few minutes, ma'am.

379
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,426
Unless there's a problem
you'd like to discuss.

380
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,650
Madame President,
my objection to this operation

381
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:58,598
isn't a secret
to anyone in this room.

382
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,200
For us to be wading into the middle
of another civil conflict

383
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,603
- halfway around the world...
- We're done debating this.

384
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,064
The UN's been issuing reprimands
and economic sanctions

385
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,568
while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

386
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,727
That number will continue to grow
if we don't stop him now.

387
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,187
If you can't get
behind what we're doing,

388
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:19,682
I'll find a Secretary
of State who can.

389
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,622
But I am done
with your handwringing.

390
00:26:24,194 --> 00:26:25,945
Excuse me, Madame President.

391
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,503
Tim Woods from Homeland Security
is outside.

392
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,189
He needs to see you
on another matter.

393
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:33,637
- Can it wait?
- No, ma'am, it can't.

394
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,190
All right.

395
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,320
We'll continue when I return.

396
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:39,430
And, Joe

397
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,517
I want that report in front of me
when I get back.

398
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,934
- What is it?
- I don't have the details,

399
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,928
but it involves
a potential domestic breach.

400
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,419
Tim is here to fill us in.

401
00:26:58,113 --> 00:27:00,368
Tim, make this brief;
the Joint Chiefs are waiting.

402
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,438
We've been working with the FBI
the last eight weeks,

403
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:05,798
investigating a series
of technology thefts.

404
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,125
We didn't understand
the implications of this until today.

405
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:11,295
The same people behind these thefts
abducted a man named Michael Latham,

406
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:14,858
one of the chief engineers in charge
of protecting critical infrastructure.

407
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,681
Tell me what we're dealing with.

408
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:20,218
The FBI thinks these same people
have forced Latham to create a device

409
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,098
to hack through the CIP firewall.

410
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:24,822
The firewall protects
all national systems:

411
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,644
energy, utilities, transportation...

412
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,147
I'm here because
the FAA reported some...

413
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,317
irregularities in their air traffic
control system.

414
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,571
Are you saying commercial
flights are in danger?

415
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,542
Possibly.

416
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,951
Do I need to give the order
to ground air traffic?

417
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,038
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

418
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,248
There are more than 3,000 flights
over the continental United States.

419
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,042
To ground them all would take
12 hours, minimum,

420
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:53,504
- and it could create a panic.
- Then what do you recommend?

421
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:57,800
Let us quietly decrease air traffic
while the Bureau works their leads.

422
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,792
We'll make sure
you're briefed on a real-time basis.

423
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:04,265
- I don't like the timing of this...
- Timing?

424
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,976
Could this be connected
to our intervention in Sangala?

425
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:09,228
The FBI hasn't found any connection.

426
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,995
Evidence suggests that we're dealing
with a domestic terror group, homegrown,

427
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,868
with a strong, anti-government bias.

428
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:16,905
And these leads you mentioned
do you think

429
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,697
you'll be able to catch these people
before they do any real damage?

430
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:22,783
The Bureau's got
everyone on it, ma'am.

431
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,346
- You didn't answer my question.
- No, ma'am. I didn't.

432
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:37,840
Madame President, at this time,

433
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:41,218
we're doing preliminary assessments
of any collateral damage.

434
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:44,061
Of course, I don't condone
what Juma's doing over there.

435
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,015
But there are tribal wars
all over the world.

436
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:48,184
Why not intervene in Thailand,
Malaysia?

437
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,214
This isn't a tribal war, Kevin.

438
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,558
It's a genocide.

439
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:55,182
Ending it is the moral obligation
of a nation as powerful as ours.

440
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,055
That's a lofty aspiration,

441
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,179
but the reality
is a lot more complex.

442
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,614
The president's going
into this with both eyes open.

443
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:04,172
How can she be sure the cycle
of violence will stop

444
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,952
after Juma's been taken out?
Could be stuck there indefinitely...

445
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,579
keeping the peace.

446
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:12,708
If I gave you an exclusive preview
of the president's post-invasion plans,

447
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,560
you might change your mind.

448
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,922
You're trying to bribe me
with an exclusive?

449
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,882
I'm trying to get you
to give us some rope.

450
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:24,762
What are you asking me to do, stop
writing or write what I don't believe?

451
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:27,209
Either one would be fine with me.

452
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,140
Sir, you have a phone call
on your private line.

453
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,914
Could you excuse me for a moment,
please, Kevin.

454
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:45,908
It's Chuck Toland, sir.

455
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Wait.

456
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,331
Chuck, did you find something?

457
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,491
I did, but don't get carried away.

458
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,836
It doesn't confirm your theory
about how Roger died.

459
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,611
<i>But it is suspicious.</i>

460
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:01,816
- I'm listening.
- His girlfriend, Samantha,

461
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:03,676
received a large lump-sum deposit

462
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,929
in an off-shore bank account
about three days after Roger's suicide.

463
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,216
You mean his alleged suicide.

464
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,676
Right, sir.

465
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,797
Where did the money come from?

466
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,062
I couldn't tell.
It looks like it's been washed.

467
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,625
<i>There's no readily
identifiable source.</i>

468
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,470
So... what does this mean?

469
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,237
All it means is that
she suddenly came into $400,000.

470
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,240
If we find out anything more, I'm gonna
need to talk to her personally.

471
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,914
<i>Is that how you want me
to handle it?</i>

472
00:30:29,236 --> 00:30:31,210
No.
If she's got anything to hide,

473
00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:33,414
she's not going to talk
to a private investigator.

474
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,583
<i>I agree.</i>
So how do you want me to proceed?

475
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,628
I'll talk to her myself.
Is she still at that brokerage firm?

476
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,408
Yeah, Sloane Kittridge.

477
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,790
Good.

478
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:46,663
I'm going to finish up here
with Aldrich.

479
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:49,505
Then I need you to take me somewhere,
and keep it off the manifest.

480
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,967
I don't want anyone
to know where we're going.

481
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:53,476
- Yes, sir.
- Agent Gedge.

482
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:54,776
Yes, sir.

483
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,606
You think Chuck's taking
advantage of me, don't you?

484
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,568
- It's not my place to say that, sir.
- I'm asking you anyway.

485
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:06,947
Sir, the police and FBI
have both investigated your son's death.

486
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:10,254
And yes, I believe this PI could be

487
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,704
exploiting your grief
for personal gain.

488
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,414
These so-called leads
that he's generating have led nowhere.

489
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,306
My son didn't kill himself.

490
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,419
I'm sure of it.

491
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:22,616
Yes, sir.

492
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,636
Can you check
that socket again, please?

493
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,846
Has FAA reported any more anomalies?

494
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,098
Not since the first three.
Maybe it was just a glitch?

495
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:36,811
Or a ripple caused when they broke
the firewall and entered the system.

496
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,105
If they're in, I can't see them,
and I've checked every ELR socket.

497
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,027
Keep looking.

498
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,591
- What's going to happen?
- What do you mean?

499
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:50,366
If Almeida has broken through
the firewall then we're screwed, right?

500
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:52,373
Crashing a couple planes
is really nothing

501
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:54,233
compared to contaminating
the water system

502
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:57,176
- or bringing down the power grid...
- Don't think about it, Janis.

503
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:58,651
Just stay on task.

504
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,545
Okay, so...
I will just stay calm,

505
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:05,506
right?

506
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:15,541
- Pull up the second one.
- You already looked at it.

507
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,880
I want to look at it
again, pull it up.

508
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,064
Have you found anything?

509
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,942
We keep looking at the same six
forensic reports over and over.

510
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,986
- What are you looking for?
- An entry point.

511
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,277
- They had access cards.
- But noaccess card was stolen,

512
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:31,991
which means they were forged.

513
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,523
These access cards have
individual signatures,

514
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:38,265
making them almost impossible to forge.
Only a couple guys can do it.

515
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,082
Can you access old CTU files?

516
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,250
Sure.

517
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,461
Pull up August 1999.
Code name: Hatteras.

518
00:32:46,574 --> 00:32:48,365
- Just got a call from Homeland.
- And?

519
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,939
They briefed the president
but she's not ready to ground planes.

520
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:54,555
Here you go. Hatteras file.
You know, you can hire a $14.00-an-hour

521
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,173
data applications geek to do this;
you don't need me.

522
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,020
I wouldn't advertise that.

523
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,548
There he is...
Gabriel Schector.

524
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,454
- Who is he?
- He was a supplier.

525
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,697
Tony and I used him
to buy things off-book.

526
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:07,772
See if he's in your database.

527
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,531
- Yeah. He's there.
- Is he still in Los Angeles?

528
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,410
No. According to this earmark,
he came to DC nine weeks ago.

529
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:19,371
The thefts started
a week after that.

530
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:20,706
That's your guy.

531
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,439
- Do you have an address?
- He's subletting an office downtown...

532
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:27,046
1208 Naylor Road, Suite 630.

533
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,052
Put a field team
together, pick him up.

534
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:31,126
I'll call Judge Simons,
have a warrant ready.

535
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:32,927
- That's a mistake.
- Why?

536
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:36,106
You don't have time with Schector...
you serve him with a warrant,

537
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:39,169
he'll call his lawyers,
he'll stall as long as he needs.

538
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,415
What's the alternative, Jack?

539
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,182
Break in and torture the guy,
like you used to do?

540
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,470
Isn't that how you ended up
in front of a senate sub-committee?

541
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,612
Is this how it starts?

542
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,112
You get in my face,
tighten your jaw,

543
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:56,992
then if I say something you don't like,
you slam me against the wall.

544
00:33:57,378 --> 00:33:59,195
You have no idea what I do.

545
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:02,331
And last time I checked,
you subpoenaed me.

546
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:06,017
You want my help, you want my advice,
take it. You don't, don't.

547
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,461
I don't care.

548
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,173
You said you used to work with this man.
How well does he know you?

549
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,787
He knows me.

550
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:17,017
Larry, can I talk to you
for a second?

551
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:31,364
- I want to take Bauer with me.
- No.

552
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,612
I'm not letting him
put his hands on a suspect.

553
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,554
He won't need to put
his hands on anybody.

554
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,658
If he's in the room,
Schector will talk.

555
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,026
Renee, you saw...

556
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:41,495
I'm trying to find Almeida
before it's too late,

557
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,205
and Schector is our best lead.

558
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,145
So you want to intimidate him
with Bauer?

559
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,128
Schector knows how far
Bauer might go. Let's use that.

560
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,130
And if Schector doesn't blink,
then what?

561
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,111
I'll keep Bauer on a short leash.

562
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,051
We're the FBI, not CTU.
We honor the law.

563
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,267
Even when it's not convenient.

564
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:01,699
This situation is heating up fast.
The president's into it now,

565
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,601
- and she's expecting results.
- Yeah, I know.

566
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:06,764
It's your call.

567
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,107
But I promise you,
I can handle Bauer.

568
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:20,659
All right.
But I'm holding you responsible.

569
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,503
- And I'm sending backup teams.
- Okay.

570
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,594
You're coming with me,
and you're doing this my way.

571
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:48,614
Tell me about Schector.

572
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:52,691
He used to work for defense contractor
in San Diego, till he went on his own.

573
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,174
- Legitimate?
- Yeah, at first, then he got greedy.

574
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:58,500
Started using his connections
to acquire technology,

575
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:00,171
sell it on the gray market.

576
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,776
Who'd he sell to, terrorists?

577
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:04,244
No. Usually foreign governments
trying to get around treaties.

578
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,481
And how did you and Tony
get involved with him?

579
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:08,040
We arrested him, we turned him.

580
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,103
He was a great conduit for Intel.

581
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:12,503
CTU didn't mind
that you let this guy stay in business?

582
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,547
CTU didn't know.
It was just Tony and me.

583
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:18,008
You and Tony were tight?

584
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,970
Yeah, we were close.

585
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,033
All right, so it sounds like Tony,
who everyone thinks is dead,

586
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:28,393
puts together a plan
to hijack American security.

587
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,825
He contacts Schector
to help him with this plan.

588
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:34,441
Except you don't believe it.
That Tony's dirty.

589
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:37,086
I believe that Tony's alive.

590
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,364
And that he's doing something dangerous,
and that we need to find him.

591
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:05,218
We confirmed Schector's inside.
How do you want to handle this?

592
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:06,758
I'm going in with Bauer.

593
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:08,628
- Alone?
- I want Schector to talk.

594
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:11,796
I don't want to spook him.
Call me when backup gets here.

595
00:37:17,072 --> 00:37:20,437
Matobo's fighters are hidden
outside the capitol in three camps.

596
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:23,031
Alpha, beta and delta.

597
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,371
Our ground forces will join up with them
once the air strikes are completed.

598
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,431
Make sure General Wagner understands

599
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:32,506
our priority is to maintain
order in the streets.

600
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:36,295
People need to see that their country's
being governed under the rule of law.

601
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:39,506
What happens when Matobo's men
execute General Juma without a trial?

602
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:43,268
Should we intervene
or let the mob tear them apart?

603
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,421
I'm meeting with Mr. Matobo
in a few minutes.

604
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,142
I'll make sure
he keeps his men in line.

605
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:52,603
And, Joe,

606
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:55,439
I was wrong to dress you down
in front of the Joint Chiefs.

607
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:56,788
I'm sorry.

608
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:58,192
No need to apologize.

609
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,903
- You're under a lot of pressure.
- That's still no excuse.

610
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:03,447
Thank you, ma'am, I appreciate that.

611
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:05,836
The fact remains,

612
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:08,872
if you can't get behind this operation
with both shoulders,

613
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,662
I will need your resignation.

614
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,107
That won't be necessary, ma'am.
Whatever doubts I have,

615
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,920
- I'll keep them to myself.
- Good.

616
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,505
- Excuse me, Madame President.
- What is it, Ethan?

617
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,528
I thought you'd want to know,

618
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:26,557
Henry Aldrich has agreed
to delay his broadcast for 24 hours.

619
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:27,596
Henry's doing?

620
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:30,001
I underestimated him.

621
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:32,581
Letting him intervene
was the right call.

622
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:34,274
That's some good news.

623
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,606
What about the firewall situation?
Has the FBI made any progress?

624
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,082
They've identified a man
who may have information.

625
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,022
They're about to question him.

626
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,284
It's more than likely he's not going
to give you this information easily.

627
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,831
Remember, this is an FBI operation.
We work within the confines of the law.

628
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,335
You can threaten him,
but do not lay hands on him.

629
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,255
The minute I see you crossing that line,
I will pull you back, understood?

630
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:02,819
Understood.

631
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,308
Agent Walker, FBI.

632
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,599
I'm here to talk
to Gabriel Schector.

633
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:21,151
Just a second.

634
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,053
Can I help you?

635
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:34,579
How are you, Gabe?

636
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,707
Didn't know you were FBI.

637
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,177
I'm not.

638
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,419
Just came along for the ride.

639
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,880
Mr. Bauer is here
under my authority.

640
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:47,579
So I can hold you responsible
for anything he does while he's here.

641
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,344
I have a witness.

642
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:50,971
Sure.

643
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:56,299
Come on in.

644
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:01,857
Please.

645
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:04,086
Have a seat.

646
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:11,434
Well, well, well...

647
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,440
this should be
an interesting conversation.

648
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,096
How long's it been, Jack?
Years.

649
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:20,316
How's the Senate thing doing?

650
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,837
I hear they dismantled the CTU.

651
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,630
Don't tell me.

652
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:27,904
It was your fault, wasn't it?

653
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,218
Mr. Schector, we're not here
to make small talk.

654
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,511
I have questions.

655
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,764
You have my undivided attention.

656
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:37,225
- Where's Tony Almeida?
- Tony Almeida?

657
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:41,063
In the ground, I suppose.
Unless he was cremated.

658
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:44,633
Didn't he die at CTU a while back?

659
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:46,526
You got an out here, Gabe.

660
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:49,112
They're not after you.

661
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:52,327
They're willing to accept
that you didn't know what Tony Almeida

662
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:55,075
was going to do with the components
that you helped him steal.

663
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,833
Nobody I knew stole anything,
and if they did,

664
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,668
I knew nothing about it.

665
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,588
This is far more serious
than you know.

666
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:09,800
If you help us find Almeida, I can see
to it that you're kept in the clear.

667
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:13,470
Otherwise, you could be a co-conspirator
to multiple terrorist acts.

668
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:18,141
No, well, I think
this conversation is over.

669
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:22,549
I tried to answer
all your questions honestly,

670
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,356
but I think, from now on,

671
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,192
you can speak to my lawyers.
So,

672
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,866
good-bye, Jack.

673
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:32,053
And good luck with the Senate.
Hope they fry your ass.

674
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:33,178
Ari,

675
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:35,742
could you show these people
to the door, please.

676
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,079
- You want to play it like this?
- That's the way I want to play.

677
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,806
- Drop your weapon.
- Drop it now!

678
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:52,676
You two are going to prison!
This was unprovoked! Unprovoked!

679
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,137
Your man Ari was going for his gun...
I've got a witness.

680
00:41:57,914 --> 00:42:00,267
Why don't we try having
this conversation again.

681
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,222
Where is Tony Almeida?

682
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:04,563
No.
I'm not talking to you.

683
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:08,650
Where is he?

684
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:11,987
Tony Almeida's dead.

685
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:15,101
What do you want me to do?

686
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:18,451
This is your call.

687
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:22,205
Do whatever it takes.

688
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,905
This is against the law.
You can't do this.

689
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,782
- I'm gonna enjoy this.
- Enjoy what?

690
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:35,989
All right!

691
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,203
I'll tell you what I know!

692
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:43,435
There's no need for me to lose
my good looks over this.

693
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:47,779
Last time I saw Almeida...

694
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,824
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

695
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,564
Tell your men they've got a shooter
on the Columbia Building, heading south.

696
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:05,291
Shots fired. Suspects are down.

697
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:07,690
The shooter's on the roof
of the building across the street.

698
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:08,752
Seal all exits.

699
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,804
<i>Get away from this, Jack.</i>

700
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,804
Tony?

701
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,557
There's nothing you or the FBI
can do about this.

702
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,799
- Just stay away.
- Tony, just talk to me.

703
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,838
What the hell's going...

704
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:43,816
What's going on
at Schector's office?

705
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:46,437
I don't know.
They haven't checked in yet.

706
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:53,565
<i>GSA 117, Northeast Three,</i>

707
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,952
<i>descend pilot's discretion,
direct JFK.</i>

708
00:43:56,436 --> 00:43:59,686
Northeast Three, roger,
we're starting our descent now.

709
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:02,838
GSA 117, descend and maintain 2,000,

710
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:04,891
expect holding runway four-right.

711
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,869
GSA 117,
I did not receive your read-back.

712
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:12,333
Acknowledge. Over.

713
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,012
GSA 117, acknowledge.

714
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:25,096
Mr. Paulson,
I've lost comm with GSA 117.

715
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:29,606
- Try the emergency channels.
- I did.

716
00:44:31,288 --> 00:44:32,197
Nothing.

717
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,380
And there's no fault on my board.
I redirected twice.

718
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:39,798
Something's interfering
with our comm.

719
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:42,916
Call back FBI!

720
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:46,220
Tell them we have a 767 on approach
no longer under our control!

721
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:49,019
- Yes, sir.
- GSA 117, acknowledge.

722
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:52,561
GSA 117, this is Northeast Three.

723
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:54,787
<i>Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.</i>

724
00:44:55,212 --> 00:44:58,153
Advise passing 7,000,
maintain 1,500.

725
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:01,351
<i>Traffic ahead reporting
moderate turbulence.</i>

726
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,580
<i>Should be a smoother ride
for you down there.</i>

727
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:05,335
Roger that, Northeast Three.

728
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,148
<i>Understand, Northeast Three,
GSA 117.</i>

729
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,923
<i>Enter descent for 1,500.</i>

730
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,580
All right.

731
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,839
Get ready to make the course change.

732
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,368
We're really taking
this all the way.

733
00:45:24,574 --> 00:45:27,502
You just need to do exactly
what I tell you to do.
