1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,699
Any problems getting
the canisters out?

2
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,399
No. They were hidden exactly
where you said they'd be.

3
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,900
Russians will finally
understand the consequences

4
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,699
of occupying our homeland when
we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

5
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,866
Erwich has just cleared
airport security.

6
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:26,699
Then the authorities don't know
anything's been stolen.

7
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:30,099
Not yet.
Then the only thing we have
left to take care of is Bauer.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,433
You paged me?

9
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,866
I need you to do something.

10
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,900
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

11
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:36,533
Bauer is a priority.

12
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,433
I just signed a treaty.

13
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,466
Now all of a sudden

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,766
I find out
that the terrorists

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,266
are still out there...
with nerve gas.

16
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:45,599
MARTHA:
You people have to listen to me.

17
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,999
I had a document.

18
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,533
<i>It was hidden in my blouse.</i>

19
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,566
<i>It's gone.
Someone stole it from me.</i>

20
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,366
This is what she was like
before you sent her to Vermont.

21
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,132
Are you suggesting
that I readmit her?

22
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,633
For her sake, if nothing else.

23
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:01,433
Aaron, my wife is gone.

24
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:02,766
We have
a priority alert.

25
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,699
You've been burrowing
into classified

26
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,466
CTU protocols
without authorization.

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,466
<i>SPENSER:
I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

28
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:10,199
Stop. I know you logged on

29
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,766
<i>to the security subsystem
where you had no right to be.</i>

30
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,433
<i>AUDREY:
Someone knew
that Jack was alive.</i>

31
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,065
<i>It's critical
to our investigation</i>

32
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:18,766
<i>that we find out who that was.</i>

33
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,199
<i>( grunting )</i>

34
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,132
Did you let that man into CTU?

35
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,965
This man
is a professional assassin.

36
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:28,965
He just killed Dr. Paulson,
he tried to kill me.

37
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:31,433
Who told you to let
that man into CTU?

38
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,900
The White House.

39
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:35,099
Mr. Cummings.

40
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,433
JACK:
I don't understand
the problem.

41
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,232
David Palmer was murdered
because he was about

42
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,965
to expose Walt Cummings'
connection to the terrorists.

43
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,332
When Cummings failed to frame
me for Palmer's murder,

44
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,800
he tried to kill me.

45
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,766
All that may be true, Jack,
but we don't have proof.

46
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,132
We can prove that Cummings

47
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,833
used Spenser to get
Jack's assassin into CTU.

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,132
All we have
is Spenser's word.

49
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,633
That's not enough
to build a case.

50
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,499
You don't
have time to build a case.

51
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,699
You want the nerve gas,

52
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,999
Cummings
is your connection.

53
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,065
Cummings is the President's
Chief Advisor.

54
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:06,766
How exactly do you
suggest we get to him?

55
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,132
I can secretly meet
with Mike Novick,

56
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,332
enlist his help.
How do we know

57
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,866
Novick's not in this
with Cummings?

58
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,833
Because I know him.
He'll listen to me.

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,633
And the President
will listen to him.

60
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,733
With Novick's help,
we can isolate Cummings.

61
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,266
Jack, as much
as I appreciate

62
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:20,599
you wanting
to be involved,

63
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,866
you don't work here
anymore.

64
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,999
That's exactly the reason
why I should do this.

65
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:26,399
If it backfires, there'll
be no fallout on you.

66
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,800
I think it's worth a try.

67
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,499
I agree.

68
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,733
It's your call.

69
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,900
<i>( sighs )</i>

70
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,800
All right, Jack.

71
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,399
But just so we're clear,

72
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,332
this is about
finding the nerve gas,

73
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,232
not getting revenge
for David Palmer.

74
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,399
Understood.

75
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:55,232
Work out your protocols
with Ms. Raines.

76
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,466
We'll keep
looking through

77
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,232
Cummings' background
for anything

78
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,733
that supports our case.

79
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,166
We're gonna need to set up

80
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:03,232
a secure channel for you

81
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,266
to contact us on.
We'll drop you

82
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,065
as close to Logan's
retreat as possible.

83
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:11,566
Can you bring up
the satellite photo
of the compound?

84
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,366
Jack, I'm sorry if
I'm being a little distant.

85
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,932
I just...

86
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,633
It's taking me a little while
to get used to you being alive.

87
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,599
I understand.

88
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,900
I'll call Novick.

89
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,800
Jack.

90
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,866
When Cummings finds out
that you're still alive,

91
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,399
he's gonna come after you again.

92
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,666
Yeah.

93
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,833
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,999
Yes?

95
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,199
NATHANSON:
Is Bauer dead?

96
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,566
I haven't received
confirmation yet.

97
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:02,733
Your man should have
taken care of this by now.

98
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,032
Perhaps he had to alter
his strike window.

99
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,633
Has the nerve gas
reached the port?

100
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:08,800
Not yet.

101
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,132
But they should
be arriving any minute.

102
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,800
Good. I have to go.

103
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,965
I'm late for a briefing.

104
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,166
You have all the shipping
documents in order?

105
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,599
The canisters
will arrive at port

106
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,166
in your country in eight days.

107
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:31,299
Ground transportation to your
base camp will take another day.

108
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:34,232
Will you need my help
getting them to your target?

109
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,900
No. I've arranged
transport to Moscow.

110
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,366
<i>( indistinct talking )</i>

111
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,633
Have they found my wife yet?

112
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,032
No, sir,
but Secret Service is confident

113
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,533
she's still
on the grounds.

114
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,633
If they're so damn confident,
why can't anyone find her?

115
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,999
What the hell
are they doing?

116
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,199
I'm sure it's just a matter
of time, Mr. President.

117
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,199
Sorry I'm late.

118
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:06,699
I was just
setting up the video.

119
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,032
This was made
by terrorists,

120
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,099
to document the effects
of exposure to nerve gas.

121
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,932
It was recovered
from a training camp
two years ago.

122
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,399
Disorientation occurs

123
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:19,599
moments
after exposure.

124
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,566
Now the video jumps forward,

125
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,699
no more than a couple
of minutes, we estimate.

126
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,533
Within that time,

127
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,766
there's permanent damage

128
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,866
to the central
nervous system.

129
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,166
Violent seizures
take over.

130
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,232
Bronchial membranes
blister and peel away.

131
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,866
Death occurs within...

132
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,132
Stop.

133
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,999
Now, according
to DOD,

134
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:46,499
the Sentox-Six nerve gas
stolen from the airport

135
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,199
is far more lethal than the gas

136
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,433
we just saw used.

137
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,766
<i>( beeping )</i>

138
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,065
If released in a town
or city, for example,

139
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,299
the cloud will remain lethal
for much longer.

140
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,766
Are we any closer

141
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,965
to finding the canisters?

142
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:02,466
There haven't been any reports

143
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,466
of progress, sir.

144
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,232
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

145
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,833
I need to return a call
to the State Department.

146
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,733
Do you have
those updates, Walt?

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,466
Yes, here's one from CTU.

148
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:24,266
Also one from Homeland Security.

Jack. Mike Novick.

152

Yours, too, Mike.

I'm so sorry about David Palmer.

155
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,332
I know how much
he meant to you.

156
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,433
Yeah...
What's going on?

157
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,499
I have a lead on
the stolen nerve gas.

158
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,132
Isn't CTU
coordinating
the search?

159
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,299
This is something I need
to bring directly to you.

160
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,299
I don't understand.

161
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,633
I can't talk about it
on the phone, Mike.

162
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,266
We need to meet.

163
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,999
No one can know about this,
not even the President.

164
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:04,932
I'm not comfortable with
all this secrecy, Jack.

165
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,633
You need to give me some idea
what this is about.

166
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,533
It concerns Walt Cummings.

167
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,566
There's an area

168
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,232
a few hundred yards outside
the southwest gate.

169
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,733
It's at the far side
of the property

170
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,166
from the main house.

171
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,666
Thanks, Mike.
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

172
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,932
Jack...

173
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,132
Hey.

174
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,199
They said we can leave soon.

What about you?

00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,866
Are you coming home

No, I need to stay here.

179
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,733
CTU still
needs my help.

180
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
Derek, I'd like to speak

181
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,699
with your mom for a moment,
is that all right?

182
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,833
Yeah, of course.

183
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,965
Take him downstairs.

184
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,533
She'll be there soon.

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,533
You're not coming back

186
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,499
to us at all, are you?

187
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,099
No.

188
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:08,766
I never thought I was going
to be back here at CTU.

189
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,566
I would never have
gotten you involved

190
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,599
in all of this,
I promise you.

191
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:19,199
It's the woman who interviewed
me, isn't it? Audrey Raines.

192
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,032
You were involved with her.

193
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,132
I could tell by the way
you looked at each other.

194
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:32,065
I was with her before
I had to disappear.

195
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:35,032
Are you still
in love with her?

196
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,932
Yes.

197
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,132
Does she still love you?

198
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,466
I don't know.

199
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,699
Mr. Bauer.

200
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,800
Your transportation's
standing by.

201
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,666
I'll be right there.

202
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,999
I'm sorry, I have to go.

203
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,399
Thank you.

204
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:16,533
Yeah.

205
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,633
Thank you.

NOVICK'S VOICE:
I'm not comfortable
with all this secrecy, Jack.

208
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,166
You need to give me
some idea what this is about.

209
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,699
JACK'S VOICE:
It concerns Walt Cummings.

210
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,099
NOVICK'S VOICE:
There's an area,

211
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,999
a few hundred yards outside
the southwest gate.

212
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:42,633
It's at the far side of the
property from the main house.

213
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:45,366
Your man didn't
do his job.
Don't put that
on me, Nathanson.

214
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,599
You were supposed to have
Bauer killed hours ago.

215
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,266
I'm not going
to warn you again.

216
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,866
Pull yourself together.

217
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,766
You heard the call, didn't you?

218
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,166
Bauer's coming here to expose

219
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,366
my role in all this.

220
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,099
You're assuming
he knows the extent of it.

221
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,533
Well, it's obvious
he knows enough.

222
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,999
Now, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

223
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,999
At this point, there's only
one thing you can do.

224
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,801
Mrs. Logan,

225
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,134
please come out
of there.

226
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,900
Mrs. Logan...

227
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,000
Aaron...

228
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,000
don't let them take me.

229
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,568
You've got to
listen to me.

230
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:58,201
They're just trying
to help you.

231
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,601
No. No.

232
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:00,801
They're trying to set me up.

233
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,967
They're trying to make it
look like

234
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,301
I had a breakdown,
so they can

235
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:04,735
cart me off to some
psychiatric hospital.

236
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,601
Ma'am...
Aaron...

237
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,468
It's someone in my
husband's administration.

238
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,368
They're trying
to shut me up

239
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:13,101
because I know the truth.

240
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,867
What truth?

241
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,401
David Palmer.

242
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,735
<i>I know...
( radio static )</i>

243
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:25,101
Don't let him take
me, Aaron. Please?

244
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,468
We have our orders,
Mrs. Logan.

245
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:27,568
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:30,201
Aaron... please...

247
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,867
Aaron...

248
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,201
Audrey, did you check
with the airports?

249
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,867
Yes. They've all been alerted
on the missing canisters.

250
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,668
And CHP?
Same thing.

251
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,368
Trucks are being checked
at all major interstates.

252
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,668
Make sure there's no mention
of the Sentox nerve gas.

253
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:10,900
The White House is clear
about that.

254
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,267
Yes, I know.
The bulletin only describes

255
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:13,468
the missing canisters.

256
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,000
There's no mention
of chemical weapons.

257
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,368
Good. The last thing we need
is for the public to find out

258
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,434
that nerve gas is out there.

259

...what were you
doing in there?

264
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,301
Making sure the canisters
were secured properly.

265
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,468
Don't want them
knocking around

266
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,000
when this gets loaded
onto a ship.

267
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,967
My men secured the canisters
according to my instructions.

268
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,967
You don't need
to be concerned.
All right.

269
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,134
Here are the customs
documents you need
when the shipment arrives,

270
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:28,867
along with the remote
trigger and the arming codes.

271
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,534
I'll take the rest
of my payment now.

272
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,934
Our arrangement was you'll get
your final installment

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,568
when the ship
left port.

274
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,835
There's not gonna be a problem.
They're loading out

275
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,867
in less than an hour.

276
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,867
Then you won't have long
to wait.

277
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,867
Fine.

278
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,234
Ms. Raines?

279
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,067
Yes.

280
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,234
We've been released.

281
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,701
Oh, good.

282
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,234
Can I ask you
something?

283
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,934
Of course.

284
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,401
Do you still have
feelings for Jack?

285
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,434
I'm sorry,
but that's personal.

286
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,801
I know, but he's been
living with my son and me

287
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,301
for the last six months.

288
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,634
We started to become a family...

289
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,034
...and I care about him.

290
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,501
Do you know
he still loves you?

291
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,701
If you don't love him,
let him go.

Jack, it's Audrey.

00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,468
What?

298
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,534
Audrey, what?

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,701
When this is over,
are you coming back?

300
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,034
I don't know.

301
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,668
Are you going back
to Diane?

302
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,267
No...

303
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,468
I don't know what
I'm doing yet.

304
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,668
I haven't had any time
to think about it.

305
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,134
Is it true what she said?

306
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:05,301
What'd she say?

307
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:07,701
That you still love me.

308
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:18,534
I never stopped
loving you...

309
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:21,735
not for one second.

310
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,934
Then don't go away
again, Jack, please.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,401
It's more complicated
than that.

312
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:31,267
I know.

313
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,000
It's time.

314
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:40,900
I gotta go.

315
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:41,668
Jack...

316
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:42,801
I have to go.

317
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,434
Yeah, I know, I know.
Okay. Bye.

318
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,101
No, no!
Keep me out of this!

319
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,768
The last thing I want to do
is comment to the press

320
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,534
about the roadblocks
going up.

321
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,267
And we can't have any
leaks about the nerve gas.

322
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,534
It would just
cause a panic.

323
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,301
Come in.

324
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,201
Pardon me, sir.
We found Mrs. Logan.

325
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,368
Is she all right?

326
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:18,334
She's fine, sir.

327
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,735
She was hiding
in the stables.

<i>( heavy sigh )</i>

329
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,735

330
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,568
did she think
she was doing?

331
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,867
Mr. President...

332
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:32,134
I feel awkward
mentioning this, but...

333
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,000
Mrs. Logan said
some things...

334
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:34,900
About David Palmer.

335
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:36,134
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,201
I've heard her conspiracy
theories, Aaron.

337
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,701
I've heard them all.

338
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,967
But thank you
for your concern, Aaron.

339
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,934
They found my wife.

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,835
Good.

341
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,568
Mr. President...
we need to talk.

342
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:13,768
What is it, Walt?

343
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,735
I was hoping
to spare you from this,

344
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,301
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer
is forcing my hand.

345
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:23,468
He's on his way here to
meet with Mike Novick.

346
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:24,768
Bauer? Why?

347
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,768
He's going to accuse me
of helping

348
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,434
the terrorists
acquire the nerve gas.

349
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,267
That's ridiculous.

350
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,934
No, sir.

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,900
It's the truth.

352
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,634
What did you say?

353
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,668
Through a proxy, I leaked

354
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:41,867
information to
the terrorists

355
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,534
about where the nerve
gas was hidden.

356
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,634
You have to understand, sir,
this gas was never going

357
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:47,134
to pose a threat
to American lives.

358
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,668
Never pose a threat?!

359
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,934
People died in the airport!

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,867
Hostages were killed!

361
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,501
We had hoped to limit
the collateral damage.

362
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,101
"Collateral damage"?!
What are you thinking?

363
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,101
This is an unspeakable crime.

364
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:09,301
Walt... you have to answer
for this.

365
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:12,134
Mr. President...
it's in your best
interest to hear me out

366
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,468
before you make
that phone call.

367
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:16,735
<i>( slams receiver )</i>

368
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,034
What do you mean
"my best interest"?

369
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,401
Sentox gas is being smuggled
out of the country

370
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,900
by separatists who think
they are going to use it

371
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,434
against the Russians.

372
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,601
However, that nerve gas will
never reach Russian soil.

373
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,434
And you know this how?

374
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:34,234
We control the remote detonators
on those gas canisters.

375
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,234
As soon as they reach
the terrorists' base,

376
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,334
we'll trigger the
canisters by satellite

377
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,534
and release the gas.

378
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,267
So everything
that happened today

379
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:42,835
was just to kill
a some terrorists?

380
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,801
No, the goal is to
produce a smoking gun,

381
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,835
proof of the existence

382
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
of weapons of mass destruction
in Central Asia.

383
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,534
This is unbelievable.

384
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:55,101
It's necessary.

385
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,634
It will finally
give us a pretext

386
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,601
to increase our military
presence in the region,

387
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:02,701
guaranteeing the flow of oil
for the next generation.

388
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,835
How dare you.

389
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,401
How dare you act
without my consent.

390
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:08,801
How dare you put
this administration--

391
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,234
this entire country in jeopardy.

392
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,368
You're a traitor.

393
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:16,934
No, no, Mr. President,
I am a patriot!

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,067
Doing what needs
to be done

395
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,101
for the continued safety
and well-being of this nation!

396
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:26,034
My God...

397
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,034
you gave the order to have
David Palmer killed.

398
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:33,167
That was an unfortunate
but necessary intervention.

399
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:36,801
He found out too much
and we had...
Walt!

400
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:39,234
You're rationalizing murder,
the murder of a president.

401
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:42,101
You're going to contact
these people

402
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,167
and recover the nerve gas
before it leaves the country.

403
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,267
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Why not?

404
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,234
I don't know where
the nerve gas is.

405
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,601
And the man I have
working inside

406
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,000
has gone dark--
he's unreachable.

407
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:57,835
Now, you'll let things
play out as they are.

408
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,368
Otherwise, your administration
will be implicated

409
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,000
and your presidency
will be destroyed.

410
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,568
Jack.

411
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,901
Thanks for seeing me
like this, Mike.

412
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:59,668
What is it?

413
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,801
Did you tell anyone
we were meeting?

414
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:03,234
Of course not.

415
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:12,901
Son of a bitch!
Who did you tell?

416
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:15,701
Who did you tell?!
I didn't tell
anybody, Jack!

417
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,434
<i>MAN ( over loudspeaker ):
Jack Bauer,
stay right where you are.</i>

418
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,467
Put down your weapons
and put your hands up.

419
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,067
What's the meaning
of this?!

420
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:28,100
Tell your men
to stand down!

421
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,467
I'm sorry, sir,
we can't do that.

422
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:31,534
He's here at my request!
We have orders

423
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,834
to use force
if necessary.

424
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,701
Orders? From who?

425
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,801
The President of
the United States.

426
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:44,467
Get on your knees.

427
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,367
Thanks.

428
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,801
Novick and Bauer have
been taken into custody.

429
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:10,601
So we're just gonna
lock Mike Novick up?
For the time being.

430
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,768
Well, what good will it do?
Eventually, he's gonna get out,

431
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,100
and he's gonna talk
to the press.

432
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,434
What can he say?
He doesn't know anything.

433
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:18,568
I thought you told me
he talked to Jack Bauer.

434
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:21,067
We stopped Bauer before he
could give Mike any details.

435
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:24,035
What's he gonna think?

436
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,534
We're detaining him.

437
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,001
Bauer was about to divulge
national security secrets

438
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:29,901
that Mike's not
authorized to hear.

439
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,167
That's why Mike's
being detained.

440
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:33,668
And what about Bauer?

441
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,234
He must have talked
to other people at CTU

442
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,334
and told them
what he knows.

443
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,001
As soon as this

444
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,035
nerve gas leaves
U.S. soil,

445
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,968
it's gonna be very difficult
to prove

446
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:45,801
that either of us
is connected

447
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,301
to this in any way.

448
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,434
And you're sure that
these-these-these
detonators will work,

449
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:54,834
that the Sentox gas
will be released
before it can be used

450
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,501
against the Russians?
Yes.

451
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,834
Right now all you need to do
is authorize me

452
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,234
to terminate
CTU's involvement

453
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,734
in this matter.

454
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,234
We'll tell them we've got the
situation under control,

455
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,901
and that we'll
deal with Bauer.

456
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,401
Who, after all, is not
officially affiliated

457
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,768
with them any longer.

458
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:18,367
All right.

459
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:21,234
Good.

Mr. President, I have

463

Mrs. Logan for you.

464

Yes, sir.

What is Jack Bauer doing here,

468
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:17,367
why is he under arrest,
and why wasn't I told?

469
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:20,067
Orders of
the president.
Directly?

470
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:24,634
No. It came through
Walt Cummings' office.

471
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:27,067
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:34,267
We're no longer running point
on the search for the canisters.

473
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,467
We've been ordered off
by Division.

474
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,701
Why?

475
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,067
The White House
wants to use

476
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,534
their own people
to coordinate from now on.

477
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,167
That doesn't make sense--
we'll waste hours

478
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:43,568
getting another agency
up to speed.

479
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:44,935
Yeah, I know.
I tried calling the president.

480
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,234
He's not taking my calls.
What about Mike Novick?

481
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:47,501
Jack should be with him by now.

482
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:48,801
Novick's people say
he's unreachable,

483
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,001
and Jack's cell goes
right to voice-mail.

484
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,467
Something's wrong.

485
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,367
Yeah, I know, but I don't know
what we can do about it.

486
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,401
I do.
What?

487
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,401
We can disregard
the order.

488
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,634
We're not disregarding
a presidential order.

489
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:01,901
If we don't, we will not
find this nerve gas.

490

Sending Jack Bauer
to have a conversation

491
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:04,834
with Mike Novick as a
private citizen is one thing,

492
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:07,634
but I'm not about to start
considering disobeying

493
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:08,935
a direct order from
the White House.

494
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,100
That's because you don't
have the experience

495
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,267
to know any better.

for a moment?

I can't have you talking
to me like that in front
of these people.

500

You're right. I'm sorry.
Are we clear about
who's in charge here?

501
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,367
Yeah, but my advice stands.

502
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,401
If this order jeopardizes
our chances of finding

503
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,968
that nerve gas,
it's your responsibility

504
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,200
to ignore it-- at
least until we can

505
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,234
make our case
to the White House.

506
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:38,634
You also need to learn

507
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:40,901
to make decisions
faster.

00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:20,834
<i>( door opens )</i>

534
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:24,501
Mr. Bauer, you're being moved

535
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:27,301
per the president's
orders.
Where?

536
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,935
To a class three
detention facility.

537
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,901
On what charges?
I was invited here

538
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,367
by Mike Novick.

539
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,501
Those are my orders, sir.

540
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,701
You're Pierce, right?

541
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:41,768
Aaron Pierce. You served
under David Palmer.
Yes, I did.

542
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,834
I need to speak with you
just for a moment, please.
That's not possible.

543
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,601
It concerns David
Palmer's killer.

544
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,301
All right.

545
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:53,067
David Palmer was assassinated
because he was on the verge

546
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:56,668
of discovering that the
terrorists that attacked us
today were being helped

547
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,001
by someone within
Logan's administration.
Who?

548
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,334
Walt Cummings.

549
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:03,634
Why would Mr. Cummings
be involved

550
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,367
with terrorists?
I couldn't tell you.

551
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:07,768
But I can tell you
that the terrorists
are now in possession

552
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,001
of a weaponized nerve gas,
and Walt Cummings may be

553
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,200
the last chance we have
to stop them in time.

554
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:16,334
Walt Cummings ordered the
assassination of David Palmer.

555
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:20,601
I know that's hard to believe,
but I can prove it, it's true.

556
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:23,568
Actually, it's not
that hard to believe.

557
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:25,868
The First Lady also thinks

558
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,067
someone in the administration
was involved.

559
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,200
Your primary responsibility
as lead agent

560
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:31,901
is to protect the President

561
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,501
of the United States.

562
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,901
Someone in his administration
is undermining his authority.

563
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:39,200
That is equivalent
to a coup d'\tat.

564
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:42,868
Agent Pierce, please...

565
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:44,868
please, I need your help.

566
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:01,521
Bauer's escaped.

567
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:04,188
When? I didn't get
a code alert.

568
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:05,420
My comm's down.

569
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,521
Call it in, have agents
cover the west gate--

570
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:09,554
that's where he was headed.
What about you?

571
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,155
I'll take your post.

572
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:12,354
Go.

573
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,554
Yes, sir.

574
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:21,487
That was NSA--
CTU hasn't transferred

575
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:24,687
the search operation
to their jurisdiction yet.

576
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:25,921
What's the problem?
I don't know.

577
00:30:25,988 --> 00:30:27,854
But you need to
call Lynn McGill,

578
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:29,287
make sure we're in charge
of this.

579
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:31,754
I've been avoiding his calls
because he's just gonna ask me

580
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,155
why I'm pulling CTU off
the search operation,

581
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,954
and I don't know
what to tell him!

582
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:36,121
You don't have
to tell him anything.

583
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:37,621
You're the president.

584
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:39,320
Agent Pierce,

585
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,287
we're in the middle
of a meeting, if you don't mind.

586
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,387
Mr. President,

587
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:46,454
my name is Jack Bauer,
and I'm sorry to have

588
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,088
to confront you like this,
but your chief of staff

589
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:49,754
is withholding information

590
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,454
that is vital
to this nation's security.

591
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,654
<i>( blow lands )
Stop this!</i>

592
00:30:58,387 --> 00:31:00,521
I'm the President
of the United States--

593
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:01,721
get your hands
off this man!

594
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:03,554
Agent Pierce, do something!

595
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:05,221
I am, Mr. President.

596
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:06,821
I'm upholding my
oath to protect you.

597
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,621
That won't have
any effect, sir.

598
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,387
I've overridden
the distress line.

599
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:14,121
Mr. Cummings is guilty of
conspiring with terrorists.

600
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:16,121
He facilitated the theft
of a military-grade nerve gas,

601
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:19,754
and today is responsible for the
death of at least three people,

602
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:21,121
including David Palmer.

603
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:23,287
I know about that, but
there's an explanation.

604
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:25,554
What do you mean,
you know about that?

605
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:27,988
Mr. Bauer, please, I just
found out a couple minutes ago.

606
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,221
It's very complicated.

607
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,021
I don't know
what this man has told you,

608
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,821
but we need to find
that nerve gas now,

609
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:34,854
and I mean immediately,
before it is too late.

610
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,454
It's already too late.

611
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:37,854
What do you mean?

612
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,454
Apparently, it's on its way
out of the country.

613
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:44,021
Where is it?!

614
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:45,387
He told me he doesn't know!

615
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,754
He's lying to you, sir!

616
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,121
The man I have
inside has gone dark,

617
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:52,487
I don't know.

618
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:57,954
I'm done talking with you,
you understand me?

619
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:59,687
Now you read my file.

620
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:00,888
First thing I'm going to do,
I'm going to take out

621
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:01,954
your right eye,
then I'm going to move over,

622
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:02,921
and I'm going to take our
your left.

623
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,221
And then I'm going to cut you.

624
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,021
I'm going to keep cutting you
until I get

625
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,221
the information that I need,
you understand me?

626
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,687
So for the last time,
where is the nerve gas?

627
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:17,155
<i>( Cummings grunts )</i>

628
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:18,821
Stop.

629
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,654
Stop! Stop!
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you!

630
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,188
<i>( breathlessly ):
I'll tell you.</i>

631
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,387
It's-it's on a freighter leaving
the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

632
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,287
JACK:
How is it concealed?!

633
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,788
In a container
carrying medical supplies.

634
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,420
What's the container number?
I don't know.

635
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:31,587
What's the number?!

636
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:32,754
I don't know!

637
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:33,921
I-I'd tell you, I swear.

638
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:36,420
LOGAN:
Mr. Bauer!

639
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,754
<i>( grunting )
I don't know.</i>

640
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:42,854
<i>( strained grunting )</i>

641
00:32:56,387 --> 00:32:57,921
<i>( intercom beeps )</i>

642
00:32:57,988 --> 00:32:59,888
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan, I've got
Jack Bauer on line three.

643
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:01,654
Jack, what's going on?
We've been trying to reach you.

644
00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:05,487
Bill, hold on. I'm going
to put you on speakerphone.

645
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:07,721
Bill, I'm standing here
with the president.

646
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,754
The nerve gas is
at Long Beach Harbor

647
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,988
in a container full
of medical supplies

648
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:13,054
on a freighter bound
for Central Asia.

649
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,221
It's set to depart
at 2:30 p.m.

650
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,954
How solid
is the intel, Jack?

651
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:18,354
It came directly
from Cummings.

652
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,521
Mr. President, we've
been trying to reach you

653
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:23,054
about an order we received
changing our jurisdiction.

654
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,287
Disregard the order.

655
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:26,420
Then you want CTU to maintain

656
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:27,888
operational control
of the retrieval?

657
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,554
Yes. Absolutely.

658
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,354
I'm alerting CBP.

659
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,387
Get hazmat teams in there
and set up a perimeter.

660
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:36,155
Have medical teams standing by
in case the gas is released.

661
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:37,121
Got it.

662
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,221
Good work, Jack.

663
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:40,221
Are you heading back
to CTU?

664
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,554
I don't know yet.

665
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,621
Jack, we'll let you know
when we have more information

666
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:46,255
on the container.

667
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,354
Copy that.

668
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:54,988
Mr. President, Agent Pierce
and I are prepared

669
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:58,654
to hand ourselves over
to the authorities now.

670
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,621
Aaron.

671
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,721
Yes, Mr. President?

672
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:10,821
Take back your shield and get
Walt Cummings out of my sight.

673
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:13,521
Yes, sir.

674
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,954
He told me it was too late,
and I believed him.

675
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:42,854
You need to understand,
I trusted Walt Cummings...

676
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,454
but he lied to me.

677
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:47,487
I was coerced.

678
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,255
There is, uh, one more thing
that we need to discuss.

679
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,754
What is that, sir?

680
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:00,354
You.

681
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,354
The fact that you're alive

682
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,287
presents problems
for both of us.

683
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:09,420
<i>( softly ):
Yes, Mr. President.</i>

684
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:10,988
I accomplished what
I set out to do,

685
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:17,221
which was to identify and
locate David Palmer's killer.

686
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:21,788
I would like to stay on until
the nerve gas is retrieved.

687
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:26,621
After that, I give you my word
I will simply disappear again.

688
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,788
All right.

689
00:35:31,854 --> 00:35:35,121
I think that would be best
for the good of the country.

690
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,687
Yes, sir.

691
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:44,155
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

692
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,654
Thank you, Mr. President.

693
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,688
I'll see you soon.

694
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:42,154
<i>( knocks on hood )</i>

695
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,488
Wait. Hold up, Kevin.

696
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,454
What's happening?

697
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:48,054
Martha.
Charles...

698
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:50,655
Come on. Get out
of the car.

699
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,621
Be careful.

700
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:53,154
What?

701
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:57,121
You were right.

702
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:58,254
There was a conspiracy.

703
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:00,288
David was trying
to warn you and warn me.

704
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:01,954
I should have listened
to you.

705
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:03,154
<i>( stammering ):
I-I...</i>

706
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,854
Y-you... you believe me now?

707
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,254
It was Walt Cummings.

708
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:10,288
He lied to me.

709
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,488
He convinced me that

710
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,221
you were out of control.

711
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:14,288
Walt?!

712
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:15,820
Sending you back
to the... the clinic

713
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,354
in Vermont
was his idea.

714
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,421
And you went along with it.

715
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:26,187
I'm sorry, Martha.

716
00:37:26,254 --> 00:37:30,521
Sending me away
without a word...

717
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:35,054
like I was... some nuisance
to be gotten rid of.

718
00:37:39,187 --> 00:37:40,954
Excuse me,
Mr. President,

719
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,887
but you wanted to know
when a link with CTU

720
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:43,854
was established.

721
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,854
Yes, um...
thank you, Wendy.

722
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,755
See that
the First Lady's bags

723
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,755
get back to
her room.

724
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,321
Of course.

725
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:57,755
I've got to go.

726
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,054
Chloe, do we have confirmation
on the intel Jack gave us?

727
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,655
There's only one ship scheduled

728
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,721
to leave the port
of Long Beach at 2:30.

729
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,820
It's a freighter
heading for Central Asia,

730
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,421
leaving from Pier F.

731
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:26,787
We don't have CTU teams
in the vicinity,

732
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:28,755
but we've got a Customs
and Border Protection

733
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,354
task force on site
under our directive.

734
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,655
All right, make sure
that CBP understands

735
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:33,987
the nerve gas is
housed in 20 canisters

736
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,388
of gray metal
that are unmarked.

737
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:36,920
They're going
out in a shipment
of medical supplies.

738
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:38,254
Yeah, yeah,
they know all that already.

739
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,521
But there's going to be

740
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,054
about a thousand cargo
containers on that ship,

741
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,621
and we don't know
which one the
nerve gas is in.

742
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,087
It's container 539146,
box seven.

743
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,087
I was able to hack into
the ship's manifest.

744
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:49,354
It's the only container
stocking medical supplies.

745
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,987
That's great.

746
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,288
Make sure all the strike
force units have that.

747
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,154
Right.
Lynn, the White House
is requesting

748
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,688
a live feed from the assault.

749
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:57,121
We'll have Chloe
patch them in once
the TAC teams

750
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:58,354
reach the staging area.

751
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,421
All right, got it. Yeah.

752
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:05,521
That's him.

753
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:07,354
<i>BUCHANAN ( over speakerphone ):
His name is Ivan Erwich.</i>

754
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,688
He's a chemical engineer

755
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:10,820
trained at the University
of St. Petersburg.

756
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:13,521
Joined his country's separatist
movement six years ago.

757
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:14,721
Do we have
any clearer images,

758
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,021
any file photos?

759
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,721
No, which is why
we need you to I.D. him

760
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,521
when the strike force
has a visual.

761
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:22,221
Okay, just make sure
that CPB knows

762
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:23,887
that we need
to take Erwich alive.

763
00:39:23,954 --> 00:39:25,554
They know. Stand by.

764
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:26,755
What's the situation?

765
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,288
The strike team
is in place, Mr. President.

766
00:39:28,354 --> 00:39:32,321
We're just waiting
for the video feed to come up.

767
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:34,288
Feed's up.

768
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:42,121
<i>FINN ( over monitor ):
CTU, we've located
the target container.</i>

769
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,354
No hostiles present.

770
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:45,321
You have the green light,
Agent Finn.

771
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:47,421
Remember, do not discharge
your weapons

772
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:48,920
unless absolutely necessary.

773
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,755
If a bullet breaches
one of those canisters,

774
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,887
we'll have
a massive casualty situation.

775
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:54,987
FINN:
Copy that.

776
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,454
Masks on.

777
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:20,954
Go!

778
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,887
Don't move!

779
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:32,954
Put your hands
in the air now!

780
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:41,354
He's dead.

781
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:42,954
Open 'em up.

782
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,354
Open 'em up.
Let's go! Open 'em all up.

783
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,087
This one.

784
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,421
Empty. Next.
Moving on, moving on.
No.

785
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,254
FINN:
Come on, get it open.

786
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,954
Empty. Next.
Come on, move it.

787
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,021
Open it, open it.

788
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,588
Next.

789
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,421
Open it, come on,
come on.

790
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:02,421
What do we got?
What do we got?!

791
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:04,787
Nothing?!

792
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:05,787
There are

793
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,388
no gas canisters here, CTU.

794
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:09,721
Repeat, the nerve gas
is not here.

795
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,421
Get Walt Cummings in here now!

796
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:13,854
Yes, sir.

797
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:16,854
Damn it!

798
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:19,987
The nerve gas
isn't there.

799
00:41:20,054 --> 00:41:21,920
It has to be.

800
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:24,021
Where are the canisters?!

801
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:25,221
I don't know.

802
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:27,321
I-I've told
you everything.

803
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:29,954
They have
to be there.

804
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:33,454
Oh, God...

805
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:34,787
What is it?

806
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:37,755
That's Schaeffer,
the man we had inside.

807
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,187
They must've found out
we reprogrammed

808
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:42,121
the detonators.

809
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,054
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

810
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,354
It's his cell
phone, sir.

811
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,454
Who's calling you?

812
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,755
That's Schaeffer's number.

813
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,920
JACK:
Bill?

814
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:14,421
Yeah, Jack?
I want you
to monitor

815
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:15,755
and record this call.

816
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,920
We're on it.

817
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,054
Answer it now.

818
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:22,187
Yes?

819
00:42:22,254 --> 00:42:23,321
ERWICH:
We know you've altered

820
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:24,454
the arming codes,
Mr. Cummings.

821
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:26,321
CUMMINGS:
Who is this?

822
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:30,054
I think you know my name...
as I now know yours.

823
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:31,488
Your man Schaeffer confessed

824
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:33,054
everything.

825
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:36,388
Is President Logan with you?

826
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:37,755
The President
had nothing

827
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,820
to do with this...

828
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:41,421
nor did anyone else
in the government.

829
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:42,554
I was acting alone.

830
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,755
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

831
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,221
It's the truth.

832
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,388
Erwich, listen.

833
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,521
We can negotiate something.

834
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,187
I don't negotiate
with my enemies.

835
00:42:51,254 --> 00:42:53,054
I eliminate them.

836
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:55,054
Your country is about to pay

837
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:58,054
a very steep price.
