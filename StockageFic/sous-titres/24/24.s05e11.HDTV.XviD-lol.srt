1
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:14,734
Jack, we've authenticated
the thumb-drive data.

2
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,300
Omicron definitely made
the Sentox for the military.

3
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:18,400
Who is this Henderson?

4
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,868
JACK:
Someone I used to work for.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:22,701
Where?
CTU.
He's the man who recruited me.

6
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,601
Things ended badly between us.

7
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,467
What are accusing me
now of, Jack, being in
bed with terrorists?

8
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,367
I need complete access
to Omicron's Sentox program.

9
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:31,634
HENDERSON:
I've got to merge
some files,

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,934
find out who was working
on this project.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,067
We need I.T.

12
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,367
They're next door.

13
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:36,400
I listened to everything

14
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,133
Bauer had to say
about the thumb-drives.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,133
CTU does not have enough
information to hurt us.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
WOMAN:
What about Bauer?

17
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,501
Well, in about one minute,
he'll be dead.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,567
Oh, my God...

19
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:49,367
How could I be so stupid?

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,234
( yells )

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,067
Mr. McGill, we think
there might be an attack

22
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,367
on President Suvarov's
motorcade.

23
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,968
My people are not going to chase
that white elephant.

24
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:13,834
They're busy trying to locate 19
canisters of Sentox nerve gas.

25
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,033
Now let my people focus
on their work,

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,667
or I will have you
escorted out of here!

27
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:20,467
Lynn is mentally incapable
of running CTU.

28
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,234
What are you suggesting?
Section 112.

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,267
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles
and Ms. O'Brian,

30
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,567
put them in holding,

31
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,567
and then escort
Audrey Raines out of CTU.

32
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,601
Lynn McGill,I'm relieving you
of your command

33
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,734
under the "incapacity clause"
of section 112.

34
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,601
Mrs. Logan is riding
with the Suvarovs.

35
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,667
Get my wife on the phone.

36
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:37,968
The terrorists were
very specific:

37
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,667
if I don't allow them
to attack the motorcade,

38
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,834
they're going to release
canisters of nerve gas

39
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:45,434
in multiple locations.

40
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,334
You need to get out of the car!

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,968
We're under attack;
we need backup now!

42
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,367
( gunfire )

43
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:52,534
( screams )

44
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,133
( sirens approaching )

45
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,400
I thought we had
an understanding.

46
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,667
It happened outside
of my authority.

47
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,133
I told no one.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,968
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

49
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,834
then its new ally,
the United States,

50
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,567
will pay with the lives
of its citizens.

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,701
Mr. President, this is our
final conversation. Good-bye.

52
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,234
No... Wait!

53
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:28,434
How long has
he been conscious?

54
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,100
Ten minutes.
Before you go in,

55
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,701
you should be aware
of something.

56
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,267
Tony's been asking
for his wife.

57
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:36,868
He doesn't remember?

58
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:40,334
He remembers the explosion,
but that's all.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,234
We have to tell him
Michelle is dead.

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,634
No, absolutely not.

61
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,701
He's undergone severe trauma.
This kind of stress will

62
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:49,434
raise his blood pressure and
make the vascular damage worse.

63
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,501
Please, just hold off
on telling him

64
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,534
until his condition
has stabilized.

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,300
Would you
excuse us, please?

66
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,133
Tony.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,968
How are you feeling?

68
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,767
They told me
they took Michelle to Cedars.

69
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,267
Yes, they couldn't treat
her here.

70
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,133
Why? How badly was she hurt?

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,033
Is she going to be okay?

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,000
As far as I know, yes.

73
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,234
What the hell's going on here,
Bill?

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,901
They killed President Palmer,

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,934
and they tried to kill
Michelle and me.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,334
David Palmer was
the primary target.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,100
They killed him because he was
going to expose

78
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,601
someone inside Logan's
administration.

79
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,834
They set Jack up
to take the fall.

80
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:44,234
Did they get Jack?

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,267
No. He's alive.

82
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,501
He's working with us here
on a provisional basis.

83
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,267
Bill, I need to talk to Jack.

84
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,934
You need to rest.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,334
No, I don't need to rest.

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,968
I need to talk to Jack. Now.

87
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,467
I'll tell him.

88
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,968
Thanks.

89
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,667
Could you do me a favor?

90
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,801
Could you get a message
to Michelle?

91
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,000
Tell her I'm okay.

92
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,467
I will.

93
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:12,000
( softly ):
Tony...

94
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:14,968
we need you to get better.

95
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,067
( indistinct police radio
transmission)

96
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,367
( speaking in Russian )

97
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,033
( crying )

98
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,334
Copy, Blacktop One.

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,701
We're standing by.

100
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,334
The Navy helicopter is
on its way, ma'am.

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,701
It'll take us back
to the retreat.

102
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,767
He... didn't warn
the motorcade.

103
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,534
Ma'am?

104
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:14,701
Charles, he knew
about the attack, and...

105
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,300
he just let it happen, Aaron.

106
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,334
That can't be true.

107
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,200
He didn't just let it happen.
He...

108
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:30,667
He gave the terrorists
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

109
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:33,834
Ma'am, why would he do that?

110
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,501
( helicopter approaches )

111
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,634
How soon before
you're ready?

112
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,801
I'll be leaving
in a couple of minutes.

113
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:56,100
I just need to finish setting
the arming mechanism.

114
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,300
Make sure you place the canister
to maximize casualties.

115
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,367
It must look as if this
is one of our primary targets.

116
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,300
It'll be taken care of.

117
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,534
OSTROFF ( over phone ):
Yes?

118
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,033
Do you have the key card yet?

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,934
I'll have it within the hour.

120
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,634
They're can be
no miscues.

121
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm using up one of my canisters
to create this diversion.

122
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,400
Without the key card,
it's all for nothing.

123
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,934
Call me when you have it.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,567
I will.

125
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,934
( phone rings )

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,133
( sniffs )

127
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,634
Hello.

128
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,300
I'm going to be there soon.

129
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,968
Make sure you bring the money.

130
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:39,801
You'll have it.

131
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:42,000
And you'll have
your precious card.

132
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,534
Careful.

133
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,167
It's all we got left.

134
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,934
Don't worry about it.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,234
In a little while, be
able to buy all you want.

136
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:04,133
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs
have been treated.

137
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,133
The chopper is picking
them up now.

138
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,968
What do I say to my wife, Mike?

139
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,167
She put you
in an impossible situation...

140
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,601
It's my job to handle
impossible situations,

141
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,934
and I failed,
and not for the first time.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,067
Mr. President...
I should never
have given in.

143
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,968
I should have ordered
back the motorcade.

144
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,701
Sir, with all due respect,
you don't have time

145
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,901
for self-recrimination.

146
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,601
The terrorists' attack failed.

147
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,501
We have to assume they'll make
good on their threat

148
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,567
to use the Sentox
on American soil.

149
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,300
Has CTU made any progress,

150
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,968
or are they just waiting
for the other shoe to drop?

151
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,701
They're looking for a lead,

152
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:43,067
working the scene where
the motorcade was ambushed.

153
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,000
Bill, they're airlifting
the bodies

154
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,400
of the terrorists to CTU.

155
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,701
When will they be here?

156
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,934
Any minute. I'm meeting
them in the morgue.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,367
Let me know what you find.

158
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,367
You got it.

159
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,601
Jack's calling in.

160
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,100
Put him on speaker.

161
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,400
Jack, we're in an emergency
briefing with department heads.

162
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,701
Bill wants to put you
on speaker.

163
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,601
I thought Lynn took Bill
off the active roster.

164
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,234
AUDREY:
Bill's been reinstated, and
Lynn's been relieved of duty.

165
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,901
Okay, fine. Put me on.

166
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:09,234
All right.
You're on.

167
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,367
Jack, it's Bill.

168
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,334
What did you find
at Omicron?

169
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,434
Christopher Henderson was
responsible for setting up

170
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:15,901
the deal that allowed
the terrorists

171
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,167
to gain control of the Sentox.

172
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,367
He just tried to kill me
by blowing up a bunker

173
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:20,901
that the Sentox was
developed in.

174
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,367
I managed to survive,
but unfortunately

175
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,267
the servers that control
the data were destroyed

176
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,567
and Henderson managed to escape.

177
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:26,667
Chloe, are you there?

178
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:27,868
Go ahead, Jack.

179
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,868
Can you hack into
Henderson's office computer?

180
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:30,934
I already did it.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,934
Henderson's
home workstation is clean.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,601
He wiped his hard drive
five minutes ago.

183
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,834
There's still
an active socket.
What's that mean?

184
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:39,234
It means he's exchanging
data with an off-site link.

185
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,367
Can you locate it?

186
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,567
Yeah. The registry listing is

187
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:45,200
5714 Tarawood Drive,
Toluca Lake.

188
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,734
Tarawood Drive?

189
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,067
That's his home address.

190
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,367
I'll send a tac team.

191
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,734
No, Bill.
I need to go in alone.
Why?

192
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:55,400
Henderson's good; he'll be able
to detect a tac team moving in.

193
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,400
How do you want
to play this, Jack?

194
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:58,634
He left me for dead.

195
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,434
I'm the last person
he expects to see.

196
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,667
I should be able to walk
up to his front door.

197
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,868
All right.
But I want you

198
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,234
in constant contact
with CTU.

199
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,534
Right now, Henderson is

200
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,834
our primary link to finding
this nerve gas.

201
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,234
I know.
I'll get back to you.

202
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,601
WOMAN:
You've reached the private
client line

203
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,968
for Banco Buenos Aires.

204
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,868
Please leave a message
at the tone

205
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,901
or press the star button
for immediate assistance.

206
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,868
MAN:
Client identification code,
please.

207
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:36,968
Eight-four-seven-seven-C,
as in "Charlie."

208
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,701
How can I help you,
Mr. Henderson?

209
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,167
I'd like after-hours access

210
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,434
to my personal safety deposit
box, please.

211
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,100
Buchanan.

212
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,400
Bill, we found a schematic

213
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,100
of some kind
of ventilation system

214
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,400
on one of the terrorists.

215
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,901
It's from the Suvarov attack.

216
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,100
Since that's the most efficient
way to deliver the Sentox,

217
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,934
this could potentially be
their next target.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,167
Do we know what building
the schematic is from?

219
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:02,901
Not yet. But I sent a copy
off to Building and Safety.

220
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,767
They're running it
against their archive.

221
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,133
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar.

222
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,601
I want them
working on this, too.

223
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,067
Better make it fast.

224
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,267
There's a number handwritten
in the margin-- 18:00 hours.

225
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:14,133
That means the attack could
happen in the next hour.

226
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,467
Yeah.

227
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,801
That was Curtis.

228
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,801
He's going to upload a set
of schematics to our server.

229
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,834
This is the likely target
of their next attack.

230
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,167
There was
a time-stamp on it.

231
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,801
The attack could occur
sometime in the next hour.

232
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:26,567
Where is it?
We don't know.

233
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:28,567
The only thing Curtis could tell
at first glance is

234
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,834
that it's the ventilation system

235
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,467
in some kind of
industrial building.

236
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:32,601
How big?

237
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,300
Big enough to hold
several thousand people.

238
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,501
Let's find it.

239
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,100
How you doing, Tony?

240
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,467
Fine.

241
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,434
Have you heard anything else
on my wife's condition?

242
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,234
I haven't heard anything new.

243
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,701
Sorry.

244
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,534
( panting )

245
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,767
Tony.

246
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,267
You'll have to get
back to Recovery.

247
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,400
Get away from me.

248
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,567
Mr. Almeida, please...
I said get away from me!

249
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,434
Tony, come on.

250
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,267
Two cc's of Ativan.

251
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,634
Michelle...

252
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,868
Thank God that
you're all right.
Let go of me, or I'll...

253
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,534
Martha, please...
Listen, don't touch me.

254
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,734
Martha, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

255
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:26,534
I didn't think that
I had any choice.

256
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,834
Charles...

257
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:31,100
It isn't just
that you...

258
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:38,200
You didn't stand up to them.

259
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,868
You should have
stood up to them.

260
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,334
Martha...

261
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:51,601
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell
you how glad I am

262
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,067
that you're
both all right.

263
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,167
ANYA:
Thank you.

264
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,067
It was awful.

265
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,767
I'm deeply embarrassed that
something like this

266
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,234
could happen on U.S. soil,

267
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,167
but I promise you,
whoever did this

268
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:03,701
will be brought to justice.

269
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,434
( speaking Russian )

270
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,334
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

271
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,767
Of course.

272
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,534
We both know who is
responsible for this.

273
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:18,534
We believe it was the same group
who attacked Ontario Airport

274
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,868
this morning, but we thought
that they were all killed

275
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,167
in the siege.

276
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,701
Obviously, you were wrong.

277
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,133
The situation is much more
serious than you know.

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,400
These terrorists have possession
of a military-grade nerve agent.

279
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:35,834
And they've threatened
to use it

280
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:37,834
against the civilian
population of Los Angeles.

281
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:39,133
How long have
you known this?

282
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,467
We just found out
about it.

283
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,367
But given this
change of circumstances,

284
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,701
I'm asking you to honor
the terms of our treaty.

285
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,167
Allow my intelligence

286
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:50,067
and law enforcement agencies
access to whatever
intelligence

287
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,968
your security people have
on these separatists.

288
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,300
You will have our help.

289
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,834
Thank you, sir.

290
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:01,167
Mr. President, I hope
you won't find this offensive,

291
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,667
but there's something
that's been troubling me.

292
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:03,767
What is it?

293
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,167
Mrs. Logan-- her behavior.

294
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,367
She has not been
herself.

295
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,334
I'm sure that she is
very upset

296
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
by what just happened.

297
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,934
Yes, I imagine she would be,

298
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,267
but I noticed this
before the attack.

299
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:21,267
From the time she entered
the car with Anya and me.

300
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,601
Yuri, the truth is, my wife has
been under a doctor's care

301
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:29,767
for quite a while now.

302
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:30,801
She suffers

303
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:34,267
from depression and anxiety.

304
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,000
It's been very difficult
for both of us.

305
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:39,534
I'm sorry to hear that.

306
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:41,567
Thank you.

307
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
Guard said you wanted to see me?

308
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,000
How long are you going
to keep me here?

309
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,167
You're not going out there
any time today, Lynn.

310
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,534
District Marshal's
reviewing your case.

311
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,868
I need to ask you
a favor, Bill.

312
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,701
I know I don't
deserve it.

313
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,000
I was unfair to you earlier.

314
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,534
What is it?

315
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,400
I need to make a phone call.

316
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,167
Lynn, if you think you can
get out of this

317
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,334
with a few phone calls,
you're mistaken.

318
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I won't let
that happen.

319
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,033
It's not that, I swear it.

320
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,167
I'll give you the number,
you can clear it yourself.

321
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:21,701
What's this about?

322
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,133
My sister.

323
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,667
I need to talk to her
about a personal matter.

324
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,901
It can't wait a few hours?

325
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,167
No, it can't.

326
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,501
Bill, please, she's in
a little bit of trouble

327
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,534
and I'm the only one
who can help her.

328
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,400
I don't need to clear it.

329
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:44,167
Get Mr. McGill a phone.
Give him some privacy.

330
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,267
Thank you.

331
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,067
Thank you.

332
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,300
( phone ringing )

333
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,734
Hello.

334
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,200
Jenny, it's me.

335
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:07,400
Listen, I don't care
that you took my wallet.

336
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,601
Keep everything
that's in there.

337
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,667
I just need to get
my key card back.

338
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:12,901
What key card?

339
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,567
My CTU access card.

340
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,167
It's of no value to you.
It just lets me in and
out of this building.

341
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,200
Well, can't you just get them
to give you a new one?

342
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,701
I mean, that's what I did
when I lost the key

343
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,167
to my laundry room.

344
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:25,033
Damn it, Jenny, this isn't
a laundry room.

345
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,534
This is a secure
government building.

346
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,667
Now, if you don't want
me to call the police,

347
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,367
you'll get me back
the key card today.

348
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:32,701
You hear me?

349
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,300
Yeah, I do.

350
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,634
Listen, I got to go.

351
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,868
Where's that card
from Lynn's wallet?

352
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,234
Why?

353
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,033
'Cause I want to give him back
his key card.

354
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,734
We don't need it.

355
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,634
That's how I'm getting us
all this money.

356
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,834
You told me we were just
going to take his cash

357
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:53,968
and a credit card.

358
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,300
Yeah, we're taking
a credit card.

359
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,901
$20,000
line of credit,

360
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,501
right here.

361
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,601
$20,000?

362
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,267
Who's going to pay you

363
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,934
that kind of money?

364
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,767
Yes, Mr. President?

365
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,767
I'd like to speak
with my wife.

366
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,634
I'm sorry, sir.
She asked to be left alone.

367
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,534
Evelyn, I want
to see my wife now.

368
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,567
Move away from the door.

369
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:27,601
Sir, she ordered me

370
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,834
not to let anyone in.

371
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,567
I'm not anyone, Evelyn.

372
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:32,701
I know, sir,

373
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,801
but she specifically
mentioned you.

374
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,934
I have to get to a meeting.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,334
Would you please tell my wife

376
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,133
that I would like
to speak with her?

377
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,901
Of course, Mr. President.

378
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,467
Thank you.

379
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:05,167
I'd like you to find
Aaron Pierce right now.

380
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,167
I want to know
how he's doing.

381
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:08,534
Is there a message

382
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:09,968
you want me
to get to him?

383
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,367
If he's all right, tell him
I'd like to see him.

384
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,167
Chloe, come here.

385
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,567
I think I got a match.

386
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:19,968
There's a discrepancy here.

387
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,667
That's because they're from
two different layers.

388
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:23,701
The one Curtis had
was structural,

389
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,267
but this is an
electrical blueprint.

390
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:27,868
You're right.
Mr. Buchanan.

391
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,033
Edgar matched the schematics
we got from Curtis.

392
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,267
Where is it?
Tyler Memorial.

393
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,701
Westwood.

394
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,534
A hospital.

395
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,033
Tell Curtis to activate
a tac team.

396
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,734
I'll call Tyler Memorial,
tell them to evacuate.

397
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,334
This is Bauer.
I'm on-site

398
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,634
at the Henderson house.
Do you copy?

399
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,367
Jack, we found intel in the body
of a dead terrorist.

400
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,133
There is going
to be an attack.

401
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,167
Where?

402
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,267
Tyler Memorial Hospital.

403
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,701
We think it's happening
within the hour.

404
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,234
Okay, I copy.

405
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,767
I'm moving in now.

406
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,367
Miriam...

407
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:17,400
AUDREY:
Who?

408
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,534
Christopher's wife.

409
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:19,868
He's not here.

410
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:21,167
Tell Chloe I'll get
back to her

411
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,868
as soon as I have access
to his computer.

412
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,067
All right, we're on it.

413
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,267
This is Curtis Manning with CTU.

414
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,567
I need to speak to the ranking
security officer on site.

415
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,067
You're talking to him.
Tom Wegman.

416
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,901
Mr. Wegman, I'm heading to you
now with a tactical team.

417
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,634
The nerve gas will
most likely be released

418
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,767
into a ventilation unit.

419
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,667
You need to seal off
the sub-basement.

420
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,367
I've called in a second
security shift.

421
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,100
Good.
We'll get that area locked down.

422
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,601
How long before
the hospital's evacuated?

423
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,501
Uh, an hour, maybe two.

424
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,467
This attack could occur
within the next 30 minutes.

425
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,701
This is a large facility,
Agent Manning.

426
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,968
We have 600 patients,
many of whom need assistance.

427
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,167
Mr. Wegman,

428
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,033
if this nerve agent
is released

429
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,267
into the ventilation system,

430
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,767
everyone inside that building
will die.

431
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,167
Do what you have to do,

432
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,334
but get those people
out of that building.

433
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,767
Right.

434
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:19,667
Hello, Miriam.

435
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:23,367
Oh, my God.

436
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,200
We thought you were dead.

437
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,300
Where is he?

438
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,467
What are you doing, Jack?

439
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,133
Miriam, where's Christopher?

440
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,534
He's still at work.

441
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:36,968
Did he call you?

442
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,100
You're scaring me.

443
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,300
In the last hour,

444
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:41,300
has he called you?!

445
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,367
No.

446
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:47,067
Now tell me
what the hell is going on.

447
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,267
I need to see
his computer.

448
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,801
What are you doing?

449
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:52,334
Where is his computer?!

450
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,667
I'm not going to tell you
anything until you tell me

451
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,167
what is going on.

452
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:01,701
Christopher developed
a chemical weapons system

453
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,701
called Sentox-VX nerve gas
for Omicron.

454
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,667
He enabled terrorists
to gain control of it,

455
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,100
now it's being used
against civilian targets

456
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,167
in Los Angeles.

457
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,634
So where is his
computer?!

458
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:13,968
Miriam,
I am telling you

459
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,200
the truth.

460
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,501
We have proof
that he brokered

461
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:18,467
the deal.

462
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:19,667
That's impossible.

463
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:22,567
Less than an hour ago
he tried to kill me.

464
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:27,968
Move towards the living room.

465
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,734
Keep walking
towards the den.

466
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,834
I want you to take
a seat on the couch.

467
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:44,067
Look, why don't we
just call him?

468
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,067
I'm sure there's an explanation.

469
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,267
Miriam, take a seat.

470
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,100
You don't need
the gun, Jack.

471
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,501
You're not going
to shoot me.

472
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:15,868
Chloe, it's Jack.

473
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,801
I need access
to Henderson's hard drive.

474
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,400
I need you to talk me
through it.

475
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:25,434
( knocking )

476
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:26,501
Yes?

477
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,334
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

478
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,300
Oh, yes, Aaron, come in.

479
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,868
I-I didn't really get a chance
to say thank you before.

480
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,000
You saved my life.

481
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,067
I know that you'll say

482
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,968
it was all just
in the line of duty.

483
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:48,200
You're welcome.

484
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:58,801
The country's lucky
to have men like you.

485
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:00,968
I'm lucky.

486
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,868
I hope you'll allow me
to say that.

487
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,667
NOVICK:
Mrs. Logan.

488
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,834
Would you excuse us,
Aaron?

489
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:32,934
What is it, Mike?

490
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,734
The President's been
trying to reach you.

491
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,000
I know.

492
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,234
But I don't want

493
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
to see him.

494
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,901
Would you like me
to convey that

495
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:43,968
to the President?

496
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:46,667
You can convey
whatever you want, Mike.

497
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,200
Mike...

498
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:03,334
Mike, I want you
to know nothing
happened in there.

499
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,334
Whatever didn't happen,

500
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,100
make sure it doesn't happen
again.

501
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,234
( indistinct
radio transmission )

502
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:26,901
Manning?

503
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,434
Yeah.

504
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,467
Tom Wegman,
hospital security.

505
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,000
Thanks for mobilizing
your people so quickly.

506
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:33,334
Have you uplinked
with CTU yet?

507
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,534
We're doing that now.

508
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,467
We've doubled security
at all sub-basement

509
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:37,934
ingress points.

510
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,801
Nobody's getting down there
unless they go through us.

511
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:40,934
Good.

512
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
The bad news is we have
26 patients in ICU

513
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,467
that can't be moved.

514
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,701
Seven of them are
high-dependency newborns.

515
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,100
We can't even
relocate them

516
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,601
without the
specialized transport units

517
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:50,968
which we don't
have on site.

518
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,300
What about nearby
hospitals?

519
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,267
All neonatal transport units
are in service.

520
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,601
All right, thanks.

521
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,667
I want a visual sweep of all
high-probability target points

522
00:26:58,734 --> 00:26:59,701
within the hospital.

523
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:01,200
Team A, start
at the north end,

524
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,934
Team B take south. Move.

525
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,434
It's Viktor.

526
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,934
I'm at the hospital.

527
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,634
And why are you calling me?

528
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,334
They must have found out
about the attack.

529
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,300
The hospital's being evacuated.

530
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,200
All of the elevators and

531
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,801
stairwells are guarded.

532
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:44,834
Calm down, Viktor.

533
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,701
Bring up the schematics
of the hospital.

534
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,434
There's another entrance
to the sub-basement.

535
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,167
An electrical conduit.

536
00:27:58,234 --> 00:27:59,534
There's a good chance
it isn't guarded.

537
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:01,467
How do I find it?

538
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:03,033
In the Radiology wing
down corridor six.

539
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,200
Call us when
you're there.

540
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,234
We'll talk you
through it.

541
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,868
I'll call you
in a few minutes.

542
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:11,300
Viktor, I need you
to finish this task,

543
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:14,033
even if it means
you don't get out.

544
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,501
DOD just concluded a briefing
with Russian Intelligence.

545
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:33,767
We were given a name.

546
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,400
Vladimir Bierko.

547
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:38,534
He made billions in the
post-Soviet economy--

548
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:40,067
weapons and oil.

549
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,300
He bankrolled several
underground radical publications

550
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,367
promoting the separatist cause,

551
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:44,734
but it's believed
that he was more

552
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:45,968
than just a sympathizer.

553
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,534
The Russians think he's
financing these attacks?

554
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,100
They think that he's directing
the attacks himself.

555
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,200
Based on what?

556
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,000
A number of communiques
that were intercepted

557
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,501
by Russian security force,

558
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,067
supported by the fact
that Bierko vanished
from Russia

559
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:59,567
three months ago.

560
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:02,167
We posted Bierko's profile
to the interagency servers.

561
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:04,534
Homeland Security has issued
an emergency brief

562
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:06,167
to local law enforcement.

563
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:07,701
Do you think there's any hope
of finding him

564
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,167
before the attack
on Tyler Hospital?

565
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,133
The most promising lead we have

566
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,067
is a man named
Christopher Henderson.

567
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,133
Unfortunately, he escaped.

568
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,067
Jack Bauer believes there may be
files on Henderson's computer

569
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,334
that could lead us to Bierko.

570
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,367
He's trying to acquire those
files now, sir.

571
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,901
Well, let's hope he succeeds,
Bill.

572
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:26,767
The country's already suffered
three devastating attacks today.

573
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,167
We need to stop this madman.

574
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes, Mr. President.

575
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:34,834
Chloe, it's Jack.
Have you found anything yet?

576
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:38,234
The only thing on Henderson's
hard drive is domestic stuff:

577
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,868
bill-paying programs,
downloaded music.

578
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,634
Chloe, Henderson isn't
trading music files
with his office.

579
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:44,000
There's something else
on the computer. Find it.

580
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:45,467
I'm doing the best I can.

581
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,033
Why don't you
face it, Jack?

582
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,567
Christopher is innocent.

583
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:50,667
He was innocent when you forced
him out of CTU,

584
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:51,801
and he's innocent now.

585
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:53,701
Maybe you didn't hear me
earlier, Miriam,

586
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:54,834
he tried to kill me.

587
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:57,400
If he did, then he was
defending himself.

588
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:58,968
No, he blew up the server room
at Omicron

589
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,133
while I was still inside.

590
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,267
He was destroying
evidence that would

591
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:03,801
have implicated him
in this conspiracy.

592
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,200
This is so familiar.

593
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,901
You're accusing him
of being a criminal.

594
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,434
Why do you hate him so much?

595
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,100
I want you to know
something.

596
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,267
Chris never hated you,

597
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:16,701
not even after
what you did to him.

598
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,868
When he thought
you were dead,

599
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:21,000
he looked in on Kim.

600
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,234
He cared
about your daughter, Jack,

601
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,667
just like he cared about you.

602
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,501
We both did. You know that.

603
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,467
CHLOE:
I found something, Jack.

604
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,501
What is it?

605
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,067
It's a shadow drive.

606
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,467
It was partitioned from the
primary hard drive.

607
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,801
What's on the shadow drive?

608
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,701
A backup log that contains
data points

609
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,367
for every satellite phone call
Henderson has made

610
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,434
in the last year.

611
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,767
Can you cross-reference
those numbers

612
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,234
with the telephone numbers
the terrorists used

613
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,400
earlier this morning?

614
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,801
I got into the log,

615
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,601
but the phone lists
are password-protected.

616
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:45,968
Hold on.

617
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,267
Christopher had
a secret file on
his computer.

618
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:48,734
There's a list of numbers.

619
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,300
And that implicates him?

620
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,133
We need access to that list.

621
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,434
Do you know
the password?

622
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,801
No, I don't.

623
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:56,801
Miriam, we believe there's going
to be another attack

624
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:57,834
within 30 minutes.

625
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,467
Thousands of lives
are at stake.

626
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:04,434
Please, if you know
that password, I need it now.

627
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:08,000
I can't help you.

628
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:16,767
Chloe, you're going to have
to try and hack into it.

629
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,701
I'll see what I can do.
Hurry.

630
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:23,601
I'll show this
to Manning. Good work.

631
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:24,968
Agent Manning?

632
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,501
One of our guards caught this.

633
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:29,801
This guy's dressed
as an orderly,

634
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,667
but I've never
seen him before.

635
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:35,501
An orderly has no business
being where he is.

636
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,801
That was five minutes ago.

637
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:37,801
Where is this?

638
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:38,934
Sub-basement.

639
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,667
Team A, meet me in the southeast
stairwell.

640
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,000
Team B, form a soft perimeter.

641
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,300
We have a possible suspect
in play.

642
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,334
CTU, did you copy that?
Yes, we copy.

643
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,901
Edgar, I need you to uplink
the hospital video surveillance

644
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,434
for facial recognition software.

645
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,734
See if you can get a match.

646
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:03,000
Curtis has a suspect.

647
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,934
We're running the image
through facial recognition.

648
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,067
Halfway through the database.

649
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,167
Got something.

650
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,000
All right, put it up.

651
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,200
Curtis, we have a suspect.

652
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,400
His name is Viktor Grigorin.

653
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:14,734
He's a Russian national.

654
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:17,868
Served time for drug smuggling
and weapons trafficking.

655
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,834
Copy that.

656
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:22,334
All teams, suspect
is a confirmed hostile.

657
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,367
Repeat:
a confirmed hostile.

658
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,801
( faint clattering )

659
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,667
Freeze!

660
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,133
Don't move!

661
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,434
Agent Manning, you need
to come look at this.

662
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,400
Search him.

663
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:20,133
Don't! It might be set to
go off if it's moved.

664
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,400
Chemical Response Team,
we need you down here now.

665
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,033
All teams,

666
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,801
we've located
the canister,
and it is on.

667
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,667
CTU, Chemical Response Team
is on the way in.

668
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,634
The hospital evacuation
is still in progress.

669
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,267
There are still
a lot of people in here.

670
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:07,567
Copy that, Curtis.

671
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:11,234
Edgar, notify LAPD
and all relevant agencies.

672
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,234
I want a mandatory evacuation
of the downtown core.

673
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,133
Yes, sir.

674
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,601
Jack, Henderson is using
an interlaced encryption key.

675
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,734
What does that mean?

676
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:22,200
It could take me
a half a day to crack it.

677
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:25,133
Damn it, Chloe, we don't
have that kind of time.

678
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,734
I'm sorry. It's a little tougher
than it looked

679
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,267
at first glance, okay?

680
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,400
Yeah. All right.

681
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,267
Jack, you should know
that Curtis and his team

682
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,234
intercepted a terrorist
at the hospital.

683
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,667
Did they take him
into custody?

684
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:35,901
No. He's dead.

685
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,501
But they found
a nerve gas canister.

686
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,567
They're trying to disarm it now.

687
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:42,868
There are patients there
that can't be evacuated.

688
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:44,300
Chloe, listen to me.

689
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:45,968
There's nothing you can do
about the hospital.

690
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,234
There's still 18 canisters
out there.

691
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,100
I need you to
stay focused.

692
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,100
I know.

693
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,467
If I got you
more personnel,

694
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:52,968
would that help you
crack the code faster?

695
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:55,167
I've already got three analysts
working on it, Jack.

696
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:57,801
Miriam?

697
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,267
Miriam? Honey, I want you
to pack a bag.

698
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,434
I want you...

699
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:05,901
Don't you move!

700
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,501
Miriam, sit back down!

701
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,133
Put your hands
behind your head.

702
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,300
Get back up on your knees.

703
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,868
Now!

704
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:18,100
I want you to
handcuff yourself.

705
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,667
Behind your back.

706
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,934
Get up.

707
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,300
Take a seat
next to Miriam

708
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:31,501
on the couch.

709
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:32,901
You okay, honey?

710
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:34,767
Okay.

711
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,801
How do I find the nerve gas?

712
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:38,601
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

713
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,367
Where is it?

714
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:40,501
That's right, Jack.

715
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:41,834
Start at my knee,
just like I taught you.

716
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,133
Sooner you do it,
sooner you'll see

717
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,033
I don't know what
you're talking about.

718
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,300
Where is it?!

719
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,200
He doesn't know, Jack!
He doesn't know!

720
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,467
For God's sake, leave him alone!

721
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:51,534
Christopher, CTU found

722
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,133
one of the canisters
at Tyler Memorial

723
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,901
Hospital.
It's armed!

724
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,834
People are going to start dying.

725
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,133
How do I find
the nerve gas?

726
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,300
Jack, leave him alone!

727
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,200
He doesn't
know anything!

728
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,901
You really trust him?

729
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,868
Ask him what's
in the briefcase.

730
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,467
Unlock it!

731
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:38,834
Ask him what

732
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:39,901
he's doing with all the money!

733
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,334
Ask him!

734
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,534
Christopher?

735
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,968
Is this true?

736
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,133
Have you been lying
to me all this time?

737
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,567
I've been protecting you
all this time.

738
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,400
By lying?
It's not that
simple, Miriam.

739
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,033
I defended you.
I defended you, too,

740
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,200
against things you would not
want to know because
I love you, Miriam.

741
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,734
There's not one thing I've done
out of self-interest or greed.

742
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:57,033
Even when they

743
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,534
fired me--
even when they framed me--

744
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,734
I served my country.

745
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,267
I don't care how you

746
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:02,467
justify this.

747
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:03,467
I am out of time.

748
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,634
You are going to tell me now

749
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,367
how to find the rest
of the nerve gas.

750
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:07,634
Oh, go ahead
and do it, Jack.

751
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:08,734
Get it done.
Shoot me.

752
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,267
Kneecap me.

753
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:11,968
Go ahead and do it. Do it!

754
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,734
( shot fires )
( screams )

755
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:17,501
You son of a bitch!

756
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:18,734
I shot her above the kneecap!

757
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,434
Son of a bitch!
She can still walk!

758
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,567
You make me shoot her again,
she'll be in a wheelchair for

759
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,801
the rest of her life!
Damn you!

760
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,834
Where do I find the nerve gas?!

761
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,501
Damn you!

762
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,067
Where is it?

763
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,734
Please, please, baby.

764
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,601
Don't you make me do this.

765
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,267
Tell him what he wants to know.

766
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,133
I can't.

767
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,100
I can't.

768
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,133
Forgive me,

769
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,934
Miriam. I can't.

770
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You son of a bitch.

771
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:51,434
( gasping )

772
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:54,234
You don't care about anybody.

773
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,200
Not even her.

774
00:38:58,434 --> 00:38:59,667
Chloe, this is Jack.

775
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:02,701
I need an ambulance on site.
I repeat:

776
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,133
I need an ambulance
on site.

777
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,133
Miriam Henderson's
been shot in the leg.

778
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,467
I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson

779
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:09,267
in to CTU.
It's all right.

780
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,567
I'll need an interrogation room
prepped,

781
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:13,100
and a medic standing by
with hyocine-pentothal.

782
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,234
It'll be ready
when you get here.

783
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,267
You okay, Jack?

784
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:16,267
Yeah, I'm fine.

785
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,601
Just get the
ambulance here now.

786
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:18,667
Team's on its way.

787
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,767
Put Buchanan on.

788
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,634
Mr. Buchanan,
Jack's on line one.

789
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:24,367
Jack, it's Bill.

790
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:26,534
What's happening
at the hospital?

791
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:28,434
There's a CRT team on site.

792
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,367
Stand by, Jack.

793
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,634
Curtis, what's your status?

794
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,734
We're still trying
to defuse the detonator.

795
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:37,701
Look what we found
on the hostile.

796
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:40,367
Hold on, Bill.

797
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:42,534
It's a remote timing display.

798
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,167
Can we defuse the detonator?

799
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:46,300
Not in 60 seconds.

800
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,801
We'll have to get it
out of here.

801
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:50,000
It could go off
if we move it.

802
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,334
( wheezing breaths )

803
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,634
It's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

804
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,634
All teams, we're moving
the canister

805
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:57,434
to the containment unit.

806
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,501
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

807
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,701
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Move, move!

808
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,067
All right, clear off!

809
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,100
Clear off!

810
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,601
Go, go, go!

811
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,434
Get out of the way!

812
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,567
Everybody clear!

813
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:32,601
Go, go, go!

814
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:37,434
All right,
get 'em out of the way!

815
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,400
Move!

816
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,767
Move, move!

817
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,667
Get that door open!

818
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,534
( grunting )

819
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,200
Come on!
Get that thing sealed!

820
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,634
We're clear!

821
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,934
CTU...

822
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,033
the canister detonated inside
a containment unit.

823
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,267
The hospital's safe.

824
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,767
Good work, Curtis.

825
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:24,467
( muffled whimpering )

826
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:31,300
( silenced shot fires )
( screams )

827
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:36,200
( whimpers )

828
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:37,701
( silenced shot fires )

829
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,934
I have the key card.

830
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,467
How long will it take for you to
reprogram it?

831
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:56,133
Five minutes.
Then we will be able to use it

832
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,234
to access CTU.

833
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,701
Good.
