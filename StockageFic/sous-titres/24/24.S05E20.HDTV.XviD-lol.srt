1
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,368
What happened to David Palmer
wasn't supposed to happen.

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,600
He put himself in harm's way,
and he got involved

3
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:18,934
with something
that he shouldn't have.

4
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,001
You know who killed David?

5
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,001
He works for me.

6
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,901
MARTHA:
You lied to me.

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:28,967
This entire day has
been one giant lie!

8
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,167
What you've done
makes me sick!

9
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,634
Martha, enough!

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,901
I need you to swear
to me that you will do

11
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,467
as I ask for the country.

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,234
I hate you.

13
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:44,134
The situation with Martha
is taken care of.

14
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,834
There are too many loose ends
lying around.

15
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,101
We cannot afford to have her

16
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,400
pull on one
and unravel everything.

17
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,634
She won't.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,967
I have the recording.

19
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:52,167
Have you destroyed it?

20
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,433
No, sir, I have not.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,634
You and I have been in this
from the beginning.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Destroying that recording
protects both of us.

23
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,500
I've got O'Brian.

24
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,001
Where is she?

25
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,368
She's working
out of Bill Buchanan's house.

26
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,167
Did Chloe tell you why she was
helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

27
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,834
'Cause she thinks
Jack is innocent,

28
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:13,800
that President Logan
framed Bauer.

29
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,500
This is Karen Hayes-- Miles
traced Chloe to your house.

30
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,201
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out of there.

31
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:20,533
Karen, why are you warning us?

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,634
Because I may have made
a mistake earlier.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,967
Chloe, if they find you
here, you'll be arrested.

34
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:26,201
You have to go now.

35
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:28,034
Not yet.

36
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,334
BAUER:
It's over, Christopher!
Turn around!

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,067
Give me the recording.

38
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:43,667
I don't have it.
Where is it?!

39
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,134
BAUER:
Henderson wasn't lying.

40
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,368
He doesn't have
the recording on him.

41
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,734
There must've been
some kind of a hand-off.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,500
Henderson stopped and
rendezvoused with another car.

43
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,634
Can you track the other car?

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,901
We're tracking it now, Jack.

45
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,067
It headed back to Van Nuys--
looks like

46
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:56,400
the civilian side
of the airfield-- pulled onto

47
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,634
the tarmac; whoever it was
got out and got directly

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,567
onto the plane.
CHLOE:It is a chartered
diplomatic flight.

49
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:03,567
BUCHANAN:
Jack, we've tried
everything we can.

50
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:06,500
There's no way
to delay the plane.

51
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:23,667
Okay, call me
when you've got 'em. Yeah.

52
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,067
Bill, are you out?
The field team's almost there.

53
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,734
Chloe's packing
the comm gear she needs

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,167
to stay in touch with Jack.

55
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,433
Where is Jack?
Van Nuys Airport.

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,167
He stowed away
on a diplomatic flight

57
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,201
that just took off.
What? Why?

58
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,734
He's trying to find a recording
that implicates President Logan.

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,500
And someone
on that flight has it?

60
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,967
Yes, and we don't know who.

61
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:42,867
That's what Chloe's been trying
to find out.

62
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:45,767
Hang on. Yeah?
Field team's a block
away from Buchanan's.

63
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll set up here for the
remote debrief of O'Brian.

64
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,234
No. Put it in
the Situation Room.

65
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,834
Oh, I thought you wanted...
I want it in
the Situation Room. Go.

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,268
Bill, the field team's

67
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,500
gonna be there any second.

68
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,600
Get Chloe out of there now.
How close are they?

69
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,934
One block.

70
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,667
All right, I'm gonna have
to run interference.

71
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,234
It's more important
that she gets away.

72
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,368
Good. I'll bring you in.

73
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,700
You'll be treated
as a suspect.

74
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,934
We never talked.

75
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,567
BUCHANAN:
Understood. They're here.

76
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,400
Out the back.
Bill, wait.

77
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,834
Have Chloe call me
on a dry channel.

78
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:19,901
Either one-five
or two-seven.

79
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,167
Dry channel,
one-five or two-seven. Got it.

80
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,967
There's a gate in back.

81
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,400
Follow the path
between the houses
to the alley,

82
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,167
turn right and go
to Ventura Boulevard.

83
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,634
What about the curfew?

84
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,134
There's a hotel
on the boulevard,
the Miramont.

85
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,134
You should be able to make it
there without being spotted.

86
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:36,634
What about you?
I'm gonna make sure
you're not followed.

87
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,467
I'll be at CTU,
probably in Holding.

88
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,934
Why in Holding?
Karen's gonna place
me under arrest.

89
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,901
If you need anything,
contact her.

90
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,867
Why is she...
Chloe, please, just go.

91
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,301
( knockingat door )

92
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,700
Who is it?

93
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,368
MAN:
Homeland Security.

94
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,368
Mr. Buchanan,
we need you

95
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,600
to open the door.

96
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,600
We're under order
from Karen Hayes.

97
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,467
I'll be right there.

98
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,201
What, uh, what's going on?

99
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:23,001
Please step aside, sir.
We need to search the house.

100
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,334
No, I'm not stepping aside.
Do you have a warrant?

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,500
Where's Chloe O'Brian?

102
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,467
I have no idea.
Sir,

103
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,467
don't make us use force--
we know she's been here.

104
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,400
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

105
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,634
Where is she?

106
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,800
I don't know

107
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,901
where Chloe O'Brian is.

108
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,034
She's gone.

109
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:55,867
Sir? This is a recent
file from Comm.

110
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,567
Only O'Brian
could access it.

111
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,567
Talk to us, sir.

112
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,901
I'm not talking to you.

113
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:07,067
I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

114
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,934
Mr. Papazian,

115
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,700
we are on site-- it appears
Chloe O'Brian was here,

116
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,034
but she is gone.

117
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,334
Is Bill Buchanan there?

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,433
Yes, sir.
We lost O'Brian.

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,533
Damn it!
Put him on the
phone, please.

120
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:29,901
Hello?

121
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,301
Don't play games with me, Bill.

122
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,667
Just give me
O'Brian's location,

123
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:35,101
or I will make it
very bad for you.

124
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,268
From what I understand,
Miles, she got out of CTU
right under your nose.

125
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,567
You're the one who ought
to be concerned, not me.

126
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,101
Bill, this is Karen Hayes.
Tell us what you know now.

127
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,734
Stop wasting our time.

128
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,634
I'm not saying any more.

129
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,533
This is Ed.

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,867
Ed, bring Buchanan in.

131
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,867
Set up a grid search for Chloe.

132
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,734
She's probably got a car,
which means

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,101
she's about 15 miles out.

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,467
Copy that.

135
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,400
But the agents on site

136
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,400
are trained for
interrogation.

137
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,934
Why are you
bringing him in?

138
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,767
Because I want
to run this, Miles.
But now it's us

139
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,934
who are wasting
time here.
Don't worry.

140
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,167
I will make him talk.

141
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,700
I'll be in my office.

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,034
( phone line ringing )

143
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:18,334
HAYES: Yeah?
I'm set up
at the Miramont Hotel.

144
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,268
Make sure no one looks
for me here.

145
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,667
I'll take care of that.

146
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,334
Tell me what else you need.

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,734
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.
Pull up the manifest.

148
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,867
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt.

149
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,767
Okay, put everything you've got
from that flight under

150
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,368
the shared volume so I can get
to it.

151
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,934
Crew, passengers, cargo,
everything.

152
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,334
Done.

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,334
Okay, I see it.

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,700
Thanks.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
( phone rings )

156
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,500
( panting )

157
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,201
Yeah.

158
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,400
CHLOE: Jack, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Did you get what I need?

159
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,034
I've got the passenger list--
it's gonna take

160
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:04,433
some time to cross it
against Henderson.

161
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,600
What about the air marshal?

162
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,101
That I'll have
in a couple of minutes.

163
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,634
Okay, good. What's
happening at CTU?

164
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,867
They're still under orders
from the president to stop you,

165
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,201
but Karen Hayes
is backing us.
Openly?

166
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,834
No, but she's
letting me help you.

167
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,934
If there's proof against Logan,
she wants it found.

168
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,433
The proof is
on this plane.

169
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,268
Check the flight manifest,
figure out which passenger

170
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,667
has a connection to Henderson
and get back to me

171
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,634
with the air marshal's
seat number.
I will.

172
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,734
I don't think so.

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Oh, hey. I was
just asking.

174
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,368
You don't have to go
all feminist on me.

175
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:40,034
Did you see that?

176
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,433
21st-century woman.

177
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,467
We better get
used to it.

178
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,101
( computer beeps )

179
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,767
( phone rings )

180
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,334
Yeah.

181
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,834
Jack, I found the air marshal--
his name is George Avila.

182
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,268
He's sitting in 7A.
Anyone sitting
next to him?

183
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,700
No.
Okay, good.
Get back to me

184
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,101
when you've got the
connection to Henderson.

185
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,167
Got it.

186
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,234
( quietly ):
Excuse me.

187
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,368
Is that seat taken?

188
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,001
No.

189
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,533
Thanks.

190
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,700
The stewardess said I could
change seats-- I was next

191
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,634
to the galley,
it's kind of noisy.

192
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm trying to get some rest.

193
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,367
Yeah?

194
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:42,701
Okay, the man you're looking
for is in seat 12D.

195
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,367
His name is Hans Meyer.

196
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,768
He's with
the German government.

197
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,234
He's been connected to Omicron
since the mid-1990s.

198
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,667
He's worked directly
with Henderson.
That's it.

199
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,334
Okay, I've got it.

200
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,067
Mr. Meyer?

201
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,667
Yes?

202
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,267
My name is George Avila.
I'm the air marshal
on this flight.

203
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,868
What's wrong?
It's nothing serious.
We found something

204
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:16,933
that we think is yours.
It should have been

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,967
in the baggage
compartment.

206
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,267
We'd just like you
to come back

207
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,634
to the galley and
identify it for us

208
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,933
so we can properly
stow it.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,100
Please, sir. We'd
really appreciate it.

210
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,667
If you have any
carry-on bags,

211
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,667
you should bring
them with you.

212
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:29,868
I don't.

213
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,768
Very well.

214
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,701
What makes you think
it was mine?

215
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,067
Ticket stub.

216
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,567
They have taken away

217
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,834
all my medication.
I need to get to it.

218
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,768
I'm sorry, ma'am. They won't
let me give that to you.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,567
What do they think I'm going
to do? Kill myself?

220
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,667
Over that son of a bitch?!

221
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,967
I just called the president
of the United States

222
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,401
a son of a bitch.

223
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:43,967
No reaction?

224
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:47,100
He must have some kind of law
on the books against that,

225
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,067
or am I immune, just like he is?

226
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,134
Do you have a first name,
Agent Adams?

227
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,701
It's Justin, ma'am.

228
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,634
You don't have much of
a personality, do you, Justin?

229
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,300
This is Novick.

230
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,234
It's Martha.

231
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,033
Are you still in the retreat?

232
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,367
Yes. I'm just down the hall
from your room.

233
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,667
I need you to come here
right away.

234
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,467
I'll be right there.

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,167
They've cut me off
from my medication.

236
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:53,601
You haven't been cut off.

237
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,334
Dr. Hill said you had enough

238
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,834
in your system right now.

239
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,734
You need to wait
a few hours.

240
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,300
I don't want to wait
a few hours, Mike.

241
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,601
I need something now.

242
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,734
What's going on, Mrs. Logan?

243
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,534
I don't need counseling, Mike.

244
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:10,067
I just want a damn pill.

245
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,967
Sit down. Sit down.

246
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,801
Thank you, Agent Adams.

247
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,933
We've been through some
tough times before, Martha.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Just follow the doctor's
orders for now.

249
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
This is more than
just a tough time, Mike.

250
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,067
None of this is going
to go away.

251
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:33,601
I just have to live with it.

252
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,334
What do you mean,
"It's not going to go away"?

253
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:36,868
What are you talking about?

254
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,933
I... I shouldn't have said that.

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,401
Martha, it's me.

256
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,734
Say what needs to be said.

257
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,900
What needs to be said
I can't say to you.

258
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,167
Why not?

259
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,167
Listen, Mike,

260
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,300
I just...
I just need

261
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,900
to get some sleep.
I'm just...

262
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,401
My nerves

263
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,267
are shot from today.

264
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,801
I just need something
to calm me down.

265
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,267
I just need
to get to my medication.

266
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,267
The president doesn't want
you to leave the room.

267
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,401
Then you can bring it here.

268
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:23,167
I just want to take
a couple of pills.

269
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,634
I need to sleep.

270
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,634
You can watch me take them.

271
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,134
I'll see what I can do.

272
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,933
( phone rings )

273
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,567
Yes?

274
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,234
GRAHAM:
They found Bauer yet?

275
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,334
No, they haven't.

276
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,367
That's not good.

277
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,467
I know that's not good.

278
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,200
I'm putting pressure
everywhere I can.

279
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,768
I don't think I have to tell you
how disastrous it would be

280
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,734
if Bauer gets his hands
on that recording.

281
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,734
That's exactly right.

282
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:06,967
You don't have
to tell me. I know.

283
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,200
When I find him,
I will call you.

284
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,768
Is there
anything else?

285
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,067
No.

286
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,634
Good.

287
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,868
Mr. President?

288
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:24,900
What is it, Mike?

289
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,501
There's something I think
I should call to your attention.

290
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,868
Yes?

291
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,267
Your wife is in
a very agitated state.

292
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:32,768
I don't know
how to proceed.

293
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,267
Proceed with what?

294
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:37,134
She wants me to bring
her her medication

295
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,734
against doctor's orders.

296
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:42,434
That's all I need right now
is to deal with her!

297
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,033
No! No!

298
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,501
No more pills.

299
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,267
And she shouldn't be wasting
your time with this anyway!

300
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,801
Mr. President.

301
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:54,534
Is there something
going on that I
should know about?

302
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:57,100
Why? What did she say?

303
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:00,701
She needs more medication
to calm herself down.

304
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,501
Something's clearly
bothering her,

305
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,567
but she didn't want
to talk about it.

306
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,933
I don't see where any of this
becomes your business, Mike.

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,567
I'll tell you where,
Mr. President.

308
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,267
I'm your Chief of Staff.

309
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,768
If there's something going on
that I don't know about

310
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,933
that involves national security,
it is my business.

311
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,567
This isn't national security,
Mike.

312
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,134
It's our marriage.

313
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,000
I think both of us
realized today,

314
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,234
at this point,

315
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,267
our relationship is nothing
more than a facade,

316
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,367
and one that we're going
to have to keep up

317
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:44,801
for as long
as I'm president.

318
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,801
I think that

319
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,567
she's reacting to that, Mike.

320
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,100
I see.

321
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,701
I'm sorry, sir.

322
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,634
Mike?

323
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,834
Give her what she wants.

324
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Lord knows, she's
in a lot of pain.

325
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,300
( groaning )

326
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,033
Where are you hiding it?

327
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,667
Hiding what?

328
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,367
What-What do you want?
What the hell is this?

329
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,534
I know who you are.

330
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,334
I know your connection
with Omicron.

331
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,701
I know your history
with Christopher Henderson.

332
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:27,900
He asked you to take something

333
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,701
out of the country for him.
Where is it?

334
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:32,167
Christopher Henderson?
I have not seen him in months.

335
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,501
Don't you lie to me!

336
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,134
I'm not lying, I swear!

337
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,834
I know Henderson,
but I don't know

338
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,868
what you're
talking about.

339
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,200
Did you check your luggage?

340
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,534
Yes.

341
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,667
Find it.

342
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:45,768
Move!

343
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,200
What are you doing?

344
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:53,601
Nothing.

345
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,701
Homework?

346
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,234
Homework, yeah.

347
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,534
I didn't know they
had WiFi in here.

348
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,300
Could you leave me alone?

349
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,567
I can't talk right now.

350
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,167
( laughs ):
You're a little, uh,

351
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,134
freaked out
because of the curfew thing.

352
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,534
Join the club.

353
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,334
Yeah, okay.

354
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,667
When you come up
for air, I'm buying.

355
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,100
MAN:
Airport Customs.

356
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,667
This is Chloe O' Brian
from CTU Los Angeles.

357
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,067
I need to talk to somebody
in passenger clearing.

358
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,334
I'll need verification.

359
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:34,067
Agency ID: CTU 99A-12.

360
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,434
( bell dings )

361
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,933
The captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign,

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,033
as we are expecting
some turbulence.

363
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,501
Please return to your seat

364
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,933
and make sure your seat belt
is securely fastened.

365
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,933
( rumbling )

366
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,367
( rumbling )

367
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,933
The passenger in 12D must
be in the forward lavatory.

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,367
You should get him out.

369
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,067
The captain said it's
going to shake pretty hard.

370
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,933
There's nobody in those.
I just checked.

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,267
Then where is this guy?

372
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,167
MAN:
I don't know. Maybe
he changed seats.

373
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,834
( loud rumbling )

374
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,367
( screaming )

375
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,067
( quietly ):
Call the captain, and tell him
the air marshal's down,

376
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,534
and a passenger's
missing!

377
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,367
What's going on here?!

378
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,501
Please be seated, sir.
Now, sir!

379
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah?

380
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,267
Captain Cotter, this is Dan.

381
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,768
The air marshal's
been assaulted.

382
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:31,933
What?

383
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,367
Assaulted?

384
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,534
What's going on back there?

385
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,300
I don't know, sir,
but he's been

386
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,100
knocked out,
and a passenger's missing.

387
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,534
Okay, okay. Secure the cabin.

388
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,501
Keep the passengers
under control.

389
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,334
What's going on?

390
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,834
There's a problem
in the cabin.

391
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,267
Make sure our
door is secure.

392
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:47,967
It is. What kind of problem?

393
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,033
The air marshal's
been knocked out.

394
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,834
Call L.A. Center,
get vectors

395
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,534
for an emergency return.

396
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,634
Mr. Avila, what happened?

397
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,200
The man seated next to me--
where is he?

398
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,701
I didn't see him.

399
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:04,234
We got to find him.

400
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,834
Damn it.
What?

401
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,533
Mike, come in.

402
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,301
So, do you have

403
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:34,834
something for me?

404
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,201
This is just enough
for a couple of days.

405
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:41,268
Dr. Hill's going
to come in...

406
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,967
Thank you, Mike.

407
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,301
Thank you.

408
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:57,101
I'm going to get ready
for bed now.

409
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,567
Is there
something else?

410
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:00,600
Yes, there is.

411
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,234
Earlier you said
something to the effect

412
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:07,767
that I didn't know
everything that
was going on.

413
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,800
I was confused.

414
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,800
I wanted my pills.

415
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,301
I don't think so.

416
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:17,301
Are you calling me a liar?

417
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:19,834
I just spoke with the president.

418
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:24,034
And I got the same feeling
from him I get from you.

419
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,533
Which is?

420
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,967
That you're both
covering something up.

421
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:29,734
You know, Mike, I'm the one
around here

422
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,001
who's supposed to be paranoid,
not you.

423
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,467
I know you, Martha.

424
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,301
And I know
the president.

425
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:42,334
He said this was all about
marital difficulties.

426
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,101
I think there's
something else.

427
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,800
What is it?

428
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,834
Don't shut me out.

429
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:53,301
Maybe I can help you.

430
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:55,101
There is something
else, Mike,

431
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,433
but it's between me and Charles.

432
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,201
If that changes, I promise

433
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:03,034
I'll let you know.

434
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,700
I don't know what you think
Henderson gave me.

435
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,800
I saw no one.

436
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:15,967
I was picked up
at the Consulate

437
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,101
and brought directly here.

438
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,567
There are witnesses,
you can ask them.

439
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:20,067
Is this your only
piece of luggage?
Yes.

440
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:21,634
If you're lying to me,
I'll find out.

441
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,567
I am not lying.

442
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,500
Please, if there is someone
on this plane

443
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:28,067
that has something you want,
it is not me.

444
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:29,067
( phone ringing )

445
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,334
Yeah.

446
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,334
Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer
is our guy.

447
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,433
Why not?

448
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,867
The timeline
doesn't match.

449
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,967
He's been in customs
for the last three hours

450
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,201
clearing himself
onto the flight.

451
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:40,533
The plane's turning.

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,700
What does that mean?
It means they
know I'm on board.

453
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,034
Chloe, keep looking.
Okay.

454
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,734
( metal rattling )

455
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,600
Are you sure
he's down there?

456
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,034
There's nowhere else
he could be.

457
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:02,167
Tell the pilot

458
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,901
he can do it.

459
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,967
But there's a passenger
down there with him. He'll die.

460
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:08,167
There's over 50 passengers
up here. Call him now.

461
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,234
Do it.

462
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:19,533
Captain, the air marshal says
the baggage area

463
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,268
is secure,

464
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,167
and that you should begin.

465
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:27,201
( gasping )

466
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,967
( loud hissing )

467
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,734
Air's coming in.

468
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,167
It's not coming in,
it's going out.

469
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,301
What do you mean?

470
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:37,101
They're depressurizing
this area.

471
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,400
What's going to happen to us?

472
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,734
If we don't get
into the main cabin,

473
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,201
we're going to lose
consciousness.

474
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:45,001
( phone ringing )

475
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,500
Jack, what's going on in the
plane? Security net just issued

476
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:51,901
a bulletin.
Chloe, I need you to patch
me through to the pilot.

477
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,301
I don't know
if I can do that.

478
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,867
Chloe, they're depressurizing
this area.

479
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,034
We're going to lose
consciousness.

480
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:57,134
Okay, okay.

481
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:05,867
( phone ringing )

482
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,334
Yeah, Chloe.

483
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,234
Jack needs us to patch him in
to the pilot of the flight.

484
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,967
Can you get through
on a CTU sub-channel?

485
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,101
I'll try. Hold on.

486
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,368
I'll stay on the line.

487
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,700
MAN:
Air control operator 44.

488
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,301
Yes, I need you to patch me
through to the pilot

489
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,901
of diplomatic flight
five-two-zero out of Van Nuys.

490
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,167
Hey, what
do you got?

491
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:30,368
A little voice-over
IP going on there?

492
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,800
Please leave me alone.

493
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,834
No, seriously, I can help.

494
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,467
I know a way for you
to get some free bandwidth.

495
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:39,134
Really?

496
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,368
Absolutely.

497
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,567
Sit down.

498
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:43,533
Cool.

499
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,001
Wow, nice piece.

500
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,901
Never seen one
of these before.

501
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,201
What is that?

502
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:54,134
( electrical crackling )

503
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,334
It's a CTU Series four.

504
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,767
Chloe, they've opened the line

505
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,967
to the pilot.
I'll patch him through.

506
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:02,901
Thanks. Okay, Jack, I'm putting
you on with the pilot.

507
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,134
Go ahead.

508
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,400
This is Captain Stan Cotter.

509
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:08,634
Who am I speaking to?

510
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,067
Captain, my name is Jack Bauer.

511
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:11,734
I'm with the counterterrorist
unit in Los Angeles.

512
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,234
I'm the man
in your baggage hold.

513
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,600
What do you think you're doing?

514
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:15,767
I'll explain everything
in a moment,

515
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,101
but you're going to have
to restore

516
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,867
air pressure to this area.

517
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,034
Sir, I remind you,
I am a federal agent.

518
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:22,268
What kind of a
federal agent

519
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:23,667
knocks out
an air marshal?

520
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,967
I don't believe you.

521
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:27,201
Sir, I was patched through
to you by a CTU sub-channel.

522
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,134
I couldn't have done that
unless I had clearance.

523
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,934
All I know is,
you have a gun

524
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,234
and you have breached
airplane security.

525
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,867
Captain, this is a matter
of national security.

526
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:36,767
Now open the damn hatch!
( air hissing )

527
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,667
What do you think?

528
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:41,368
He couldn't have patched in
through CTU if he was hostile.

529
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,934
There's no point
in taking a chance.

530
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,634
In a couple of minutes
he'll pass out.

531
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,368
From there,
the air marshal can handle it.

532
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,368
Captain, we are running out
of air down here.

533
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,067
( air hissing )

534
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,400
Captain, I know you can hear me.
There is a man on board

535
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,867
your plane that is a danger to
you. That's why I am here.

536
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,001
Open the hatch!

537
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,134
I can't do that.

538
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,500
Okay, you son of a bitch.

539
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:26,301
( air hissing )

540
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,667
( shouting )

541
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,800
What the hell was that?

542
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,934
The aileron conduit's
been breached.

543
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:03,067
What?!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

544
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,967
You're going to kill
everybody on this plane.

545
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,101
That's up to you.

546
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,667
Open the hatch.

547
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,234
I'm not letting
you up here.

548
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:11,634
Then you'll be responsible
for everything that happens.

549
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,634
( people screaming )

550
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,001
All right, all right,
all right.

551
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,767
Sue, I'm going

552
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,301
to stabilize the pressure
and I'm letting him up.

553
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,967
I want you to unlock
the hatch.

554
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,467
The cockpit's secure.
He can't get in here.

555
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:27,101
Yes, Captain.

556
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,334
What do you think
you're doing?

557
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,967
The captain ordered me
to open the hatch.

558
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,433
Both of you,
turn around
and grab the wall.

559
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,901
Now!

560
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,201
You...

561
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,901
in the baggage hold.

562
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,901
Do it.

563
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,101
Now.

564
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,433
Close it.

565
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,700
Lock it.

566
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,433
Out of the galley now.

567
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,533
Get back to your seats.

568
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,001
What's going on?
Sit down!

569
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,667
He has a gun!
( people screaming )

570
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:24,867
Everybody just stay
in your seats.

571
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:26,334
Face forward.
Put your hands on your head.

572
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,201
Do what I tell you
and no one will get hurt.

573
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,901
If you don't,
people will start to die.

574
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,533
Get the captain
on the phone now.

575
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Sir, he's in
the main cabin.

576
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,201
He has a gun.

577
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:39,368
Get the first-class passengers,
move them into the main cabin.

578
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:42,067
Everyone to the main cabin.

579
00:29:42,134 --> 00:29:44,734
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I want to assure you

580
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,234
I have no intention
of hurting any of
your passengers.

581
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:48,967
I need to find something
that's on the plane.

582
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,167
It's a matter
of national security.
What do you want, Bauer?

583
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:53,067
I want you to remain
in a holding pattern

584
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:54,268
so I can search
your passengers.

585
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,533
If you're really
a federal agent,

586
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,467
then you know I have
to land this plane.

587
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,067
Sir, that won't give me
enough time.

588
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,567
That's not my problem.

589
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,600
I have a gun.
Your air marshal is down.

590
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,301
Captain, it is
your problem.

591
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,533
You need to remain
in a holding pattern,
do you understand me?

592
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,368
You do what you have
to do, Mr. Bauer.

593
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,268
My job is to land
this airplane.

594
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:12,268
And that is what
I am going to do.

595
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,600
Captain? Captain...

596
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,767
MAN:
That's all we have
on Flight 520, sir.

597
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,701
Okay, look, I want updates
on the situation

598
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:41,334
on a minute by minute basis
if necessary.

599
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,334
GRAHAM:
Yes.

600
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,901
I just got word
from the FAA

601
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:57,233
about a hijacking aboard
a diplomatic flight that left

602
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,001
Van Nuys a half hour ago.

603
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,001
So what?

604
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,001
Jack Bauer is
the hijacker.

605
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:05,167
What is he doing
on that flight?

606
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,934
Looking for the recording
that implicates me

607
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,267
in David Palmer's death.

608
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,667
Henderson handed it off
to somebody

609
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:12,968
before he was arrested

610
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:14,968
and Jack must know
that it's on board.

611
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,167
Then you shouldn't be
wasting your time
talking to me.

612
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,334
Order the plane down,

613
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,901
and grab Bauer before
he can hurt us.

614
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,901
Wait, what are you saying?

615
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:30,034
That he hijacked the plane?

616
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,467
Not exactly.

617
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:33,601
He has control of the cabin.
The pilot is landing the plane.

618
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,834
What about
that recording?

619
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:36,500
He's still looking
for it,

620
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:38,901
but there's no guarantee he'll
find it before the plane lands.

621
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,167
And after that,
it's all over.

622
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,767
The president will have
his people

623
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,834
arrest Jack at the airport
and isolate him.

624
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,200
What are we
supposed to do?

625
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Just keep helping Jack.

626
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:50,300
Chloe, I need to see
that evidence.

627
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,567
Call me if you need

628
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:53,701
anything from here.
Fine.

629
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:01,701
Give me a second.

630
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,901
What's Bauer doing
on Flight 520?

631
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,467
You have no idea
what you're dealing with,

632
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,701
you little ass-kisser.

633
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,300
You don't talk to my people
like that, Bill.

634
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,500
Take him to Holding.

635
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,034
It's no wonder CTU fell apart
under that guy.

636
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,834
Miles, I know you're
trying to help,

637
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,034
but I'll take it

638
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,968
from here, okay?

639
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,734
WOMAN:
Western Operations.

640
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,133
This is Miles Papazian,
Homeland Security, Los Angeles.

641
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,634
Pass code 21 double six.

642
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:36,200
Put me through to Mike Novick.

643
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,934
One moment, please.

644
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,567
Yes, Miles. What is it?

645
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:44,500
I need your input, sir, because

646
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:47,068
I'm having a problem
with Karen Hayes.

647
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,867
I'd like to preface what I'm
about to tell you

648
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,367
by saying that I
don't wish to be

649
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,667
second-guessing...
I don't have time
for prefaces.

650
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,068
Karen Hayes was called in
to replace Bill Buchanan.

651
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,068
She was hand-chosen
by the vice president

652
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:58,200
to take that post.

653
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,834
I understand that, sir.

654
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:02,734
Are you saying you feel
she's unfit to do the job?

655
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,434
Four hours ago,

656
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,867
she relieved Bill Buchanan
for ineffectual leadership.

657
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:10,001
He's been working covertly
with Chloe O'Brian

658
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:12,801
to aid Jack Bauer,
a federal fugitive.

659
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:16,167
Which means Buchanan needs
to be dealt with appropriately.

660
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,400
What has Karen done?

661
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,734
She sent in a tac team
to pick them both up,

662
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:22,001
but by the time they got
there, O'Brian was gone.

663
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,834
But instead
of having the team

664
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,434
do the interrogation
of Buchanan onsite,

665
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
Karen wasted 20 minutes

666
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,300
by bringing him in to CTU.

667
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,601
Maybe she felt
the interrogation

668
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,267
would be more effective
with CTU resources.

669
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:39,467
But, sir, she isn't even using
rudimentary CTU resources.

670
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:42,500
She wants to do a soft
Q and A by herself.

671
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:46,167
Any leads we may have had
on O'Brian have dried up.

672
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,767
Wait a second, Miles.

673
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:51,334
I'm not going to pass judgment
on Karen Hayes at this point.

674
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,634
She's not
interrogating a terrorist.

675
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,400
She's dealing with a high-
ranking federal employee.

676
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,634
Sometimes finesse
and diplomacy

677
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,500
are better than coercion.

678
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,500
Your concern
is duly noted, Miles.

679
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,901
If you'll excuse me,
I need to see the president.

680
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,100
Karen.

681
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,701
Shut up, Bill.

682
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:32,001
We're offline. Now we can talk.

683
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,334
Look, you can continue

684
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,001
this charade of me being
under arrest if you want to,

685
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,233
but Jack
needs our help.

686
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,167
And he's getting it,
but make no mistake, I am

687
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,400
still in charge of this
facility, and until I see

688
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:42,901
that evidence,
I must remain skeptical.

689
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:46,034
Have you talked to Chloe?

690
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,034
Yes.

691
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,400
What's Jack's status?

692
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:49,867
He's searching the cabin
for the evidence,

693
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,734
but the pilot is going
to land that plane.

694
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,300
How much time does Jack have?

695
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:54,233
15 minutes.

696
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,068
To search over 50 passengers?

697
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,300
That's impossible.

698
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:00,867
STAFFER ( over intercom ):
Ms. Hayes.

699
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,100
Yes.

700
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,801
The president
and Mike Novick want an update

701
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:07,200
on the hijacking
of the diplomatic flight.

702
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,167
Put them through.

703
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,567
Go ahead, sir.

704
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:13,100
Ms. Hayes,
this is the president.

705
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,767
Talk to me about 520.

706
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:17,068
We know that Bauer's
involved, but we don't know why.

707
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,233
Isn't it obvious?

708
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,434
Bauer is a fugitive

709
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,534
and he's looking for safe
passage out of the country.

710
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,667
Well, that's certainly
a possibility, sir.

711
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,734
Listen to me. This
man is desperate.

712
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,500
He will say
or do anything.

713
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:30,834
He's not to be trusted.

714
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:33,167
We need to take him down now,

715
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,467
dead or alive.

716
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,601
Yes, sir.

717
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,300
Mr. President.

718
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,167
Look. You call the pilot

719
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:41,834
and you tell him
that I don't care

720
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,267
if Bauer is making
threats or not,

721
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,133
that plane has
to land immediately.

722
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,367
And when it lands, I want
my Secret Service detail

723
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,267
to take him into custody,
is that clear?

724
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:53,701
Ms. Hayes?

725
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,267
Yes, Mr. President.

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
The president has had knowledge

727
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,867
of everything
that's happened today.

728
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:06,068
He wants that plane down
before Jack finds the evidence.

729
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,867
We have to buy him more time.

730
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:11,734
I don't have the authority
to keep that plane from landing.

731
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:15,601
Sir.

732
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:18,233
It still doesn't
make sense to me.

733
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,901
What?
Jack Bauer

734
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:21,334
has been on the right side

735
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,767
of everything that's
happened today, up until now.

736
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,434
Well, right now,
he is hijacking a plane.

737
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,001
This man is not stupid.

738
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,001
He's appeared

739
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,300
to do the right thing,
but right now,

740
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,601
he's backed into a corner,
and he's desperate.

741
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,601
Do you really believe that, sir?

742
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,968
I absolutely do.

743
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,500
Bauer's lied to us all day.

744
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,501
MAN:
Flight Operations.

745
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:10,867
This is Chloe O'Brian again.

746
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,501
Yes, Ms. O'Brian.

747
00:37:12,568 --> 00:37:13,900
The copilot, Don Faganson,

748
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,867
didn't check in
when he boarded Flight 520.

749
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,501
Mr. Faganson didn't board.

750
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,633
Why not?

751
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,468
He was replaced
at the last minute.

752
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:21,501
By whom?

753
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:24,367
Scott Evans, the new copilot.

754
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,867
Here are your things,
Go back to your seat.

755
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:40,334
( phone rings )

756
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,468
Yeah.

757
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:43,501
Jack, it's the copilot,
Scott Evans.

758
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:44,633
How do you know?

759
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,101
He used to fly for Hatton Air.

760
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,334
It's a private charter company

761
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:49,334
that worked exclusively
for Omicron.

762
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,867
Evans was assigned
to Henderson's group.

763
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:52,334
He flew him around
for over a year.

764
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,401
Okay, I need you to
patch me through
to the captain

765
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,334
on a discreet channel
so Evans can't hear me.

766
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,301
Okay.

767
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,867
Sit down!

768
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:02,867
Now!

769
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:04,501
Everybody stay in your seats

770
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:06,767
and no one  will get hurt!

771
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,134
CHLOE:
Go ahead.

772
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,534
Captain, this
is Jack Bauer.

773
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,401
I'm speaking to you
on a discreet channel.

774
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,633
The person that
I'm looking for,

775
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,267
the man with the
evidence that I need,

776
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,301
is sitting next to you.

777
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,167
He's your copilot,
Scott Evans.

778
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,334
That's ridiculous.

779
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,834
Sir, my sources
have informed me

780
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,600
that Evans was a
last-second replacement.

781
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,468
Can you explain to me
why you're not flying

782
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,434
with your regular copilot,
Don Faganson?

783
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,934
Captain, Scott Evans
has been connected

784
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,834
to a known terrorist.

785
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,234
You need to open the door.

786
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:49,800
This conversation is over.

787
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,334
Damn it.

788
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:00,934
What did he want?

789
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,934
He's desperate.

790
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
Wants us to land.

791
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,201
This is messed up.

792
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:06,468
Yeah.

793
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:09,600
Bad luck for you, huh?

794
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,667
Why?

795
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,733
Well, wasn't Don supposed
to have your seat tonight?

796
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,468
Yeah.

797
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,900
What happened to him?

798
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,201
I don't know.

799
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,267
I got the call, so I'm here.

800
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,900
Yeah.

801
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,101
Oh, God.

802
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:34,867
What's wrong?

803
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:35,867
( groans )

804
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:36,967
Could you, uh...

805
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:39,000
Could you take the
stick for a second?

806
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,867
You okay?

807
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:45,201
Yeah. I just...
got a cramp in my leg.

808
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:51,301
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

809
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,834
Yeah.

810
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,234
( groans )

811
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,967
I'm the only one
who can fly this plane.

812
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,967
Now, you don't strike me

813
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,800
as a man who's willing to die

814
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,234
for Christopher
Henderson.

815
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,401
Give me the recording.

816
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:19,468
( cocking gun )

817
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:20,934
Do it.

818
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:32,367
Slowly.

819
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:33,934
Get up.

820
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,267
Get back in your seat.

821
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,267
You're going
to land this plane

822
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:45,434
or I'm going to put
a bullet in your head.

823
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,101
( phone ringing )

824
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,234
Yeah, Jack.

825
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,234
Advise CTU I have the recording.

826
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:56,167
I'll be on the ground
in less than 15 minutes.

827
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,967
Got it.

828
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,501
NEWSCASTER:
At this hour, there are still
many unanswered questions

829
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,568
surrounding
David Palmer's death.

830
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,934
During the emergency press
conference, the president

831
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,334
announced that the terrorist
threat was over...

832
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:17,468
( phone ringing )

833
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:21,934
Yes.

834
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,234
MARTHA ( weakly ):
Charles.

835
00:41:23,301 --> 00:41:26,401
If I'm going to live with this,

836
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:28,434
then you're
going to have to help me.

837
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:31,234
Help you do what, Martha?

838
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,501
Understand.

839
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:35,301
I...

840
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:39,534
I know you're a good man,

841
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,234
and that deep down,

842
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:45,767
you do what's best
for this country.

843
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:46,867
Of course I do.

844
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:50,434
Then why...

845
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,568
why didn't you come to me?

846
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,633
I'd have been there for you.

847
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,900
I could have
talked you through it.

848
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:00,967
For God's sake, Martha,
for the last three years,

849
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:02,134
you've been one click away

850
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:03,900
from a nervous breakdown
every single day,

851
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,468
and I'm gonna come to you
for advice?

852
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:10,633
( phone rings )
I'm gonna have to take
another call.

853
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,967
No. Charles, no, no.

854
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,900
We'll talk later.

855
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:17,600
( sobbing )

856
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:21,534
( cell phone ringing )

857
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:22,667
Yes.

858
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,167
Bauer's got the evidence.

859
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,633
He is in control of the plane.

860
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,134
How do you know that?

861
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:31,034
We just picked up a call from
Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.

862
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:33,800
What do we do?

863
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:39,267
You are going to have
to shoot down that
plane, Mr. President.

864
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:40,568
What?

865
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,301
It's the only option
we've got.

866
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,167
Otherwise, you go to prison

867
00:42:45,234 --> 00:42:47,167
for treason and murder.
