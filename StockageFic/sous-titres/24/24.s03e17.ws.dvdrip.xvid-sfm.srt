1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,999
-How much ofthe virus was released?
- Enough to kill everyone in the building.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,396
- Did you plant any other vials?
- My assignment was the hotel.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,354
- So there are others?
- Yes. 11.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,552
Alvers planted a vial
in the ventilation system.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,990
It went off as Gael tried to disarm it.
No one can leave the building.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,194
We have to impose a quarantine. If people
realise what's going on, there'll be panic.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,311
- (man) They're lying.
- It's inside!

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,510
(Phillips) Keep away from the doors.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,192
(screaming)

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,029
- If you try to leave, I will shoot you.
- (whispers) No, you won't.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,672
(screaming)

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,318
- He knows who you are, Jack.
- Who knows who I am?

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,796
"Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer."
That's what he said.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,871
Go up against him, you're a dead man.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,076
- Bauer.
- (Saunders) Hello, Jack.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,473
I knew you were better than Amador,
but you're not better than me.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,115
I need you to put me in touch
with a... friend of yours.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,633
Mr President, the man in possession
of the virus demands to speak with you.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,839
(Saunders)
You are no longer in control ofyour country.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,079
And if you do not use the full power
of your office to execute my wishes,

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,628
the virus will be released.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,796
And it be impossible to stop.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,631
Everybody. Stay calm.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Stay calm and quiet.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,553
- Look! Outside!
- (screaming and panic)

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,596
Move in! Move in!

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,432
(screaming)

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,880
I want to make one thing clear right now.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,634
No one leaves this building
until further notice.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,874
In a moment, I will get on the intercom
and explain why.

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,275
I need absolute quiet
and absolute cooperation.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,872
- It reaches the entire hotel?
- Yes.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,635
(coughing)

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,399
This is Federal Agent Michelle Dessler.

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,554
In order to survive what's happened,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,595
you will need to listen carefully
and follow my instructions.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,236
As most of you already know, an infectious
substance has been released in the building

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,470
and the hotel has been quarantined.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,232
Anyone attempting to leave
will be stopped by any means necessary.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,318
If you are in your room, stay there.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,877
If you are anywhere else,
return to your room immediately.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,392
Medical assistance will arrive shortly
and be given to anyone who requires it.

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,878
The first priority is to go back to your room
and stay there.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,790
Thank you.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,555
You heard the announcement.
Let's make our way back to the elevators.

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,878
The elevators are back in operation.
This way, people, in an orderly fashion.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,720
God. Danny?

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,311
Oh! No!

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,192
It's OK.

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,235
Who did this? Who killed him?

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,830
You?

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,192
You're a federal agent.
You were supposed to protect him.

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Get your hands off me.

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,633
I am sorry,
but this will just make things worse.

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,396
- You were supposed to protect him.
- (man) It's OK. Come on.

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,273
Yeah, this is Bauer.

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,868
(woman) Agent Bauer,
please hold for the president.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,872
- Jack.
- Mr President.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,670
The man I spoke to, the one who controls
this virus. Why did he use you to get to me?

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,268
I wish I could answer that.
He says he knows me,

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,233
but we haven't ascertained
a positive identification.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,876
The only thing I can tell you for certain is that
within the last hour he was in Los Angeles.

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
He made it clear he intends to use
the threat of this virus to control me,

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,953
and, through me, the entire government.
Obviously, we cannot let that happen.

65
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,396
- I understand, sir.
- Find him, Jack.

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,909
We're doing everything we can.
I'll keep in touch.

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,514
Thank you.

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,870
With Amador dead, we got two leads left.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,629
First, whoever this guy is says he knows me.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,350
- Second, he knows Alvers.
- The guy who planted the virus at the hotel.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,235
Right. Call Tony. Tell him to get Alvers
to give us a physical description, detailed.

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,593
Then I want it crosschecked
with personnel in my service file.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,717
- Bauer says he doesn't know this man.
- But he knows Bauer.

74
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,876
- Apparently.
- How is that possible?

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,788
I don't know. All I know is they're
doing everything they can to find him.

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,030
Did he give any indication of what he wants?

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,271
No.

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,871
But he controls enough of the virus to wipe
out a significant portion of the population.

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,550
So, whatever he wants, we don't have
much choice but to give it to him.

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,269
At least for now.

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,634
- Make sure all the exits are sealed off.
- I checked a few minutes ago.

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,880
Well, check again.

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,880
You don't have to keep me busy,
Agent Dessler.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,713
I'm not gonna panic.

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,550
I know you won't.
I appreciate all the help you've given me.

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,880
I'd just like to know the truth. Um...

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,316
Is everyone in this hotel gonna die?

88
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,355
Not everyone.
A few will be immune to the virus.

89
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,715
But most of us...

90
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,030
- What are the chances of survival?
- I don't know.

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,915
I'll let you know as soon as I do.

92
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,519
Thank you.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,870
(phone rings)

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,395
- Dessler.
- Hey, it's me. The perimeter's set.

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,880
Things are under control, but a panic's still
possible as more people show symptoms.

96
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,671
We have to be ready for that since the
incubation period is shorter than we thought.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,358
How you doing?

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,517
I... I'm fine. So far.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,471
I just...

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,953
What?

101
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Things got crazy.

102
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,030
I had to shoot a man.

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,477
He was trying to get out of the hotel.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,788
He's dead.

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,158
Michelle, you did what you had to do,
the only thing you could have done.

106
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,756
- You need to stay focused, all right?
- I know. I am.

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,880
There's something we need you to do. Find
out if Alvers ever saw the man that hired him.

108
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
We need a description
as detailed as possible.

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,836
I'm on it. I'll call you right back.

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,880
(man) Medical assistance just got here.
We're gonna really need your help now.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,477
(Duncan) Come on, everybody. Move it.

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,156
(male agent)
Ma'am, bring her up.

113
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,997
- I'm bleeding.
- You don't look too bad so far.

114
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,870
We had a deal. I told you what I knew, you'd
kill me when I started showing symptoms.

115
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,232
- You haven't told us everything you know.
- What are you talking about?

116
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,518
The man you work for. What's his name?

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,995
He never told me his name.

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,678
I'm dying.
I have nothing to gain by lying about it.

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,190
When was the last time you saw him?

120
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,115
Three hours ago,
at a go parlour in Chinatown.

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,879
- Tony. I'm with Alvers.
- We're ready. Go ahead.

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,952
I want a description.

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,595
Mid-thirties. Caucasian. Uh...

124
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,995
About six one. Black hair, brown eyes.

125
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,588
Lean, no facial hair.

126
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,880
- He... He speaks with a British accent.
- You get that?

127
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,873
- We got it. How long will this take?
- Once the parameters are in, not long.

128
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,270
I need to cross-reference it
with personnel Jack has worked with.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,991
(Tony) All right, Jack. We're uploading
photos of suspects. You should have a visual.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,076
(Jack) Copy that.

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,990
(Alvers) No.

132
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,070
No.

133
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,799
No.

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,871
No.

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,276
No.

136
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,871
No.

137
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,713
No.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,149
No.

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,949
No.

140
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,555
No.

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,869
No.

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,678
No.

143
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,916
- He's not there.
- Are you sure?

144
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,871
- Of course I'm sure.
- Tony?

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,276
Yeah, I heard.
We'll have to widen the search parameters.

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,838
The accent might be a mislead.
Maybe he's not British.

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,668
If we drop that parameter,
the database will increase by a factor of 50.

148
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,756
That's 750 possibilities.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,880
A fair amount of those are missing visuals.
In other words, no head shots.

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,871
- Tony.
- Yeah, Jack?

151
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,157
What are the parameters,
outside of accent and appearance?

152
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,953
As wide as we can make 'em.
All living males...

153
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,833
- Change that.
- Change "living"?

154
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,634
- Yeah, change it to "presumed dead".
- Copy that.

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,716
(Alvers) No.

156
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,193
No.

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,868
No.

158
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,232
No.

159
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,874
No.

160
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,314
- There. That's him.
- Tony. Tony. That's him.

161
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,156
- (Tony) Jack, you know this guy?
- My God.

162
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,875
- Jack?
- I know him. His name is Stephen Saunders.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,072
British lntelligence lent him to CTU
for a mission in Kosovo.

164
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,634
- The one that targeted Victor Drazen.
- Yeah.

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,880
I was the only one to get out.
Five died, including Saunders.

166
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,996
At least, that's what I thought.

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,240
I was obviously wrong. Tony, I'll get back
to you. I need a minute to think this through.

168
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,873
Jack. Hurry.

169
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,878
Son of a bitch.

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,880
The hotel seems to be under control.

171
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,192
SWAT's in place. NHS is there
and will start the testing procedure soon.

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,440
- Any sense the press has picked up on this?
- Not so far, but they're bound to before long.

173
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,430
Containing the virus is crucial,
but containing the story is just as important.

174
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,433
If this story breaks,
we need a plausible cover.

175
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,269
- I'll work up some scenarios.
- Don't use the term "Cordilla virus".

176
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,472
People have never heard of it
and the unknown creates fear.

177
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,190
Say it's similar to legionnaire's.
People are familiar with that.

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,880
- And they know it was handled successfully.
- OK.

179
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,836
- Mr O'Laughlin.
- Mr President.

180
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,359
- Please.
- Thank you.

181
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,392
Thank you very much. Mr Palmer.

182
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,880
11 vials are unaccounted for.
What's Homeland Security's assessment?

183
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,476
- The threat level should be raised to "Red".
- Do it. What about domestic air travel?

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,156
It is our suggestion that flights be grounded
and airports closed.

185
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,876
If your concern is to avoid panic, stopping
air traffic might have the opposite effect.

186
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,315
Better than widespread release of the virus.

187
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,075
If you shut down airports,
you can't explain it with legionnaire's.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,796
We're talking about security issues.
We are not talking about public relations.

189
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,348
How the public relates to this
is a security issue.

190
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,871
We also advocate shutting down interstate
rail and bus traffic in the interest of...

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,912
Whoever has these vials
could already be in their cars.

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,952
- We can't shut down every highway...
- Mr President...

193
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,880
Gentlemen.

194
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,953
Alert the airlines to a possible shutdown.
But wait for my authorisation.

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,354
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,232
(phone rings)

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,510
- Yes.
- (woman) Mr President, call on one.

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,434
One moment, please.
Thank you, Mr O'Laughlin.

199
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,870
Thank you, Mr President.

200
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,075
It's him.

201
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,271
OK, guys, here we go. Start the trace.

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,476
- Put the call through, please.
- Yes, sir, right away.

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,238
- (Saunders) Mr President?
- Yes?

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,880
It's time for your first assignment.

205
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,156
A simple one, but one necessary
to our future relationship.

206
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,910
- We don't have a relationship.
- No. You don't negotiate with terrorists.

207
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Well, I don't negotiate with heads of state,
so just do as you're told.

208
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,590
Across the street from your building is
a mailbox. Have the Secret Service open it.

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,557
Inside is a package wrapped in black paper.
Have them bring it to you within ten minutes.

210
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,873
- I'm not doing anything until you tell me...
- (dial tone)

211
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,035
He didn't stay on long enough. Probably
knew we were going to try and trace the call.

212
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,873
- Send Secret Service to get the package.
- All right,

213
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,037
but it'll have to be screened
for explosives, the virus...

214
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,914
Then do it.
Just make sure it's back here in ten minutes.

215
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,996
All right.

216
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,275
His file's inactive.
There's no evidence he surfaced after Kosovo.

217
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
So, for six years
he's let everyone think he's dead.

218
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,278
I don't think so. If he survived, he'd
have been captured and sent to prison.

219
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,355
If the mission failed, maybe he was why.
Betrayed the team and pretended to be killed.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,877
You don't know Saunders. He was a patriot.
Something else happened to him.

221
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,952
- Who are you calling?
- Ml6.

222
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,109
(man) Operations.

223
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,518
This is Jack Bauer, I need to speak with
Trevor Tomlinson, please.

224
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,636
(phone rings)

225
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,275
Hello, Jack.

226
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,868
Has CTU brought you up to speed
on Saunders?

227
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,390
We've got his file up now.
There's no indication he's still alive.

228
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,637
Trust me, he is.
You'll want to do a forensic protocol search.

229
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,077
- Being done as we speak.
- Would London have any additional data?

230
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,395
On something like this? No, it's local.

231
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,149
One more thing. He'll want to deal
with people he knows and trusts.

232
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,033
See if you can do a search
on all his past contacts.

233
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,551
Great. Most of them have gone dark,
or they're confirmed dead.

234
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,114
Oh, here's something. A name. Diana White.

235
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,516
Ran a high-class escort service
in Los Angeles in the late '80s.

236
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,155
Catered to diplomats,
embassy employees, that sort of thing.

237
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,198
She passed intel to Saunders
and they became close.

238
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,756
- They lived together for a while.
- Is she still in Los Angeles?

239
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,350
Yes, but she's been inactive
in intelligence circles for some time.

240
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,749
Patch her file and every piece of information
you've got through to my computer. Thanks.

241
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,668
I'd like to begin testing hotel staff.

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,509
But it would really help if you would go first.

243
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,949
- All right.
- OK.

244
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,156
- (woman) Name, please?
- Michelle Dessler, CTU.

245
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,236
There you go.

246
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,156
We're set.

247
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,838
It's a nasal swab. As reliable as a blood test,
but it can be analysed much more quickly.

248
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,873
- How quickly?
- We should have the results in two hours.

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,638
Thank you.

250
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,391
Next.

251
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,159
- (man) In there.
- (Duncan) Over here, sir.

252
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,078
Sir, step over here.

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,908
It's all right, sir.
There's nothing to be worried about.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,230
It's a simple nasal swab.

255
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,831
This phone is what was in the package
from Stephen Saunders.

256
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,838
We scanned it. It's clean.

257
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,829
Unfortunately, Mr President,
it's built with what's called a subchannel chip,

258
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,276
designed to receive a specific signal
that can't be traced.

259
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,075
- I understand. Thank you, Aaron.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,189
So this is how he intends
to communicate now.

261
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,198
- And if we can't trace the call...
- We can't find him.

262
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,550
(phone rings)

263
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,711
Yes.

264
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,789
Good. You're using your new phone.
Consider it our private line.

265
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,793
And, as you've no doubt been informed,
don't bother trying to trace my calls.

266
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,552
What do you want?

267
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,434
- Within half an hour hold a press conference.
- About what?

268
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,109
The space programme.
The price of wheat. It's entirely up to you.

269
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,597
But at some point, you will use the phrase
"The sky is falling".

270
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,553
Use it however you like, Mr President...

271
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,636
but use it.

272
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,635
He wants a press conference. About what, it
doesn't matter. Just say, "The sky is falling".

273
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,633
It's a signal of some sort. Maybe for an attack,
maybe for a wave of attacks.

274
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,876
Maybe it's just to show he's in control.

275
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,548
Either way,
you can't give him that kind of power.

276
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,478
- You saw what that virus does.
- I read the file, yeah.

277
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,750
A thousand people are dying as we speak.

278
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,838
Not just in a file,
but in real life, right here in LA.

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,711
I realise that, but...

280
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,436
If I don't do what this man says,
it will be millions.

281
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,869
It could buy some time.

282
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,750
Maybe CTU can find this maniac
before things get out of hand.

283
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,678
Call a press conference.

284
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,759
- (man) She's there.
- I'll let him know. Diana White is at home.

285
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,395
- Have we got anything new on her?
- Just the list of her clientele.

286
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,230
Dignitaries, heads of state, even a member
of the Vatican. Net worth, 20 million.

287
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Her relationship with Saunders makes sense.
She names her clients,

288
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,758
he blackmails them
by threatening to reveal them.

289
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,880
- Think that's how he financed his operation?
- I think it's how he financed part of it.

290
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,113
You knew Saunders. You said he was
a good soldier. What do you think happened?

291
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,876
To be honest, I don't know. I still can't believe
he survived the blast in Bosnia.

292
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,874
They must have captured him,
otherwise he would have resurfaced.

293
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,398
They would have put him in prison,
tortured him for God knows how many years.

294
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,880
Now he's holding
our government responsible.

295
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,678
- But he was a British agent.
- He was on loan to us.

296
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,678
- It was a US operation.
- Oh.

297
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,155
We left him behind.

298
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,880
I left him behind.

299
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,832
You were studying this virus,
even before it surfaced.

300
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,158
- (man) This isn't the same strain.
- Maybe not the same, but related, right?

301
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,874
You must have worked on a cure
or vaccine or something.

302
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,911
Any research we have is based on...

303
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,198
I got a hotel full of people dying.
One of them's my wife.

304
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,475
- So don't tell me there's nothing you can do.
- I wish there was. I'm sorry.

305
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,876
NHS.

306
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,310
What did they say?

307
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,716
Anyone infected...

308
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,718
It's a hundred per cent mortality rate.

309
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
You know today?

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,876
When Michelle told Chappelle that
I should stand down because of my wound,

311
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,590
I barely even spoke to her.

312
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,878
Tony, I can't tell you that I know
what you're going through, cos I don't.

313
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,789
- But if you need anything, I'm here.
- Kim. Would you excuse us?

314
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,313
- Of course. Here's the file.
- (Tony) Thanks.

315
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,475
Have you cleared those files with Division?

316
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,717
No, I didn't get to it yet.
I had to take care of something.

317
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,391
I know what you were doing, Tony.
You were calling about Michelle.

318
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,715
- She's my wife.
- I understand that,

319
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,400
but we're short-handed. We can't afford...

320
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,395
- I know how to do my job.
- You're not doing it. You have to move on.

321
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,476
"Move on"?

322
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,879
- What, you're acting like she's already dead?
- Yes. I am. And so should you.

323
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,558
We're at war, Tony. I need your full attention.

324
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,753
If you can't give it to me, go home,
or maintain a vigil at the hotel.

325
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
But if you stay here I need you to focus,

326
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,876
and the best way to do that is to assume
the worst and make it about getting revenge.

327
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,873
Now, what's it going to be?
Are you staying or not?

328
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,556
What do you need?

329
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm hunting for bank accounts
Amador used over the past few months,

330
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,394
on the computer
we confiscated at the go club.

331
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,878
If I find something, maybe we can follow the
money trail back to this Stephen Saunders.

332
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,070
- This offshore or domestic?
- Both.

333
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,755
Anything suspicious, I'll stream it to you.

334
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,475
Coordinate with Division
on a substrata overlay.

335
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,880
All right. You got it.

336
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,838
- Thanks, Tony.
- Yeah.

337
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,558
- Don't fire! I'm a federal agent.
- So what? You're in my house.

338
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,395
Don't shoot.
I just want to show you my identification.

339
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,990
- What do you want?
- I need to talk about Stephen Saunders.

340
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,792
Bastard.

341
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,116
Put that gun down!

342
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,670
You first.

343
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,880
OK.

344
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,440
I'm going to put my gun down.

345
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,710
Just take it easy.

346
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,078
- Step out from behind there.
- OK. I'm coming out.

347
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,836
Just take it easy.

348
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,713
Just stay calm. I just want to talk to you.

349
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,751
Now we can talk.

350
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,996
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

351
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,630
Go ahead.

352
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,876
Tell me about you and Saunders.

353
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,875
Stephen always told me he'd protect me.
I was young and stupid and I believed him.

354
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,673
When the work turned ugly,
he left me hanging.

355
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,793
- What kind of work?
- (exasperated sigh) It's a figure of speech.

356
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,758
We know you acquired intelligence
for Saunders.

357
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,871
I provided a service for wealthy men.

358
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,675
How long do you think it would've lasted
if I'd betrayed confidences?

359
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,991
- So, you're denying that you work for him?
- Yes.

360
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,595
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

361
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,190
You will. Come on.

362
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,752
Call Tomlinson. Tell him we're bringing
Diana White in for questioning.

363
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,038
- I'm not going anywhere without a lawyer.
- You're not under arrest.

364
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,756
I'm taking you to Ml6. You'll be interrogated
by an agent of a foreign government.

365
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,112
Your constitutional rights no longer apply.
Let's go.

366
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,032
- Have you seen Gael?
- He doesn't have much time left.

367
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,879
So fast.

368
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,631
- Is he in a lot of pain?
- You know the pathology of this virus.

369
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,079
- I want to see him.
- I wouldn't advise that.

370
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,193
If I've been infected, I've been infected.
There's nothing anyone can do.

371
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
That's not what I meant.

372
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,871
(hacking cough)

373
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,678
(breathes heavily)

374
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,873
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

375
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,149
Contact my family...

376
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,113
and tell them that I love them.

377
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,158
Tell them that I died quickly, no pain.

378
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,116
Of course.

379
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,836
Gael.

380
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,873
I was raised to believe...

381
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,878
suicide is a sin.

382
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
No one could blame you,
in this world or the next,

383
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,075
for ending your suffering.

384
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,919
Are you so sure about that?

385
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,155
(choking cough)

386
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,075
A few seconds more, that's all I needed.

387
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,997
You know...

388
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,880
when I was trying to stop the cylinder
from exploding,

389
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,077
I hesitated, just a moment,

390
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
because I was afraid.

391
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,913
Then I forced myself to move forward.

392
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,239
If only I hadn't hesitated,

393
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,193
this might not be happening to me,

394
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,034
to all those poor people upstairs.

395
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,510
Oh, Gael, you did everything you could.

396
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I'm proud to have worked with you.
You're one of...

397
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,555
You're one of the bravest men
I've ever known.

398
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,431
And I will make sure
that your wife and children know that.

399
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,791
(chokes)

400
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,796
(chokes)

401
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,839
Homeland Security put the threat level
to Red. They're in contact with the FBl,

402
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,396
set to move if "the sky is falling"
should trigger any kind of suspicious activity.

403
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,239
Is the FAA set to ground flights
and close airports?

404
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,030
- David, I think that's an overreaction.
- That was not my question.

405
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,115
Yes.

406
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,631
(man) Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

407
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,475
- Please, be seated. Good morning.
- (press) Good morning.

408
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,160
I know the hour's unusual,

409
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,033
but so are the times in which we live.

410
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,153
As a result of intelligence on terrorist activity

411
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,590
gathered by the office of Homeland Security
and other agencies,

412
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,874
I'm announcing that a threat level Red
exists throughout the United States.

413
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,471
Therefore, I'm ordering the grounding of
all domestic and international air traffic,

414
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,875
and the closing of airports.

415
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,555
I'm not taking this action
because the sky is falling.

416
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,390
But I'd rather be overprotective
than underprepared.

417
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,274
And, as always, diligence and calm
are your best weapons

418
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,233
against the insidious nature of the enemy.

419
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,918
And God willing,

420
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,353
we and all those who love freedom
will remain safe and secure. Thank you.

421
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,632
- Mr President, can I have a question, please?
- This is not a Q-and-A session.

422
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,475
The president has made a statement
and has nothing more to add. Thank you.

423
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,071
One moment.
Maybe a couple of questions.

424
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,275
- Mr President?
- Bill?

425
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,279
- Is the United States currently under attack?
- This is a preventive measure.

426
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,075
What are you preventing?
Will the public accept grounding air traffic

427
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,237
based on the vague justification
you've just given?

428
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,352
The exact nature of the threat
is something I can't go into.

429
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,670
- Hello, Jack.
- This is Chase Edmunds.

430
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,111
Chase Edmunds, Trevor Tomlinson.
This is Miss Diana White.

431
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,391
Miss White.
We've done some additional checking.

432
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,671
She's the owner of the address in Chinatown
where Saunders was.

433
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,872
- I haven't seen him.
- You might want to think that through.

434
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,198
- Think he'd put himself on the line for you?
- We're vetting the data on Saunders.

435
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,317
- Have you sent it off to London?
- No, it's still in our system.

436
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,637
London wants to get as far as we can
before transmitting.

437
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,632
Get down!

438
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,671
- She's dead! Chase! Are you hit?
- I got it in the vest.

439
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,397
Cover me.

440
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,715
Trevor! Saunders' computer file.
What server did you store it on?

441
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,155
A 5.

442
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,028
We gotta get down to the computer room.
Use the stairs. Go!

443
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,316
There's no way Saunders took out this place
just to kill Diana.

444
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,116
Ml6 has information that doesn't exist
anywhere else in the world. We need to get it.

445
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,276
I'll get the door.

446
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,475
Room's clear. Check him out.

447
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,794
(beeping)

448
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,796
- Chase.
- What?

449
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,075
We got a bomb.

450
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,518
- How much time?
- None. You gotta go now.

451
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,196
- Go now!
- Jack, I'm not leaving you.

452
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,829
Get out of here!
It's an order. Go now!

453
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,073
(beeping quickens)

454
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,036
I got it. Go! Go!

455
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,230
Go! Go!

456
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,873
(phone rings)

457
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,680
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's me.

458
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,516
Gael's dead.

459
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,269
He was suffering so badly.

460
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
No one should have to go through
what he did.

461
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,354
Tony, there are children upstairs
who are going to die in agony

462
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,396
in front of their parents' eyes.

463
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,558
Unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do for them.

464
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,880
Actually, there is.

465
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,874
- Field Ops has a supply of capsules.
- Those are for agents that are captured.

466
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,880
I know. They're for committing suicide to
prevent torture. It's what they'd be used for.

467
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,509
We could make them available
to anyone symptomatic.

468
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,110
- It would be their choice.
- You know I'm not authorised to do that.

469
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,353
I'm not interested in what's authorised.

470
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,880
You're talking about mass suicide,
facilitated by an agency of the government.

471
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,678
I'm talking about common decency.

472
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,479
Ifyou could have seen Gael...

473
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,880
I'm calling because...

474
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,912
if it was me...

475
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,713
If I'm infected... I know what I'd want.

476
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,912
We don't have much time.

477
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,917
Gael was the first to die because he was the
first exposed, but others won't be far behind.

478
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,189
I'll see what I can do.

479
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,349
Thank you.

480
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,674
(woman) Mr Chappelle, line two.

481
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,390
Chappelle.

482
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,880
Ryan, it's Jack. Almost the entire Ml6 office
has been wiped out.

483
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
What?

484
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,678
They took out a woman
who had contact with Saunders,

485
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,394
and most personnel, including Tomlinson,

486
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,751
which means Saunders has
a larger organisation than we thought.

487
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,555
It also makes him more visible,
easier to find. Got anything yet?

488
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,875
I don't know. I'm following the money trail.

489
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,356
I narrowed it to a few dozen offshore banks,
but it'll take time.

490
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,235
One of the things Saunders was trying to
destroy was the information Ml6 had on him.

491
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,880
I retrieved the hard drive storing that
information. Call London, get their protocols

492
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,475
and assemble a team ready to start
striping data off this thing.

493
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,673
- All right. I'll put Chloe on it right away.
- OK.

494
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,509
Suicide capsules.
For the people down at the hotel.

495
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,359
It's gonna get pretty bad down there.

496
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,029
It's against every regulation in the book.

497
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,839
Yeah.

498
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,871
Do it.

499
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,795
I tried to call Pachal. There's no answer.

500
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,271
He's dead.
So's Young, taken out in the Ml6 operation.

501
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,875
And Bauer?

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,754
He and his partner got out
before the explosion.

503
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,792
- But the hard drive was destroyed?
- Completely.

504
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,519
- What about Diana?
- Dead.

505
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,389
I'll miss her.

506
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,598
There's one more thing. There have been
inquiries made about the bank in Cayman.

507
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,558
- By whom?
- They're coming from CTU.

508
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,356
- A man named Ryan Chappelle.
- I know Chappelle.

509
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,880
Apparently he's quite good
at following money trails.

510
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,030
Is he?

511
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,072
Carry on.

512
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,472
What is it?

513
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,717
There was just an attack
on the LA office of Ml6.

514
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,674
- Jack Bauer was there at the time.
- Is he all right?

515
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,035
Yeah. He's on his way back to CTU.

516
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,118
Any indication that the attack was triggered
by what I said at the press conference?

517
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,599
- We don't know what triggered the attack.
- So, it could have been what I said?

518
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,398
- How was the attack carried out?
- By helicopter. And two men inside.

519
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,590
They have to land it somewhere.

520
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,076
I want FAA to coordinate
with Homeland Security and Border Patrol.

521
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,391
Right away, Mr President.

522
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,757
(phone rings)

523
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,830
What?

524
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,873
I enjoyed your press conference.
Good to know the sky's not falling.

525
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,196
- What do you want?
- To give you your next assignment.

526
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,514
A sort of preliminary action to clear the decks
before the main event to come.

527
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,950
There's a man named Ryan Chappelle,
regional director of CTU.

528
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,753
- Yeah, what about him?
- I want him killed.

529
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,676
What?

530
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,715
At 7am, have his body delivered to the
train yard downtown, just off the main line.

531
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,872
- It's out of the question.
- What a shame.

532
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,751
Before you decide,

533
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,880
you might want to drop by the Chandler
Plaza Hotel, look at what's happening.

534
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,873
Then imagine the same taking place
at hundreds of locations all over the country.

535
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,956
You're insane.

536
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,196
(dial tone)

537
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,630
What does he want?

538
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,596
David?

539
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,111
