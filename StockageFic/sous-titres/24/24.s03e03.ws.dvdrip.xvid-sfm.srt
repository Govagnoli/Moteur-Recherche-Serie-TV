1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,675
What if I can get us
a copy of Keeler's playbook?

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,554
- What exactly do you mean by playbook?
- His entire prep for tonight's debate.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,920
- I told you to drop that.
- Listen. There is something you need to see.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,354
- There's nothing I need to see.
- It's about Anne.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,833
It's something we didn't know about her,
something that could damage us.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,635
- Can I talk to you now?
- Of course. OK. What's up?

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,271
Chase and I have been going out for a while.
And it's starting to get serious.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,239
I really care for him, Dad.
So what do you think?

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
I don't know what I think.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,551
(distorted) We want the release
of Ram Ãn Salazar.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,753
Ifyou refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,318
It looks like the virus was delivered
in a crystalline form.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,320
Maybe what you're looking for
is a white powder.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,995
- So, it would look like cocaine? Or heroin?
- Yeah, that may even be the strategy.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,149
Someone thinks they're selling coke,
in fact they're handling the virus.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,920
- Where did you get that money?
- It doesn't matter. We needed it, I got it.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,912
This is how you're gonna help your family?
By dealing drugs?

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,070
I'm not dealing 'em. It's a stupid delivery.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920
If that kid's got a bag of cocaine that's
got the virus in it and he doesn't know it,

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,229
I need to stop him putting it into circulation.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,037
You didn't shoot up, did you?
You think you can hide it from me?

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,990
- I'm not trying to hide it. I'm trying to quit.
- People don't just quit.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,520
I am not going on record with this addiction,
do you understand me?

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,159
You're the only person who knows,
and it's gonna stay that way.

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,475
Give me an update.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,359
- Kyle's still in his house.
- What about the package?

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,520
- It's with him.
- And Ram Ãn?

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,398
- Just waiting to come home.
- Good.

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,070
Have you downloaded everyone's folders?

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,629
Not yet. I'm pulling up details on the virus.

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,872
Don't waste too much time. All we need to
know is it kills within 24 hours of exposure

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,232
- and we believe Kyle Singer has it.
- I got all that. What's our approach to Singer?

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,120
Jack's meeting Nicole Duncan,
Health Services.

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,477
They're gonna take a Hazmat team over
to Singer's apartment. He's waiting for it now.

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,915
(breathes heavily)

36
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,512
Son of a bitch.

37
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,711
- Hey, Jack. How you doing?
- OK, Nicole. How've you been?

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,236
Till this afternoon, I was doing fine.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,396
You know, I tried to reach you
after I heard about Teri.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,520
Yeah, I know.

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,876
After that I kind of withdrew.
I appreciated the calls, thanks.

42
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,911
We should get going.

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,280
I just ran Macer's epidemiological model.
Her estimates were off.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,953
- Better or worse than we thought?
- Twice as bad.

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,080
She had 9% of the population infected
within a week but it's closer to 20%.

46
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,632
And the infection-to-mortality rate is higher
than her estimate. Almost 95% lethal.

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,350
I've been hunting germs for years,
I've not seen anything like this.

48
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,516
Great.

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,550
Are you feeling OK?

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,075
- Yeah, why?
- You're perspiring.

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,874
It's been nonstop since noon.

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,200
We'll be about eight minutes. It'd be great
to go over the quarantine protocols first.

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
- No problem.
- Good.

54
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,349
(distorted) Ifyou refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
(rewinding)

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,868
- We want the release of Ram Ãn Salazar...
- Gael!

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,998
Gael, take a look at this.
Closing in on the point of origin of this call.

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
- You see this code artefact here?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,273
We found a few more in this recording.
I think it's from a domestic switch-on mode.

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,438
Think the call was made from inside the US?

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,438
Maybe. I'm piping it over to your system.

62
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,280
- See if you can find a match.
- OK.

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,874
- But do it after the meeting.
- What meeting?

64
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,593
Tony's shifting resources to help Jack
in the field. He's closing in on the virus.

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Gael. Jack needs the audio feed
when he gets to the apartment.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,838
Tony needs me for something.
I'll do it after the meeting.

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,030
I need it before. Come do it now.

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,589
I can't! Stop bugging me.

69
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,636
I'll get it to you.

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,274
Fine.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,072
Have you thought about how it will be
when Ram Ãn comes back?

72
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,909
How it will be?

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
- Like it was before.
- Things have changed, Hector.

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,149
Nothing's changed.
He's only been gone three months.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
You've changed.

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,672
You've been in charge
while he's been in prison.

77
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,272
Are you willing to give that up so easily?

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,070
(phone rings)

79
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
- What is it?
- Bauer's about to intercept the package.

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,109
- How?
- I'm not sure, I'm about to find out.

81
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,236
- Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer?
- Of course.

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,431
He'll be fine.

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,636
Hey. How was the interview?

84
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,436
Fine.

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
What's up, Dad?

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,155
Your mother told me you paid the rent.

87
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
All three months we owed.

88
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,030
Yeah, I came into a little money.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,869
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't
have a job come into a little money?

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Tim and l, we went down
to the track the other day.

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,510
He knows this guy over at the stables
so, uh, we got a tip.

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,395
- Where did you get the money?
- Dad, what does it matter?

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,596
Honestly, the rent's paid for three months,
all right? The pressure's off us now.

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,155
Did you do something illegal?

95
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,152
No.

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,876
I told you, we went to Santa Anita
and we got lucky. I didn't do anything.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,833
Don't lie to me, I got enough to worry about.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,949
Now, this is my house. I pay the rent.
I take care of you and your mother.

99
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah, and when you get that job
you can go ahead and pay me back, huh?

100
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,589
- Wait, we're not done!
- We're done!

101
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
- Don't walk away!
- You should be thanking me!

102
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,909
Kyle! Kyle!

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,714
Open the door! Open the door!

104
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,872
(banging)

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,515
His name's Kyle Singer.
We think he's transporting the virus,

106
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,200
- though it's likely he doesn't realise it.
- How could he not know?

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,670
Health Services believe it was made
to look like heroin or coke.

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,475
We know Singer was hired to deliver
a package from Mexico to Los Angeles.

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,200
- He thinks he's smuggling drugs.
- That's the working theory. Here's the thing:

110
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,400
Once Singer delivers the powder,
it's cut up and distributed around the city.

111
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
Then it's impossible to contain.

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,191
- Well, isn't LAPD grabbing Singer?
- No.

113
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,750
Why not? Can't they get there faster?

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,993
LAPD's not trained to handle a hot zone.
Jack's going in with Health Services.

115
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,400
We're running the operation from here,
updating the president in real-time. Now...

116
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,755
we have to approach Singer with care.

117
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,872
He has no idea how deadly the powder is.

118
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,197
(Helen) What's going on?

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,589
- (Sam) He's locked himself in.
- Did you fight again?

120
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,272
(Sam) I'm not fighting...

121
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,592
- He doesn't respect me.
- Of course he does.

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,478
You're going to have to talk to him.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,558
(Sam) How can I talk
when there's a door between us?

124
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
(Helen) Give him the benefit of the doubt.

125
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,316
(Sam) Maybe there's more.

126
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,670
- He said he won it at the track.
- He could've come up with a better lie.

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,918
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
- Come on, Helen. Where are you going?

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,719
- Wherever.
- Hey, hey, hey. What's in the bag?

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,150
- Clothes.
- Open it.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,991
- What?
- Open the bag.

131
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm warning you.
Open that bag or I'm gonna open it myself.

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,275
- Mom?
- Kyle, listen to your father.

133
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,437
- It's none of his business.
- While you live in my house it is.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your house? This isn't your house,
you can't even pay the rent.

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,070
- Oh, Kyle!
- Hey!

136
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,559
- Aw, will you quit snooping, please?
- Don't even think about it.

137
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,918
What is this? Huh? Coke? Heroin?

138
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,200
- Give it back.
- What did you say?

139
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,510
- I need it.
- You need it? Are you some kind of junkie?

140
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
No. I'm just delivering it to this guy, OK?

141
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
- And if I don't get it to him...
- Who?

142
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,316
- It's just a guy, OK?
- Who?

143
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,270
Give me a name.

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,391
Kyle. Answer your father.

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,395
Just give it to me, OK?

146
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Stop it! Stop it, both of you!

147
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,430
Both of you! Both of you, stop!

148
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,434
Sam! Sam! Don't, Sam! Kyle!

149
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I can't reiterate this enough.
This is a credible threat.

150
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,875
Salazar's people will release this virus
if we don't find it first.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,036
So let's get going.

152
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,756
(talking quietly)

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,200
- Thought you were meant to be with Dad?
- I was. He sent me back here.

154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,236
- Why?
- To question Parker.

155
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,589
He already turned in Singer,
what else can you get?

156
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,559
- Nothing. And that's the point.
- I don't understand.

157
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.
He's making me sit out.

158
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,595
- Why?
- Why do you think?

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,039
Because of us? Chase, I'm sorry.

160
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,079
He says he's protecting me, but I'm not
the one he's trying to protect here.

161
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,918
- You're not blaming me, are you?
- All I'm saying is we shouldn't have told him.

162
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
What were we supposed to do?
Sneak around until someone catches us?

163
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,595
- Well, we could have waited.
- Until when?

164
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,270
He'd have the same response
no matter when we told him.

165
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,355
I gotta deal with this kid Parker.

166
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,436
(sighs)

167
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,119
Jeffrey, the food's exceptionally bad today.

168
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,757
Aren't there laws in this country
for cruel and unusual punishment?

169
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,110
Tell Annicon I'm ready to talk.

170
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,396
Bauer couldn't tell me, but Salazar's got
leverage, enough to get him released.

171
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,036
I won't let this son of a bitch
erase the last few years of my life.

172
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,478
Call your friend at the State Department.
See what he can tell you.

173
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,074
(phone rings)

174
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,280
- Annicon.
- Mr Annicon?

175
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,636
- Yeah.
- This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard.

176
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,872
- I know who you are.
- Sir, Salazar asked to see you.

177
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,792
- Why?
- He says he's ready to talk.

178
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,110
I'll be right there.

179
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,713
- Don't ask me why, just do it.
- All right.

180
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,280
- I hope you can get a refund.
- A refund?

181
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,794
From whoever sold you that load of crap.

182
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,480
Keeler will use this against you in this debate.
Ignoring it won't make it go away.

183
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
Neither will dignifying it with a response.

184
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,590
He'll claim that Anne perjured herself.
Which, in case you've forgotten, is a felony.

185
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Anne is no felon.

186
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,880
The allegation itself is enough to damage
you. Now, come on, David. Please, think.

187
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,873
You know you can't go into this debate
without some kind of response.

188
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,078
- What do you propose?
- Talk to Anne.

189
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,350
Make sure she's told you everything.

190
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,911
- She has told me everything.
- Are you sure?

191
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,553
Ever since I started seeing Anne,
you've undermined our relationship.

192
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,434
- Just because you don't like her?
- You're right, I don't like her.

193
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,633
This isn't about me and Anne,
it's about you and Anne.

194
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,480
If she's got nothing to hide, fine,
she's got nothing to hide.

195
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,553
But you'd better find out before you face off
with Keeler on national television.

196
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,990
(PA) Presidential flight check.
Presidential flight check.

197
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,199
Did you ask your friend,
Jack Bauer, what's going on?

198
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,393
You did, didn't you?
But he wouldn't say.

199
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,431
It must be very frustrating, Luis,
being kept in the dark.

200
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,680
- You have something to tell me?
- I asked you here, didn't l?

201
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,150
Then start talking because
you used up my patience an hour ago.

202
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Whoa. You are a dog with a bone, Luis.

203
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,474
Once you bite down, you don't let go.

204
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
When I'm out of here
I don't want you on me any more.

205
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,519
When you're out of here?

206
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,519
You are right.
In a few hours I am going home.

207
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
Really? And how will you manage that?

208
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,238
Hector's a good brother.

209
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Unless he's got a key to this place,
you're not going anywhere.

210
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,115
But he does have a key. And when he turns it,
the last two years of your life,

211
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,080
all the hours you spent
away from your family,

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,677
all the work you've done to put me here,
will go away. Just like that.

213
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,674
I wanted you to hear it from me, Luis.

214
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,468
I wanted it to be the last thing you ever heard.

215
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,877
Argh!

216
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,469
Your son will be returned to you now.

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,355
I'm just saying that Kyle is in over his head.

218
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
We're not calling a lawyer.
He hasn't even been arrested.

219
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,392
- Not yet.
- Maybe he won't be.

220
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,188
If we leave it alone, don't do anything,

221
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,478
- maybe this will just go away.
- You can't be serious?

222
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Why not, Sam?
Why do we have to let anybody know?

223
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,513
- Because it's against the law not to?
- What are you suggesting we do?

224
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,430
Call the police? Maybe they'll give us
a reward and we can pay our rent?

225
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,234
Right, that wasn't fair. I'm sorry.

226
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Oh my God!

227
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,598
- What are you doing?
- Do you want to visit your son in jail?

228
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,439
Wait a minute! Helen!

229
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Get back, get back!

230
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,188
- Kyle Singer! Kyle Singer!
- He's not here!

231
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,230
Isolate them. Draw blood for a full count and
get an oral swab. Seal all windows and vents.

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,191
No!

233
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,836
In here! In here!

234
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,439
Tony! The virus is out.
I repeat, the virus is out.

235
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
- Copy that, Jack. Where is it?
- The sewage system.

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,275
Get DWP to shut
all lines from ground zero.

237
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,279
It might be airborne. Get the fire department
and the LAPD to set up a perimeter.

238
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,433
- Tell them we've got a level three hot zone.
- Copy that.

239
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
(knock)

240
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,669
Come in.

241
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,112
Wayne said you wanted to see me.
What's wrong?

242
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
Keeler.

243
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,913
He's bringing your ex-husband
into this debate.

244
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,640
The SEC's investigation into his company.

245
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,038
Ted was convicted
and served his sentence. You know that.

246
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
I know what you told me.

247
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,670
I told you all there is to know. Ted's company
was introducing a hypertension drug...

248
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,557
- And you reviewed the research?
- Yes.

249
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,392
- Which turned out to have been fabricated.
- Which Ted knew at the time and I didn't.

250
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,630
Now Ted's claiming that you both knew.

251
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,319
He can't reverse eight years
after giving testimony.

252
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Well, he is. And he's willing
to go on record with the press.

253
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,355
- I don't know what to say except he's a liar.
- It's your word against his.

254
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,599
David.

255
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,030
You have reason to be suspicious.

256
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,638
God knows, you've been betrayed
by some of the people you've trusted most.

257
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,992
But I'm not Sherry.
I told you the whole truth once.

258
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,872
And I'm not going to defend it.

259
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,871
Because, if there's anything less
than complete trust between us...

260
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,310
I do trust you, Anne.

261
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,793
You should.

262
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,271
(phone rings)

263
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,879
- Yes?
- (Wayne) We need to talk.

264
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,080
I'm with Anne now.

265
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,868
- Let me guess, she denied everything.
- I believe her.

266
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Well, listen. I might be able
to make this whole thing go away.

267
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,590
- How?
- Meet me in the auditorium. Alone.

268
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,116
All right.

269
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Have you had a chance
to take a look at Nicole's field report yet?

270
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,913
- I'm almost done.
- What are your impressions?

271
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,312
- From what I've read so far, I'm optimistic.
- Think we'll be able to contain the virus?

272
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,875
- We should be able to limit casualties.
- Even if it's airborne?

273
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,713
There is a risk of it spreading,
but the team acted fast.

274
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,475
They evacuated and sealed off
the building and quarantined the Singers.

275
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,160
- When do we get their test results?
- Five minutes, ten tops.

276
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,994
- So, it looks like we lucked out, huh?
- Yeah, we deserve a little luck.

277
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,557
- I gotta go, but keep me in the loop.
- OK, you do the same.

278
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,030
LAPD's doing the perimeter. They need
wind vectors for the last 15 minutes.

279
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,118
Call meteorology. Extension 2112.

280
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,960
Tony, local news picked up the story about
the body being dumped at Health Services.

281
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,952
- They want a statement. What do I say?
- Nothing.

282
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,880
Tony. Warden Mitchell's on the phone. He's
calling from the prison, he says it's urgent.

283
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,829
Almeida.

284
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,433
- Mr and Mrs Singer?
- What the hell is going on here?

285
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,560
Because this is not about drugs.

286
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,960
- We think you've been exposed to a virus.
- A virus?

287
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,750
It's called the cordilla virus. We believe Kyle
carried it in from Mexico without knowing.

288
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,360
- What do you mean? How?
- He thought he was carrying drugs.

289
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,351
So we've been exposed?

290
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,960
- I'm afraid so.
- What does that mean? Are we sick?

291
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,315
We'll keep you here until we get your results.

292
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,749
- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.

293
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,160
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

294
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,630
- I think Kyle's been exposed.
- We got an all-points on him.

295
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,160
- Have you set up a perimeter?
- We're doing all we can.

296
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
All agencies are in the loop
on a need-to-know basis.

297
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,709
- OK, good work.
- Listen, Jack, I know this isn't the best time,

298
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,320
but I just got some bad news
I figured you'd want to know.

299
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,160
- What's wrong?
- Luis Annicon was murdered.

300
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,277
- Murdered? How?
- Salazar's guard. We've got him in custody.

301
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,799
He claims Salazar had his son kidnapped
and threatened to kill him if he didn't.

302
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,509
- I'm sorry. I know you two worked closely.
- I'll have to get back to you.

303
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,949
- Is everything OK?
- I'm gonna get back to you.

304
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,716
(breathes heavily)

305
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,679
- These results can't be right.
- They are.

306
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,748
- Check it again.
- I have. Blood, saliva and surface tests.

307
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,676
They're all negative. We can't find
even a trace amount of this virus.

308
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,030
What are you doing? You haven't showered.

309
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,238
- We're not at risk.
- What? I watched the powder get out.

310
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
It's harmless.
Some form of silicate, that's all.

311
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,955
- What?
- There is no virus in the powder.

312
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,470
We tested five samples,
there weren't even trace amounts.

313
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,513
Atmospheric and surface analysis
also came up negative

314
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,752
- and Kyle's parents tested negative as well.
- You're sure?

315
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,228
The only thing I'm unsure of
is being on the right trail.

316
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,513
The body dropped at Health Services
was linked to Singer.

317
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Why would Salazar pay him
to bring a bag of worthless powder?

318
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,832
Fine, Jack.
But where do we even start looking?

319
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,076
I don't know.

320
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,829
Wait a second. Macer said the only way
to transport it was in crystalline form, right?

321
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,635
The only way it'll survive
outside a living body.

322
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,990
What if it was never outside a living body?

323
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,958
- What do you mean?
- Transported inside a living host?

324
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
What if Kyle Singer was infected
in Mexico before he even left?

325
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,549
Salazar has no power
if he's already infectious.

326
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
That's the point!
He wouldn't be contagious yet.

327
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,160
- The incubation period is 14 hours.
- Right. Think about it.

328
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,628
We know that Singer
was in Mexico 11 hours ago.

329
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,160
They haven't threatened to release it
for another three hours.

330
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,197
- The math adds up.
- We need to find Kyle Singer.

331
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,839
- Hello?
- Linda?

332
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,360
- Kyle, I told you, I have nothing to say to you.
- No, no, listen to me, OK? I'm in trouble.

333
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,272
- Yeah, because you're dealing drugs.
- I need your help.

334
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,875
- What happened?
- My Dad found the stuff.

335
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,951
We got in a fight.

336
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
I split, he's still got it.
I got to get this to them, all right?

337
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,110
These guys are hard-core.
I gotta make it right.

338
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,476
- Make it right? How?
- I don't know.

339
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,360
I was thinking I could pay 'em.
You know, just to keep them off my back.

340
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,113
- You want me to give you money?
- No, no. Just borrow.

341
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,157
How much?

342
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,233
- It's about 20 grand on the street.
- I don't have that kind of money, Kyle.

343
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,360
- Doesn't your Dad keep some cash around?
- Not that much!

344
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,590
Linda, listen to me!

345
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,638
These guys, they will kill me
if I don't give them something.

346
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,992
- Please. Please, anything will help right now.
- Now you want me to get involved in this?

347
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,438
Just... just let me borrow something.
Anything.

348
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,553
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

349
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,309
- Where are you?
- At the mall.

350
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,828
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Thank you.

351
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,960
(Gael) CTU knows the powder's not real.
They're after Singer.

352
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,951
- What do you want me to do?
- Stay with him.

353
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,352
As soon as he's alone,
grab him and take him to containment.

354
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,512
We can't let the cops get him.
We need Singer to make this work.

355
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,357
(Hector) Don't lose the boy.

356
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,079
Follow him and do what you have to.
I want nothing to happen.

357
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,160
- There's no way we'll ever release Salazar.
- (man) What are the alternatives?

358
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,755
- CTU's very close to containing the threat.
- So, we should hold on?

359
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,228
Yes, that's right.

360
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,593
All right, Stan, I'll make sure
you're kept in the loop.

361
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,752
- What is it, Wayne?
- I just spoke to Anne's ex-husband.

362
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,672
Now, listen. All Ted Packard wants is money.

363
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,960
- If we pay him, he'll recant before the debate.
- That's blackmail.

364
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,996
- That's business.
- I don't think so.

365
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,150
It's cheaper than trying to defend against
this allegation, which is going to hurt you.

366
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,276
I've faced down worse lies.

367
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,552
I think I've earned some credibility.

368
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,358
You read the polls this morning?

369
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,790
Because Keeler is closing the gap

370
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,111
and this race is much closer than it should be.

371
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,756
Now, listen, I know it's distasteful, David,
but in cost-benefit terms it's a no-brainer.

372
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,190
- Anne won't think so.
- Anne doesn't have to know.

373
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,352
I can't keep it from her.

374
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,114
Well, that's your choice.
But if this comes out

375
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,678
Anne will be on the front page
of every newspaper in this country.

376
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,760
She's not Sherry.
She's not equipped to handle that scrutiny.

377
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,320
And you will not be able to protect her from it.

378
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,437
(feedback from microphone)

379
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,312
Between this debate and the threat of
this outbreak, you have enough on your plate.

380
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,069
Don't be a martyr. Keep it simple.

381
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,310
We could have the money within the hour.

382
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,793
Do it.

383
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,960
What's going on?
They don't have their suits on. Are we OK?

384
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,076
- Yes. The powder was harmless.
- Thank God!

385
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,360
This was for nothing?
You scared the hell out of us.

386
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,160
Mr Singer, we still need to find your son.

387
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,360
- Is there anything you can tell us to help?
- Why? You said it was harmless.

388
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,512
We believe your son was infected with
the virus in Mexico before he came home.

389
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,160
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

390
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,072
What are you saying?
That our son could die?

391
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,033
- Yes, that could happen.
- Oh, God.

392
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,352
Look, I know how difficult
this must be for you and I'm sorry.

393
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,636
But we need to find your son.
We need to find him now.

394
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,560
- Uh. Have you tried his cellphone?
- The line's been disconnected.

395
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,155
Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

396
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,469
- He took my phone.
- What's the number?

397
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,472
818-555-0103.

398
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,949
OK. I'm gonna need one of you to call him.

399
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,070
This is my fault. Kyle never would've done
this if I could take care of my own family.

400
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,071
- No!
- Yes. You know it's true.

401
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,160
Tony, it's Jack.

402
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,391
Jack, I just spoke to LAPD.
They got a priority APB out on Singer.

403
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,751
Good. I think we've got a number on him.

404
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,118
All right. We'll thread the line
through a tracing matrix.

405
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,160
The number's 818-555-0103. I want you
to route the call back through my cellphone.

406
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,314
I need you to trace that number
and reroute the call through Jack's cellphone.

407
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,960
I'm going to need one of you
to make the call now.

408
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,876
I need you to keep him on the line
as long as possible so we can trace him.

409
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,879
What am I supposed to tell him?

410
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,230
The truth.

411
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,358
- Tony, you set?
- Yeah, we're ready.

412
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,676
(phone rings)

413
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,875
- Linda?
- Kyle, it's your father.

414
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,397
- Dad?
- We need to talk.

415
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,311
Look, I don't know what you want to talk
about. I already know how pissed off you are.

416
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,270
Whatever you did, I know you were just
trying to help out your mom and me.

417
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Well, unless you give back the stuff,
I gotta deal with the situation, OK?

418
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,075
Kyle, please, don't hang up. Please!

419
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,039
Just listen to me.
What I'm telling you is important.

420
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,194
- Please. You have to come home.
- Dad, why do you sound different?

421
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
I need you to trust me
on something I'm about to tell you.

422
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,194
- Dad?
- You may have gotten a virus.

423
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Something you picked up in Mexico.

424
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,560
- What? How did you know I went to Mexico?
- It doesn't matter. But you may be sick.

425
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,996
And if you are then you need
to get checked out by a doctor.

426
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Dad, I don't know what
you're talking about. I feel fine.

427
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,709
(voice cracking)
I know it sounds crazy, but it's real.

428
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,991
- There's some people here trying to help.
- Cops?

429
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,272
- Tony, have you got a lock on this trace?
- How much longer?

430
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,560
- I got a cell tower but it covers three miles.
- I can't believe this.

431
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,076
One minute you tell me that you love me and
the next you're selling me out to some cops.

432
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,196
They're not the police. They're just trying to
stop this virus before it becomes an outbreak.

433
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,160
Dad, I already told you, I feel fine.

434
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,154
They say you won't start feeling sick for
another few hours, but by then it'll be too late.

435
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,360
- Got a lock yet?
- How much longer?

436
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,238
- Ten seconds.
- What d'you want me to do? Turn myself in?

437
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,160
Because you may be sick. And if you are,
other people are going to get infected.

438
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,876
Tony!

439
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Got it. He's at Los Feliz Mall,
between Vermont and Sunset.

440
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,511
Get his photo to mall security.
Tell them not to approach him.

441
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,560
Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car.
I can land a team there in ten minutes.

442
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,472
Fine. Tony, I don't want you taking Chase.

443
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,596
- Why not?
- I just don't.

444
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,436
Thank you very much. We'll notify you
when we have him in custody.

445
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
Please, help our son.

446
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,596
We will.

447
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,676
(phone rings)

448
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,873
- O'Brian.
- (Michelle) Chloe, Tony's off site for a while.

449
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,560
- He is?
- Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours.

450
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,357
- OK.
- Let people in your area know.

451
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,760
- OK, I will.
- Thanks.

452
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,875
What was that?

453
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,272
- Michelle's taking over for a couple of hours.
- Where's Tony?

454
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,752
We've located Singer.
Jack can't get there so Tony's going.

455
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,876
What? Tony's not field ops.

456
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,160
They're really going out of their way
to cut you out of the loop.

457
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,038
Did you do something to piss off Jack?

458
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,113
Bad idea, Chase.
You're just gonna make things worse.

459
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,760
- Tony. I heard they found Kyle. Is it for real?
- We'll see. I'm meeting Jack there now.

460
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,960
OK, I'm done with Parker. He's said all
he's gonna say. I want back on the case.

461
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,235
We're handling that, Chase, all right?

462
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,557
Jack doesn't want me there.
Did he say why he's cutting me out?

463
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,599
He's your boss, it's his call.

464
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,435
This isn't right.
Did he tell you it's because of Kim?

465
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,160
He found out we're seeing each other
and this is how he's making me pay.

466
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,355
Take it up with Jack.

467
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,071
(sirens)

468
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,356
(dials phone)

469
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,638
(phone rings)

470
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,200
Just want to keep the line open for Tony.

471
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,316
- Leave a message for Jack Bauer.
- Dammit, Jack!

472
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,718
Chase. Chase!

473
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,108
I know my Dad can be hard,
but he'll come around.

474
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,040
- How do you know?
- Because I know my father.

475
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,032
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

476
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,319
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. It's OK. Forget it, Kim.

477
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,676
Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
Because I do.

478
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,198
- We shouldn't have told him.
- Well, the only other option

479
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,076
is for us to stop seeing each other, which,
as far as I'm concerned, is not an option.

480
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,912
Or is it?

481
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,440
- Chase, what do you want?
- To be able to do my job.

482
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,955
Kim. We need you at your station.
Tony's about to land.

483
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,439
Tony Almeida, CTU.

484
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,752
We've found the guy you're looking for.
He's in the rotunda.

485
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,357
Bronson, watch down the east entrance.
Pearson, I want you in the security office.

486
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,996
(sirens)

487
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,593
- How long have you been using, Jack?
- What?

488
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,878
I did a rotation in rehab, you learn
to pick it up when someone's using.

489
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,670
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

490
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,796
How long?

491
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,432
For a while now.

492
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,709
It was the only way I could maintain
my cover with the Salazars.

493
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,433
- Are you high now?
- No!

494
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,869
- It's empty.
- Nicole, I told you, I'm fine.

495
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,269
- I'm not so sure.
- Then turn me in!

496
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,909
I don't want to turn you in, Jack.
I'm worried about you.

497
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,313
You don't have to be. I've kicked it.

498
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,513
I have a responsibility to stop this virus

499
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,993
and I am taking a calculated risk
that you are more of an asset than a liability.

500
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,476
Just please don't screw this up.

501
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,960
I won't.

502
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
(phone rings)

503
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,595
Yeah?

504
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,991
- We found Singer. We're gonna pick him up.
- OK, where are you?

505
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,760
Second floor rotunda,
top of the north escalator. You?

506
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,832
Unloading dock, north entrance. Got a visual?

507
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah.

508
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,679
- Where are your men?
- Posted on the main entrances.

509
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,315
- Good. We'll be there in a minute.
- All right.

510
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,029
Have your men cover
all the parking-level exits. Let's go!

511
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,553
I don't want to cause any kind of commotion.

512
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,629
- CTU's about to move in on the kid.
- Stand down, it's too hot.

513
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,032
- It's my only chance. He can't get caught.
- No, no. Wait!

514
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,917
- I can't wait.
- Gomez!

515
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,117
- Wait here. We want to make a clean grab.
- Yes, sir.

516
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,034
- Kyle?
- Who are you?

517
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,920
My name's Tony Almeida.
I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you.

518
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,920
What your father told you
about your being sick is true.

519
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,549
- I don't believe you.
- Come with me, I'll prove it to you.

520
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,111
- (shot)
- (screams)

521
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,388
Get out of the way! Move!

522
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Nicole, he's been hit in the neck!

523
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Jimmy, give me your walkie-talkie.
We have an officer down.

524
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,710
Singer is not in custody.
I repeat, Singer is not in custody.

525
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,514
Maintain cover on all exits.

526
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,954
