3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,307
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:20,394
In the meantime, I'm going to need
a provisional chief of staff.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,201
I would like that to be you.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,190
Larry Moss's calling for you.

7
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,276
<i>Ma'am, we have evidence
Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala</i>

8
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,695
<i>as a base to manufacture
biological weapons.</i>

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,572
These weapons are on US soil?

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,824
We suspect they're
at the Starkwood HQ in Virginia.

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,633
And you're not suggesting that Starkwood
intends to use those weapons

12
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,871
- to attack this country?
<i>- Given their actions today,</i>

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,956
we need to move on Starkwood
immediately.

14
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,623
They're coming and they'll be coming
with everything they've got

15
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:47,463
and the only thing
that's going to stop them

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,590
is getting these weapons
ready to deploy.

17
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:52,176
Tell me what the FBI knows.

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,090
I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges.

19
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,516
Get him out of here
and do what you have to do.

20
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,053
I'm not spending the rest of my life
in prison

21
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:04,855
because Jonas Hodges
has lost his mind.

22
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,649
- You know where they are?
- Yes.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,255
Where's Jack?

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,113
He managed to secure the weapons,
but Starkwood got them back.

25
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:13,739
Jack was exposed.

26
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,059
There has to be something
you can do to help him.

27
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:17,243
There's no cure.

28
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:21,176
We got a location on the weapon. We're
ready to stage a raid on the compound.

29
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,341
I want to go.

30
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,955
- I'm sorry. I can't allow it.
- I've seen the canisters.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,421
- I know exactly what we're looking for.
- But you're sick.

32
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,753
We have no idea

33
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:31,924
- when you'll start showing symptoms.
- You're right.

34
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:38,889
Where are the damn weapons?

35
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,851
He played me.

36
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,353
Little old Seaton
bought us some time.

37
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,481
We're going to do a point by point
search of this entire compound.

38
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:56,574
There are bioweapons on this facility.
We're not going anywhere without them.

39
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,577
You try to advance any farther,
you will be fired upon.

40
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:15,050
I count three platoons at least.

41
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:18,387
- Everything mil-spec.
- Yeah. They were waiting for us.

42
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,735
This was one big trap.

43
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,684
Renee, we would really use
those satellite overheads.

44
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:25,180
Copy, Larry.

45
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:27,897
- What have we got?
- Nothing. The subnet's been crashing.

46
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,484
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Here we go.
I've got sat five retasking now...

47
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,992
Somebody talk to me.
What are you seeing?

48
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,770
You've got hostiles on all sides.

49
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,695
Damn it. Find me an opening.

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,851
I'm looking,
but there's no way through.

51
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:42,244
Okay, heads up.
Is everybody seeing this?

52
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,966
- Larry?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:46,874
Yeah. We're seeing it.

54
00:02:58,502 --> 00:02:59,650
It's Hodges.

55
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,889
The men are at the ready, sir.

56
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,978
- I appreciate your presence.
- Where else would I be?

57
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:12,069
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

58
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,901
Agent Moss.

59
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,946
You need to move your men
and allow us to proceed.

60
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,697
I want you off our property

61
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,170
and I want you to release my man.

62
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,910
You have no right
to take him hostage.

63
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,788
I have an order
from the President of the United States.

64
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,683
To search this building.

65
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,406
For weapons that do not exist.

66
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,906
Have you looked?

67
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:38,175
Are there weapons of mass destruction?
Are there weapons of any kind?

68
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,885
Is there anything in here at all?

69
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:48,963
Agent Moss,

70
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,647
who dreamed up this charade?

71
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,943
Give me a name.
Let's get to the bottom of this.

72
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,756
You want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges?

73
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:01,657
Get these guns off my head.

74
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:04,327
You think you have a gun
at your head?

75
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:07,829
You know what I've got?
I've got the United States government

76
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,221
sending SWAT teams and attack
helicopters in the middle of the night.

77
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:15,350
I've got a government
that I served faithfully for 30 years

78
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,517
dreaming up BS accusations
so politicians

79
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,646
too cowardly to show their faces
can dismantle my company.

80
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,514
That's what I've got.

81
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:31,687
You've got five minutes

82
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,690
to get these helicopters
flying out of here

83
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,859
with all of you on board.

84
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,620
- You don't want to do this.
- Five minutes.

85
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,250
And I want my man back.

86
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,224
- Renee, you get that?
- Yeah, we did.

87
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,169
- What options do we have?
- In five minutes?

88
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,255
There's no time to bring in TAC support,
so give me something else.

89
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:02,167
All right, Larry, give me a second.
Stand by.

90
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:03,958
That's it.

91
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:09,594
- I want to show you something.
- Hodges just gave us 5 min to leave.

92
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,696
We lost that situation,
but I think I found us a new way in.

93
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,730
Look. These are
Senator Mayer's files.

94
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,633
This is Douglas Knowles.
He's the chairman of Starkwood.

95
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,094
He was actually helping the senator
with the investigation.

96
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,613
He is the one who brokered the deal
to open the company's books.

97
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,407
- Another insider? We just get burned.
- Just listen.

98
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,601
Knowles was loyal to Hodges
for almost 20 years

99
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,283
and now he's secretly helping
the senator take down Starkwood?

100
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:33,248
He's scared of something.
This man wants to help us.

101
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,708
It's worth a shot.

102
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,018
Yeah. Make the call.

103
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,471
- Knowles.
<i>- Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.</i>

104
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,264
I got your number
from Senator Mayer.

105
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,766
Senator Mayer is dead.

106
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,726
I know. I was with him
when he was killed

107
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,725
<i>by one of your employees.
A man named John Quinn.</i>

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,860
You have no idea how much I was hoping
someone would call.

109
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,039
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't understand.

110
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,168
Things are very out of control.

111
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,668
Are you aware
of what's happening on your base?

112
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,744
I'm watching it with my own eyes.

113
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,706
The FBI is pinned down.
They say they're looking for bioweapons.

114
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,649
Sir, Jonas Hodges is in possession
of a military-grade bioweapon.

115
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,087
A prion variant developed in Africa
with General Juma.

116
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,172
It's not where they think it is.

117
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,550
They're all standing
in front of an empty hangar.

118
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,718
The FBI was deliberately led
to the wrong location by Seaton,

119
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:29,930
but I promise you, sir,
the weapon is on your base.

120
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,615
I was contaminated
when trying to intercept the canisters.

121
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,203
They were ferried back to Starkwood
approximately 90 minutes ago.

122
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,106
90 minutes ago Jonas was handing down
his new strategy to the board.

123
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,492
Stonewall the government,
no cooperation whatsoever.

124
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,737
I can't believe this is happening.

125
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,363
Sir, this is happening

126
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,367
and the weapons are on your base.
Do you have an idea where they might be?

127
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,661
I think I might.

128
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:55,539
I want to put you in touch
with one of my men in the field.

129
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>- Can I call you right back?</i>
- Yes.

130
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,953
Thank you.
Go.

131
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,246
Some of the men were unhappy
drawing down on federal agents.

132
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,954
It's understandable.

133
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,343
I had hoped not to include
the rank and file.

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,471
You can count on them.

135
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:13,682
Let's show our guests the door.

136
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,227
Let's move!

137
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,628
Into position.

138
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,781
Jack, I'm on comm.

139
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,242
- You're on with me and Agent Walker.
- Hodges and his men have repositioned.

140
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,180
Okay, we're going to have
to move fast.

141
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,747
Larry, I want you and your men
to pull out on Hodges' timetable.

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,585
Tony, find a way to stay behind.

143
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,671
We're going to get your vectors over
to a man we contacted inside Starkwood.

144
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,546
His name is Douglas Knowles. He believes
he knows where the weapons are.

145
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,675
Isn't this how we got into this mess?
Almeida and some friendly contact?

146
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,268
He's chairman of the board,

147
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,970
but he was cooperating with Mayer's
investigation of the company.

148
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:54,348
He is all that we've got.

149
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,694
All right, I got 400 eyeballs
trained on me right now.

150
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,896
How are we supposed
to get Almeida to stay behind?

151
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,732
I need you and your men to create
a diversion to cover Tony's escape.

152
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,620
Look, we need to make this work.

153
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:09,196
If you all get on those helicopters,
we will lose this weapon for good.

154
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,040
<i>Larry, are you on board with this?</i>

155
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,133
- We got to go.
- We need to know, are you on board?

156
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:22,702
I'll do what I can.

157
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:27,581
Take his bag.

158
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,557
All right, let's go.
We're standing down.

159
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,768
- You're coming with me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

160
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,710
- This wasn't part of the deal.
- What deal?

161
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:37,439
As far as I could tell, he couldn't care
about you one way or the other.

162
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,936
You take these handcuffs off of me
or it's going to get really ugly.

163
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,109
Soldier!

164
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,574
Get the hell out of here, Moss.

165
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,532
You don't want to test us.

166
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:58,495
Let's go!

167
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,037
Don't move. No!

168
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,206
Doug Knowles.
Jack Bauer sent me. Come on.

169
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:56,261
That street's solid security cameras.
I'll take you to a restricted area

170
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,679
on the east perimeter.

171
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,617
There's a good chance
the weapons are there.

172
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:03,101
The place is crawling.
I don't know how we're going to make it.

173
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,770
I'll take care of that.

174
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,064
<i>Jack, I'm with Knowles.</i>

175
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:11,147
<i>I'm going to need satellite support
on the east perimeter.</i>

176
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,446
<i>Jack, I need support.
Do you copy?</i>

177
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:18,561
<i>- Renee? Anybody...</i>
- Copy, Tony.

178
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:20,560
Come on, let's go.

179
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:24,164
I've got you just off the landing pad.
No hostiles in your immediate vicinity.

180
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,333
<i>- Proceed at your own discretion.</i>
- Copy that.

181
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,139
- Which way?
- Come on.

182
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,968
You all right?

183
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,011
Yeah, I'm fine.

184
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,259
Tony and Knowles have connected.
It's time to update the White House.

185
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:44,268
Okay, good.
I'll be right there.

186
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,586
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

187
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,081
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

188
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:12,170
Mr. Bauer, tell me
you have the bioweapon.

189
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,209
I'm afraid that's not the case.

190
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,384
Our search was stopped by armed
mercenaries on Starkwood's base.

191
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:21,493
Agent Moss and his men had to withdraw
from a firefight they would have lost.

192
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:24,683
Are you saying Hodges men
were ready to fire on federal agents?

193
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,226
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

194
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,562
My God!
Who does he think he is?

195
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,692
Despite the setback, I am confident
the weapons are still there.

196
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,749
I reached out
to Starkwood's chairman.

197
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:38,035
He's willing to cooperate.
He's with Tony Almeida now.

198
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,576
They are moving towards a secure area
where we believe the weapons are.

199
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,701
Very good.

200
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,857
- Tim, what's our troop status?
- Mobilizing.

201
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:47,456
The Secretary of Defense says
they're still several hours out.

202
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,375
At which point we have a war
on our hands against 1,500 mercenaries

203
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,044
armed with bioweapons.

204
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,742
Madam President, I do believe
that a surgical air strike will work

205
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,445
as long as we can pinpoint
the exact location of the weapon.

206
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,843
- And you can do that?
- Yes, I believe we can.

207
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:03,055
Mr. Bauer, you've seen the canisters
containing the bioweapons,

208
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,515
- you know what they look like, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

209
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,010
Then we'll need you
to verify the canisters

210
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:10,062
once Almeida has located them.

211
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,642
No more mistakes.

212
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,608
We're gonna need visual confirmation
from you, Bauer, eyes on.

213
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,611
Jack, we have got
to get this part right.

214
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,196
I understand. Anything else?

215
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,533
Jack, I have been told
that you were exposed to the pathogen.

216
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,701
How you doing?

217
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:32,820
Right now I'm fine, Madam President.
Thank you for asking.

218
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,795
Thank you for your service.

219
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:36,671
I'm not giving up on you.

220
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,091
<i>- Keep me informed.</i>
- Yes, ma'am.

221
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Let's go.

222
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,938
I don't have a lot of time.
What's going on?

223
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,274
That's what I've been trying to ask you.
I called 3 times.

224
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,403
It's kind of crazy here right now.
Unless it's urgent, I call you back.

225
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,489
I'm hearing rumors that the Joint Chiefs
have been called in.

226
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,956
It's not a big deal.

227
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,577
They're doing a final assessment
before lowering the alert level.

228
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,954
Olivia, don't do this.

229
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,408
- What? I'm telling you the truth.
- Really?

230
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,980
Because I've got a source
in the Port Authority container yard

231
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:18,683
who's using terms
like "weapons of mass destruction,"

232
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:22,272
so naturally I'm wondering if that's why
the Joint Chiefs are having a meeting.

233
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,500
Look, I can't talk about it.

234
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,680
It's obviously a question
of national security.

235
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,807
You have my word
I'll tell you soon as I can.

236
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,225
I want to know now.

237
00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:34,265
I just gave you a big story, Ken.

238
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,690
You'll have to wait.
I gotta go.

239
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,996
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

240
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,486
That'd be a big mistake.

241
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,395
What's that supposed to mean?

242
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,404
You want me to say it,
fine, I'll say it.

243
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,974
Think how your mother would feel
when she hears that you forced out

244
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:52,122
her chief of staff
to take over his position.

245
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,334
He was incompetent.

246
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,920
Yeah, well, it won't play that way
on the morning news.

247
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:00,861
So, talk to me.

248
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,333
Now.

249
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,470
I can't talk here.

250
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,264
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental,
room 1271.

251
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,255
You've got half an hour.

252
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:23,468
Agent Pierce, please get a car ready.
I have to make a quick run.

253
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,828
All right, Jack, we're here.

254
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,789
Knowles says there's been more activity
in this area for several days now.

255
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,416
I'm looking at about 6 buildings.

256
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,777
- Could be any one of them.
- Copy that, Tony.

257
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,545
Hold on, we're getting
infrared up now.

258
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,590
I'm counting seven buildings
in your immediate vicinity.

259
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,755
The building directly southeast
of your current position

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,775
is showing no infrared signal.

261
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,368
I'm guessing they're using
a blackout shield.

262
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,115
All right, we'll try there first.

263
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,229
- You see any patrols coming our way?
- Negative, you're clear.

264
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,147
Okay, let's go.

265
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,456
Jack, Knowles' key card
isn't working.

266
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,735
We're gonna need
electronic support here.

267
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,368
There should be an R-6 interface module
on the back of your comm device.

268
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,506
- It's a card key.
- Yeah, I know what that is.

269
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:28,468
I'm plugging in now.

270
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,556
Okay, we're up.

271
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,067
Cormac Z series.

272
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:38,196
We're looking at a five digit key
protected by an AES block cipher.

273
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,640
Running combinations.

274
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:46,152
You've got a vehicle coming your way.
It's east of you about a hundred yards.

275
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,909
Take cover down there.

276
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,506
- How much longer?
- How much more time do you need?

277
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,495
I have 2 out of 5 digits.

278
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,706
We're pretty exposed here.

279
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,486
It's all right, I'm fine.

280
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,017
Come on.

281
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,561
Two more numbers, Tony.

282
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,653
- What are we gonna do?
- We still got two digits to go.

283
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,327
Turn around.
Move in for a closer look.

284
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,364
- We're not going to make it.
- Sit tight.

285
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,700
Doug, where you... Doug!

286
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:49,883
Hold your position.

287
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:51,926
May I see some ID?

288
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,566
Doug Knowles.

289
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:58,992
Dammit.

290
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,770
<i>One to go.</i>

291
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,662
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

292
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,486
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base cleared
of all nonessential personnel.

293
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,655
Nonessential personnel?

294
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,338
I'm chairman of the board.

295
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:16,785
I realize that, but we're dealing with
a heightened security situation here.

296
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,454
So, I need to know
what you were doing in this area.

297
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,500
Jonas called a late night board meeting,
that's what I'm doing here.

298
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:26,878
That meeting ended
nearly two hours ago.

299
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,476
We got it. We're in.

300
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,965
I don't have to explain myself
to you, you know.

301
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,885
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.

302
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,472
- I don't believe you're hearing me.
- No, I don't you're hearing me!

303
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,614
I built this company!
And I don't need you telling me

304
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:46,047
where I can and cannot walk!
Understood?

305
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,068
You're gonna have to come with me, sir.
Right this way.

306
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,117
I'm in.
But they got Knowles.

307
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,703
- Do you think he's gonna say anything?
- I don't know.

308
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,206
But I better get in and out as fast
as possible just in case he does.

309
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,497
Okay, Tony, the president needs
a visual on the weapons

310
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,711
before she'll launch an attack.
She needs your eyes

311
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,552
on the canisters
and a confirmation by Jack.

312
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:11,677
Copy that.

313
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,093
- I'm moving.
- Good.

314
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:20,473
Stay here, I'll be right back.

315
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,277
Get me the medic!

316
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:44,727
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:48,419
We just found Mr. Knowles alone
just outside the restricted zone.

318
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,337
Did he have an explanation?

319
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,423
Yes, sir, he said he was walking.

320
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,173
Walking.

321
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,343
Should I take him to Stokes
for interrogation, sir?

322
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:02,270
You're suggesting what, soldier,
that we strap him down,

323
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:04,434
extract a confession,
because he was walking?

324
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,603
He's the chairman of the board.

325
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:08,855
I was just requesting

326
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,310
<i>instructions, sir.
What you'd like done.</i>

327
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:14,131
I'd like you to take him
to his office.

328
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,804
Make sure he's comfortable.

329
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,114
And stay with him until I arrive.

330
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,333
Yes, sir.

331
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,648
Will that be all?

332
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,243
Call zone 9,

333
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,002
have them double down security.
Let's make sure that...

334
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,707
- Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

335
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,127
How much longer?

336
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,932
Half an hour.

337
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,392
Good.

338
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,392
I'll need to know
the minute it's done.

339
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:50,522
Yes, sir.

340
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,561
Aaron, I'd like you
to wait in the hall, if that's okay.

341
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:00,701
Ms. Taylor,

342
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,368
you tasked me
with handling your security.

343
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,537
I can't allow you
to enter a hotel room

344
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,948
I haven't vetted.

345
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:11,087
Aaron,

346
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:13,086
I appreciate the concern.

347
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,338
But you can see the door from here,

348
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,256
I have you on speed-dial,

349
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,260
and I can scream very loudly
when the occasion demands.

350
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,429
I just need two minutes
to wrangle a reporter.

351
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:25,151
Really, I'll be fine.

352
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,226
All right,
I'll be here if you need me.

353
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,401
Want a drink?

354
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,129
No.

355
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:52,569
I assume you don't mind if I do.

356
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:53,994
It's been a day.

357
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:58,942
I gotta tell you.

358
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:00,884
I don't like being threatened.

359
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,510
It was unfortunate.
I apologize.

360
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,876
We've known each other
a long time, Ken.

361
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,290
- I thought we had an understanding.
- We do.

362
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,227
And I want to keep it that way.

363
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,522
We both do.
Am I right?

364
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,194
Okay, so, I told you,
I have this source.

365
00:21:20,684 --> 00:21:23,145
Cop out at the Port Authority
container yard.

366
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,399
He told me he saw
these professional assassin types

367
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,912
get into an intense firefight out there
a couple hours ago.

368
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,875
According to him, someone hijacked
a WMD out to God knows where.

369
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,698
- That's true.
- Yeah.

370
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,838
I want to know all about it.

371
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:46,381
Look, if you think
all you've got to do is nod your head

372
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,765
confirming what I already know,
then we've got a problem.

373
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,435
It's national security, Ken.
I can't tell you.

374
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,053
I'm saying you can.

375
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,523
If this story breaks,
it would create a panic.

376
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,214
People would be hurt.

377
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,070
If you knew, you'd understand
why it's got to stay a secret.

378
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,431
Right, exactly.
I'd understand.

379
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:06,573
Have a little faith, okay?

380
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:10,803
All right.

381
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,873
There is a bioweapon
in the container yard.

382
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,824
That's what they were fighting over.

383
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,169
It was developed
by Starkwood in Africa.

384
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,296
- Starkwood?
- Right.

385
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,352
They moved it to their base
about 30 miles from here.

386
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:28,012
So it's there right now.

387
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:35,269
So this is what the Joint Chiefs
are discussing, what to do about that.

388
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,055
Olivia...

389
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,605
The president...

390
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,955
ordered an air strike

391
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:53,913
as soon as the exact location
of the canisters was known.

392
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:58,918
So you see
why you can't run with this?

393
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,348
Really, Ken...

394
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:02,496
you can't.

395
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:06,337
A lot of lives are at stake.
The entire plan depends on surprise.

396
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:07,834
You get that, right?

397
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:15,959
Maybe you're right.

398
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:18,581
Maybe I need to kill this story.

399
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,510
Thank you.

400
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:23,924
What I mean is...

401
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,738
maybe somebody could convince me.

402
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,118
What are you saying?

403
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,604
You know what I'm saying.

404
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,250
You're very beautiful
when you get all patriotic.

405
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,587
That's over.

406
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:40,250
- We agreed.
- You agreed.

407
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,458
Really,

408
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,713
I don't want to do this.

409
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,544
Then say no.

410
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,730
This is pandopamine
which should control the shaking.

411
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:11,074
Here, apply pressure.

412
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:15,076
You can give yourself an injection
once every two hours.

413
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,356
More if need.

414
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:19,207
- You think I'll need more?
- In all likelihood, yes.

415
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:22,502
The onset of symptoms
so soon after exposure suggests

416
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,579
the bioagent is more virulent
than we thought.

417
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,702
All we're doing here
is just masking the symptoms.

418
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:29,977
I understand.

419
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,343
There's something
you may want to consider.

420
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:33,534
What's that?

421
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,540
Bryden University has been funding
some studies on prion diseases.

422
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:40,379
The work is purely experimental at this
point, but it does suggest treatment.

423
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:43,231
- That's good news.
- I don't want to get anyone's hopes.

424
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,246
We're talking a slight chance.

425
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:48,797
A possible treatment using stem cells
from a genetically compatible donor.

426
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,899
An immediate family member
would make the best donor candidate.

427
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,965
I saw your file.
It says you have a daughter, right?

428
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,112
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

429
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,079
- Jack, if there's a chance.
- Mr. Bauer...

430
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,545
Doctor, thank you
for everything you've done.

431
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,869
Excuse me.
I need to get back to work.

432
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,880
- It's none of your business.
- It's my business

433
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:15,078
when you're having
a seizure in the middle of the FBI.

434
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:17,450
You heard the doctor.
The medication will mask the symptoms.

435
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:18,933
Why won't you talk about this?

436
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:21,042
- Talk about what?
- The experimental procedure.

437
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,603
There's nothing to talk about.

438
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,150
She's your daughter,

439
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,440
- and you're not gonna let her know?
- That's right.

440
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,651
So you're not gonna try?

441
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:32,756
I know you're trying to help, but you
don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,950
My daughter and I,
we don't talk, okay?

443
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,451
So, please, let it go.

444
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:42,957
It should be her choice.

445
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,086
Well, it's not.

446
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,292
I'm the one who's dying.

447
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,663
It's my choice.

448
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:57,373
No sign of the target yet,
but Tony's working on it.

449
00:25:57,498 --> 00:25:58,798
You look better.

450
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,033
Thanks.

451
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,353
- Tony, can you hear me?
- Jack, you okay?

452
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:05,908
Yeah, I'm fine.

453
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,003
Tony, we're seeing new activity outside
the building. 2 vehicles, 8 hostiles.

454
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,945
- Looks like a security detail.
- You think Knowles gave him up?

455
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,948
Tony, they're moving
for your point of entry.

456
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,025
<i>- Eight hostiles and closing.</i>
- Yeah, I hear them.

457
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,000
- You want to regroup?
- No.

458
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:28,020
I want to get this over with.

459
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,239
We're clear.

460
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:49,971
Two three, we're clear.

461
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:14,438
I haven't seen you here before.

462
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,445
They sent 8 of us over here, sir.

463
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:19,113
Why, is something wrong?

464
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,758
No, sir.
Just, you know, precautions.

465
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,994
Right.
Can't be paranoid enough.

466
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:35,338
I'm in the building.

467
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,881
Copy, we're with you.

468
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:41,260
Tony, it's Jack.
I've got you at 125 feet MSL,

469
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,262
40 feet underground.
Is that correct?

470
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,495
That's right.
I'm four floors down.

471
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,975
We've got no information on any kind
of subterranean floors for the building.

472
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,603
Believe me, they're here.

473
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,278
Epoxy-hardened walls,

474
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,023
poured concrete ceilings.

475
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,454
I have a visual on the weapon.

476
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,277
Sending images for verification now.

477
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,210
Copy that.

478
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,669
Okay, those are the canisters.

479
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:31,749
I'll notify Admiral Smith
the target is located and confirmed.

480
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:33,104
Those are the canisters.

481
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:39,273
It looks like they're transferring
the pathogens from the canisters

482
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:41,121
into some sort of delivery system.

483
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,462
- It's on the move.
- Copy that. It doesn't matter.

484
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:47,181
Renee's phoning in the coordinates.
Everything's gonna be dust in 10min.

485
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:48,491
Get out of there now.

486
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:50,316
Copy that.
Withdrawing.

487
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,630
Okay, men.

488
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:14,854
You want to explain this?

489
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:18,983
I'm arrested by our own security force.
Held captive

490
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,082
in my own office like a prisoner.

491
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:23,821
They won't allow me a phone call,
even to you,

492
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,390
to find out
what the hell is going on!

493
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:29,827
That's a lot of complaints, Doug.

494
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,411
You done?

495
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,373
You were supposed to be home
hours ago.

496
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:38,646
- Why'd they find you snooping around?
- I saw the FBI raid.

497
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:40,963
They say we have bioweapons.

498
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,093
Which they did not find.

499
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,093
That's not the point.

500
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:49,218
Is it true?

501
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,975
Remember when I first
brought you out here

502
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,728
20 years ago?
There was nothing here.

503
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,406
Nothing.

504
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,565
And out of the damn mud,

505
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,708
we built this place,

506
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,404
the largest private army
in the hemisphere, maybe the world,

507
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:09,197
and we pulled America's ass
out of the fire

508
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,577
again and again and again.

509
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,329
Answer the question!

510
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:15,805
I am.

511
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,784
Every day, we've done things that the
government could not or would not do.

512
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:25,655
"Get this done," that's what they said,
"Here's your mission."

513
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,052
Nobody asked
how anything was gonna be done.

514
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,991
Nobody wanted to know.

515
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:34,702
All anyone wanted was results,
and we delivered.

516
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:38,855
- No one's questioning that.
- No one's questioning that?

517
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,523
You're not insane, are you?

518
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:43,817
The senate, the committees,
the president.

519
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:47,136
Every chattering nonentity
in Washington is out there

520
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,955
with their
standard operating procedures saying,

521
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,530
"How was this done?
How was that done?"

522
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:57,231
Tearing at us, trying to bring us down,
every one of them.

523
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,831
I kept this country strong.
I kept it safe.

524
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,705
And I will not be persecuted
for that.

525
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:10,302
You cannot start a war against
the people you're supposed to protect.

526
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:15,933
We were at war, Doug,
the moment they decided to dismantle us.

527
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:18,174
And as for particular weapons,

528
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,313
as for your question,
let me rephrase it.

529
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,819
Are we prepared to defend ourselves?

530
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:26,394
We are.

531
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:29,143
Jonas...

532
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:34,368
you can't take on
the federal government.

533
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:37,001
Yeah, well,

534
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:39,915
You never were one for thinking big.

535
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,835
20 years

536
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,016
I treated you like a son. 20 years.

537
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,092
A little loyalty...

538
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,418
wasn't that the least I deserved?

539
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:45,105
Yes.

540
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,734
Sir, we just got an alert
from one of our radar intercepts.

541
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,070
There's a squadron of F-18's

542
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,688
<i>heading our way
out of Virginia Beach.</i>

543
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,918
- <i>Sir?</i>
- What's the ETA?

544
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,279
- Less than ten minutes.
- What's our readiness?

545
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:01,404
How many?

546
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,256
We have three loaded.

547
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,251
Place the call to the president.

548
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,467
I'll be there momentarily.

549
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,980
You probably think
I'm the scum of the earth right now.

550
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,278
All I care about is that
you don't run the Starkwood story.

551
00:34:33,851 --> 00:34:35,351
You're a real sport.

552
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,741
Taking one for the team like this.

553
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:46,257
Look at me.

554
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,714
You won't run it, right?

555
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:56,427
I'm sorry, Livy.

556
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,247
What?

557
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:02,099
I have to run it.

558
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:05,602
Breaking something this big
will put me over the top in New York.

559
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:09,046
I'll make sure nobody knows
any of it came from you.

560
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:11,818
You lying son of a bitch.

561
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,745
Come on, please.

562
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:18,047
I'm did what I needed to do
to get ahead, just like you.

563
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:21,994
There's no comparison.
Running that story'll harm the country.

564
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,997
I've been in Washington
a lot longer than you.

565
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:27,783
You'll see, this is
how the game is played.

566
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,919
Actually, Ken,
this is how the game is played.

567
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:34,965
What do you mean?

568
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:54,485
You run that story,
or ever try to blackmail me again,

569
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,236
and I'll make sure everyone knows

570
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:58,583
just how you get your leads.

571
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:01,700
I think your wife
will be especially interested.

572
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:05,913
From everything you've told me,
that's gonna be one nasty divorce.

573
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:08,290
You bitch.

574
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:13,212
Find a new beat. I don't want to see you
around the White House again.

575
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,593
Sorry, I've got to take this.

576
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:34,775
- Where in the world are you?
- Sorry. I had a meeting on K Street.

577
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,445
- I had to deal with a reporter.
- Are the press on to this?

578
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,942
- Not anymore. I took care of it.
- I need you here, Livy.

579
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:44,743
We've had confirmation on the bioweapon,
and the air strike is happening now.

580
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,119
I'll be there in 5 mins.

581
00:36:58,882 --> 00:36:59,944
Where are we?

582
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,261
The F-18's have been loaded
with bunker-buster ordinance

583
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,257
and will be in range
in seven minutes.

584
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,809
What's the risk of the pathogen
spreading to the surrounding areas?

585
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,007
Minimal.

586
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:12,980
We're using white phosphorous charges,
which burn at 5,000 degrees.

587
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:17,025
- More than enough to incinerate it.
- And that's been confirmed by the CDC.

588
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:18,610
It has.

589
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,030
Weapons are ready?

590
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,444
Yes, sir.

591
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:32,958
The call to the president?

592
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,085
The call is in process.

593
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,172
It's an historic day, gentlemen.

594
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,300
A great day for Starkwood.

595
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,099
Too bad Mr. Knowles
can't be joining us.

596
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,010
<i>I have an ETAC with eyes on.</i>

597
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:10,542
<i>Weapons control status:
yellow tight.</i>

598
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,122
<i>Fighters entering the IP.</i>

599
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:13,832
<i>Engage airspace coordination area.</i>

600
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:16,361
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- Stand by.

601
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:18,420
Command and control is reporting

602
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:22,215
that a phased array radar system
is active inside the Starkwood compound.

603
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:24,598
Meaning what exactly?

604
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,386
They know we're coming.

605
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:30,599
Is there any evidence
of an antiaircraft artillery threat?

606
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,201
Intelligence is indicating
no such capability on the ground.

607
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:39,608
There's a phone call for you.
It's Jonas Hodges.

608
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:48,462
- Put him on speaker.
- He's requested a private conversation.

609
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:52,087
He says he's established
a proprietary line in the Ops Room.

610
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,100
A proprietary line?

611
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:58,335
- How did he manage that?
- I have no idea.

612
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:31,785
Let me begin by saying
that I am truly sorry it's come to this.

613
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:35,813
But I have to insist that you turn
your planes around immediately.

614
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:40,060
You're in no position
to issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

615
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,188
Well, maybe I am.

616
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,737
You remember several years ago,
Madam President,

617
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,676
Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan.

618
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,150
I remember it very well.
I fought that deployment.

619
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,425
And you lost.

620
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,899
You'll also recall that we requisitioned
a missile system at that time:

621
00:39:58,191 --> 00:39:59,341
Python Fives.

622
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:02,441
<i>Well, three of those missiles
are now loaded with the pathogen</i>

623
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:05,249
and aimed at cities
on our eastern seaboard.

624
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:13,224
- You're bluffing.
- As a sign of good faith,

625
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:16,649
I'm willing to show you that I'm...

626
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:18,374
that I'm not bluffing.

627
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,337
You see that?

628
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:26,386
Madam President?

629
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:39,144
You call this good faith?
You are waging war on your own country.

630
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:41,730
Well, of course,
I wouldn't see it that way.

631
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,749
What do you want?

632
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:48,236
Well, we can have that conversation
a little later on

633
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,095
<i>at the White House.</i>

634
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:54,085
You think we're going to just sit down
and discuss this?

635
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,286
<i>Yes I do, in the Oval Office,</i>

636
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,955
in confidence, within the hour.

637
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:03,411
<i>But in the meantime,
I think it is to both of our advantage</i>

638
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:07,717
that the American people do not know
the exact circumstance of this standoff.

639
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:12,469
<i>So you will keep this conversation
to yourself, and turn the planes around.</i>

640
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:15,197
And if you don't comply,
Madam President,

641
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,948
I will have no choice

642
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,643
but to launch those missiles.

643
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:27,364
And remember, I can detect any action
you take against our facility.

644
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:30,362
<i>You have 30 seconds.</i>

645
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,771
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith.

646
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,358
Just do as I say.

647
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:17,993
- Ma'am, with all respect...
- Abort the air strike immediately!

648
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:22,164
This is Admiral Smith. I have
an abort order from the president.

649
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,623
Take fighters off target.

650
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,942
Repeat: take fighters off target.

651
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,763
Stand by for confirmation code.

652
00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:34,461
Roger that.

653
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,560
We're standing down,
Madam President.
