1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,310
-What's going on?
- The operation wasn't completely successful.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,238
They have Saunders' daughter,
but didn't remain covert.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,476
- So Saunders knows we have her?
- Not yet.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,239
But CTU is estimating
he'll find out within the hour.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,158
The deadline for his next demand
is up in 15 minutes.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,353
Giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll's an act of treason.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,950
I will not give in to Saunders' latest demand.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,469
We're out of time.
We need you to call your father.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,353
- And tell him what?
- Anything. Just keep him on the line.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,078
(phone rings)

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,111
- Jane?
- Hi, Dad.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,152
I told you only to use
this number in an emergency.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,511
- Someone is monitoring the call.
- They've got her.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,872
There's a man named Jack Bauer with you,
isn't there? Hand the phone to him.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,073
You know how many vials I have
and what I'm capable of.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,475
You know what I'm capable of, too.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,079
Stephen Saunders, this is Jack Bauer.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,990
You're completely surrounded. The president
has refused to capitulate to further demands.

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,111
The only way you're getting out alive

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,993
is through the front door
with your hands on your head.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,514
That's not exactly true, Jack.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,430
I'd like to offer you congratulations
on your wife eluding infection from the virus.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,516
How do you know about my wife?

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,998
I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so that we can return her to you.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,476
There are five agents watching
the northeast exit of this building.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,434
Send them to the front entrance. Michelle
will be dead if you don't do what I say.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,757
This is Tony Almeida.
Move everyone to the front now.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,350
In your car and move to the front
of the building. Down, down!

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,272
Stephen Saunders, this is your final warning.
Come out of the building now.

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,474
- Smoke him out.
- Release the tear gas.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,556
We're a go.

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,997
- Send them in.
- Perimeter teams move in. Move in!

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,509
- All right, boys. Let's go! Let's go!
- Move!

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,552
- Baker!
- Move ahead.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,829
- Why aren't you covering the south?
- CTU said you needed us out front.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,080
- Why would they do that?
- They said Saunders was moving.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,798
Clear down there. Check the other room.

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,798
All teams respond. Any sign of Saunders?

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,395
- Apartment's clear!
- Jack, we're in. Still no sign of him.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,795
- Who gave you that order?
- Tony.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Move your team back to their mark now.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,709
(phone rings)

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,277
- CTU. Almeida.
- Baker said you pulled him out of position.

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,791
- I was working off the information I had.
- You should have cleared it with me.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,708
- Somebody in my team made a mistake.
- That's an unacceptable mistake.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,630
I have tactical command in the field.
If you can't run CTU, get someone who can.

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,517
- Chase, check in.
- We've covered the building. He's not here.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,916
Dammit!

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,358
- Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building.
- He's gotta be in there.

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,677
What were you just telling Jack
about someone making a mistake?

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,270
Never mind. Adam, are you sure
we tracked him to the right building?

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,868
He was in there
when Jack made that phone call.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,310
- I'm pulling up the imagery now.
- I'll take care of that.

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,069
You stay with Chloe and cover the site teams.

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,836
(phone rings)

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,955
Almeida.

57
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,152
I hope you purged
the incriminating satellite frames.

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,352
I did what you wanted me to.
Now, where's my wife?

59
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,150
Not so fast. I like to do things in phases.
That was phase one.

60
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
Next we have to talk about my daughter.

61
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,599
- What about her?
- I want her back, of course.

62
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,030
- Well, I want my wife back.
- Then there should be no problem.

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,073
- Where's Jane now?
- She should be here in about five minutes.

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,320
Good. Make sure the men who guard her
will follow your orders without question.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,198
If any harm comes to my daughter,
your wife dies.

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,437
If Jane is not released when I order it,
your wife dies.

67
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,031
- That's all you need to know. Are we clear?
- (Adam) Tony, are you in there?

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,914
- (Adam) President Palmer's on the line.
- I'll do my part. You do yours.

69
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,476
- That's the spirit.
- (Adam) Tony, are you there?

70
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,118
- I'm here.
- Are you OK?

71
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,198
- I'm fine. Put the president through.
- OK, hang on.

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,677
- This is Tony Almeida.
- Please hold for the president.

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,270
Mr Almeida. I just heard
you lost Stephen Saunders. Is that true?

74
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,235
- Yes, sir, unfortunately it is.
- I thought CTU was certain of his location.

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,351
We're looking into it now, sir.

76
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,756
- Does he know we're holding his daughter?
- Yes, sir, he does.

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,189
And she's obviously very important to him.

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,835
- Is Jane Saunders with you now?
- She's on her way here.

79
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,353
Mr Almeida, I don't have to remind you how
much security we're gonna need around her.

80
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,439
She is the only thing between us
and Saunders controlling the government.

81
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,760
- Yes, Mr President. We're aware of that.
- Good. Keep me posted.

82
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,320
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,518
(TV) As yet, the Keeler campaign
has not issued a comment.

84
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,596
We now go live with the senator.

85
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,748
Senator Keeler, do you feel this is going to do
serious damage to your campaign?

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,031
Absolutely not.
My record on labour speaks for itself.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,278
I voted against NAFTA and favoured
tax incentives for domestic manufacturing.

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,550
What about the other endorsements you lost?

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,992
- Who did he lose?
- AFL, ClO and a couple of veteran groups.

90
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,829
They don't like his negative spin
on your withdrawal from the debate.

91
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,198
Now the threat level's been raised to red,
people realise he's the one playing politics.

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,311
We can't waste time on the election.

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,591
The only thing that matters
is stopping Stephen Saunders.

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,553
Would you come with me, please?
Excuse us, Gerry.

95
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,993
We will be scheduling a press conference
shortly to address these issues. Thanks.

96
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,348
No, Adam, we found the room he was using.
I just wanna know how he got out.

97
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,278
- I'll call you when we get something.
- Good.

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,356
- What did he say?
- I don't understand.

99
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,792
Saunders disappears and now CTU says
they're having problems with the satellite.

100
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,309
We'll look into it. Baker, this is Jack.

101
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,399
- I want two teams on patrol, two on standby.
- What about us?

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,678
We're going to CTU. I wanna be with
Saunders' daughter when he calls us back.

103
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,991
How did Saunders get past us? Could he
have access to our tracking systems?

104
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,953
- CTU. O'Brian.
- Chloe, what are you working on?

105
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,995
We're trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.
I'm analysing his last call to you.

106
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,715
Is it possible
that he was just routing his calls?

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,472
No, he did that earlier at the apartment.
Now he couldn't do that without our knowing.

108
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,279
Get back to me
as soon as you've got anything.

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,994
Something's not right here.

110
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,315
- This is CTU?
- Yes.

111
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
Your father and Chase are on their way back.

112
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,509
- With Saunders?
- No.

113
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,871
- Why not?
- They're still trying to locate him.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,116
- They haven't captured my father?
- No.

115
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,472
- But he knows you guys have me, right?
- Yes, he does.

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,040
- Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida.
- Tony.

117
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,715
- We'll put Miss Saunders in a holding room.
- I was told a white room.

118
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,674
That's changed. If you walk her to the back,
security will take her from there.

119
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,360
You'll be fine, OK?

120
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,269
- How are you doing?
- I can't believe Saunders escaped.

121
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,039
How could this happen?
I thought he was surrounded.

122
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,154
It happened. Rae Plachecki's coming here to
talk to you about the shooting at the library.

123
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,034
OK. Look, I heard the news about Michelle.

124
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,355
What news?

125
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,951
- That she isn't infected.
- Oh. Yeah.

126
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,474
I'm really glad that she's OK. That's great.

127
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,556
Yeah. Thanks.

128
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,919
There's no way to be sure. Some people
don't show symptoms for five or six hours.

129
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,632
- Adam.
- Didn't they talk to you about your options?

130
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,068
(Sarah Kaufman) They said they could
give me a pill so I won't suffer.

131
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,754
- Adam, I need to talk to you now.
- Sarah, hold on.

132
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,476
- I'm talking to my sister right now.
- The one who got infected with the virus?

133
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,273
I'm not even gonna answer that, Chloe.

134
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,233
I'm sorry. I'll just wait here until you're done.

135
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,113
- Chloe.
- I'm sorry. This is really important.

136
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,199
I just need you to finish up
as quickly as you can.

137
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,909
Sarah, I'm gonna have to call you back
as soon as I can, OK?

138
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,710
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

139
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,634
Satellite navigation said there are missing
frames, and they're certain it's on our end.

140
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,680
- What about the backup?
- Gone, and they cover about 20 seconds.

141
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,399
If Saunders did escape,
it was in that exact interval.

142
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,718
- There was a glitch at the wrong moment?
- Yeah. What are the chances of that?

143
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,549
- Not good.
- So Saunders has access to our system.

144
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,355
- Did you tell Tony yet?
- I want more information before I go to him.

145
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,598
I checked with field ops. Their systems
are accounted for. Do the same in comm.

146
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,678
You really think someone
inside CTU is working for Saunders?

147
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,036
It's the only thing that makes sense, so do
that and then you could call your sister back.

148
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,752
- Hey, Pete. I need a few minutes alone.
- Sure thing.

149
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,198
How you doing?

150
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,348
Why am I being treated
like I've done something wrong?

151
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,837
I apologise for that.
We're just trying to keep you safe.

152
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,070
This is the one place I'm not safe.
I've been thinking about it.

153
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,720
You need me to get to my father.

154
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,756
So threatening to kill me or harm me
is the only tool you have to use against him.

155
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
Tell me I'm wrong.

156
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,878
You're right. We need your father
to believe we'll do anything to get him.

157
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,918
But we're not gonna hurt you.
I give you my word.

158
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,554
- Your word?
- Yeah, my word.

159
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,832
I run this office
and I will personally protect you.

160
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,670
What about Kim's father?
They told her that he's on his way back here.

161
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,955
What about him?

162
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,036
He scares me.

163
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,798
I got the feeling he's willing to hurt me.

164
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,118
Nobody's gonna hurt you. All right?

165
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,789
- I wish I could believe you.
- (phone rings)

166
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,829
- Almeida.
- Has Jane arrived?

167
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,835
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

168
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,553
- She's here.
- Put her on.

169
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,432
No. You have my wife.

170
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,233
- I wanna talk to her first.
- You don't give me orders.

171
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,909
You're wrong. I have your daughter,
which means I'm in charge.

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,591
If you so much as touch my wife,
I will slit Jane's throat.

173
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,158
Hold on.

174
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,476
Sorry for your discomfort.
Hopefully it's temporary.

175
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,034
Uncuff her.

176
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,950
I'm going to let you speak to your husband.
Tell him you're OK and being treated well.

177
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,152
Nothing more. Understood?

178
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,154
- Tony, it's me.
- Michelle.

179
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,113
- He won't let me say much.
- Are you all right?

180
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,119
I'm fine. I'm being treated well.

181
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,516
Don't let them do this...

182
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,033
Michelle?

183
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,276
Let me speak with my daughter, Mr Almeida.

184
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,396
It's your father. He wants to talk to you.

185
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,389
- Dad?
- Yes, Jane. It's me.

186
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,159
They're saying horrible things about you.

187
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,397
That's what they do. Don't believe any of it.

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,680
The virus in the hotel
that's killing all of those people...

189
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,955
Please tell me that you didn't do that.

190
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,029
Listen to me, Jane. The US government
distorts the truth and destroys lives.

191
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,470
Don't listen to any of it. It's all lies.

192
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,433
Then you didn't do it?

193
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,315
I'd never do something without good cause.
You know that. You know that.

194
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,079
That's all. Let's do this.

195
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,237
How long will it take for you
to get her out of the building?

196
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,511
I have to fabricate some clearances.
About 30 to 40 minutes.

197
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,839
Contact me as soon as you're clear of CTU.
Take down this number.

198
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,438
Someone from Tony's group
purged the frames from the feed.

199
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,553
- Do you know who?
- It could have been from here or Division.

200
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,558
I'd better tell Tony
so we can lock down the system.

201
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,557
(phone rings)

202
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,355
- CTU, O'Brian.
- This is Sunny Macer from Health Services.

203
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,189
- What can I do for you?
- Have you heard from Michelle Dessler?

204
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,436
No, she was sent to you for observation.

205
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,075
That's why I'm calling. We got a message
that she asked to go to County.

206
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,715
She's not at County and not here.
We can't get ahold of her.

207
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,594
- I'll check on it and get back to you.
- Thanks.

208
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,589
- Davis.
- Get me Mike Redmond. He's with Michelle.

209
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,269
- He's not answering.
- He's active. He has to answer.

210
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,030
- He's not answering.
- OK, I heard you the first time.

211
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,790
- And you're sure about this?
- Yes, Tony. Of course I'm sure.

212
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,357
There are 79 users, and one of them's been
playing games with the uplink recording.

213
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,233
We're gonna have to
lock everything down, then.

214
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,319
Well, obviously, I agree.
You want me to do it now?

215
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,396
- Yeah.
- OK.

216
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,951
- What is it?
- Something weird's happening with Michelle.

217
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,312
- What do you mean?
- No one can find her or Redmond.

218
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,552
That's because I overrode NHS's order.
I didn't want them to know about it.

219
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,878
I'm putting Michelle in quarantine in one
of our substations so she can still work.

220
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,276
- I need every warm body I can get.
- What am I gonna tell Macer?

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,868
I'll call her.
There's something I want you to do.

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,228
What is it?

223
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,989
I'm sending you the record of a phone call
between Saunders and myself.

224
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,588
- You spoke to him?
- Strip away the carrier signal.

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,792
- See if you can use it to find him.
- What about the voice track?

226
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,388
He scrambled it. It's useless.

227
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,919
Fine.

228
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,034
Chloe. Do it in tech one,
away from everybody.

229
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,948
- I don't want Adam to know about it.
- Why not?

230
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,709
Technically, it's his job, but you're better at it.

231
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,229
- Why did you just say that?
- Because it's true.

232
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,478
You assured me that going on the offensive
against Palmer was the right thing to do.

233
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,239
- Now it's backfired.
- Come on, John. That's not fair.

234
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,359
Palmer leaves the debate after you brought
up the charge against his girlfriend.

235
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,109
Everyone assumed that the national security
excuse was just a cover.

236
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,392
Apparently, it wasn't. The alert level's at red
and the airports are shut down.

237
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,476
I know.

238
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,316
All right.

239
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,680
Palmer still hasn't told the public
any of the details about this threat.

240
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,513
Call Alex at the Pentagon
and see what you can find out.

241
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,156
Depending on what it turns out to be, I may
need to be proactive and issue an apology.

242
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,556
- (phone rings)
- Yeah?

243
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,956
Sherry Palmer will be here in five minutes
to talk to the senator.

244
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,550
- What's this about?
- She says she has a high-value proposition.

245
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,676
All right, hold on.

246
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,076
It's Sherry Palmer.
She wants to come here in five minutes.

247
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,555
- Why?
- She wouldn't say.

248
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,357
Except that it's a high-value proposition
and she wants to present it face to face.

249
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,040
Set it up.

250
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,118
All right. The senator will be here.

251
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,113
This should be interesting.

252
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,312
- I'll offload the systems.
- I'll be right up. Where's Tony?

253
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,319
With Jane Saunders. Kim's waiting
to be debriefed and then working with NHS.

254
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,319
- Why isn't she tracking Saunders?
- Tony put Chloe in charge of that.

255
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,152
- Where's Chloe?
- Tech one.

256
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,352
- Why isn't she in field ops?
- You haven't talked to Tony yet?

257
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,992
It looks like someone from Tony's group
intentionally wiped out those SAT frames.

258
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,275
- That's how he was able to evade us.
- What?

259
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,757
Adam, NHS wants those coordinates now
or they're going to widen the quarantine zone.

260
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,189
OK. That's all I know. I gotta get back on this.

261
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,276
OK, fine.

262
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,319
- We may be moving you in a few minutes.
- Where?

263
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,192
- To Division.
- What's that?

264
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,788
(phone rings)

265
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,512
- Yeah.
- It's Jack.

266
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,950
I need to speak with you.
Meet me outside the observation room.

267
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,600
I'll be right back.

268
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,998
Jack. What the hell's going on?

269
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,271
You think someone on the inside's
working with Saunders?

270
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,312
- I have Chloe working on it.
- What's she doing?

271
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,113
She's taking a look at the status logs.

272
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,391
If this is true, we've gotta get
spec ops down here immediately.

273
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,398
I thought about that,
but I don't wanna raise any red flags.

274
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,959
If someone is working with Saunders,
I don't want them to know we're onto them.

275
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,756
OK, we'll work this up together,

276
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,833
but I want Division to pick up Jane Saunders
so they can continue questioning her.

277
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,270
- Good idea.
- I'll call Brad Hammond. See you in tech one.

278
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,871
No, Jack. I have a 30-minute status call
scheduled to Hammond anyway.

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,993
Why don't you let me tell him?
You can go up to field ops.

280
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,076
OK, fine.

281
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,479
Adam, is Tony set up for 30-minute
status calls with Brad Hammond?

282
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,917
If he is, it's not in the books.

283
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,996
Thanks.

284
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,598
Thank you very much.

285
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,676
John, hello.

286
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,469
Nice to see you. I don't believe you know
Mark Kaner, my campaign manager.

287
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,319
- No, only by reputation.
- How do you do?

288
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,878
- So what brings you here?
- Well, actually, it's a private matter, John.

289
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,515
Let us have a minute, Mark.

290
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,596
No problem.

291
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,636
Please.

292
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,878
I heard about the endorsements
you lost this morning.

293
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,949
- Daily fluctuation. Doesn't mean a thing.
- Doesn't mean a thing. Pretty optimistic.

294
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,470
No, your campaign is imploding.

295
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,673
By the time the press has a chance to analyse
all the mistakes you made last night,

296
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,997
you'll look like a desperate candidate
gasping his last breath.

297
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,830
- If you just came here to insult me, I'm busy.
- No, John, on the contrary.

298
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,916
Relax. I...

299
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,149
I came here because I can guarantee you
a win in November.

300
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,668
John, what I'm about to tell you, I will deny
to my grave if you try to hold it against me.

301
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,997
So that's clear, right?

302
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,638
John, we are clear on that, right?

303
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,876
Good.

304
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,189
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

305
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,468
- Whose murder?
- Alan Milliken.

306
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,354
- Alan Milliken died of a heart attack.
- Yes, but he didn't have to.

307
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,468
His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length
away, but someone kept it from him.

308
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,273
How could you possibly know that?

309
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,358
Because that someone was me.

310
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,719
Sherry, I think you had better leave right now.

311
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,355
Really? So you can watch
your entire career leave with me?

312
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,914
If it's true,
I don't want anything to do with you.

313
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,670
Spare me. You haven't gotten this far without
getting a little dirt under your fingernails.

314
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,598
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Of course not.

315
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,554
But, for the sake of conversation,
just allow me to paint you a picture.

316
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,912
Please. It won't take but a moment.
Just indulge me.

317
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,836
Very well.

318
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,512
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me,

319
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,870
and I can prove that he lied.

320
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,150
No, you think about that.

321
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,717
Proof that the president of the United States
lied to cover a murder.

322
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,638
- What kind of proof?
- Besides my confession?

323
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,196
I have the prescription bottle
he was reaching for. I was holding it.

324
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,278
And I have it in a very safe place.

325
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,271
You are talking about incriminating yourself.

326
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,716
- You would go to prison.
- Yes, I know that.

327
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,631
But so would David.
David lied to the police to save himself.

328
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,830
It's quite simple, John.

329
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,076
All you have to do is go to David

330
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,988
and tell him that you have
this medicine bottle with my fingerprints on it

331
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,829
and, I guarantee you,
David will drop out of the race,

332
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,349
the party will be thrown into turmoil

333
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,918
and nobody, I mean nobody,
will be able to touch you come November.

334
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,520
And for all of this?

335
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,554
You'll put me on the White House staff.

336
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,837
Nothing so high
that it'll raise too many eyebrows, but...

337
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,592
All of this for you to be to a mid-level staffer
in my administration?

338
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,315
You and I both know
that it would be a little more than that.

339
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,513
It's been revised
now the exposure range has changed.

340
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,916
So the casualty estimates
have been projected upward?

341
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,679
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid so.
- By a factor of how many?

342
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,477
Now the virus is not completely contained,
it could be as high as times five, sir.

343
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,670
(sighs)

344
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,110
- All right, thanks, Dan. Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,030
- What is it?
- I just spoke to my source at Keeler's office.

346
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,312
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

347
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,840
- When?
- Just now.

348
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,593
- Meeting Keeler about what?
- He didn't know, David.

349
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,638
So I was hoping you'd have some idea.

350
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,038
I don't know what she's doing,
but we can't worry about that.

351
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,632
- There are people dying here in Los Angeles.
- Yeah, well, I don't like it, David.

352
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,354
So let me put someone on this.

353
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,794
No.

354
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,398
I brought Sherry in to fix a problem
and look what happened.

355
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,308
Just let it be. We'll hear soon enough.

356
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,356
What do you see?

357
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,069
They're trying to use the open
phone switches to find us.

358
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,589
The phone I called in with is shut off.

359
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,156
They can't triangulate me, can they?

360
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,236
Not quickly, but they can use a trial-and-error
process and that could get 'em close.

361
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,472
- Then that's what they're doing.
- It looks like it.

362
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,160
Then we have to stop them.

363
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,840
Come with me.

364
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,833
Your office is using
our last phone conversation to locate us.

365
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,080
How are they doing it?
I'm committed to getting my daughter back.

366
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,112
You kill me and that'll never happen.

367
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,198
That's not the only option.

368
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,356
You're an attractive woman.

369
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,430
I'm guessing your husband would prefer
you returned without disfigurement.

370
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,518
I'm not telling you anything.

371
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,635
I have to talk with Almeida.

372
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,438
Keep the conversation short.

373
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,397
- (phone rings)
- Almeida.

374
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,476
Let me paint you a picture.

375
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,116
I have a sharp knife, the tip of which
is drawing blood from your wife's face...

376
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,196
right now.

377
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,029
If whatever you're doing to trace
these calls doesn't stop in 30 seconds,

378
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,197
she'll be unrecognisable.

379
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,749
(phone rings)

380
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,155
- O'Brian.
- Shut down the trace.

381
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,955
- I'm just starting to get something.
- Do it now, Chloe.

382
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,310
Let me at least unscramble the audio.

383
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,560
- I need you to hold off for a few minutes.
- I thought you wanted me to find Saunders.

384
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,638
I do. Just... I'll explain it to you later.

385
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,635
- What are you doing?
- Trying to pick up a thread.

386
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,469
Somebody may be working against us.
I have quarantine zones springing up.

387
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,478
I'm treading water here, Jack.

388
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,433
Why are you lying to me?

389
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,279
- Lying?
- I just got off the phone with Hammond.

390
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,870
You didn't have a status call scheduled.

391
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,829
I screwed up earlier. The SAT transmission
on my system was forged by own people.

392
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,919
I should have noticed it wasn't authentic
before I ordered Baker off his post.

393
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,112
By the time I realised my mistake,
Saunders was gone.

394
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,711
- What about the missing frames?
- Must have been deleted by the same person.

395
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,630
I know this is big and, I promise you,
I'll offer my resignation when this day is over.

396
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,990
Right now we got too much going on.

397
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,873
Making a mistake is one thing.
Covering it up is another.

398
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,037
I can't let you stay in place.
I am taking over command of CTU.

399
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,879
- I made a mistake, Jack.
- No, Tony.

400
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,560
You made two.

401
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,759
Fine. I'll make sure Adam sends over
everything I got to your group.

402
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,160
Tony, I narrowed down the list.

403
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,554
What list?

404
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,117
Of people who can't account for their time
when the SAT frames went missing.

405
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,559
Yeah, right.

406
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,629
It's very likely that someone on this list
is working from within CTU to help Saunders.

407
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,076
Look, Adam, I'm not in charge
of CTU any more.

408
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,677
- What are you talking about?
- Jack decided it was best if he took over.

409
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,429
Why don't you send that list
over to Hammond?

410
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,078
(Saunders) Yes?

411
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,589
- I got a problem.
- What problem?

412
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,075
Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command.

413
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,432
- Why did he do that?
- He found out I deleted those satellite frames.

414
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,398
- Does he know about our communication?
- Not yet.

415
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,717
He thinks I'm covering my mistake,
but he's gonna find out soon.

416
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,912
Then I suggest you get my daughter
out of there before he does.

417
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,033
Look, I might not be able to do this.
I no longer have any authority at CTU.

418
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,994
You don't need authority. You just need
to know that if you don't deliver Jane,

419
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,954
for whatever reason, your wife will die,
just like Ryan Chappelle died,

420
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,470
just like the people
at the Chandler Plaza Hotel died.

421
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,034
- I'm gonna try to get her out, but if I can't...
- Ifyou can't, Michelle dies.

422
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,192
Don't call me again
until you have Jane safely away.

423
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,109
- Dad.
- I need you to help me with something.

424
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,597
Tony wants me to debrief with Rae Plachecki
about what's going on with Jane Saunders.

425
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,236
Tony just stepped down.
I'm acting director of CTU until further notice.

426
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,352
What do you mean, Tony stepped down?

427
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,870
Tony's hiding something.
I need you to help me find out what it is.

428
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,639
- Why me?
- Right now I don't know who to trust.

429
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,958
Maintain surveillance on every station
here at CTU, anyone who checks in or out,

430
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,316
and track communications
flagged higher than a code two.

431
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,750
- Where do you want me to do this?
- Field ops. Come on.

432
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,791
Thanks.

433
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,396
(phone rings)

434
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,355
Almeida.

435
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,516
- Good news, Tony.
- What is it?

436
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,633
I found a way to pull the voice track
on the phone call you had with Saunders.

437
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,399
- Have you listened to it?
- The algorithm's running.

438
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,548
Once that's complete, I'll be able to do
an analysis on ambient sound and room tone.

439
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,240
Good work.

440
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,239
(Jack) Adam, send your volumes
to Kim's computer.

441
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,396
I have her checking something for me.

442
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,432
- Is Chloe still in tech one?
- As far as I know, she is.

443
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,996
- Have her come up to my office.
- I will, Jack.

444
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,874
- Kaufman.
- I'm on the line with Chloe.

445
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,713
- We need the password to 824.
- OK.

446
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,232
- It's BCF19.
- All right, thanks.

447
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,079
Jack needs to see Chloe
in his office right away.

448
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,760
- I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

449
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,434
- (Saunders) Where is she?
- (Tony) She's here.

450
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,632
- Put her on.
- No. You have my wife.

451
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,320
I wanna talk to her first.

452
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,919
You have my wife. I wanna talk to her first.

453
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,072
"You have my wife"?

454
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,272
Hello? Hello?

455
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,116
Dammit.

456
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,118
Help! Somebody help! I'm locked in!

457
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,038
Tech one! I'm locked in!

458
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,110
Everybody, can I have your attention?

459
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,915
Just stop working for a second.
I need your attention.

460
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,838
From this point forward,
I am taking command of CTU.

461
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,349
That includes field ops
and all communications.

462
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,916
Tony Almeida has stepped down.
He is no longer in charge.

463
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,072
I'm taking Jane Saunders to Division.
Here's the order.

464
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,875
I don't have time to go into details.
We have to focus on finding Saunders.

465
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,549
Come on, Pete.
Call Division. Talk to 'em yourself.

466
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,515
Unless you are working directly with NHS,
I need you to get involved.

467
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,715
Your superiors will hand out your
assignments. We need to find this guy now.

468
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,351
We're leaving right now.
We're going out this way right here.

469
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,235
Chloe hasn't refreshed her chron tables.
I thought she was on the main system.

470
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, she was.

471
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,071
- That's weird. She never forgets to do that.
- What's going on?

472
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,395
- Have you seen Chloe?
- She's in tech one.

473
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,632
- Where are all the guards?
- We don't need those guards.

474
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,513
You were worried
about my father sending men to get me.

475
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,872
We have agents on the streets.
Don't worry about it.

476
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,797
- Why can't I get a feed on tech one?
- Hang on.

477
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,318
- Someone blocked it.
- We have a hostile inside.

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,918
Tony locked me in here. Saunders has
Michelle. He's using her to get his daughter.

483
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,878
Don't move.

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,833
Negative, Jack.
He's not on any of the monitors.

- When did he lock you in here?
- About 10 minutes ago.

488
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,797
Lock down the entire building. Adam, I wanna
know everything that's exiting this building.

489
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,472
- Who's watching Jane Saunders?
- Both guards are down. She's gone.

490
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,197
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

492
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,635
This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.

493
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,718
- How long until satellite finds you?
- About 30 minutes.

494
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,638
I'll give you further instructions

Yeah, all right.

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,235
I'd like to speak to him. Personally.

499
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,472
Son of a bitch.
