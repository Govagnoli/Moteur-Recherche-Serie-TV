1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,437
Mr President, with respect to the death
of Alan Milliken, I know you lied.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,711
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,037
Her fingerprints on this prescription bottle
prove otherwise.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,720
- What do you want?
- Your resignation.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,836
Without this, Sherry's got nothing.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,428
I can call Foxton
and he can make this disappear.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,198
You mean steal evidence?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,118
I just heard Tony took Jane Saunders.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,596
Saunders has Michelle.
He wants to trade her for his daughter.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,433
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,791
You help me make this trade,
I'll turn myself in, go to prison, whatever.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,710
We don't have a visual on Saunders.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,990
Keep your teams down. Stay down.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,595
I can't.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,280
Jane! It's OK! Come here!

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,351
Teams A and B move. Move now!

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,877
Stephen!

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm pinned down! Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now!

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,473
11 vials of the virus are unaccounted for.
Where are they?

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,750
It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,668
This is Jack Bauer. Saunders is in custody.

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,713
We just got verification. There's 11 vials.
How long till you can give us their location?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,230
I'm not sure I can.
Saunders applied a decryption overlay.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,194
Unauthorised access will erase
the file structure. I'll keep trying.

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,674
- Where are the 11 vials?
- You're wasting your time.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,870
I don't have that information in there.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,152
Where are the vials?

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,993
- In the hands of true believers.
- Believers in what?

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,396
That the greatest threat to world peace
comes from this country.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,435
There's a hotel near here where 800 innocent
people are dead or dying because of you.

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,391
Were they a threat to world peace?

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,356
The US must retreat within its own borders.
Those people are the first casualties of war.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,153
What happened to you, Stephen?

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,589
I was abandoned by the people I worked for,

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,999
as you'll be some day.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,796
- But my message will be heard in one hour.
- What are you talking about?

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,471
My couriers have been instructed to release
the virus at noon. They can't be recalled.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,717
Tell us where they are. We'll stop them.

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,154
That is possible.
But only if you agree to my terms.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,398
- What are your terms?
- I have a private jet at Van Nuys airport.

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,838
I need to be on it, with a presidential
guarantee of safe passage to North Africa.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,317
- Never gonna happen.
- Then hundreds of thousands will die.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,197
I know what you're thinking, but the Bosnian
police had two years and couldn't break me.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,472
Do you really think you'll be able to do it
in less than an hour?

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,351
Get me on that plane, Jack.
You don't have a choice.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Bring me Jane Saunders.

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm gonna need your gun, Tony.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,637
- Frisk him.
- Up against the wall.

49
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,309
- Hey! You don't have to do that.
- I've got my orders.

50
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,556
- He's one of us.
- Not any more.

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,989
- What's going on?
- I'm taking him into custody.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,192
That's straight from
Brad Hammond at Division.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,798
I'm sorry, Tony.
There's nothing we can do right now.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,993
Just take care of business, Jack.
I'll be all right.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,789
- They said you wanted to see me.
- I need you to speak with your father.

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,313
- What do you want me to say?
- Try to make it personal, connect with him.

57
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,036
Tell him you're scared,
that you don't want him to do this.

58
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,151
I'll try.

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,715
I know what's going to happen...
and I know you can stop it.

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,990
Please.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,317
I won't let them use you to manipulate me.

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,791
Despite everything that's happened...

63
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,192
I love you, and I'm asking you,
please don't let this happen.

64
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,356
This doesn't make any sense.

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,032
It doesn't make sense to you
because you haven't seen what I've seen.

66
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,116
You don't understand.

67
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,954
You think what happened to you
is the government's fault, and maybe it is.

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,631
- But the people who'll die are innocent.
- And that is tragic, Jane.

69
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,595
But it has to happen for things to change,
and they must change.

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,154
How can you do something like this?

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,839
- I'm doing it for your sake.
- For my sake?

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,871
For you and your children.

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,270
After it's all over,
the world will be a better place.

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,277
Please, Dad.

75
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,357
Please.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,513
Please. Don't do this.

77
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,916
Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,600
But one day you will.

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,077
And you'll look back
and you'll thank me for what I've done.

80
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,395
Yeah.

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,750
- Oh, my God.
- Jane.

82
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,836
Jane!

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,077
Jane.

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,269
We're on the move.
Get the choppers ready.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,877
(phone rings)

86
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,354
- Hello?
- Sherry, it's David.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,278
- Hello, David.
- I've been thinking things over.

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,791
What Keeler offered you.
How did you put it? A seat at the table?

89
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,036
- Yeah, something like that.
- Well, there may be a seat at my table.

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,628
It's a little too late for that, David.

91
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,718
Sherry, I think it's in both our best interests
for you to hear what I have to offer.

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,956
All right. I'm listening.

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,914
- No, not on the phone. In person.
- Where, then?

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,356
- At Latham Park, the old baseball ground.
- I know it.

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,677
- I'll meet you there in 25 minutes.
- That's short notice.

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,756
But you will be there.

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,431
- You're in no position to make demands.
- Sherry, I have a schedule to keep.

98
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,475
If I start changing things, it will attract
attention, and neither one of us wants that.

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,751
All right, David.
I'll hear what you have to say.

100
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,711
Fine.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,035
(phone rings)

102
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,836
Yeah.

103
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,714
- She should be leaving soon to meet me.
- I knew she'd go for it.

104
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,035
She's enjoying having me over a barrel.

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,510
- I could hear it in her voice.
- Don't worry about that, David.

106
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,030
If we can find this prescription bottle,
all her leverage is gone.

107
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,673
How long will you need?

108
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,758
The more time we have,
the better our chance of finding it.

109
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,509
I'll do whatever I can
to keep her there with me.

110
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Wayne... find it.

111
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,437
Take a look at your handiwork.
You murdered these people. Whole families!

112
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,394
Sometimes a fire needs to be lit
in order to put out another fire.

113
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,114
I don't wanna hear your justification.
This is over!

114
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,073
You are gonna tell me
how to find the rest of the vials now!

115
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,955
Or you'll send me inside the hotel?
I'm prepared to die for my cause, Jack.

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,828
Yeah, I know.

117
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,111
- Chase. Come in.
- Copy that.

118
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,435
What are you doing, Jack?

119
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,713
- Why did you bring me here?
- Ask your father. It's up to him.

120
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,796
Dad?

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,831
Tell me how to find your couriers,
or I'll put her in that building.

122
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,953
- She has nothing to do with this!
- Neither do the people in those body bags.

123
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,635
I am gonna do everything I have to
to stop you releasing more of this virus.

124
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,150
- How could you do this?
- I'm gonna give you one chance.

125
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,669
No, you're not.

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,873
- Tell me how I find them.
- You know you can't do this, Jack.

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,992
You are a government agent.

128
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,396
Send her in. Take her inside now!

129
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,193
No. Dad, stop them! Dad, stop them!

130
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,869
Stop it! Dad! Dad, please!

131
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,592
No! No!

132
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,117
Jane...

133
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,995
Everything that happens to your daughter
is because of you.

134
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,670
Get her out of there, Jack.

135
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,360
- Dad, please!
- Jack, get her out of there!

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,596
- Where are the vials?
- Get her out of there!

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,756
How do I find the vials?

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,395
Let her go! Do as I say now, Jack!

139
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,115
When your daughter is infected,
I'm gonna make you watch her die.

140
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,789
Let her go! Let her go!

141
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,438
You're running out of time, Stephen.

142
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,148
- Stephen, you're out of time!
- Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,948
Just don't harm her!

144
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,475
How do I find the vials?

145
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,310
Each one is tagged with a GPS locator chip,

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,671
so that I can track them
right up until the moment they're released.

147
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,473
Where are the locator codes?

148
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,790
- In my head.
- You memorised all 11?

149
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,588
Yeah. Get her out of there.

150
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,750
Bring Jane out from the tunnel now.
Let's go.

151
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,360
Jack, we picked up 10 of the 11
GPS signals coming off the vials.

152
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,228
- Why are we missing a signal?
- I don't know. I gave you the correct codes.

153
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,839
Where's the 11th vial?

154
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,871
- Los Angeles.
- What's the target?

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,710
He was told to select a public place where
maximum casualties would be inflicted.

156
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,990
- What's his name?
- Arthur Rabens.

157
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,635
- I'm assuming that's not his real name.
- We need a description.

158
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,910
Take him back to holding over at CTU.

159
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,600
I want him working
with a sketch artist immediately.

160
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,399
- What about Jane?
- She stays here.

161
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,117
- Kaufman.
- Adam, it's Jack.

162
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,630
I need you to do an all-agency search
on the name Arthur Rabens.

163
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,399
- Saunders believes it might be an alias.
- I'm on it.

164
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,080
Has District sent anyone over
to replace Tony?

165
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,276
Brad Hammond just got here right now.

166
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,152
- Let me speak to him.
- One second.

167
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,034
Mr Hammond, I have
Jack Bauer for you on line six.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,197
Jack, I've been briefed
on CTU activity to this point.

169
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,757
We're relaying the coordinates of the 10 vials
to local police, NHS and Haz-Mat.

170
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,594
- We can't get a signal from the 11th vial.
- The 11th vial is in Los Angeles.

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,633
The courier is Arthur Rabens.
Saunders believes that might be an alias.

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,718
- There's no predetermined target.
- Is he telling the truth?

173
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,479
Yeah. He thinks
we're willing to kill his daughter.

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,957
- But our best bet is to lock on to that signal.
- Everyone in comm is working on it.

175
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,394
Brad, I know you took
Tony Almeida into custody.

176
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,353
But now his wife is safe,
he might be a real asset to us.

177
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,200
There's not going to be
any special treatment.

178
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,157
For God's sakes, Brad.

179
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,909
Four and a half years ago I was in
the same position Tony's been put in today.

180
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,996
Drazen kidnapped my wife and daughter.

181
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,550
I went outside of CTU to get them back,
and no one put me in prison.

182
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,355
- The circumstances were different.
- And the outcome will be the same.

183
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,358
The operation was put at risk
because of what he did.

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,950
This operation started a year ago
with Gael, Tony and myself.

185
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,311
Gael gave his life, I became an addict
just to maintain my cover,

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,317
and now you're sending Tony to prison?

187
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,797
It's wrong, Brad, and you know it. You
should put a medal on him, not handcuffs.

188
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,311
Jack, you can testify at his hearing.
Right now, we've got work to do.

189
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,158
- Where's Michelle?
- She's here.

190
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,113
- Could I talk to her, please?
- First things first.

191
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,876
Plachecki from the attorney general's
office will take your official statement.

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,150
You're entitled to have a lawyer present.

193
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,750
Look, I don't need a lawyer, Brad.
I did what I did.

194
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,635
What you did, Tony,
is punishable by the death penalty.

195
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,993
- Death penalty.
- What did you expect?

196
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,989
- You committed treason.
- That was not my intent.

197
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,997
You facilitated the escape of a man

198
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,237
who was responsible
for the death of Ryan Chappelle

199
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,191
and almost a thousand civilians,

200
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,915
and who was contemplating
killing millions of others.

201
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,513
You tried to neutralise the only leverage
we had by giving him back his daughter.

202
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,920
So what's the bottom line?

203
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,476
I will testify to the fact
that your service record is long

204
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,955
and, for the most part, distinguished.

205
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,437
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

206
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,959
- Sherry should have left by now.
- Yeah, well, she's taking her time.

207
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,514
So she can make the president wait.

208
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,917
(phone rings)

209
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,558
- Wayne Palmer.
- (Julia) Wayne...

210
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,911
- I told you not to call me.
- I don't have anyone else.

211
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,429
I'm sorry, but I can't help you right now.

212
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,156
The police are coming back to arrest me,
Wayne, for murdering Alan,

213
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
because they don't believe
that Sherry was here.

214
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,276
- I know what happened.
- Then why didn't you tell them the truth?

215
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,598
My lawyer says that the president
is backing Sherry's story.

216
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,594
Is it true?
Is your brother covering for Sherry?

217
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,670
- l... I don't know, Julia.
- Don't lie to me.

218
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,117
Listen, I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do for you right now.

219
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,153
Please, just... don't hang up.

220
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,829
I'll call you as soon as I can, I promise.

221
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,552
Wayne.

222
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,475
I'm so scared.

223
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,194
I know. I know.

224
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,995
We loved each other once. Help me.

225
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,757
- I have to go, Julia.
- Wayne...

226
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,155
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,157
All right.

228
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,473
I'm Chief of Staff to the president
and I'm committing a burglary.

229
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,319
It's an historic moment.

230
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,874
Foxton, Sherry can never know
we were here.

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,788
You do what I say and she won't.
Let's get to work.

232
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:07,070
Jack. Tactical feed from San Francisco.
They're apprehending Saunders' courier.

233
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,192
- He's not breathing.
- Sniper took him down with a head shot.

234
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,595
Got it.

235
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,475
Is the vial intact? Field Ops,
I repeat, is the vial intact?

236
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,955
Vial appears intact.

237
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
We 've got it. The vial is intact.
We have the vial.

238
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,395
One down, ten to go.

239
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,189
- Did you check the kitchen?
- For the second time. There is nothing there.

240
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,677
Well, it looks like Mrs Palmer believes
in better living through chemistry,

241
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,268
but none of the bottles are Alan Milliken's.

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,351
- Dammit.
- Relax.

243
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,755
If she's hidden it here, we'll find it.

244
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,829
- How can you be so sure?
- Cos she's not a professional, and I am.

245
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,795
- Sherry.
- David.

246
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,910
- Let's take a walk.
- Actually, I just wanted to get to the point.

247
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,838
What is it that you've decided?

248
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,436
I've decided to give you what you want:
a place in my administration.

249
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,476
That's what you implied over the phone,

250
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,356
but I thought I was here
so that you could be a little more specific.

251
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,438
You will be my de facto right hand,
involved in all major decisions.

252
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,152
Involved how?

253
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,989
On everything from ambassadorial
appointments to legislative proposals.

254
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,715
You will be one of my primary consultants.

255
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,868
- One of your consultants?
- Right.

256
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,033
- Goodbye, David.
- What? Where are you going?

257
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,470
Back home,
because this conversation is over.

258
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
- Why?
- That's just not good enough.

259
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,188
I am not going to be relegated
to some informal role

260
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,232
so that you can ignore me
whenever you choose.

261
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,309
- Why don't you just tell me what you want?
- I want a permanent position, David.

262
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,477
In your administration and in your life.

263
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,075
I don't understand.

264
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,236
I want to be your wife again.

265
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,109
You what?

266
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,394
I don't expect to have the kind
of physical intimacy that we used to have,

267
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,990
although maybe in time that'll come.

268
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,352
But I really want to be
Mrs David Palmer again,

269
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,151
the first lady, right by your side
in Washington, wherever you go.

270
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,989
Sherry, I don't know what to say.

271
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,353
You can start by saying yes...
or I walk for good.

272
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,348
Are you prepared
to have me be your wife again?

273
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,236
Yes.

274
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,588
Really?

275
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,271
Oh, David.

276
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,591
Oh, God.

277
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,393
We should talk about the details.

278
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,678
Work out a timeline,
how we expose this to the public.

279
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,595
Wait a minute.

280
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,112
No, I know you
a little better than this, David.

281
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,277
Something's not right here.
You're making this all too easy.

282
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,039
There's something else going on.

283
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,915
- I'm giving you what you ask for.
- No, no, no, you're not.

284
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,595
You're toying with me.

285
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,188
And I don't know why
and, frankly, I don't care.

286
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,472
You... you just consider my offer rescinded.

287
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,155
John Keeler will be
the next President of the United States.

288
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,910
(phone rings)

289
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,951
- Yeah?
- She's on her way back.

290
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,231
We need more time.
We haven't found anything yet.

291
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,708
I tried to keep her here,
but she knew something was wrong.

292
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,915
- Wayne, you should leave.
- We're not done.

293
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,634
She will be there soon.
You have no choice.

294
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,875
David, hold on.

295
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,950
- There's a safe.
- We've found a safe in a hidden cellar.

296
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
- Can you open it in time?
- Can you get in?

297
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,951
It's an Evans-Stoller,
so forget about cracking it.

298
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,072
These electronic safes
have manufacturer override codes.

299
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,156
I have a guy who can get 'em for us.

300
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,558
- How long?
- As long as it takes to get him on the phone.

301
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,350
- David, we may have just found a way.
- You'd better. You're running out of time.

302
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,716
The suspect used a titanium clamp to secure
the device to a railing. We're defusing it.

303
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,879
- Wilson, what is your status?
- Suspect in custody. Virus is contained.

304
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,195
- (phone rings)
- Y eah?

305
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,029
Seattle, Las Vegas secure. Denver courier
taken down making a phone call.

306
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,879
Jack, we got the couriers
in Las Vegas and Seattle.

307
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,275
Saunders' man in Denver
was making a phone call.

308
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,312
- Did he complete the call?
- We don't know.

309
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,829
We gotta find that out.

310
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,076
(woman) Vial is secure. We are secure.

311
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,953
I'm getting a level-two SAT transmission
from the LA grid.

312
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,476
- Are you sure? What are the coordinates?
- Alpha 1733 and Delta 401.

313
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,070
That's downtown. Lock in on the SAT feed.
Transfer to my screen.

314
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,031
OK.

315
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,111
(dials number)

316
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,435
(phone rings)

317
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,118
- This is Jack.
- It's Chloe.

318
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,357
- What have you got?
- Rabens is in Los Angeles.

319
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,948
- Where?
- On South Flower heading northwest.

320
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,275
We got a location.

321
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,075
Extrapolate his path and cross-reference it
with probable public targets.

322
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,555
The most likely match
is the California Centre.

323
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,150
A mall makes sense. Get units over there
to evacuate and secure the area.

324
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,475
We're on our way.

325
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,637
I just tried to see Tony.
Security said you're denying me access.

326
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,991
- He's a prisoner, Michelle.
- He did what he did to save my life.

327
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,911
I'm aware of that. And because of that
he's being charged with treason.

328
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,511
Treason? I know that he broke protocol
by taking Jane Saunders out of CTU,

329
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,517
but he would never have given her up.

330
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,639
- Because of him, we caught Saunders.
- We had Saunders two hours ago.

331
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,752
Tony let him escape.

332
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,919
No one told you? We had Saunders
trapped in a building downtown.

333
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,190
We were ready to drop the net,

334
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,995
and Tony pulled units out of position
so Saunders could get away.

335
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,318
- Brad, it was an impossible choice.
- No, it wasn't.

336
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,273
Tony has a sworn duty
to protect the people of this country.

337
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,599
Putting your life first was treasonous,
and he's going to prison for it.

338
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,232
- Brad...
- I want you to put yourself in his place.

339
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,952
If you would have made the same call,
you should resign right now.

340
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,508
The target is moving north
at 40 miles per hour.

341
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,234
How long till we intercept?

342
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,272
- About a minute.
- How are we doing on the other vials?

343
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,956
They got the Flagstaff couriers and two
in Washington. Rabens is the last one.

344
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,679
Next right. You should be
coming up right behind him.

345
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,633
I'm turning right onto Flower.

346
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,673
The target is less than a block ahead of you.
You should have a visual.

347
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,429
- There's no vehicles within range.
- You sure the target's in the vehicle?

348
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,753
Of course. He's travelling 40 miles per hour.
Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you.

349
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,398
There's no cars in front of us.
Recheck your signals. It's not possible.

350
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,239
Yes, it is. He's underneath us.

351
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,271
Chloe, the target's on the subway.

352
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,960
Can you access
the MTA's disaster-response system?

353
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,957
We can access their control centre.

354
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,311
We need to stop the train in the tunnel
before it hits the station.

355
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,600
Logging onto their system.

356
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,515
Has Adam turned up a photo on Rabens yet?

357
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,189
No. And Saunders hasn't
completed the identity sketch.

358
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,915
They're accepting my request
to stop the train just short of the station.

359
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,952
- Shall I tell MTA to close the station?
- Absolutely not.

360
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,032
If Rabens notices anything,
he might release the virus.

361
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,358
I'm gonna need 20 personnel undercover
and a backup Haz-Mat team ASAP.

362
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,678
We've got men nearby. I'll tell Hammond
to order the redeployment.

363
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,277
(phone rings)

364
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,435
- Foxton.
- I've got those codes for the safe.

365
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,393
- OK, give me the first one.
- 676765B.

366
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,353
676765B.

367
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,835
- That didn't work. Got another one?
- Come on.

368
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,951
- 228767.
- (car approaches)

369
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,435
Did you hear that?

370
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,353
- (car door slams)
- It was a car.

371
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,036
No.

372
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,316
- Sherry's here.
- I need you to be quiet.

373
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,079
- We need to get the hell out of here.
- Quiet!

374
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,953
- The next one.
- Next one. 35266...

375
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,197
- Dammit, Foxton, come on!
- Got it.

376
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,199
- It's not here.
- Dammit. All right, come on.

377
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,353
- That's it, let's go.
- What?

378
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,796
I didn't come this far to leave empty-handed.

379
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,918
Wayne.

380
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,797
What's going on here?

381
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,071
Answer me. What...?

382
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,751
Oh.

383
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,270
Now I understand
why David wanted to meet me.

384
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,109
But I am so surprised
to find you here doing his dirty work.

385
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,595
I've never done anything to hurt you.
David put you up to this, didn't he?

386
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,756
- Sherry, l...
- Answer me. David put...

387
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,473
The eyebrows. Change the eyebrows.

388
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,118
Attention, passengers.

389
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,075
Southbound services are temporarily
suspended due to a stalled train.

390
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,430
We apologise for any inconvenience.

391
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,196
(Chloe) Chase, what's your location?

392
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,675
- I'm covering the east side of the tracks.
- Copy that.

393
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,793
(Jack) Chase, I've got a visual
on you coming down the stairs.

394
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,595
- Everything in place with the MTA?
- They're ready to move the train.

395
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,799
- Teams A and B, are you in position?
- Roger. We are in position.

396
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,392
Rabens' description: mid-30s, white male,
dark hair, brown eyes. Nondescript.

397
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,308
- Chloe, release the train.
- Release the hold on the train.

398
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,516
(train hooter)

399
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,240
Train doors are opening.

400
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,471
- Target is moving off the train.
- North or south?

401
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,239
- North.
- Target is moving north.

402
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,271
All teams remain in your zones.

403
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,518
Chloe, can you check
the altitude on a GPS signal?

404
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,949
If I triangulate.

405
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,397
- Target is changing altitude.
- Target's moving up the stairs.

406
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,398
We've got ten remaining white males.

407
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,352
Target is now moving west.

408
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,837
Team A, split off and maintain pace.

409
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,270
(Chloe) Target is now moving south.
Target is now descending.

410
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,555
(Chase) He's heading to the 7th Street
exit. Coming right towards you, Jack.

411
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,030
(Chloe) Target is heading south.

412
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,470
I've got a visual.
Four white remaining males.

413
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,716
I want all teams to start closing in.
I repeat, all teams start closing in.

414
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,437
- What have you got, Chloe?
- Target is now moving west.

415
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,276
(Chloe) Target has stopped moving.
The target has stopped.

416
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,396
I have identification on the target.
White male at my six o'clock.

417
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,752
He's looking at the map.
I'm initiating takedown.

418
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,508
Drop the bag!
Get on the ground, now! Don't move!

419
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,234
- What's going on?
- Where is it? Where is it?

420
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,237
- Where's what?
- Chase.

421
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,316
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

422
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,271
I've got a signal. Wait for Haz-Mat?

423
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,551
No, it's either in the vial
or we're already contaminated.

424
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,314
What is this?

425
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,269
(beeping)

426
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,553
- Those aren't mine. I don't even...
- Shut up!

427
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,797
- Son of a bitch.
- Just the transmitter. This isn't Rabens.

428
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,993
He knows we're onto him. He's still got
the vial. Shut the station down now!

429
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,318
Julia.

430
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,159
- Stay here. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

431
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,635
Just stay here.

432
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,630
- Julia, what are you doing here?
- The police think I killed Alan.

433
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,158
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.
It's nobody's fault but your own.

434
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,589
What are you doing with a gun?
You don't wanna do this.

435
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,156
I'm going to jail for the rest of my life
because of you.

436
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,117
- Julia! Julia!
- That's not true, Julia.

437
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,152
No, Wayne, relax. We're all right here.

438
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,113
- You gotta put that gun down.
- No! No!

439
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,993
She's the one who should be going to jail.

440
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,878
My life is ruined.
Don't you understand that?!

441
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,788
Julia, please, we can... We can work this out.

442
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,797
He's right. We can work it out.

443
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,118
Shut up. Shut up!
You have been lying your entire life.

444
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,755
- You are not gonna lie your way out of this.
- You're right.

445
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,634
But right now, Julia,
I am telling you the truth.

446
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,877
Now, I will go to David
and he will pardon you.

447
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,753
I was just with him, just now.

448
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,839
I'm gonna be his wife again.
He'll do whatever I say.

449
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,631
I promise you,
you will not spend one day in jail.

450
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,000
Isn't that so, Wayne?

451
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,190
Julia, listen, you'll have everything
you've always wanted.

452
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,635
You'll have your freedom,
you'll have Alan's estate.

453
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,633
You just think about it, sweetie.

454
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,958
I promise.

455
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,550
You'll be set for life.
Good, good. That is real good.

456
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,229
That's good.

457
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,070
Oh, my God. Sherry...

458
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,588
Sherry...

459
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,953
I'm so sorry.

460
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,838
No!

461
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,071
God, no, please.

462
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,271
Take up position at the end of the platform.

463
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,996
- We've detained everyone in the station.
- Did we shut it down in time?

464
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,990
- No one's left since the train came in.
- OK, start searching the tunnels.
