1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,070
-Hello, Sherry.
- David.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,591
Alan's determined to see Wayne removed.
Even if it means destroying my presidency.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,757
You want me to find
something you can use against Alan.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,113
You think you can enlist your ex-wife to
manufacture lies in order to bring me down?

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,708
You want it to stop,
stay away from my brother.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,832
- (phone rings)
- Jack, I think it's Amador.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,316
I've got the product.
There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,079
Meet me in there in an hour and ten minutes.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,948
I'll have one man with me for security.
You may do the same.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,316
(Ram Ãn) We are following through.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,876
- (Hector) There are too many risks now.
- They are in the playbook.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,189
CTU, Dessler.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,835
(Jack) Ram Ãn, ifyou want this deal
to happen, we've gotta go now.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,872
Tony, Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,195
Amador's gonna be at Posta Mita in an hour.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,030
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,559
He's disconnected.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,797
Based on what CTU got,
the meeting will probably take place here.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,871
My forward position is gonna be here.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,232
I need you to put your men behind this ridge
until we know that the virus is real.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,557
- How long will it take them to get there?
- 90 seconds.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,312
Good luck.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,591
Ram Ãn, if you want this deal to happen,
we have to leave now.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,836
We have to be there
20 minutes before Amador.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,871
The deal is off!

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,874
We're leaving now.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,828
Hector!

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,472
(gunshot)

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,036
(gasps)

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,596
- Are your people ready?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,188
- What about Chloe?
- Yeah, she's there, too.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,398
This is our chance to get the virus.
Make sure they're aware of what's at stake.

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,637
- They're aware.
- lt'll all come down in the next hour.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,115
- You don't have to keep reminding me.
- I do.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,075
Too many things can go wrong here.
We don't need another mistake.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,634
So, um...

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,312
Have we had any word from Jack
in the last few minutes?

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,069
No. He's still with Nina and the Salazars.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,880
You should have listened to me.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,795
This is my business. I built it. And I won't let
anyone destroy it. Not even you.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,758
Ram Ãn.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,718
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
- We can't. They'll ask questions.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,477
- He'll die if we don't.
- I know.

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,876
Ram Ãn.

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,876
Ram Ãn, I'm sorry, but we have to go.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,638
When we are done.
I want him to have a proper burial.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,912
Ram Ãn, you're making a big mistake.
He's setting you up. He works for CTU.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,676
Hector was right. You should give this up.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,270
That's enough.
Don't mention my brother's name. Ever.

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,638
All right. Let's do the deal.
Everybody back in the cars. Come on.

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,312
(Palmer) Coordinate with CTU.
I want updates every half-hour.

52
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,590
(woman) Yes, sir.

53
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,950
- Yes?
- David.

54
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,875
I just want you to know that I'm leaving.

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,630
- This leverage you have with Milliken.
- It's better that you don't know the details.

56
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,835
All right.

57
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,872
Aaron told me that you refused
a Secret Service escort.

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,313
Yes. But that's because the person I'm going
to see might scare if I don't come alone.

59
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,796
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,315
I know you can.

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,474
- David.
- Mm-hm?

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,398
I still believe in your presidency.

63
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,911
And if Alan Milliken is threatening
your ability to lead this country,

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,838
he will be stopped.

65
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,395
Amador will be here in 30 minutes.

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,389
We have Delta teams ready to intercept the
package when Jack confirms it has the virus.

67
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,954
- Jack's transmitter working yet?
- We're using Chase.

68
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,072
He's moving into a covert position
to give confirmation.

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,880
- He can transmit to us and the Delta teams.
- Who's running his comm?

70
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,113
I am. I wrote a software bridge. I'm amplifying
the low-frequency signal and relaying it out.

71
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,714
OK. Good.

72
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,793
Chase'll let us know when the transaction's
complete and Jack has the virus.

73
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,873
Our units will move in,
taking full precautions to keep that virus safe.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,754
Ram Ãn, you have to get your men
out of sight before Amador arrives.

75
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,075
I know. Take Nina and send her inside.

76
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,839
- Hombres, vengan aca.
- Enseguida.

77
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,078
(Ram Ãn) Give me the map. I want
some men over here and some over there.

78
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,873
Tell them to keep their eyes open.

79
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,235
Ram Ãn, he's setting you up. I can prove it.

80
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,516
Luis, espera.

81
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,188
Really? How?

82
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,116
I was at CTU for seven years, I know
their protocols. I know how they'll play this.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,880
- I'm listening.
- Their attack teams won't be close.

84
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,589
They'll have one man doing reconnaissance.
He'll be watching now.

85
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
- You know where he would be?
- There's some high ground.

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,592
I bet he's there,
or 90 degrees west at the tree line.

87
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,076
We'll know soon enough.
Felipe, Pablo, check it out.

88
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,590
Make your approach from the sides
in case the woman is right.

89
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,678
I am right.

90
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,716
Vamonos.

91
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,995
- Kim, go over these format changes.
- Yeah.

92
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,192
Here, you're gonna need these files
for the repagination.

93
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,551
- What is that?
- It's a baby.

94
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,716
I can see that it's a baby. Whose is it?

95
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,068
- Chloe's.
- Chloe's?

96
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,714
Her baby-sitter
must have had an emergency...

97
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,671
- Chloe doesn't have a baby.
- She does.

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,837
She doesn't. I was in the search team
when Chloe got hired.

99
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,156
I did her background checks -
personal and medical histories.

100
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,308
- And she's never had a baby?
- No. It's definitely not her kid.

101
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,759
Felipe, Pablo. Call me with your positions.

102
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,110
- (over radio) It's Felipe.
- Where are you?

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,109
- At the tree line. There's no one here.
- Pablo, what about you?

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,195
Pablo.

105
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,153
Pablo, can you hear me?

106
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,310
They got to him.

107
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,875
- Pablo.
- He's dead. They're coming for you next.

108
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,991
What's going on?

109
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
What did you say to him?

110
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,075
What did you say to him?

111
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,069
(Pablo) Ram Ãn. It's me. I'm at the high ground.

112
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,880
- Do you see anything?
- No. There's no one here.

113
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,670
Right. Good. Hold your position.
And keep your eyes open.

114
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,119
OK.

115
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,871
Drop the walkie.

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,877
No more lies from you.

117
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,876
Amador will be here in 15 minutes.

118
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,913
Confirm he has the virus, give him
his money and bring the virus back to us.

119
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,032
You'll have one of my men with you
as your bodyguard.

120
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,880
But if you try to escape, or communicate
anything to Amador, he will kill you.

121
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,829
If he misses, there are three men in the hills
with sniper rifles aimed at your head.

122
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,031
If you want to live,
make sure this deal happens.

123
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,990
- Understood.
- Good.

124
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,311
How's Angela?

125
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,914
Adam just told me
you're not the mother of this child.

126
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,474
Who does the baby belong to?

127
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,874
- My boyfriend, Eric.
- Eric?

128
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,879
- Binder. Eric Binder.
- So why isn't he taking care of his daughter?

129
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,954
Cos it's the first place his ex-wife would look.
His ex-wife has custody of the baby.

130
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,833
She's seeing this guy
with a drinking problem,

131
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,348
then Eric found out that
he was abusing the baby.

132
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,837
- Why doesn't the ex-wife stop the boyfriend?
- She's in some kind of denial.

133
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,156
So why doesn't he call
Child Protective Services?

134
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,113
Eric has.

135
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,872
The social worker couldn't make it until
tomorrow. He's afraid that'll be too late.

136
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,072
- Wait. So he's kidnapping Angela?
- Technically. But just for tonight.

137
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,953
I don't care, Chloe. Kidnapping is a felony.

138
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,116
You wanna call the police, go ahead.

139
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,916
But if something bad happens, then that's
on you. So think about that. Think about it.

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,880
Chloe. Tony needs you.
Chase is transmitting.

141
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,192
- I'll be down there in a minute.
- No, he needs you now.

142
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,231
Is there a problem?

143
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,996
- No. No problem.
- Good.

144
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,149
Let me know how much
of her bottle she takes.

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,878
- Mr Kelly?
- Yeah. Come on in.

146
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,629
- Drink?
- Um...

147
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,871
No. Thank you.

148
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,355
We appreciate your help on this, Mr Kelly.

149
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,516
"We" meaning you and the president?

150
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,354
I am representing the president on this, yes.

151
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,916
So...

152
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,873
What can I tell you?

153
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,309
You can tell me what really happened.

154
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,510
What do you think happened?

155
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,590
I think Alan Milliken was driving the car
that hit and killed your daughter 12 years ago.

156
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,319
I... I wouldn't know.

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,675
You testified that you didn't see anything,
but I think you did.

158
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,555
And I think what you saw implicates Milliken.

159
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,316
Three weeks after your daughter's death,

160
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,476
an account was set up in your name at
Maritime Bank and a large deposit was made.

161
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,709
That was to keep your mouth shut, wasn't it?

162
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,230
This is a chance for you
to set everything right.

163
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,676
Yeah.

164
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,431
I saw Milliken driving the car that night.

165
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,870
Got the licence plate and everything.

166
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,316
But when I told that to the cop,
he takes me aside and he says:

167
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,719
"Your daughter's dead."

168
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,872
"Nothing you can do about that now."

169
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,073
"But if you keep your mouth shut, there's...

170
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,554
there's a payoff. A big one."

171
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,478
So I said I didn't see who killed my daughter.

172
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,993
It was blood money and I took it.

173
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,791
(sobs)

174
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,673
Mr Kelly.

175
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,796
Mr Kelly, we are gonna
have a press conference.

176
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,710
And you are gonna have a chance
to tell your story to everyone.

177
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,230
- I'm not gonna be doing this for nothing.
- How much money...

178
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,238
I don't want money.
I've already made that mistake.

179
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,590
OK, I'm sorry. Then what do you want?

180
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,995
My son.

181
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,117
My only living child.
He's doing a prison term, life sentence.

182
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
I want the president to pardon him.

183
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,112
- What was he convicted for?
- Murder. He's all I've got.

184
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,150
You get him outta prison, and I'll tell anyone
who wants to listen what really happened.

185
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,189
I don't care what Ram Ãn thinks,
I know you're still working with CTU.

186
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,990
You don't know anything. My interests
coincide with Ram Ãn's, and he knows it.

187
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,793
You've convinced everybody,
but I don't believe it.

188
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,469
Keep shooting your mouth off,
you're gonna get yourself killed.

189
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,558
Once he gets the virus,
he's gonna kill us both.

190
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,752
(Ram Ãn outside) Get the rest of the guns
outside.

191
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,472
Uncuff her. She needs to get going.

192
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,556
Get the briefcase.

193
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,114
If there is trouble, kill her first.

194
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,596
(Chase) She's got one of
Salazar's bodyguards with her.

195
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,750
Michelle, send the teams to their final marks.
Everybody get set, this is it.

196
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,398
(Chase) Myers and Salazar's men
are holding 300m away.

197
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,880
- Edmunds is still on point.
- No activity.

198
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,475
Make sure the Delta commander
has his field protocol straight.

199
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,874
Almeida.

200
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,197
It's Kim. I need to talk to you in private.

201
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,548
Right now?

202
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,036
Yeah. It's about Chloe. It's important.

203
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,715
All right. Tech One.

204
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,796
Keep me posted.

205
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,513
You want me to pardon this man's son,
a convicted murderer.

206
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,318
I know I'm asking a lot, David, but unless you
pardon Kelly's son, he's not gonna help us.

207
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,795
And how exactly is he supposed to help us?

208
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,874
12 years ago, Kelly was paid off not to
come forward as a witness against Milliken.

209
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,112
- What did he witness?
- Milliken killing his daughter,

210
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,199
while driving drunk.
Then drove off. Hit and run.

211
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,757
Kelly was the only witness. Milliken got
to him before the police report was filed.

212
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,156
- And he'll swear to this?
- All you have to do is pardon his son.

213
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,315
His name is Patrick Kelly. He's already served
four years of a life sentence.

214
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,431
I'll have to get back to you on this.

215
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,357
Just hurry, OK?

216
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,155
- What do you think?
- You know what I think.

217
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,880
You shouldn't be involved in this, David.

218
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,792
Give in to Milliken. Accept my resignation.

219
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,431
I told you. I am not Milliken's puppet
and I will not let him dictate my decisions.

220
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,237
You're gonna let your ex-wife convince you
to grant a quid pro quo pardon to a murderer.

221
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,717
She's only been back in your life
for a few hours and look what's happening.

222
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,434
I thought you'd be in favour
of what she's proposing.

223
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,435
Of you abusing the power of your office?
Absolutely not, David. It is wrong.

224
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,479
When you wanted me to pay hush money
to Anne's ex-husband, that was justified?

225
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,591
The difference is that...

226
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,351
David, I have your best interests at heart.
You know that.

227
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,471
I'm sorry, but Sherry has her own,
and she always has.

228
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,588
Your loyalty, which I am grateful for,

229
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,636
does not change the fact that when
someone wants to get down in the mud,

230
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,678
the only way to fight back
is to get down in it with them.

231
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,598
So you're gonna grant the pardon?

232
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,276
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

233
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
- What is it?
- There's something you need to know.

234
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,553
If this is about Chloe's baby,
I don't have time.

235
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,869
It's not her baby. Chloe does not have a baby.
And, frankly, I think she's delusional.

236
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,630
- What are you talking about?
- Look, Chloe does not have a child.

237
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,797
I confronted her.
She said this was her boyfriend's baby,

238
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,270
and that the mother of this child
was letting her get abused.

239
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,757
I spoke to Child Protective Services.
They said there was no abuse claim filed.

240
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,308
- You sure?
- Positive.

241
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,354
- Have you talked to her since you found out?
- No. When I confronted her, she was losing it.

242
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,871
Look, this is what I'm worried about -
I think she's unstable.

243
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,873
Kim.

244
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,431
- I need you to take a step back here.
- My father and Chase's lives are in her hands.

245
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,880
- That's why we can't do anything now.
- What do you mean?

246
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,871
Chloe is our only lifeline.

247
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,635
She's the only one capable
of filtering Chase's audio streams.

248
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,598
- If Chloe is unstable...
- We don't have an alternative.

249
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,439
We have got to keep her in place.

250
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,835
What about the baby?

251
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,432
Whoever her parents are, they must
be going out of their minds right now.

252
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,510
Take care of that baby until this operation
is over. I do not want Chloe distracted.

253
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,470
I'm not happy about this.
Let's hope Chloe holds it together.

254
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,515
We'll deal with the baby
once we get possession of the virus.

255
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,876
Mr Kelly?

256
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,878
Mr Kelly?

257
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,436
Mr Kelly?

258
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,796
(gasps)

259
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,996
Hold on, I hear something.
It's a car approaching.

260
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,509
Chase is reporting a car approaching.

261
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Salazar's men are sitting tight. No sign
of Amador's men and no other vehicles.

262
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,835
Chase.

263
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,990
I've got a visual. Two men inside.

264
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,638
It's Amador and his bodyguard.

265
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,671
Ram Ãn.

266
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,756
Amador's arriving.

267
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,469
(Chase) They're exiting the car.
Amador's got a case in his hand.

268
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,192
- Where's Delta?
- 90 seconds away.

269
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,229
No one makes a move
until we're sure it's the virus. Understood?

270
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,993
Understood.

271
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,598
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

272
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,199
Good.

273
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,988
The transfer protocol
is in place with the bank?

274
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,113
I'll transfer the funds
once I've verified the virus. So let's see it.

275
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,515
It looks like he's gonna
give her the virus now.

276
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,833
(Chase) He's taking a canister from the case.

277
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,235
He's unscrewing the lid.

278
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,909
It should take about five minutes
to confirm it's the virus.

279
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,669
We don't have enough audio filters.

280
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,997
- The library on  Átude three, should I use it?
- Yeah.

281
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,198
- Mr Palmer, this is Tony Almeida.
- Give me an update.

282
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,279
The exchange of the virus hasn't happened
yet. We expect it at any moment.

283
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,195
The Pentagon is furious at having
to play catch-up. I don't blame them.

284
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,676
This operation began as a secret
between three CTU agents,

285
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,880
and, I reiterate, when this is over,
the president will hold you accountable.

286
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,839
I understand. But if you're reprimanding me,
you're doing us both a disservice.

287
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,839
- I need to focus on this operation.
- This operation, how large is it?

288
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,880
We have six Delta teams,
waiting for the signal to go in.

289
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,030
- Will that be sufficient?
- It has to be.

290
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,038
Any more bodies down there,
we risk being spotted.

291
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,630
- Tell me what's gonna happen.
- We don't have time for this.

292
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,877
You've asked the president
to support you on this and he has.

293
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,795
You put him way out on a limb here.
He wants to know what the plan is.

294
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,714
Michael Amador, the seller,
will hand the virus over to Nina Myers.

295
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,673
He doesn't know that Myers
is now under our control.

296
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,792
After the exchange,
Delta teams move in, secure the virus,

297
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,759
take Nina Myers, Michael Amador
and Ram Ãn Salazar into custody.

298
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,235
A lot of things are gonna have to go perfectly.

299
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,880
That's true. But we're pretty sure
we have our bases covered.

300
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,873
Pretty sure isn't good enough.
You make this happen.

301
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,871
Yes, sir.

302
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,108
How much longer?

303
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,870
Chase is watching. Myers is still testing
to confirm that it is the Cordilla virus.

304
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,712
Tell me when he sees movement.

305
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,876
- I know to do that, Tony.
- Then do it.

306
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,872
- I put an extra filter in your volume.
- I don't need it.

307
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,838
- You asked for it.
- I found a plug-in that worked.

308
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,193
- Why not tell me instead of wasting my time?
- Leave me alone, Adam.

309
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,277
Tony.

310
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,755
Yeah.

311
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,350
- Some things about Chloe concern me.
- I know about the baby.

312
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,349
Are we right to let her run point on this? If we
make any mistakes, we could lose the virus.

313
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,029
Adam, channel two is floating.
Use a phase loop to lock it down.

314
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,072
OK. Just do what she says.

315
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,075
- What's the matter?
- They changed the access code to Division.

316
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,156
Yeah. Here.

317
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,154
There.

318
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,236
Thanks.

319
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,874
(Chloe) OK, we're on.

320
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,950
(Chase) The testing device is finishing.

321
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,833
- What's going on?
- They're about to get confirmation.

322
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,869
(beeping)

323
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,871
The signatures match.

324
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,912
- It's the virus. It is the virus.
- Send Delta in.

325
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,871
Delta teams, green light. Go!

326
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,871
I'll take that.

327
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,872
Until the funds are in place.

328
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,877
- (woman) Transfers.
- Fund transfer locater 65-1911374.

329
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,559
Waiting to confirm.

330
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,317
Your bank is on the phone
to confirm the transfer of the funds.

331
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,036
- Yes?
- 65-1911374 verified.

332
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,628
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,435
Our business is done.

334
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,028
Good luck.

335
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:20,110
Amador is out of the building. He's left
the case containing the virus with Nina.

336
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,872
They're in the car.
Turning around, heading north.

337
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,120
- Have a Delta unit pick him up.
- OK.

338
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,155
(Chase) Nina's on her way.

339
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,431
She's carrying the...

340
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,438
- What did he say?
- He thinks Nina's leaving with the virus.

341
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
(static)

342
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,314
- What is wrong?
- The channel's modulating.

343
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,877
- I know. I'm switching to Sat 9.
- What? In the middle of a meet?

344
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,673
- What's going on here?
- lt'll be fine in a second.

345
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,996
- Switch it back to Sat 3.
- No.

346
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,190
- Are you crazy?
- Sat 3 is out of range.

347
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,949
It had a glitch in its software.
I had to switch it or we would have lost it.

348
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,878
Chase, do you copy?

349
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,873
Chase, do you copy?

350
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,518
- We should be getting a clear signal now.
- Chase, do you copy?

351
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,393
(static)

352
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,476
Chase, do you copy?

353
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,879
Yeah, I copy. Nina's still in visual range
and she's headed towards the building.

354
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,071
Delta's 50 seconds away.

355
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,030
Let's go.

356
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,956
Good job.

357
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,435
Ram Ãn, we should go.

358
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,394
No, Jack. I don't need you any more.

359
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,119
He's gonna kill him.
Delta teams won't get there.

360
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,913
- We had a deal.
- My brother died because of you.

361
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,519
(gunshot)

362
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,516
Chase.

363
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,716
(gunshots)

364
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,908
Chase!

365
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,871
- Chase, come in.
- Delta's here.

366
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,678
I'm moving in.

367
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,236
Ram Ãn!

368
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,149
Salazar's on the move with the virus.
Repeat, he has the virus.

369
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,274
He's headed west between the buildings.
Jack is in pursuit.

370
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:31,396
You two, you're with me. All men in pursuit.
Repeat, Salazar has the virus.

371
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,551
(phone rings)

372
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,997
- Hello.
- Hello, Julia. It's Sherry Palmer.

373
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,435
I'm sorry to call so late. Are you alone?

374
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,235
Yes. It is very late, Sherry.
Why are you calling?

375
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,590
I know what your husband is doing to David.

376
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,359
- I can't do anything about that.
- That's not true.

377
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,473
You don't see any reason to do anything,
but I'm gonna give you a reason.

378
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,275
- What are you talking about?
- I know your situation, Julia.

379
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,396
Alan is too controlling to let you go. You're
not willing to sacrifice everything to get out.

380
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,750
You're making assumptions. I'm hanging up.

381
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,032
No. I'm telling the truth and you know it.
But I can help you, Julia.

382
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,630
I can help you get away from Alan
without giving everything up.

383
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,513
- This is ridiculous.
- You know me, Julia.

384
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,196
When I say I can make something happen,
you better believe I can.

385
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,432
- How would you do this?
- We need to meet in person.

386
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,551
- When?
- It has to be now.

387
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,036
I can't leave at this time
without Alan wondering what I'm doing.

388
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,310
Then I'm coming to you.

389
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,313
- (twig snaps)
- (Chase) Jack, hold your fire.

390
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,874
- Chase?
- Yeah.

391
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,231
- You're all right.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

392
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,798
Our first priority is the virus. Ram Ãn is our
second. Anybody gets a visual, do not fire.

393
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,869
Copy.

394
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,112
I lost him down the path.
If I were him, I'd head north.

395
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,471
Headed north, he'll run into the river.

396
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,151
Give the chopper our coordinates. Send a
team down the path in case he doubles back.

397
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,716
Four of you down that path.
I want two of you with me.

398
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,880
Ram Ãn is in possession of the virus.
He's headed north of position 453.6.

399
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,235
(man over radio) Roger. 453.6.

400
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,277
(man over radio) This is Air One.
We have visual confirmed.

401
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,356
(groaning)

402
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,269
(Jack) It's over, Ram Ãn.
There's nowhere else for you to go.

403
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,595
- I'm not going back to jail.
- Put the cylinder down and we'll talk about it.

404
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,678
Stop, Jack. There's nothing to talk about.

405
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,392
(groans)

406
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,114
Put the cylinder down!

407
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,429
I don't want to have to shoot you.
Just put the cylinder down.

408
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,676
- Jack, say the word.
- Not now.

409
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,473
Ram Ãn, I have the authority to cut a deal.
All we want is the virus.

410
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,433
Just put the cylinder down slowly.

411
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,872
Please. I don't want to shoot you.

412
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,873
There you go.
Just put it on the ground nice and easy.

413
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,835
Good.

414
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,235
(cylinder makes whistling sound)

415
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,350
- Chase, are you all right?
- Yeah.

416
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,630
Gimme your phone.

417
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,589
- (woman) CTU.
- Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida now.

418
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,309
- (Tony) What's going on, Jack?
- We do not have the virus.

419
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,274
The cylinder was rigged with a bomb.
Amador must have switched it.

420
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,868
- Do we have a position on him?
- Delta's on him.

421
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,674
It must have been Amador's plan,
which means he has an escape route.

422
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,880
- Advise Delta team.
- We're on him.

423
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,917
Tony, Nina Myers is out there too.

424
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,879
- Any chance she was involved?
- No. The bomb was for her.

425
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,880
Delta has Amador pinned.
They're 2km west of you, Jack.

426
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,872
Copy that. We're moving.
Chase, get your team ready.

427
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,316
Two clicks to the west. Split the road.

428
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,716
Copy, Delta Three.

429
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,358
Get out of the vehicle now!

430
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,276
Hands in the air.

431
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,440
Move a muscle, you're dead.

432
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,876
Very slowly, get on the ground.

433
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
Do it now!

434
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,109
Go.

435
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,156
Tony, the Delta unit's been taken out.
Amador's escaped.

436
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,472
Amador's cellphone signal
just went completely dead.

437
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,079
Jack.

438
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,073
- Jack, come in.
- Yeah, this is Bauer.

439
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,868
Amador ambushed Delta Three.

440
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,474
- It was a setup.
- Do you have a position?

441
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,876
We were tracking him by his cellphone signal.
We lost it in the ambush.

442
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,069
Satellite?

443
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,192
No. There's no visual satellite coverage
of this area.

444
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,875
Son of a bitch. Copy that.

445
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,992
Delta Three's been taken out.
They don't have Amador's position.

446
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,588
- What do you wanna do?
- We gotta find Nina.

447
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,917
Take a team up to the high ground.
I'll cover down here.

448
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,838
You guys, come on. We'll find her.
