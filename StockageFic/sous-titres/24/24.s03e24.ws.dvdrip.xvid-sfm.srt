1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,511
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up
with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,519
I can call Foxton and he can make this
disappear. You just give me the OK.

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,757
- David put you up to this, didn't he?
- Sherry, l...

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,156
The police think I killed Alan.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,512
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.
It's nobody's fault but your own.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,719
Oh, my God. Sherry...

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,918
No!

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,356
You committed treason.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,357
You facilitated the escape of a man

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,233
who was responsible
for the death of Ryan Chappelle

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,669
and almost a thousand civilians.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,395
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,037
Tell me how to find your couriers,
or I'll put her in that building.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,914
- She has nothing to do with this!
- Neither do the people in those body bags.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,749
When your daughter is infected,
I'm gonna make you watch her die.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,995
Dad, stop them!

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,750
- Stephen, you're out of time!
- Stop! Stop! I'll tell you!

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,633
Where's the 11th vial?

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,990
- Los Angeles.
- What's the target?

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,949
He was told to select a public place where
maximum casualties would be inflicted.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,311
(Chloe) Target has stopped moving.
The target has stopped.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,238
Drop the bag!
Get on the ground, now! Don't move!

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,272
- What's going on?
- Where is it? Where is it?

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,753
- Where's what?
- Chase.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,316
- What are you doing? What's going on?
- I've got a signal.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,710
What are you looking for?

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,913
It's just the transmitter.
This man is not Rabens.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,837
Shut the station down now!

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,189
This is Dessler.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,677
It's Jack. We just lost Rabens. He dumped
the GPS beacon onto an innocent.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,797
- He still has the virus?
- We have to assume so.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,912
We're sweeping the station.
We've locked down the building.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,112
- We'll set up checkpoints.
- How will you find Rabens?

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,029
We need Saunders to do an lD. Move him to
Chloe's station. We're setting up a live feed.

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,151
We'll be ready on our end.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,509
Michelle, Gael Ortega's wife Theresa's here.

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,398
All right, Jesse. Send her in.

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,149
According to Chloe's statement,
you were working to bring down Saunders,

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,114
even while you were complying
with his demands.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,911
Yeah, that's right. I gave Chloe a recording
of a conversation between Saunders and...

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,036
Chloe also said you intentionally scrambled
the voice to slow down her progress.

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,111
Tony, did you put Michelle's life
ahead of public safety or national security?

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,712
Yes.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,992
I did.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,119
They said he was exposed to a virus.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,515
Yeah, that's right.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,355
Did he suffer?

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,389
No. He went quickly.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,914
(sobs) Gael...

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,553
He was a hero.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,470
He tried to stop the virus being released,
and when it was, he just kept working.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,553
Till the end.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,039
Thank you.

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,156
Thank you.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,030
Can I pick up his things?

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,991
Of course.

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,795
I'll see what I can do.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,036
Wait here.

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,272
- Kim?
- Yes, Michelle?

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,278
That's Mrs Ortega. Gael's wife.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,315
I need you to take her to his station to
pick up his personal belongings. Thank you.

62
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,715
(Michelle) Sit him down.

63
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,717
(phone rings)

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,795
Hello?

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,071
(Chloe) I need you.
Saunders is here to lD Rabens.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,952
Well, I'm with Mrs Ortega.

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,319
Michelle said I could reassign anyone, and
I want you. Please don't make me ask again.

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,069
Fine. I'll get Barry to watch her.

69
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,716
- Barry?
- Yeah?

70
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,113
Please watch Mrs Ortega
while she gathers Gael's things.

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,037
Sure.

72
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,709
- Take as much time as you need.
- Thanks.

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,719
- Excuse me, Barry. Can I get a signature?
- Sure.

74
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,192
Thanks.

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,754
- (Barry) Anything else?
- No, that's all.

76
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,758
Sir, if you'll just step up
to the monitor. Right here.

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,030
Chin up, please, sir.

78
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,676
Chin up.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,560
(Saunders) Move in closer on 2A.

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,596
- Jack, it's me.
- Any matches?

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,631
- Nothing yet.
- How far have you got?

82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,115
We've gone through
the first two sets of photos.

83
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,357
- Next group is uploading. Stand by.
- (Saunders) It's not him.

84
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,074
- Is there anything on this page?
- Try 3B closer up.

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,038
No, that's not him.

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,550
No.

87
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,397
- No.
- Do we have a match?

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,956
- Negative, Jack.
- Don't see him anywhere.

89
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,036
- Next.
- Yeah.

90
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,512
Head up, sir.

91
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,351
- Bring up 5B.
- No.

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,550
- Are you sure?
- He's not here.

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,796
Bring up the next page.

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,952
What about this one? No?

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,358
- He killed Gael! Don't you understand?
- I need medical!

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,517
- What's going on over there?
- Saunders has been shot.

97
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,631
What are you talking about?
Who shot him?

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,833
Gael's wife. Hold on, Jack.
I need medical here now!

99
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,749
- What is his condition?
- Looks critical.

100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,475
Do everything you can to keep him alive.
He's our only connection to Rabens.

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,989
- Chase.
- Yeah?

102
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,710
- Jack?
- Talk to me.

103
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,479
- He didn't make it.
- Son of a bitch.

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,872
We'll get back to you.
Saunders has just been shot. He's dead.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,390
- (man) Don't move, ma'am. Don't move.
- (Theresa sobs)

106
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,478
(Theresa) He did kill... Gael...

107
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,113
(PA) The service
is experiencing significant delays.

108
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,628
From the couriers and our own intelligence,

109
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,993
we've been able to confirm that Saunders
was the sole architect of today's actions.

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,518
If we catch this last man, Arthur Rabens,
that'll be the end of the threat.

111
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,031
And if not, we're back to square one
and the virus is back on the market.

112
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,229
Find him.

113
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,397
- Hello, Wayne.
- Joseph, could you give us a minute?

114
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,432
- Thank you, Joseph.
- Mr President.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,399
Well? Did you get the prescription bottle
from Sherry's house?

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,909
Yeah.

117
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,713
Well, that's good.

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,072
David...

119
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,554
David, something horrible happened
and I don't...

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,955
Sherry's dead.

121
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,156
What?

122
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,994
How?

123
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,673
Julia. She came in and she killed her,
and then she turned the gun on herself.

124
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,114
They're both dead?

125
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,116
Yeah.

126
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,468
Listen, I'm not gonna try to pretend
that we can just put this behind us.

127
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,153
But the fact is... The fact is that
politically we're free of everything.

128
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,796
Free of Milliken's extortion, his death.
Free of Sherry's involvement.

129
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,278
You're thinking of the politics of this?

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,232
The mother of my children
has just been murdered.

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,796
And the woman that I love
just killed herself in front of me.

132
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,191
I understand how you feel.

133
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,314
But there's a story here, David.
There's a story that can tie this all together.

134
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,869
Alan Milliken was having
an affair with Sherry.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Julia found out
and then she killed them both.

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,831
- Oh, no. I don't wanna hear it.
- Your emotions are clouding...

137
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,279
No!

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,958
David, please, just listen to me.

139
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,436
Leave me alone.

140
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,276
David, please...

141
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,272
Jeannie?

142
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,039
Yes, Mr President?

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,553
Would you get my son and my daughter
on a conference line, please?

144
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,071
Separate the crowd into units of ten,
an officer to each unit.

145
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,149
That officer's to make sure no one leaves
that unit unless authorised by a CTU agent.

146
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,030
I understand.

147
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,676
We're also gonna search every passenger.
Then we're gonna verify their identification.

148
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,439
- Be here all day.
- Not if we find him.

149
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,712
Initiate another search of the station,
including the tracks a mile in each direction.

150
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,752
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,829
Jack, we're locked down.
We've got two men at every exit.

152
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,876
Good.

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,033
- Is there anything else we can do right now?
- Not until we get an lD on Rabens.

154
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,520
Jack, listen.

155
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,038
About Mexico. I hope you know I understand
you were just doing your job.

156
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,357
Look, it took me a long time to understand
that if you wanna do this job well,

157
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,829
you have to stay detached.

158
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,315
If you can accept that, you'll be fine.

159
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,476
Yeah.

160
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,239
Well, I have accepted it.

161
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,477
That's why I'm thinking after today I'm done.

162
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,435
I don't wanna be detached, Jack.

163
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,313
Not from Kim, not from my daughter.

164
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,551
I'm gonna request a transfer to the floor.

165
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,478
Are you sure about this?

166
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,955
I'd still be serving my country.

167
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,789
I'd take care of the people I care about.

168
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,275
I owe them that, Jack.

169
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,918
What'd Kim say?

170
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,750
I think she's willing to give it a try
as long as I'm not in field ops.

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,360
What do you think, Jack?

172
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,392
I'm the last person you should be asking.

173
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,390
This is between you and Kim.

174
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,709
Whatever you choose I would support.

175
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,200
You're a good man, Chase.

176
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,393
Let's go. Moving in.
Form a line here, sir.

177
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,640
Fast. We'll be checking your belongings
and your identification.

178
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,156
Sir, please. At the end.
Thank you, sir.

179
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,956
You only have nine people here.
Where's the man in the brown jacket?

180
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,789
- I don't know.
- We have a passenger unaccounted for.

181
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,149
This is Jack Bauer. We have two
LAPD officers down at the northwest exit.

182
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,556
I need transportation
to meet me on the corner.

183
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,269
(people shouting)

184
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,116
(man) Help!

185
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,678
- I'm a federal agent. What happened?
- A carjacking.

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,439
- Did you get a make on the car?
- No.

187
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,753
This is Jack Bauer. We've got
a civilian casualty on Hope and 7th.

188
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,670
- Did you see which way the car went?
- He went straight down there.

189
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,758
I need that transportation now.

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,110
Michelle, this is Jack.
Rabens is out of the station.

191
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,913
He was headed east on 5th Street
five minutes ago.

192
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,112
I need to lD a stolen car.
Get me a DMV readout on a...

193
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,438
- Frank Cassar.
- Then set up roadblocks at a five-mile radius.

194
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,873
Coordinate sat surveillance,
traffic cameras, everything we've got.

195
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,716
(phone rings)

196
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,673
Yeah?

197
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,154
All right. I'll be right out.

198
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,355
I need to step out.

199
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,959
(door opens)

200
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,030
Brad, Rabens is gone. He got through
the perimeter at the MTA station.

201
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,357
- How the hell did that happen?
- Doesn't matter how. It happened.

202
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,233
We identified the vehicle he carjacked,
a blue Malibu.

203
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,033
We set up a roadblock
and uplinked traffic cams,

204
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,948
but I need Tony to coordinate
the data flow with Tactical.

205
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,710
There's no downside here, Brad. He's not
a flight risk, and he'd be a major asset.

206
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,674
- I could be brought up on charges.
- We can't lose Rabens.

207
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,110
So unless you wanna take responsibility
and run Tactical yourself...

208
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,513
You're wasting time, Brad.

209
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,554
We need you on the floor.

210
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,916
- Come on, Chloe, where's Rabens?
- Just a second, Jack.

211
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,397
I think I've got a match. A light green Malibu,
intersection of 5th and Vanowen.

212
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,954
We're only a few blocks away.
We'll go there now.

213
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,232
- Adam, get me a closer shot of that plate.
- Doing it now.

214
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,676
I'm back in play, Jack.
Michelle got me up to speed.

215
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,475
- Tony, how long till the plate's lD'd?
- Adam, do we have a match?

216
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,313
- Yes. It's him. The plates match.
- Jack, it's him.

217
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,477
- Where's he headed?
- East on Del Mar, just past Franklin.

218
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,070
It's the next block. Right there, right there!

219
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,190
We got him. He's headed south
on Manning. We need backup.

220
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,355
Copy that.

221
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,751
- Tony, where's that backup coming in from?
- From the east and the south.

222
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,031
We just made a right.
We're headed west on De Soto.

223
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,159
Move that thing now!

224
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,316
We've been cut off. He made a right onto
Lawndale. We're three blocks behind him.

225
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,149
Three vehicles are ready to cut him off.
We're gonna corner him.

226
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,831
- (Tony) We got him pinned on Chamberlain.
- Keep him there. We're two blocks away.

227
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,118
He ran into the middle school
on Chamberlain, main entrance.

228
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,789
Tony, we're coming up
on the middle school now.

229
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,951
He's in the school. I'll get back to you.

230
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,436
Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits.
We cannot evacuate.

231
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,358
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move.

232
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,829
Haynes, cover the west exit.

233
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,998
Get anything? Cover your exit.
No one leaves this building.

234
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,998
Chase, take your man.
Search the auditorium.

235
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,628
(PA) All students are to remain
in their classrooms and lock their doors.

236
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,753
I repeat, remain in the classrooms
and lock the doors.

237
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,277
Chase, it's Jack.
Second floor is clear. Do you copy?

238
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,196
Chase?

239
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,552
No!

240
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,317
(gunshots)

241
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,795
Now, Chase, just lay still.
Everything's gonna be all right.

242
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,070
This is the only thing I could do
to keep him from escaping with the virus.

243
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,077
(Jack grunts)

244
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,760
Don't waste your time. It's not coming off.

245
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,957
- What are you talking about?
- Rabens didn't even try to remove it.

246
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,470
If he could unlock it, he would have.

247
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,070
Tony, Rabens is dead.
The virus is in our possession.

248
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,628
The dispersal device has been activated.
I've got no idea how long we've got.

249
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,433
Find a secure container, anything airtight.

250
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,597
I can't do that.
The device is attached to Chase's wrist.

251
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,238
- What?
- I'll explain later.

252
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,353
Put me in touch with one of the teams
that have disarmed the device already.

253
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,040
- I'll get back to you.
- Hurry.

254
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,834
Just support the device.

255
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,912
I don't know how this is gonna turn out,
but tell Kim I'm sorry.

256
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,474
Whatever you gotta tell Kim, tell her yourself.

257
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,354
We'll get through this.
You just stay with me. We'll get through this.

258
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,997
- (Tony) Jack, I'm patching you through.
- OK.

259
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,269
Roger Summers here.

260
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,837
Roger, my partner had to fasten
the dispersal device to his wrist.

261
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,077
I need to figure out how to disarm the timer
or remove the clamp.

262
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,596
The clamp's titanium, and it's wired
to the tamper-proof mechanism.

263
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,597
Fine, then let's disarm the timer.

264
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,555
- There's a plate at the end. Open that up.
- OK, I see it.

265
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,193
Chase, stay with me. Stay with me!

266
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,669
I've got the timer.
Three minutes 51 seconds, counting down.

267
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,033
You should see six wires to the left.
Separate them from each other.

268
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,873
- OK. Done.
- The furthest to the left should be red.

269
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,872
Cut it without making contact
with the others.

270
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,115
You ready?

271
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,308
I cut the red wire,
but it's still counting down.

272
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,834
The timer will stop with the next cut. Locate
the green wire. It's in the group to the right.

273
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,193
Roger, I don't have a green wire.

274
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,110
- What colour wires do you have?
- Orange, yellow, black and purple.

275
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,869
The devices don't match. Don't panic. And
don't cut any wires until we figure this out.

276
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,197
Hurry. We're running out of time.

277
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,719
- Jack, you need to go.
- I'm not going anywhere without you.

278
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,388
- Do it.
- They're gonna call back.

279
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,353
- You have to.
- They're gonna call back!

280
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,596
It's OK.

281
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,558
Man down in the third-floor science lab,
northeast corner of the building,

282
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,638
requiring medical assistance.
Emergency! Now!

283
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,756
(door opens)

284
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,869
- Could you give us a minute, please?
- Sure thing. Come on.

285
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,917
What's going on?

286
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,716
I'm back in custody.
Hammond's taking me down to Federal.

287
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,198
No. They can't do this, not after everything
you've accomplished today.

288
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,678
Michelle, I put your wellbeing
above the country's.

289
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,394
Nothing anybody can say
will ever change that fact.

290
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,712
But they can't... they can't put you in prison.

291
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,718
Yes, they can. And they will,
for a long time, believe me.

292
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,512
Tony, don't talk like this.

293
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,316
- I can't... I won't give up on you...
- Michelle, come on. Please, don't do this.

294
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,233
Baby, you're alive.

295
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,193
And nobody else got hurt
because of what I did.

296
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,278
That's more than I hoped for.

297
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,439
I can live with that.

298
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,955
- Even in prison.
- (man) Tony, it's time.

299
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,550
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

300
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,710
(phone rings)

301
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,677
- This is Bauer.
- Agent Bauer, please hold for the president.

302
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,591
- Jack?
- Mr President.

303
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,716
I wanted to thank you personally, not only for
what you've done today, but for everything.

304
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,152
This country continues to owe you
a great debt of gratitude.

305
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,191
Thank you, sir.

306
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,993
I put you in an unimaginable position
earlier today

307
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,556
when I asked you to take the life
of one of your colleagues.

308
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,717
Please forgive me for that.

309
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,472
Mr President, there's nothing to forgive.
It's what had to be done.

310
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,433
And it wasn't the only sacrifice made today.

311
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,436
I understand.

312
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,315
- How's Agent Edmunds doing?
- He's in surgery now.

313
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,750
It's gonna be a few days before we know
whether or not he can use his hand.

314
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,232
When he's strong enough to talk,
I'd like to thank him personally.

315
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,910
He would appreciate that, sir.

316
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,112
You know, Jack, men and women like you...

317
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,839
your courage
and level of commitment humbles me.

318
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,509
Thank you. I'll let everyone know at CTU
that you appreciated the job they did.

319
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,108
And, Jack, there's one more thing.

320
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,835
Please don't discuss this with anyone
until it becomes public,

321
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,431
but I wanted you
to hear it from me personally.

322
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,433
I've decided not to seek re-election.

323
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,915
This will be my only term.

324
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,669
I hope you don't mind me saying so,
but I think you're making a mistake.

325
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,712
Mistake or not, it's what I've decided.

326
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,988
When I'm a private citizen,
I hope we can become better friends.

327
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,873
That would be an honour, sir.

328
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,554
Thank you, Jack.

329
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,671
Thank you, Mr President.

Right in there.

335
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,235
- Dad.
- Hey.

336
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,071
Is Chase gonna be OK?

337
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,555
The doctors are very optimistic.

338
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,275
- They got him into surgery very quickly.
- Thank God.

339

Come here.

340
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,079
I hear you and Chase
are gonna make some changes.

341
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,273
- I'm very happy for you.
- I thought you were gonna be upset.

342
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:19,269
I'm so proud of you. I'm sure whatever
choices you make will be the right ones.

343
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,675
Thank you, Dad.

344
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,711
Thank you.

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,435
You gonna be OK?

346
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,113
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

347
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,830
There are some things I have to do...

348
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,394
but I'm gonna be fine.

349
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,593
- Are you gonna wait here for Chase?
- Yeah.

350
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,280
I've gotta leave for a little while. I'll be back.

351
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,952
OK.

352
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,038
- I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

Jack?

355
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,671
- This is Jack.
- I just got a call from District.

356
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,750
They've started interrogating Saunders'
courier. We could use your help.

357
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,200
- Jack?
- Y eah.

358
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,039
Jack, did you copy?

359
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,515
I'm on my way.
