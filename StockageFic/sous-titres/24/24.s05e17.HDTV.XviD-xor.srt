1
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:17,500
CTU is being absorbed by the
Department of Homeland Security,

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,300
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

3
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,734
MILES:
<i>Ms. Raines signed</i>
<i>a detailed statement</i>

4
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,367
<i>documenting</i>
<i>the numerous missteps</i>

5
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,634
made today by CTU,

6
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,534
and by you,
in particular.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,467
CHLOE:
<i>I don't understand,</i>
<i>why am I staying</i>

8
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:31,934
and everybody else
is being let go?

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,667
Because Ms. Raines requested
that you keep your position.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,333
I had to keep Karen
from replacing you,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,567
that's why
I signed the document,

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,300
I didn't have a choice.

13
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,634
Why were those men
trying to kill you?

14
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,101
David had a source
inside the White House.

15
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,667
Who's the source?

16
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,667
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

17
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,034
I have proof about who's behind

18
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,333
everything that's
happened today.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,500
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Someone killed David...

20
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,367
and they just
tried to kill me.

21
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:57,233
I have to go now...
Give me what I need!

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,267
They kidnapped
my little girl.

23
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,101
Evelyn.

24
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:05,901
I promise you we're going
to get your daughter back.

25
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,400
I already told them

26
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,767
I wouldn't give up
any information

27
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,034
<i>until I have my daughter.</i>

28
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:10,867
JACK ( <i>over radio</i> ):
We need Henderson alive;

29
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:11,934
do not shoot to kill.

30
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,333
Did you bring what we discussed?

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
I have the evidence with me.

32
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:18,367
I want my daughter.

33
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:22,233
She's moving.

34
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,667
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

35
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:26,367
Now.

36
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:27,367
( <i>gunfire</i> )

37
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:28,567
( <i>screaming</i> )

38
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:29,667
Wayne, I didn't get him--

39
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,101
if you got a shot, take it!

40
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:32,801
( <i>gunshots</i> )

41
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:34,233
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

42
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,467
Chloe, it's Jack, Henderson
escaped in Evelyn's car!

43
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,901
Do you have him on satellite?

44
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,467
We can't lose him!

45
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,101
Evelyn's been hit.

46
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,267
JACK:
It's not serious,

47
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,667
but it's gonna
have to be dressed.

48
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:44,901
Evelyn, you've got
your daughter back,

49
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,534
now tell me what
I need to know.

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,734
Who is behind this?
Is it the vice president?

51
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,500
The vice president
has nothing to do with this!

52
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,701
LOGAN ( <i>over phone</i> ):
You promised me you would
control the situation.

53
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,901
I didn't count on Jack Bauer
showing up, sir.

54
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,068
Bauer and Wayne Palmer
won't be around long enough

55
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,567
to tell anybody else
what they know.

56
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:06,267
HENDERSON ( <i>over phone</i> ):
I will not let you down.

57
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,001
See that you don't.

58
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,400
WAYNE:
<i>The lanes are cut off.</i>

59
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:29,934
Okay, Evelyn, I need
you to stay focused.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The recording of the phone call
that you made

61
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,567
between President Logan
and Henderson

62
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:35,567
is in a safety
deposit box--
which bank?

63
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,868
Which bank?

64
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,901
City Trust and Savings
in Agoura Hills.

65
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:41,934
Where's the key?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,934
My jacket pocket.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Mom?

68
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,501
JACK:
It's all right,
sweetheart,

69
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,801
your mom's going to be fine.

70
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,000
She's going
to be fine, okay?

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,133
Jack, you heard
what they said.

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,567
We have to get off this road,

73
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:56,634
there are military patrols
everywhere.

74
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,267
There's a motel up there
on the right.

75
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:00,100
Turn in there.

76
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,868
I want to go home.

77
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,133
We're gonna get
you home, honey.

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,100
We're gonna get you home.

79
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,467
Wayne, can you get us a room.

80
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll keep watch.

81
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,834
Make sure you keep
pressure on the wound,

82
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,968
I'll be right back.

83
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,300
( <i>phone speed dialing</i> )

84
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,868
( <i>ringing</i> )

85
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,367
Hello?
JACK ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Audrey, it's Jack.

86
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you got Henderson
on satellite yet?

87
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,167
No, Chloe wasn't able
to reposition in time.

88
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:51,334
JACK:
Damn it!

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,767
Are you still
on a secure line?

90
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:53,868
Yes. Why,
what's going on?

91
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,934
Evelyn didn't
implicate Gardner.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,834
She implicated President Logan.

93
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:01,100
Oh, my God, Jack.

94
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,634
Logan? Are you sure?

95
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,968
She said he was responsible for
everything that happened today,

96
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,200
starting with providing the
terrorists with the nerve gas.

97
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:08,901
That's what David Palmer
found out.

98
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,033
That's why
they killed him.

99
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,267
Are you saying that
President Logan

100
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,701
ordered Palmer's
assassination?

101
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:13,801
Henderson gave
the order.

102
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,067
But Evelyn says
she has evidence

103
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,701
that shows that President Logan
was complicit.

104
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,334
What kind of evidence?

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,267
She recorded a conversation
earlier this morning

106
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,734
between Henderson
and President Logan.

107
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,467
She put it in a safety
deposit box in a bank.

108
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:24,734
We're on our way
to get it now.

109
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,167
Jack, the city is
under martial law.

110
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,567
I know. I need you to upload

111
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:29,834
every military
checkpoint to my PDA

112
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,467
so we can navigate
our way around them.

113
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,934
All right,
I'll take care of that.

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Audrey, as soon as I have
the recording,

115
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,901
we're going to have
to involve your father.

116
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,901
We need someone in the
government, someone credible,

117
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,601
to present the evidence.

118
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,334
All right.

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
He's on his way back
from a summit in Japan.

120
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,634
I'll call him
on the plane.

121
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,868
Okay. Make sure
you leave CTU

122
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:47,968
before you
do anything.

123
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,601
You don't think that
they can be trusted?

124
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,501
Right now,
we can't trust anyone.

125
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,534
Logan will have every federal
law enforcement agency,

126
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,534
the military,

127
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,667
all at his disposal.

128
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,701
And he will use them
to try and stop us.

129
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,033
Don't fill your father in
on the particulars.

130
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,467
Just try and
set up the meeting.

131
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,734
I'll get back to you

132
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,267
as soon as
I have the recording.

133
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,000
All right, I'll upload
those checkpoints.
Yeah.

134
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:07,968
Wayne?

135
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,601
The bank manager
was listed.

136
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,501
That's his address,
he's not far.

137
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,667
Good. Let's get them
in the room.

138
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:20,133
( <i>gently</i> ):
Hey... we need
to get inside now.

139
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,167
Come on, it's okay.

140
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,701
JACK:
Give me your arm.

141
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,000
( <i>straining</i> )

142
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,934
You can sit
right here, okay?

143
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,868
Okay. Lie down
here on the bed.

144
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:43,200
( <i>groaning and panting</i> )

145
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,467
JACK:
I'm sorry, but
it's not safe enough

146
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:47,934
to take you to
a hospital yet.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,567
Let me see,
let me see.

148
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,467
( <i>moaning</i> )

149
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,767
Wayne?

150
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,133
Take Amy outside
for a second.

151
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,667
( <i>groans</i> )

152
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,801
Okay, even though
the bullet went through,

153
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,801
I'm still going to have
to clean out this wound.

154
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,267
It's gonna hurt.

155
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,434
But I promise you
I'll get you to a hospital

156
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,434
as soon as I can.

157
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,501
In the meantime,

158
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,634
I'm going to have Wayne
look after you.

159
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,767
No. I'll be fine.

160
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,167
You need to get the evidence.

161
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,267
And you'll need help.

162
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,300
Are you sure?

163
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,734
Yeah.

164
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:29,534
Okay.

165
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,834
Keep pressure on it.

166
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:40,067
Sweetheart, you can
see your mom now.

167
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,734
Give me the car keys.

168
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,367
Let's go.

169
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,734
I haven't been able to pick up
Bauer's trail yet.

170
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,200
LOGAN ( <i>on phone</i> ):
So he got away.

171
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,267
And there's nothing to stop
him and Wayne Palmer

172
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,000
from going to the media
with everything they know.

173
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,200
Jack knows there's no point
in going public

174
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,300
until he has proof.

175
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,033
He won't make any accusations

176
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,901
until he has
that evidence in his hand.

177
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,567
This evidence, this... this
recording that Evelyn made

178
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:08,567
of our conversation.

179
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:11,434
Are you any closer
to finding out

180
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,567
where she's hidden it?

181
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:13,734
No, sir, not yet.

182
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,934
But she was wounded,
and I will find her;

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,300
we're monitoring hospitals,
emergency services.

184
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,200
This is containable,
I promise you.

185
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,200
Please spare me your
promises, Mr. Henderson.

186
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,100
It's all gone wrong.

187
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,567
None of this
should have happened.

188
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:28,267
All these killings...

189
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,000
This whole thing was planned
to make our country safer.

190
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,334
Stronger.

191
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,367
To protect our interests.

192
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,701
And it all spiraled
out of control

193
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,200
when <i>you</i> decided
to kill David Palmer.

194
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,467
Mr. President,
what's done is done.

195
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:46,100
And right now,
we have to focus
on stopping Bauer

196
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,701
before he finds
that recording.

197
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,434
No.

198
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,467
<i>You</i> have to focus on it.

199
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,801
Why haven't the analysts
finished the hourlies?

200
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,467
They're still getting
up to speed on CTU's protocols.

201
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,234
We knew this wasn't going
to be a seamless transition.

202
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,267
Sometimes I wonder if it
was even a necessary one.

203
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:08,334
Karen...

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,801
CTU's performance
today has been

205
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:11,434
considerably less
than stellar.

206
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:12,901
Dozens of people
have been killed.

207
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,133
And they weren't
even able

208
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,634
to prevent an attack
on themselves.

209
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you really believe,
under the circumstances,

210
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,534
that we could have
done any better?

211
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,434
CHLOE:
Ms. Hayes?

212
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,334
The president is on line one.

213
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,167
Put him through
to Bill Buchanan's office,

214
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:27,400
I'll be working out of there
from now on.

215
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,334
And have Medical notify me
as soon as Bierko

216
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
has regained consciousness.

217
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,100
Miles.

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,167
Yes, Mr. President?

219
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,801
Karen.

220
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,968
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

221
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,133
Not at the moment, sir.

222
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,734
He was due back here
30 minutes ago

223
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,367
to lead the Bierko
interrogation.

224
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,701
He's gone off grid.

225
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm not surprised.

226
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,667
Karen, I'm issuing
an executive order

227
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,434
for the immediate apprehension
and arrest of Jack Bauer.

228
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,267
I want you
to run point on this,

229
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:09,767
and I want you to make this
CTU's top priority.

230
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,367
Yes, sir.

231
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:14,834
For purposes
of the warrant,

232
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,968
I'll need to know what
Bauer's being charged with.

233
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:20,567
His role in the assassination
of President David Palmer.

234
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:22,000
But I understood that
he'd been exonerated

235
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,167
of that charge, sir.

236
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,834
You, yourself,
reinstated his credentials.

237
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,901
I know, but I didn't have
all the facts then.

238
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,501
Some new evidence
has come to light.

239
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,501
New evidence?

240
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,868
Yes.

241
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm looking at it right now,

242
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,901
and I will forward it to you
at the appropriate time.

243
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:40,033
Yes, sir.

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,400
Karen.

245
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,501
Obviously, this is
a very sensitive matter,

246
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,434
and for now I would
like you to treat

247
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,968
the origin of this warrant
as confidential.

248
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,901
Understood, sir.

249
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,501
Put out an alert
on Jack Bauer

250
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,601
to all federal law enforcement
agencies and NSA.

251
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll also get military
the warrant--

252
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,901
they have more men
on the street than anyone.

253
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,100
I don't like this.

254
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,767
Pulling our resources off
finding Christopher Henderson

255
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:11,000
to go after Jack Bauer
without knowing the evidence?

256
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,033
It's a direct order
from the president.

257
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,834
You know, if we really
want to find Bauer,

258
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,100
we need to keep watch on anyone
he might contact for help.

259
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,734
Starting with Audrey Raines.

260
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,567
What's this?

261
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,400
Chloe, open it up
and make it look like

262
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,567
this is what
we're talking about.

263
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,267
Okay...

264
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,234
Can you get me
a secure channel,

265
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,400
so the calls
on my cell phone
can't be monitored?

266
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,100
Using a VPN pathway, sure.

267
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,734
Take somebody
about an hour to crack.

268
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,767
Why, what's going on?

269
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,133
I just spoke
with Jack.

270
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,968
Gardner isn't the one
who's behind this.

271
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,434
It's President Logan.

272
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,167
What?

273
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,467
Jack is on his way
getting proof.

274
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,834
I'm leaving now to go help him.

275
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,400
Take a CTU walkie.

276
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,868
( <i>computer chimes</i> )
Audrey.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,934
It's a warrant
for Jack's arrest.

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,934
It's starting.

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,067
What do we do?

280
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,634
Heading out?

281
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,567
Yes, I'm going
to try to grab

282
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:12,767
a couple hours
of sleep.

283
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:13,801
I came to talk

284
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,200
to both of you
about the warrant.

285
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,100
Well, let's start with
why the hell it was issued.

286
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,234
There's new evidence implicating
Jack in David Palmer's

287
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,400
assassination.
That's ridiculous.

288
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,501
I was there when
the assassin confessed.

289
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,067
All you have to do is
check the log.

290
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,868
I know about the logs, Chloe.

291
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,334
My orders are to bring Jack in.

292
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,167
New evidence?

293
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,868
Have you seen it?

294
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,033
It's forthcoming.

295
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,767
Who ordered this, Karen?

296
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,300
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

297
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,400
When was the last time
you spoke with Jack?

298
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,400
About an hour ago.

299
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,701
We haven't had contact since.

300
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,501
I hope I don't have
to remind either one of you

301
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,000
that you have
a legal obligation

302
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,267
to notify me
if Jack contacts you.

303
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:51,601
Look, I know this may seem odd
to the both of you--

304
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,567
frankly, it does to me--

305
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,667
but let's remember
it's in everyone's best interest

306
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:57,234
to bring Jack in peacefully.

307
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,601
Have a good night.

308
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,167
Thank you.

309
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:11,634
VALERIE ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Harris.

310
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,634
Valerie?

311
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,667
Audrey's on her way.

312
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,968
What's your status?

313
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:15,901
We're placing
the transponder

314
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,167
on Audrey's car
right now.

315
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,467
HAYES ( <i>on phone</i> ):
Good.

316
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:20,968
There won't be many cars
on the road,

317
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,634
so use the tracker
and stay out of sight.

318
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,734
Will do.

319
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,734
We don't want anything
to stop Audrey

320
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,601
from leading us to Bauer.

321
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,933
That's the house.

322
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,533
Okay.

323
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,000
What's the bank
manager's name?

324
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,266
Carl Mossman.

325
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,900
You got your gun?

326
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,666
Yeah, but we don't need them
for this, do we?

327
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,399
He's not going to let
into his bank

328
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,666
in the middle of the night

329
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,100
unless he thinks
he has to.

330
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,499
Jack, why don't we just try

331
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,067
telling him the truth?

332
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,466
Would you believe it? The
only way we're going to have

333
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,933
his full compliance
is if he's scared.

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,666
If you're uncomfortable with
that, you should stay here.

335
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,299
( <i>grunts</i> )

336
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,266
Damn it.
They've got a magnetic alarm.

337
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,900

338
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,433
We're in.

MAN ( <i>on TV</i> ):
...that will take place
within the hour.

340
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,700
At that time,
President Logan is scheduled

341
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,766
to make a statement
to the American people

342
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,332
about the successful resolution
of today's terrorist threat.

343
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,833
Did you hear
something?

344
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Like what?

345
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,466
I don't know.

346
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,266
Carl?

347
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,332
Hang on.

348
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,966
Carl?
I'll be right back.

349
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,232
Don't you move.

350
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,866

352
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,599
Cover him.

353
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,866
Put the phone down.

354
00:14:56,933 --> 00:15:00,167
Put the phone down now!

355
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,199
Bring him in here!

356
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:05,499
Just stay calm, and
everything will be fine.

357
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:09,167
Oh my God. Carl...

358
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:11,033
Take a seat on the bed.

359
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,733
Okay, look, our money
and jewelry's in floor safe

360
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,666
in the closet.
We're not interested in that.

361
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,700
You're gonna get us
into your bank.

362
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,700
( <i>panting</i> )

363
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,466
I can't do that.

364
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,666
It's not that I won't. I can't.

365
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,800
The alarm system and the vault
only allow entry

366
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,733
during business hours.
Don't lie to me.

367
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,167
Every bank has
procedures

368
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,299
to allow access
during an emergency.

369
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,533
Hey! No, no!

370
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:39,433
I'll take you
to the bank.

371
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,232
( <i>quietly</i>
<i>whimpers</i> )

372
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,766
JACK:
Slowly

373
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,299
get up, get dressed.

374
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:48,000
Go on. It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

375
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,100
I want four
of your neckties.

376
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,700
Tie her up
to the chair.

377
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:03,232
Ankles and wrists. Make
sure she doesn't move.

378
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,833
Come on.
Yes, hi. This is Audrey Raines.

379
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,966
I need to speak
with Secretary Heller, please.

380
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,133
Mr. Secretary, there's
a call coming in for you

381
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,933
on an over-air
encrypted channel.

382
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,033
It's your daughter.

383
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,666
Audrey, is everything okay?

384
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,700
Hi. Uh, yes, I'm okay.

385
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:37,900
Dad, I need your help.

386
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,199
Is this a secure line?

387
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,566
Very secure.

388
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,666
Is this about the arrest order
for Jack?

389
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,399
I was just informed.

390
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,466
Dad, I can't go into details
right now, but Jack is innocent.

391
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,533
He's being set up.

392
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,167
Set up by whom?

393
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:54,299
What the hell
is going on, Audrey?

394
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:57,466
You call me this morning,
to tell me that Jack's alive.

395
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,466
Now I get word
he's a suspect again

396
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,000
in the Palmer
assassination.

397
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,332
Dad, I can't talk to you
about it right now.

398
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,033
I need to see you
in person.

399
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,033
Can you reroute your plane
to Los Angeles?

400
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,199
Dad, I would never ask you
to do this

401
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,866
if it wasn't
extremely important.

402
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,800
All right, yes.

403
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,332
Thank you.

404
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,199
The closest airport is Van Nuys.

405
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:26,833
We're about an hour out.

406
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,299
I'll call you on final approach.

407
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,133
Okay. Thank you.
I'll see you there.

408
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,266
I'll see you.

409
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,433
Bye.

410
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,266
Doug!

411
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, sir.

412
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:44,033
We have to make a stop in L.A.

413
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,133
And keep it off the manifest.

414
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,599
Yes, sir.

415
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,266
Pull over.

416
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:05,933
She stopped.

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,933
Corner of Alderton

418
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,466
and Davis.

419
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,566
It's a gas station.

420
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:14,700
CHLOE:
O'Brian.

421
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,700
Chloe, it's me.

422
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,433
Hold on.

423
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,033
Okay, switched over
to my own VPN. Now they can't

424
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,332
monitor either end
of the conversation.

425
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,232
Do you have the walkie?
Yeah. Hang on.

426
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,433
All right, what
do I do with it?

427
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,466
Tune to proprietary
channel 17,

428
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,332
turn the sensitivity
up all the way.

429
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,366
See if you pick up
a pilot signal.

430
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,232
Okay, hold on.

431
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,966
( <i>high-pitched squeal</i> )

432
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,299
Wow. Do you hear that?

433
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,900
That's what I figured--
they put a tracker on you.

434
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,700
I found it. All right, Chloe,
I got it. Thank you.

435
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,966
Audrey, you need
to disable your phone

436
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,266
by taking the battery out
as soon as you can.

437
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,766
All right,
I have to wait

438
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,800
for a call from Jack
and then I will.
Okay.

439
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,499
( <i>sighs</i> )

440
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,499
Yes.

441
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,966
Sir, it's almost time.

442
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,700
Yes.

443
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,232
The press conference.

444
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,633
That's right.

445
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,866
Mr. President,

446
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,399
if I could
have a moment...

447
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:49,966
Uh, I should be done

448
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,199
with my statement
shortly, Hal.

449
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,666
This is potentially
time sensitive, sir.

450
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,466
I just got an alert
that a warrant

451
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,167
has been issued for Jack Bauer.

452
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,332
Thank you, Aaron.

453
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,666
Yes, sir.

454
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,666
What about the warrant?

455
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,266
Well, it's an executive
branch warrant.

456
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,666
I didn't issue it, so it
must have come from you.

457
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:15,133
That's right, it came from me.

458
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,866
Well, as you've
put me in charge

459
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,100
of overseeing CTU and the
Homeland Security transfer,

460
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,299
don't you think
you should have discussed it

461
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:23,666
with me first?

462
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,433
I appreciate everything
you've done today, Hal,

463
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:29,833
but the last time I checked,
<i>I</i> was still Commander in Chief.

464
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Of course, Mr. President,
but Jack Bauer?

465
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,700
It doesn't
make any sense.

466
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,299
We should be treating
that man like a hero.

467
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,633
I've gone over the logs.

468
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,033
Walt Cummings has confessed

469
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,599
that he arranged Palmer's
assassination, framing Bauer.

470
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,199
Well, clearly,

471
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,700
Cummings was protecting Bauer.

472
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,332
Why?
I don't know why.

473
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,666
But the fact remains
I have received confirmation

474
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,499
from Intelligence sources

475
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:56,100
that Jack Bauer was,
without question, the shooter.

476
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,133
Which sources?
That's enough!

477
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,866
I'm not going to stand here
and have my orders challenged.

478
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:04,366
You have concerns, Hal.

479
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:06,399
We'll sort this all out

480
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,133
once Bauer's in custody.

481
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,733
Does that suit you?

482
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,533
Yes, sir.

483
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,599
Good.

484
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,232

I can't wake her up.

Calm down. Tell me your name.

Her name's Evelyn Martin.

All right, honey,
now tell me where you are.

from a Motel 6

requesting medical assistance
for an Evelyn Martin.

LOGAN:
My fellow Americans, it is with
great relief that I announce

512
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,533
that the terrorist threat
our nation faced today is over.

513
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,433
More than an hour ago, federal
counter-terrorist agents,

514
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,733
under my direction,

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,499
thwarted the latest attack
on innocent civilians,

516
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:45,800
the nature of which was kept
secret due to national security.

517
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:49,800
This was done with the public's
best interest in mind.

518
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,566
He really did it.

519
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,334

00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:00,200
He stopped the terrorists,
the treaty was signed.

522
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,800
He said he would
ride out this crisis,

523
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:03,800
and everything
would be okay.

524
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:07,867
And it is.

525
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,666
I should have trusted him.

There's too many military

00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,967
About a quarter of a mile
that way.

536
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:48,133
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

537
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,666
Be right back.

538
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:57,666
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

539
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:59,733
Aaron, it's Jack.

540
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,566
Jack, are you aware
President Logan's

541
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,633
issued a warrant for your arrest
for your role

542
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,666
in David Palmer's assassination?

543
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:06,267
No, but that makes sense.

544
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:09,300
The Vice President's not the one
who's behind this, is he?

545
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:11,566
No, it's Logan.

546
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,499
They're going to have
every agency

547
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:14,733
and the military
looking for you.

548
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,033
And Logan is the only one
who can call them off.

549
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,633
As soon as we have
the evidence in hand,

550
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
We're gonna pass it off
to Secretary of Defense Heller.

551
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,067
After that,
it's not gonna matter.

552
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,067
Is there anything I
can do for you, Jack?

553
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,000
Keep your eyes open
and watch your back.

554
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,666
Will do.

555
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,100
Get out of the car.

556
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,366
Come on.

557
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,666
Let's go.

558
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,666
Move, move.

559
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,200
( <i>vehicle approaching</i> )

560
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,267
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Take cover, go!

561
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,867
Not a word.

562
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,200
WOMAN:
Ms. Hayes, Valerie Harris
is on line two for you.

563
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:14,600
She says it's urgent.

564
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,633
Valerie, what's happening?

565
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,466
We lost Audrey Raines.
What?

566
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,067
She found the tracker
and transferred it

567
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,067
to a DWP truck
at a gas station.

568
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,200
Damn it. How did
she find it?

569
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,833
She's got
no field experience.
I don't know.

570
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,200
The only reason
we discovered it

571
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,334
is the DWP guy stopped to
check a faulty power line.

572
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,633
All right, hold your position

573
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,933
and wait for my instructions.

574
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,234
Will do.

575
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:38,033
MILES:
Papazian.

576
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,000
Audrey Raines
ditched her transponder.

577
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:42,666
I need you to redirect satellite
surveillance and track her.

578
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,833
I can redirect CalTrans
and maybe one SAT-LINK,

579
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,600
but the rest are dedicated
to finding Bauer.

580
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,167
Following Audrey should lead us
right to Bauer.

581
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,867
Just get it done and tell me

582
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,267
when you've got something.
I'm on it.

583
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:08,167
Against the wall.

584
00:27:08,234 --> 00:27:10,100
Watch him.

585
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,800
Just do what he says, Carl.

586
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,600
Do what he says and you'll
be home before you know it.
Right.

587
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,733
What's the emergency procedure

588
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,267
to enter the bank?
I have 30 seconds

589
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,766
to put my key in
the alarm panel,

590
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,000
then I enter my code.

591
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:28,633
You enter the wrong code
and alert the police,

592
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,967
all I have to do is make

593
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,167
one call, your wife is dead.

594
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,499
You understand me?
Yes.

595
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:33,633
Let's go.

596
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,001
Where's the vault?

597
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:07,001
Take us around the back,
stay away from the windows.

598
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,667
How do I open it?

599
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:23,001
There's a 12-digit code, but
it's a timed unlock procedure,

600
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,434
which allows enough
time for the police

601
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,701
to arrive in the event

602
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,967
that someone should
trigger the silent alarm.

603
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:29,534
Write the code down for me.

604
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,034
Take him over to one of
the desks, keep an eye on him.

605
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,667
I know you.

606
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,767
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

607
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,667
You're David Palmer's brother.

608
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,867
I saw you on TV
this morning.

609
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,233
You were there when he was shot.

610
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Now, what the hell
are you doing in my bank?

611
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,667
And who is he?

612
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,333
Listen, I know it's
absurd to ask you

613
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,134
to trust me under
these circumstances,

614
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,267
but believe me,
you don't want to know.

615
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,600
Oh, come on.

616
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,934
You threaten me with a gun,
you kidnap me,

617
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,200
you're robbing my bank.

618
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:17,034
Now, I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here.

619
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,567
Fine.

620
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:24,300
Jack and I believe
there's evidence inside

621
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:26,600
of one of your safety deposit
boxes that's gonna prove

622
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,567
who was behind the assassination
of my brother, okay?

623
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
JACK:
Wayne.

624
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:37,333
What's going on?

625
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
What do you want
me to say, Jack?

626
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:41,134
He recognized me.
It's all right.

627
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Mr. Mossman,

628
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:44,233
how long is the delay
before the vault opens?

629
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,701
Five minutes.

630
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,068
Is that true what he said?
Is that why you two are here?

631
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,467
Yes.

632
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:53,101
Why didn't you just wait
till morning, get a subpoena?

633
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,567
The people that are behind this
will never let it go that far.

634
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:57,267
They've already tried to kill me
twice tonight, Carl.

635
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,867
And they're gonna try again
the very first chance they get.

you're in shock.

00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,734
But you're going
to be okay.

642
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,734
You know my name?

You did?

Well, that's good.

648
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,567
I'm glad.

649
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:49,401
I'll get back to you.

650
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,601
I thought
you went to bed.

651
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,300
No.

652
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,100
I, uh, watched you
with the press.

653
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:00,434
Well, um, that was Morry,

654
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,234
and he thought
it went pretty well.

655
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Good.

656
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,801
But that doesn't
begin to describe it.

657
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:09,134
Charles, you have had
to deal with

658
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,467
more crisis today

660
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,300
You...

661
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:18,234
were magnificent.

662
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:21,534
Magnificent.

663
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,467
Well, I like the sound of that.

664

Especially coming from you.

00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm so proud of you.

666
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:35,467
I hope I haven't embarrassed you
too much as your First Lady.

667
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:36,667
Stop. No.

668
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:37,667
Don't be ridiculous.

you walked up to the

but nobody noticed.

672
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,167
I'll try to find a compliment
in there somewhere.

673

I'm sorry, Marty.

674
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,200

You had so much
on your plate,

you didn't need me
piling more on.

say anything.

All right.

Yes.

We know where Bauer is.

I'm sorry, honey.

to the idea that...

that the crisis is over.

When what's done?

703
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,434
What?
You just said,

Valerie,
we have a fix on Raines.

715
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,634
She's heading
toward the Sepulveda Pass,

716
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:43,900
coming up on Mulholland.

717
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,868
Copy that.

718
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,967
Let's go.
( <i>starts engine</i> )

719
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,434
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

720
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,334
Chloe?

721
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:03,734
Do you have a minute?

722
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,033
No.

723
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,900
What is it?

724
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:10,200
I was assigned to
log all satellite

725
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:11,601
and ground video activity,

726
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,367
but part of the vector
is locked out.

727
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,434
Locked out?
What do you mean?

728
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,868
I mean, someone's
taken control of one

729
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,234
of the satellites
using a class one

730
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,801
priority override.

731
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:22,134
Do you know anything about it?

732
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,167
No.

733
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:24,701
I'll look into it.
Thanks.

734
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,967
( <i>sighs</i> )

735
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,834
Crap.

736
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,801
All points are covered, sir.

737
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:07,033
The perimeter is secure.

738
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,534
Do you have a visual?

739
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:10,868
I did, briefly.
All right, listen.

740
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:13,667
You tell your men the instant,
and I mean the instant

741
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:15,801
that Bauer steps outside
that bank building

742
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,200
you take him down.

743
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:19,367
Then, kill the others
and secure the recording.

744
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:24,367
( <i>buzzer sounds</i> )

745
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:25,467
Which one is it?

746
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:28,434
Twenty-three.

747
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:31,300
MOSSMAN:
Mr. Palmer,

748
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,567
I admired your brother
a great deal.

749
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,634
He was a great man.

750
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:34,701
Thank you.

751
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,933
HENDERSON ( <i>on tape</i> ):
It had to be done, sir.

752
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
LOGAN:
I decide what needs to
be done, Mr. Henderson.

753
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,067
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

754
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:47,300
Palmer was nosing around.

755
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:48,868
He'd have found out
about your involvement.

756
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,667
For God's sake, sir,
he called your wife.

757
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,634
I can handle my wife.

758
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,534
Right now, my concern
is keeping this operation

759
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:57,401
from collapsing
like a house of cards.

760
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:59,167
You're protected, sir.
That's president Logan's voice.

761
00:35:59,234 --> 00:36:00,234
Every thread ends
with Cummings.

762
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,401
He thinks he's running this,

763
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,267
And you need
to keep playing it that way.

764
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,501
I know my part,
Mr. Henderson.

765
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,234
You just do
as you're told.

766
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,234
Oh, my God.
We got what we need.

767
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,701
Mr. Mossman,

768
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:13,267
I'm sorry we put you
and your wife through this.

769
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:15,033
It'll be safer for
you to stay here now.

770
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,334
Could you please
let us out?
Like to help if I can.

771
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:19,567
I've come this far.
We're gonna need
to borrow your car

772
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:20,967
a little longer.

773
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:22,067
MOSSMAN:
Sure, it's insured.

774
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:23,434
Wait. There's someone inside.

775
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,100
Mr. Mossman, get
back in the vault now.

776
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,200
Is there any other way out
of here besides the front door?

777
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:30,701
No, front door only--
security reasons.

778
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,234
Damn it.

779
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,501
Both of you stay here.

780
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,601
I'll be right back.

781
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,768
Henderson's men
are taking up positions.

782
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,801
There's no other way out-- we're
gonna have to turn ourselves in.

783
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:16,000
They didn't come here to arrest
us; they came here to kill us.

784
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,601
What are they
waiting for?

785
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:18,801
All the windows
are bulletproof.

786
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:19,967
They're waiting for us
to leave the building.

787
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,900
So what are you gonna do?

788
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:24,567
How do you trip
the silent alarm?

789
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:27,467
I have a key, but you trip
that alarm, LAPD

790
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,067
will be here
within a few minutes.

791
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:30,734
That's exactly what I want.

792
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,300
Henderson's men
outnumber us.

793
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,334
We leave this building now,
we lose.
Jack, if you call the cops,

794
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:35,933
they're gonna get the recording
when we're taken into custody.

795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,567
We won't be taken into custody.

796
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:40,401
As soon as Henderson finds out
the LAPD have arrived,

797
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,100
he's gonna have his men
engage them.

798
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,033
He doesn't want the police
to have the recording any more

799
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,801
than he wants us to have it.
So they start shooting
at each other.

800
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:49,267
How does that
help us?
We have to try
and use that as a diversion.

801
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,768
It's our only way out.

802
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:56,200
Trigger the alarm.

803
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Be right back.

804
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:29,934
Valerie.

805
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,967
The feed should be coming
through to your laptop now.

806
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,267
I've got her.

807
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,667
She's heading west on Chandler.

808
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,467
How close are you
to Audrey's car?

809
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:38,701
About two miles.

810
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:39,967
Close the gap to one mile.

811
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,200
Affirmative.

812
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,567
Something's wrong.

813
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:56,034
The feed's breaking up.

814
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,767
We're experiencing
the same difficulty

815
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,134
with our signal--
hold on.

816
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,500
What's going on?
I don't know.

817
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,534
The satellite's
positioned correctly.

818
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm tracing
the corruption.

819
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,867
It's the server.

820
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,134
What is it?

821
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,367
O'Brian's gone.

822
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:47,867
* *

823
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,233
What were you doing?

824
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,600
What?

825
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,767
What were you doing?

826
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,500
Are you kidding?

827
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:10,101
If you really want the details,
I'll write you a report.

828
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,233
Let's go, now.

829
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,934
MOSSMAN:
The police should be here
any minute.

830
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,200
Mr. Mossman, like I said before,

831
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,867
it might be safer
for you to stay

832
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:38,867
here in the bank.

833
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,267
No, these guys find me,

834
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,467
they assume I know
about the recording,

835
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,134
they'd probably
kill me, right?

836
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:48,867
I'll take my chances with you.

837
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:53,233
I want you to stay as close
to Mr. Palmer as you can.

838
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,901
I'll provide cover fire.

839
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:57,934
Once we leave the bank,
you break left.

840
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,134
Yes, sir.
Cooper, what's your status?

841
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,967
No change,
they still haven't come out.

842
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:04,634
Must have seen you, damn it.

843
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:06,034
Tell your men to move in
immediately.

844
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:09,400
The cops are here.

845
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,767
We can't let them have Bauer;
take 'em down.

846
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:12,967
Yes, sir.

847
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:16,567
This is LAPD!

848
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:17,934
Drop your weapons!

849
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,101
Engage! Engage!

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,267
Let's go.

860
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,600
How is he doing?

861
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,400
He's dead.

862
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,400
Damn it.

( <i>phone rings</i> )

864
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:38,567
Jack, where are you?

865
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:39,801
I'm on my way to you.

866
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,034
Did your father agree to meet?

867
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,600
Yes, he's landing
at Van Nuys Airport

868
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,701
in about 15 minutes.

869
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,233
I'm there now.

870
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,333
Good, we got the evidence.

871
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,500
Have you listened to it?

872
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,867
Yeah, there's no doubt
it's Logan.

873
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:53,333
You understand what this means.

874
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,634
We're talking about taking down

875
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:57,367
the President
of the United States.
