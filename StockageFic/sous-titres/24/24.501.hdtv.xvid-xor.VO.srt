1
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:21,876
Jack, this is hard for me.

2
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,391
The Chinese have proof

3
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,492
that you led the assault
on their consulate.

4
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,708
And now the Chinese want me.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,793
That's right.

6
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,356
Listen to me very carefully.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,750
The man they sent to take you into
custody has orders to kill you.

8
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,906
- Orders from who?
- Someone in Logan's camp.

9
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,366
Bill Spaulding, Secret Service.

10
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,706
I have orders to take
Jack Bauer into custody.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,582
I intend to execute
those orders.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,993
Jack!

13
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:50,757
He's dead.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,540
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,315
Oh, Jack!

16
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:00,988
Give me the epinephrine.

17
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:05,522
I hope it's not too late.
He really looks dead.

18
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,891
Come on, Jack!

19
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,569
Come on, Jack, damn it!

20
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:15,040
Hey.

21
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:19,600
All right, Chloe, I need you to run
interference with the local coroner.

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,974
Make sure their database synchs
up with Jack's information.

23
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:24,972
- That won't cover the autopsy.
- There's not going to be an autopsy.

24
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,235
They wanted Jack dead,
now he's dead.

25
00:01:27,515 --> 00:01:29,366
Mr. President,
you saved my life.

26
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,454
I'm only sorry it came to this.

27
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:33,271
I just wanted to let
you know that I was out.

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,388
I'm glad.

29
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,045
Jack, you do understand
that when you hang up,

30
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,610
for all intents and purposes,

31
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:41,124
Jack Bauer is dead.

32
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,381
I understand that, sir.

33
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:47,655
Mr. President,
it's been an honor.

34
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:56,681
The following takes place between 7 a.m.
and 8 a.m.

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,526
Jim Nichols!
You're on pump number one.

36
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,594
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest.
You're on pump number four.

37
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:24,336
Phil Stone, Greg Nelson,
you're on pump five.

38
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,784
Sorry, guys,
that's all I got today.

39
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:34,971
Hey, Frank?

40
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:37,716
Look, I know I promised
you work today, but...

41
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,485
pump seven went
off-line last night.

42
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,526
That's all right.
I'll try again tomorrow.

43
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,361
Yeah, tomorrow'll
be much better.

44
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,402
See you tomorrow.

45
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:57,276
The sun is shining, but the air is
cool at President Logan's retreat,

46
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:01,848
where Russian President Yuri Suvarov is
expected to arrive later this morning.

47
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:06,178
Everything worked for me, up until
the chapter on your first campaign.

48
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,333
I'm sorry,
but I think it's a little long-winded,

49
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,273
and I think that we can
cut that down by half.

50
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:12,920
So, why don't we start
with the paragraph...?

51
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,637
You didn't hear a word I just said,
did you?

52
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,438
- Yes, I was listening.
- No, you weren't.

53
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:27,446
You're right.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,433
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

55
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,279
I can use a break.

56
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,472
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

57
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:43,279
I mean you've been distracted ever
since you got to Los Angeles.

58
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:47,419
I don't know, it's...
It's like you're somewhere else.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,723
Writing my memoirs...

60
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,921
maybe it's put me in
a melancholy mood.

61
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,908
Is that all it is?

62
00:03:58,842 --> 00:03:59,739
Yeah.

63
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:06,063
David... I'm your brother.

64
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:09,767
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

65
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:15,275
It's all right, really.

66
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,338
Okay.

67
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,872
Well, then let's
get back to work.

68
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:24,181
One more chapter,
and we'll take a break.

69
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,372
Why don't we jump down to,
um, Chapter Six?

70
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:31,212
There's going to be a lot of questions
about your relationship with Sherry.

71
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:36,660
David!

72
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,906
No, no, no, no, no...

73
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,465
Get help!

74
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:45,570
Stay with me. Stay with me!

75
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:46,703
Get help!

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,434
Walt. My chair?

77
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,487
Don't worry, Mr. President.
I had it adjusted.

78
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,127
Good.

79
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,895
Adjusted? Wait a minute.
What are we talking about here?

80
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,139
Yuri Suvarov is over six feet.

81
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:08,837
Russian President can't be looking down
on the President of the United States
when the cameras roll.

82
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:12,309
That's a risky proposition, Walt.
The press finds out about it, and...

83
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,093
They won't.

84
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:16,328
Don't underestimate the
power of the image, Mike.

85
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,039
Stalin and Churchill,
they both sat for FDR at Yalta.

86
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,409
This is the defining moment
of my administration.

87
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,915
We have to make sure that the
media presents it the right way.

88
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:27,406
I'll get it.

89
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:32,377
Yeah, put him through.

90
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,287
Have you checked on my wife?

91
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,817
Ah, she's still getting ready.

92
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,554
- She'll be fine, sir.
- Hmm.

93
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,925
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.

94
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:46,319
I'd feel better if you
would check on her yourself.

95
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,637
She cannot have one of
her meltdowns today.

96
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,999
Look... you're the only
one she listens to, Walt.

97
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:55,641
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,048
Thank you.

99
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:06,129
Mike? Mike, what is it?

100
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,242
David Palmer's
been assassinated.

101
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,550
- What?!
- It just happened.

102
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,228
Oh, my God.

103
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:22,001
- Where?
- In L.A.

104
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,754
I don't believe this.

105
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:33,642
Mr. President, uh, CTU is standing
by to brief you directly.

106
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,613
Whenever you're ready.

107
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,244
Make sure LAPD sets
up a hard perimeter.

108
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,583
They're sending
everyone they've got.

109
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,242
- Where are they on witnesses?
- Nowhere yet.

110
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:01,421
Who's running search and sweep?

111
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,224
Secret Service,
but they're shorthanded.

112
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:06,981
Narrow the search area. Make sure
ballistics runs a
line-of-fire trajectory.

113
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,295
- Sir, President Logan's ready.
- I'll call ballistics.

114
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,617
- Put the President through.
- Yes, sir. Go ahead.

115
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,784
- Mr. President.
- Bill...

116
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,296
Not to diminish the loss that
we're all feeling right now,

117
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:28,339
but I'm expecting the Russian
President very soon, so...

118
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,023
let's say what
needs to be said.

119
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,450
Of course, sir.

120
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,492
Have you arrested the
person who did this?

121
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:37,376
- Not yet, sir.
- Then what do you have?

122
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:40,431
Sir, the damage inflicted by
the single shot indicates that

123
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,030
President Palmer was hit
by a 308-caliber bullet

124
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,931
fired from an
adjacent building.

125
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,764
We've initiated an interagency protocol,
level five...

126
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:51,775
Don't... don't give me protocols, Bill.
Give me results.

127
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,002
Whoever did this,
I want them dead or in custody

128
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,732
by the time the
Russians get here.

129
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,412
Yes, Mr. President.
But until we know more,

130
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,516
I would ask that you consider postponing
the signing of the treaty, sir.

131
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,394
No. Absolutely not.

132
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,716
Mr. President, we can't discount
the possibility that this attack

133
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,407
is somehow connected
to the arms agreement.

134
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:14,310
A former president was assassinated
15 miles from where you are.

135
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:17,926
And I'm sure I don't need to explain
the significance of this day.

136
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:21,220
Do you realize what kind of political
and economic capital I've spent

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,683
just to get the
Russians to the table?

138
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:26,765
If we call this off,
they won't come back.

139
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,152
Spencer?

140
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,172
Spencer!

141
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,284
- What?
- Get out of my bed.

142
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,645
Yeah.

143
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,430
I had a good time
last night, too.

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,362
I'm serious. This was a mistake.
Get out of here.

145
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,903
What do you mean, a mistake?
We had a great time.

146
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,867
I don't get involved with
people who work for me.

147
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,079
It's too late for that.

148
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:04,174
I would appreciate it if you didn't
tell everybody at work about this.

149
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:06,871
I don't want everyone thinking
I'm some kind of slut.

150
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:10,764
Believe me,
no one's ever going to think that.

151
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:14,385
What's that supposed to mean?

152
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,765
You should lighten up, you know?
You'll live longer.

153
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,016
What are you doing?

154
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,208
When you quit overanalyzing
the situation,

155
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:30,688
I think you're gonna find out

156
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,993
that you and I are
pretty good together.

157
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,459
So I'm telling you
in advance, yes.

158
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:38,115
Yes, what?

159
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,566
I'll let you buy me dinner.
Get me drunk.

160
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,799
Have your way with me.
Anytime you want.

161
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:48,687
You know, um,
arrogance doesn't turn me on.

162
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,782
I've read that some women respond to it,
but I'm just letting you know, I don't.

163
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:20,101
- What is it?
- President Palmer's been shot.

164
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:22,861
He's dead.

165
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,006
- Who is it?
- It's me, Frank.

166
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:10,611
- Hey.
- Hey.

167
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,270
I saw your truck outside.
I thought you were on today.

168
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
Oh, Ned didn't need
me this morning.

169
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,305
It's so terrible,
what happened.

170
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:27,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

171
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:30,737
- Come on, I'm making breakfast.
- Okay.

172
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,899
- Frank's gonna join us.
- Great.

173
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:44,072
Derek, stop it.

174
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,842
Morning.

175
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:53,793
Use a glass, please.

176
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,307
Here.

177
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,053
Excuse me.

178
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,520
Can I ask you something, Frank?

179
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,557
Yeah, sure.

180
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,413
That rig in Alaska you worked on,
what was that called again?

181
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,068
The Albatross.

182
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,322
And you were there last year?

183
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,935
- Yeah, why?
- It's funny.

184
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,811
My friend's got a brother who's been
working on that rig for five years

185
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,879
and he's never heard
of any Frank Flynn.

186
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,129
It's a big platform.

187
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:38,964
Yeah, well, my friend's brother
says everyone knows everyone.

188
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,051
- What is this, an interrogation?
- I just don't like being lied to.

189
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,468
- Derek.
- No, it's all right.

190
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,826
No one's lying to you, Derek.

191
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:51,227
Really?

192
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:54,363
When you're out there,
a lot of the guys just use nicknames.

193
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,253
Yeah.

194
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,581
What's your friend's
brother's name?

195
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,512
Eat your breakfast.

196
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,872
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

197
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:14,810
S orry.

198
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,656
He's just kind of
protective of me.

199
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,339
But it's the best thing in the world
for him to have a man around here.

200
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,977
Look, what he said
about me and Alaska...

201
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,009
You don't owe me
an explanation.

202
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:31,566
I figure if you had wanted to tell me
about your past you would have told
me already.

203
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,915
I trust my instincts.

204
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,776
And I trust you.

205
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,643
Bill will call if he needs us,
you know that.

206
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:54,986
No, he won't.

207
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,408
It's not our job.

208
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:05,960
Not anymore.

209
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,287
- This is different.
- Come on, Michelle.

210
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,948
I'm just as upset as you are.
David Palmer meant a lot to me, too.

211
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:13,847
But there are other people
at CTU who can handle this.

212
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:16,877
No one who was active during
the other attempts on his life.

213
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:21,614
Tony, you and I worked up suspect
profiles. We ran scenarios.

214
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:23,507
And they have our
records on file.

215
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,452
They don't have our experience.

216
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,368
I never once regretted
our decision to leave CTU.

217
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,885
But I don't want to look back on
today and realize I could have helped.

218
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,053
We're running a business
here, Michelle.

219
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:48,292
Rick Rosen is expecting us to make
a presentation in less than an hour.

220
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,507
You can handle the
meeting on your own.

221
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,273
Michelle, don't do this.

222
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,936
It's Rick. Leave me a message.

223
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,885
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida.

224
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,506
Look, I just wanted to
call you and let you know

225
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,944
that Michelle's not gonna be
able to make our meeting today.

226
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,622
She had to go someplace.

227
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,459
On second thought...

228
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:31,628
I'm going with her.

229
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:46,896
Michelle! Michelle!

230
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,568
Did Jepson brief you
on what's happening?

231
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,991
Said there was a car bombing.
Two former CTU agents were hit.

232
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,821
Yeah, their names are Michelle
Dessler and Tony Almeida.

233
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:23,037
- You knew them?
- Yeah.

234
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,291
We're data-mining for a connection
between them and President Palmer.

235
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,829
I sent the parameters
to your screen.

236
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,756
I'll get on it.

237
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:39,340
Yeah?

238
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,946
It's Edgar. Are you coming in?

239
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:44,642
Yeah, I just got paged on a level five
protocol, of course I'm coming in.

240
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,888
I wanted to give you a heads
up before you got here.

241
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,054
Heads up?

242
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:50,030
It's bad, Chloe.

243
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:53,133
Yeah, President Palmer was gunned down.
I'd say that's pretty bad.

244
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,679
It's not just him.

245
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,461
What are you talking about?

246
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,649
Someone planted a bomb in
Michelle Dessler's car.

247
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,149
- What?
- Michelle's dead.

248
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,284
Tony's not doing too good.

249
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:09,764
Doesn't make any sense.
They were retired.

250
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:12,107
Buchanan thinks it's
linked to Palmer somehow.

251
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:15,386
We're cross-referencing everything we
have on Palmer with Tony and Michelle,

252
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,173
to see if we can
find a connection,

253
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:19,570
anything they may
have had in common.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,945
Chloe?

255
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:24,775
Go.

256
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:27,658
Chloe?

257
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:28,741
I'll call you back.

258
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,994
- Why? Chloe?
- I'll call you back!

259
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:29,246
Since I don't have to go to work today,
I can take care of the fence out back if
you want.

260
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,584
Oh, that'd be great.

261
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,543
I can't thank you enough for all
the work you've down around here.

262
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:35,165
It's the least I could do.

263
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,913
Excuse me. Yeah?

264
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,639
Jack, I know this
isn't protocol.

265
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:42,947
Please don't hang up on me.
I need your help.

266
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:46,189
Uh, hold on,
I can barely hear you.

267
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,202
I don't have a very good signal.
Excuse me.

268
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:57,657
What is it?

269
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,645
They got Tony and Michelle.
Michelle is dead.

270
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,973
Tony is in critical condition.
Now they're gonna kill me.

271
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:03,306
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:04,869
There's four people
that know you're alive.

273
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,957
Three of them are down.
Jack, I'm the only one left.

274
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:10,239
This has to be about you. It's the only
thing the four of us have in common.

275
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,504
What happened to
Tony and Michelle?

276
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:17,327
There was a car bomb. There was a guy
outside my apartment and he was
chasing me.

277
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,498
Oh, my God. Where is he now?

278
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,849
I think I lost him. I'm at a pay phone.
I dumped my cell phone.

279
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,773
I don't know what to do now.

280
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:28,800
Chloe, you need to go dark.
That means zero contact with anyone.

281
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,841
- Even CTU?
- Especially CTU.

282
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,230
Whoever's behind this is
probably monitoring them.

283
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,517
Someone out there
knows I'm still alive.

284
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,248
Who?

285
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:39,426
I don't know,
but that's what we need to find out.

286
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,625
Right now, I want you to head
north out of Los Angeles.

287
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,763
There's an abandoned oil
refinery at Variel and Topanga.

288
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,233
I want you to wait
for me there.

289
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:50,332
You can take cover by the large storage
tanks at the north end of the field.

290
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:51,713
You're coming to L.A.?

291
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:54,881
- Give me about a half an hour.
- Okay. Thanks.

292
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,086
Tony Almeida is
being medevaced in.

293
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,143
We have a trauma team standing
by to receive him in medical.

294
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,844
You're bringing him to CTU?

295
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:23,348
If there's a second attempt on his life,
we can't protect him in a hospital.

296
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:24,826
This doesn't track.

297
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,014
Michelle and Tony have been
inactive for over a year.

298
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,212
Who'd want them dead?

299
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,814
Whoever wanted Palmer dead.

300
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,781
So we're assuming
they're connected.

301
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:35,058
The timing was too close to
write it off as a coincidence.

302
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,658
There is a connection.

303
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,601
Let's find it.

304
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,000
Sir, the DOD liaison is here.

305
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,675
I need to set her up with the
security protocols for the summit.

306
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:44,997
I'll take care of it.

307
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:48,544
You have your assignments.
Send updates directly to my screen.

308
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,724
- Where is she?
- She just cleared security.

309
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:51,318
Thank you.

310
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,929
- Audrey.
- Bill.

311
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:12,856
Must be hard for
you to be back here.

312
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,575
Thank you, Bill. I'm fine.

313
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,582
I'm sorry about Michelle.

314
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:23,177
Walt Cummings briefed me
on the way over here.

315
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,503
He said that you wanted to postpone
the signing of the treaty.

316
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,684
President Logan is
making a mistake.

317
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,910
I don't disagree.

318
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,345
Have you let him know that?

319
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,885
He's the President, Bill.
It's his call.

320
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,401
That's what I'm afraid of.

321
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,640
He wants me to make sure that your top
priority is still security for
the summit.

322
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,568
Station Five is set up for you.

323
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,373
When you're situated, we'll go over
the revised security protocol.

324
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,946
Great. Thank you, Bill.

325
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:56,668
David Palmer was a man
of truth and of honor.

326
00:21:56,796 --> 00:22:00,025
And his influence will be
felt for generations to come.

327
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,893
Our nation grieves
for its loss.

328
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,932
Martha and I offer
our deepest sympathy.

329
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:12,411
You look beautiful, Mrs. Logan.

330
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,207
I look like a wedding cake.

331
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,950
Let's start over.

332
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,071
Oh, you can get that.

333
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:50,833
- Is Mrs. Logan ready?
- Not quite.

334
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,960
You didn't tell her
about David Palmer?

335
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,430
- No.
- Thank you.

336
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:59,430
She'll take it hard when she finds out.
They've been friends for a long time.

337
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:02,727
You don't have to talk
about me like I'm not here.

338
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:04,441
Excuse us, Evelyn.

339
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:15,155
Martha...

340
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,747
I... I'm sorry. Look, I know...
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

341
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,503
I just...
I'm having a bad hair day.

342
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:26,122
Martha... I've got
some very bad news.

343
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,392
But... it's not Charles, is it?

344
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:34,496
No. No, he's fine.
He wanted to tell you himself...

345
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:37,396
Well... what?

346
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:40,411
Walt, Walt...

347
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,550
well, what... what is it?

348
00:23:48,191 --> 00:23:50,715
David Palmer was assassinated.

349
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:53,890
No...

350
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:04,139
I'm sorry.

351
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,850
I know how close you were.

352
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,564
When did this happen?

353
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:14,652
Less than an hour ago.

354
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,611
This morning?!

355
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:19,008
I...

356
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:30,475
I... I have to talk to Charles.

357
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,426
He's doing damage control,

358
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:34,816
trying to keep this from pushing
the treaty off the front page.

359
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:36,122
No, no, oh, no,
I have to talk to him now.

360
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:37,216
No. He's doing a
press conference...

361
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:37,502
No!

362
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:39,859
Martha! Martha!

363
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:42,771
Agent North!

364
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:46,398
Call John, tell him not to let Mrs.
Logan anywhere near the stage.

365
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,076
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill.

366
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:51,976
As I look back upon the
deeds of David Palmer--

367
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,467
not only one of this
country's greatest leaders,

368
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,950
but one of this
world's greatest men...

369
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,892
Our nation grieves
for its loss...

370
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:03,880
Mrs. Logan...

371
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,012
Let go of me.

372
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,980
- Let go of me! Let go!
- I can't let you...

373
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,429
...to President
Palmer's entire family.

374
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:14,863
And to them, I also pledge the full
resources of this great nation

375
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:19,076
to find and to punish
those responsible.

376
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:24,282
- I can't let you go out there.
- Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

377
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:25,987
Get away from me now,
or I swear

378
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,579
I will have your family
eating dog food out of a can.

379
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,495
Martha, stop it!

380
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,648
Mike, damn it,
I am the First Lady!

381
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,148
Tell your storm trooper
to stay away from me!

382
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:37,833
I need to talk to my husband.

383
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:41,554
Martha, look... he's in the middle
of a press conference right now.

384
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:45,753
Hundreds of millions of
people are watching him live.

385
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:51,627
What is it, Martha?
What is so urgent?

386
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,430
Maybe I can help.

387
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,737
Tell Charles I want to
see him when he's done.

388
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,268
All right.

389
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:09,948
Don't shoot me.

390
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,894
What the hell are
you doing here?

391
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:15,474
I'm sorry I followed you. I'm just...
I'm just worried about my mother.

392
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:18,324
Get up.

393
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,143
Get up. Get up!

394
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,459
Damn it! Come here.
You're going with me.

395
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:25,876
This is none of my business.

396
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:27,721
This is none of my business.
I won't tell anyone.

397
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,279
Just let me go, okay?

398
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:33,269
I really wish I could,
kid, but I can't.

399
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,927
You're going with me.
Now get in the helicopter.

400
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,714
Frank, Frank, come on, please.

401
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,775
Move!

402
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:58,615
Prep a sterile cranial field.
I need access to the right hemisphere.

403
00:27:58,628 --> 00:27:59,595
Right away.

404
00:28:04,227 --> 00:28:06,425
I need to talk to Tony
before he goes into surgery.

405
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:07,808
He's non-responsive.

406
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:09,512
According to the
paramedic on the chopper,

407
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,542
he suffered a closed head trauma
that's affected his speech.

408
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:14,994
They're going to try to insert
a stint to relieve the pressure.

409
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:18,017
- Will he be able to talk then?
- The doctor doesn't know.

410
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:20,737
I want real time
updates on his progress.

411
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:23,857
We need Tony to explain this.

412
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:25,374
What is it?

413
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:27,833
I may have found a connection
between Tony and David Palmer.

414
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,984
- Tony's phone records?
- One call in particular.

415
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:32,046
The last time Tony spoke
to President Palmer

416
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:34,362
was the day that Jack
Bauer was killed.

417
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,756
Pull the transcripts?

418
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,975
I tried,
but the files were corrupted.

419
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,792
What's he hiding?

420
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,766
Something about Jack's death.

421
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:49,815
Are you kidnapping me?

422
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:50,817
No!

423
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:52,919
Then where are you taking me?

424
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:55,340
- Los Angeles.
- Why?

425
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:57,106
Because I couldn't
leave you back there.

426
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,748
You'd have gone to the police,
and I couldn't let that happen.

427
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:02,549
But what is this about?
Who are you?

428
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:06,205
Someone who's not supposed
to still be alive.

429
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,593
Like some kind of
witness relocation thing?

430
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:10,154
Yeah, something like that.

431
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:12,362
So you were a criminal.

432
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:16,843
No. Listen, Derek,
the less you know about me, the better.

433
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,032
So what are you
going to do with me?

434
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:24,178
- Hello?
- Diane, it's me.

435
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,643
Frank, I can just barely hear you.
What's that noise?

436
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:28,545
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.

437
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,603
- Derek?
- Yeah. He's fine.

438
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:33,450
Listen, Diane, I need you to pick
him up in Los Angeles for me.

439
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,508
Why is he with you?

440
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,626
I'll explain everything
as soon as I see you.

441
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,856
Frank, Frank,
what are you doing with Derek?

442
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,373
Diane, please just
do this for me.

443
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,747
I need you to get in a
car and start driving now.

444
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:44,179
You're scaring me.

445
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:47,586
Diane, do you remember this morning,
when you said that you trusted me?

446
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:49,968
Right now,
I need you to trust me.

447
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:52,097
Derek's going to be fine.
Just do what I say.

448
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:54,905
I need you to get in a car and
start driving towards Los Angeles.

449
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,616
Don't talk to
anybody about this.

450
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:58,828
And I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.

451
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,315
Frank?

452
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:05,705
I don't understand.

453
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,013
You're just going to
hand me back to my mom?

454
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:10,295
I thought you were worried
about me going to the police.

455
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,975
I have something to do in Los Angeles.
Once it's done, it doesn't matter.

456
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:33,349
How are you doing?

457
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,529
I'm sorry, Charles.
I didn't mean to make a scene.

458
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:38,949
I know that.

459
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:43,218
Dr. Hill says you haven't
been taking your medication.

460
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:46,679
I don't like the way
the pills make me feel.

461
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:47,625
Martie...

462
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:51,621
we just need to
get through today.

463
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:55,310
Charles... the reason
that I needed to...

464
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:59,032
- needed to talk to you...
- What is it, honey? Go ahead.

465
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:01,680
I think...

466
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:06,415
that David was killed because of
something he was about to tell me.

467
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,807
Come over here.

468
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:15,325
- What are you talking about?
- He called me yesterday.

469
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:17,956
He said he wanted
to meet with me.

470
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,283
Meet with you about what?

471
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:23,027
He said it concerned national security,
and that it involved you.

472
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:25,079
- Me?
- Yes.

473
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:27,070
What else did he say?

474
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:29,847
Just that he would
explain when he saw me.

475
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:35,306
If this was so important,
why wouldn't he have called me himself?

476
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:41,031
Charles, you shut him out of this White
House about 18 months ago. You
know that.

477
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,825
- He had no real access.
- Except through you.

478
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:49,355
- You don't believe me.
- I didn't say that.

479
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:53,095
- You didn't need to.
- Martha...

480
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:59,197
I am not making this up. I am not crazy;
I am not a fool, Charles!

481
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:01,220
Martha... it's going
to be all right.

482
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:05,259
I'm not making this up.

483
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:12,378
All right.
I'll have Walt look into it.

484
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,469
- You will?
- Yes.

485
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:16,140
Thank you.

486
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,806
But right now...

487
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:22,584
President Suvarov and his wife
are arriving in one hour.

488
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,409
I need you to be there.

489
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:28,619
I need you by my side.

490
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:33,804
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:53,247
Was she all right?

492
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:57,082
No, Walt, she's not all right. She's
having another one of her delusions.

493
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:01,712
She thinks that David Palmer was killed
because of something he was about to
tell her.

494
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:05,487
She's imagining she's in the middle of
one of her own conspiracy theories.

495
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:07,959
Well, what should we do?

496
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:11,877
Nothing.

497
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,959
Spenser, have you talked
to Chloe this morning?

498
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:30,104
No. Why?

499
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,873
She left her apartment
about a half hour ago.

500
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:34,823
She should've been here by now.

501
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:35,939
It's probably traffic.

502
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:37,729
She commutes against traffic.

503
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:39,662
And she's not answering
her cell phone.

504
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:41,275
I wouldn't worry about it.

505
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,608
She sounded strange
when I talked to her.

506
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,809
She always sounds strange.

507
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:49,222
I'm gonna call Adamson,
have him run a locate on her cell.

508
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,167
Don't waste his time, Edgar.
She's fine. I'm sure of it.

509
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:54,257
- What makes you so sure?
- It doesn't matter.

510
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:57,505
- It does to me.
- I saw her, okay?

511
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,570
Uh, about half an hour ago.

512
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,138
- But I thought you said...
- Forget what I said.

513
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,437
Where did you see her?

514
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,594
Man... do you really need
me to spell it out for you?

515
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:14,226
Don't worry about Chloe.
She's fine, all right?

516
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,746
You can just let me out here.

517
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:26,935
- There's nothing here.
- Just pull over, please.

518
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,286
Why won't you talk
to me, Frank?

519
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,896
Will you please tell
me what's going on?

520
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:48,299
Please?

521
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:53,703
A friend of mine's in trouble.
I needed to pick her up in a hurry.

522
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,025
This is the only way I could
get to her quick enough.

523
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,937
- Chloe.
- Jack!

524
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:50,748
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine! What's happening?

525
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:53,919
Why would anyone want to kill
the people who know you're alive?

526
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:55,629
I don't know yet,
but we're gonna find out.

527
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:59,028
Right now, I need to get access to
CTU's archives from a secure location--

528
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,508
can you help me do that?

529
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,485
I can't do it from my laptop.

530
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,230
But there's a research
loft at Cal Tech.

531
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,483
I can get us in.

532
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:07,376
Who's that?

533
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,317
I'll explain as soon
as we're in the car.

534
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,830
I don't have a car.
I took a cab.

535
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:17,130
Come on, get in the helicopter.

536
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,117
We got to go.
Derek, get back in.

537
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,748
- Jack?
- What?

538
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:37,842
It's them.

539
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,679
How did they find me?

540
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:41,423
I don't think they
ever lost you.

541
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:46,640
Come on.

542
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:49,128
Come on.

543
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,673
What's going on, Frank?
Who are they?

544
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,297
What are we waiting for?
Take off!

545
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,798
We're not at speed!

546
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:58,575
We're not gonna make it.
Get out!

547
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:01,483
Get out now,
and stay by the side of the helicopter!

548
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,764
Here! Take him and go
into the refinery!

549
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,734
Find somewhere to hide! Move!

550
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:46,386
Double back, cut him off.

551
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,346
Go through the smoke screen;
I'm going around.

552
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:26,650
Hold your fire, Chloe!

553
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:42,056
Jack, what are you doing?
Let's get out of here.

554
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,950
Chloe, take Derek
and walk away.

555
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,666
Walk away now!

556
00:39:58,304 --> 00:39:59,837
At the rate you're
bleeding out,

557
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,116
you're not gonna make it unless
you get medical attention.

558
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:03,613
You tell me what
I want to know,

559
00:40:03,643 --> 00:40:05,804
and I will get you to a hospital,
you understand me?

560
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:08,064
Do you understand me?

561
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:08,932
Yeah.

562
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,176
Four people knew I was alive.

563
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:14,215
This morning,
you tried to take them out. Why?

564
00:40:14,391 --> 00:40:17,590
Palmer was my...
primary target.

565
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:19,369
They only cared about Palmer.

566
00:40:19,465 --> 00:40:21,737
The others were
just a diversion...

567
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,996
...to set you up,
make it look like you did it.

568
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,972
Why'd they want to kill Palmer?

569
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,857
To keep him from talking.
They had to shut him up.

570
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,089
What'd he know?

571
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,642
I wasn't given
that information.

572
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:40,386
Only hired...
to take out the principle.

573
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,054
You're the one that
killed Palmer.

574
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:47,339
Yeah.

575
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:08,627
Who's behind this?

576
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:12,832
Oh... I got my orders
through a code of silence.

577
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,328
We never use names,
you know that.

578
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:18,675
That's all I know.
Take me to a hospital.

579
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:20,859
Yeah.

580
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:34,856
