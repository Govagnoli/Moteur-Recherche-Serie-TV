1
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,304
Tanner. <i>Emerson spoke to his man
inside the Bureau.</i>

2
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,396
- He says you're clear.
- <i>Good.</i>

3
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:19,101
I need to prep my men,
so why don't you tell me what we need.

4
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,691
I'll give you the specs
when I get there.

5
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:23,850
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.

6
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,985
I can handle it.

7
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,948
I don't understand.
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.

8
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,576
If he doesn't have
the CIP device, who does?

9
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,370
Almeida's working for Juma.

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,747
<i>This is Colonel Ike Dubaku.</i>

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>We demand an immediate withdrawal</i>

12
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:44,627
<i>of the U.S. Naval Strike Force</i>

13
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>by this time tomorrow...</i>

14
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:49,934
The American troops are still
in position near our country.

15
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,385
President Taylor just
received your demands.

16
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,346
Then perhaps it is time
for a more forceful demonstration.

17
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:57,658
I know about Samantha Roth.

18
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,479
She's hiding something about

19
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,686
- my son's murder.
- He wasn't murdered.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,700
- I wasn't completely honest with you.
- What do you mean?

21
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>Roger didn't commit suicide,
Mr. Taylor.</i>

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,031
He was murdered.

23
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:12,006
<i>Tony is not a terrorist.</i>
He's working with me.

24
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,071
We're working outside
the government.

25
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,742
That's why we have to get Tony
back undercover.

26
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,374
You're not going to
make it out of here.

27
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:20,955
I said shut up.

28
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:23,999
Get down!

29
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,642
We got to get you out of here
and back undercover. Go!

30
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:41,766
Tony, let's go!

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,293
Security saw Bauer and Almeida
getting into a dark-colored panel van.

32
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:11,556
- What direction were they heading?
- West.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,414
- What's happening with D.O.T. cameras?
- Traffic images aren't loading.

34
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,343
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

35
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:20,400
The server's not responding. The hacker
must be jamming the transmission.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,156
- How can they do that?
- If I knew, I could get around it.

37
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,964
Check ancillary security cams,
ATMs, parking garages...

38
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:27,646
there has to be something.

39
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,885
Keep canvassing the area.
Someone may have seen the vehicle.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,224
That... Fine. Let me know.

41
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:35,751
No luck on municipal cameras.

42
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:38,244
- They've someone running interference.
- Damn it.

43
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,584
Bauer must have worked out
this escape with Almeida's people.

44
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,166
I'm so sorry, Larry. He played me.

45
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,325
Had me believing
the Bureau was compromised...

46
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,250
someone on the inside working
against us. I realize it was him.

47
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,128
Don't put this on yourself.

48
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,313
- He played us both.
- I should have seen it.

49
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,954
Fine, take it downstairs.

50
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,258
He's facing an indictment...
years in prison.

51
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,803
Almeida must have offered him
a way out.

52
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:04,255
- The White House is on line one.
- I'll take it in the conference room.

53
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,798
I'm going to make this right, Larry.

54
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,132
Whatever it takes,
I will find Bauer and Almeida.

55
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,068
Throw in a CIP device,
and maybe we'll be off the hook.

56
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,062
What's the status of the shooter?

57
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:20,116
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
But a print match is just coming up now.

58
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:23,744
His name is Alan Tanner.

59
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:27,706
He was former Special Forces,
discharged after Desert Storm.

60
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,917
- Discharged why?
- Medical reasons.

61
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,742
He made claims to having
Gulf War Syndrome.

62
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,782
Tried to sue the government,
case was dismissed.

63
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:38,248
I want to be informed
the minute he's awake.

64
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,013
<i>I'm connecting you now.</i>

65
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,709
Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
I'm here with the president.

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,193
What are you doing
about the situation?

67
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,898
<i>We put out an all-agency alert.</i>

68
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,567
We understand apprehending
Almeida is our top priority.

69
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,027
How did he escape?

70
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:01,699
He had the help of a former
CTU agent that we mistakenly trusted.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,885
<i>A man by the name of Jack Bauer.</i>

72
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,913
I thought he's in the middle
of a Senate Investigative Hearing.

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,098
That is correct.

74
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,924
We issued a subpoena,
excusing him from the hearings

75
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,847
in order to enlist his help
in apprehending Almeida.

76
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,340
Now you're saying
that these two men are allied?

77
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,690
- It would appear so.
- My God...

78
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:23,373
You and your people
have royally screwed up, Agent Moss!

79
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,180
Without Almeida,
we have no way of finding Dubaku

80
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:28,635
and no chance of recovering
the CIP device.

81
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,295
Let's stay on point.

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,897
Agent Moss, are you working
any other leads?

83
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,274
Yes, Madame President. A confederate
of Almeida's who was wounded today.

84
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:39,814
He's out of surgery. We're waiting
for him to regain consciousness.

85
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:43,073
Do we have a time frame
on when that might happen?

86
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,017
No, madam. Not really.

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,980
Let me be clear, Agent Moss:

88
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,871
Recapturing Almeida and Bauer
isn't just your top priority,

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,535
- it's your only priority.
- Yes, madam.

90
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,084
Keep us posted, Agent.

91
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,135
Bottom line: the Bureau is not going
to be the answer to our prayers here.

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm afraid not.

93
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:04,243
- How much time does that leave us?
- Less than two hours.

94
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,519
Dubaku's demand is
that our forces retreat

95
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:10,267
behind the 23rd meridian
within 24 hours.

96
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:13,524
Now, in order to meet that timetable,
the fleet and Carrier Air Wing

97
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,719
must start withdrawing
by 1:00 at the latest.

98
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,483
Which would effectively
end our mission in Africa

99
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,405
and condemn another 100,000 Sangalans
to a certain and brutal death.

100
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,300
On the other hand,
if you authorize the invasion,

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,871
Dubaku will undoubtedly
engage the CIP device.

102
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,057
How far has the FAA gotten
with grounding aircraft?

103
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:41,242
Still over a thousand planes in the air
across the country waiting to land.

104
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,564
Dubaku could bring down
any one of them at any moment.

105
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,387
Or...

106
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,448
use the device
for something far worse.

107
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:54,645
I ran for office on the principle
of non-negotiation with terrorists.

108
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,952
How can I abandon that now,
the very first time I'm tested?

109
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,549
And, if I do so,
won't I be telling Dubaku,

110
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,047
and the rest of the world,

111
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,904
that blackmailing America works?

112
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:07,408
Madame President,
those are questions for the future.

113
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,076
We have a decision to make now.

114
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:24,448
What do you call this place?

115
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,510
We like to think of it as CTU.

116
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,168
What's left of it, anyway.

117
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,646
It's good to see you.

118
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,528
- It's good to see you, too.
- I'm glad you're with us.

119
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,073
I'm not with anyone until someone starts
answering some questions.

120
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,684
Might as well start with you.
Why the hell are you not dead?

121
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:53,870
I was dead.

122
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,206
For almost ten minutes.

123
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:58,416
Or so I was told.

124
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,542
By who?

125
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,712
By him.

126
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,095
His name's David Emerson.

127
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,385
I don't know who he paid off at CTU,

128
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,513
but his people Injected my body
with a hypothermic compound,

129
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,238
and was able to revive me.

130
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,893
- Who's he and what does he want?
- Independent contractor.

131
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:18,405
Enlists ex-military and
intelligence operatives,

132
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,190
jobs them out to clients.
Apparently, I fit the profile.

133
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:22,767
What profile?

134
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,902
Former employees with grievances
against the federal government.

135
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:30,240
Emerson had been keeping tabs
on me ever since I left CTU.

136
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,641
After Michelle was killed...

137
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,788
he figured I'd make a good recruit.

138
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,333
And everyone else thinking you're dead,
so much the better.

139
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:43,879
And since then, you've been working
undercover to expose his operation?

140
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,123
What?

141
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,026
I was really working for him.

142
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,340
I was angry.

143
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:03,305
I hated the government
for what it took from me.

144
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,801
I ran Emerson's crew
for more than three years.

145
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:11,945
And I did some pretty bad things.

146
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,173
What made you turn against him?

147
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,046
The CIP device.

148
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,709
Emerson had my crew

149
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,317
stealing components
to breach the firewall.

150
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,713
I knew what that meant.

151
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:34,127
Innocent Americans would die.
And I didn't signed up for that.

152
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,890
- Why didn't you call the authorities?
- He couldn't.

153
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,133
Why not?

154
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,477
He found out Emerson's client
was Dubaku.

155
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:46,284
That's who has agents
inside the government.

156
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:49,415
The Juma regime controls
Sangala's vast diamond wealth.

157
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,612
Dubaku hasn't been shy
about throwing it around.

158
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,113
- How widespread is the corruption?
- Pervasive.

159
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,659
That's why Tony came to me.

160
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:58,161
He didn't know how far
or high up this thing went.

161
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,080
Dubaku is the key to this thing.

162
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,276
If we're going to uncover
the conspiracy,

163
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,698
we have to get to him
before he leaves the U.S.

164
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:07,295
That's why I have to get back under
as soon as possible.

165
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,070
There's a new job
for me and my crew.

166
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,431
I don't have the details, but I know
that it'll get me to Dubaku.

167
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:17,611
The challenge is going to be
reinstalling Tony with Emerson.

168
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:19,687
We have to assume Emerson knew Tony

169
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,815
was in FBI custody
and managed to escape.

170
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,855
He's going to think Tony made
a deal with the U.S. attorney.

171
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,037
That's right.

172
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,580
I can help you with this.

173
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,661
Yes, you can.

174
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:45,209
Outside of the three of you,
who else is in this operation?

175
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,293
It's just us.

176
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:49,000
This is it.

177
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:58,484
Please, tell me that you've got
some proof that this conspiracy exists.

178
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,766
Yes, we do.
But only at the lowest level.

179
00:10:01,107 --> 00:10:03,601
We've just begun
to scratch the surface.

180
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,192
I'll work with you.

181
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,706
But only because, right now,
you are the only people that I trust.

182
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,331
You give me one reason
to question that,

183
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:27,542
and I swear I will turn you in.
You understand?

184
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:32,381
Chloe, set up the call with Emerson.

185
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,384
I found 2 freelancers.

186
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,492
- Ex-Rangers.
- You trust them?

187
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,977
I've worked with them before.
Litvak knows them, too.

188
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,309
They may want to know
more about the job.

189
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,603
Only thing they need to know
is what it pays.

190
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,814
All right.

191
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,499
<i>It's me.</i>

192
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,882
Where are you?

193
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:04,037
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.
I got away from the FBI.

194
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,333
Yeah, I heard.

195
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,040
I also heard it was Jack Bauer
who broke you out.

196
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,627
- That's right.
- That doesn't make any sense.

197
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,238
Bauer's working for them.
He helped capture you.

198
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,678
He didn't have a choice.
He's on board now.

199
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:19,952
- What do you mean "on board"?
- You heard about the Senate Hearings?

200
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,261
They're going to file
criminal charges against him.

201
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,282
I told him that if he helped us out,

202
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,192
you could get him
out of the country.

203
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,937
If it weren't for Jack,
I'd still be in custody.

204
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,231
We can use him, I'm telling you.

205
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,129
I don't know, Tony.

206
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,360
Morgan's hiring new men now.

207
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,449
Morgan's a thug. He can't run point
on something this important.

208
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,073
Let me do it like we planned.

209
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,457
Bauer can take Tanner's place
and we're good to go.

210
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,623
All right, bring Bauer.
We're at 2211 Chesterfield.

211
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:49,756
- <i>Right off Nolan.</i>
- Got it.

212
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,028
He buy it?

213
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:53,987
We'll see.

214
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:35,420
Mr. Taylor, you were looking for me.

215
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,097
Yes, I have to go out

216
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,985
- and I need some transportation.
- Certainly. Where will we be going?

217
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,630
I'll direct you on the way.

218
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:44,293
I need a destination
for the manifest, sir.

219
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,515
As before, I'd like you to
keep this off the manifest.

220
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,071
And no driver this time,
just you and me.

221
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,668
I thought we were through with
all the subterfuge.

222
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:55,393
Please just do as I ask.

223
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm sorry, sir,
not without an explanation.

224
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,399
It's Samantha Roth.

225
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,526
She says she has new information
regarding my son's death.

226
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,385
I thought I was done with this, too.

227
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:12,666
I didn't initiate this.
She called me.

228
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,521
I know you felt obligated
to report my...

229
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,085
my prior activities, and rightly so,

230
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,895
but I would like to think that I can
count on your loyalty when I ask for it.

231
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,621
I could lose my job, sir.

232
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,037
This will be the last time.

233
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,753
I promise.

234
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,639
Please.

235
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:45,223
I'll call you
when I secure a vehicle.

236
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,340
Thank you.

237
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,027
- Who was that?
- Staff, nothing.

238
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:54,661
- Here, can you help me with this?
- Sure.

239
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,079
It was a gift from my father.
You remember?

240
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,719
On the day I won back
his seat in the Senate.

241
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:05,099
Prime Minister Matobo
has asked to see me.

242
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,305
He's going to want to know why
I haven't authorized the invasion yet.

243
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:10,573
What're you going to tell him?

244
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:12,845
I don't know.

245
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:18,465
The American people elected you
because they trust your judgment,

246
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,307
and they're going to trust you
to make the right call on this, too.

247
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,697
I don't know what the right call is.

248
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:27,816
The right call...

249
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,288
is whatever you decide it is.

250
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:37,334
- How many units in the field?
- 17, all available agents are deployed.

251
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:41,086
Widen the grid... we have to assume
they've gotten outside our perimeter.

252
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,299
On it.

253
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,471
- Sean Hillinger.
- <i>Sean, its me.</i>

254
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:50,472
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm calling from the plane.

255
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,714
You haven't landed yet?

256
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,146
No, the pilot says
we're in a holding pattern...

257
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,812
but we keep circling and circling,

258
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,165
and I can see other planes
out the window, too...

259
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,776
eight or nine, at least.

260
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,152
Christina, sweetheart, relax.

261
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:08,497
But the woman sitting next to me says
she heard something about a near miss

262
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,018
and a problem with the air
traffic control system.

263
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:13,968
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

264
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,366
Yeah, it's true.

265
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,458
The FAA has grounded some planes,

266
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,101
<i>but it's only a precaution.</i>

267
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,738
- Really?
- Yeah, it was an isolated incident.

268
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:25,344
You're going to be fine.

269
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,607
I just... I got worried
there for a minute.

270
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,960
- You know how I am.
- I do.

271
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:36,017
Now, listen, I want you to
call me as soon as you land.

272
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,101
I will.

273
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:38,936
I love you.

274
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:40,825
I love you, too.

275
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,840
Was that your wife?

276
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,127
Janis told me
her plane's still in the air.

277
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,259
You okay?

278
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,363
Okay, there's a maniac out there
with the capability

279
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,288
of bringing down planes at will,
so, no, Erika,

280
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,319
I'm not okay.
Her flight is number 18 in the queue,

281
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:03,883
so it'll be another two hours, at least,
before hers gets clearance.

282
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:05,907
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,240
Is there anything I can do?

284
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,102
There's nothing anybody can do,
that's the problem.

285
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:20,546
She's right here. I'll let her know.
Thank you.

286
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,444
I got off the phone
with the hospital.

287
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,947
- Tanner's regained consciousness.
- Can he talk?

288
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:29,287
He asked the doctor
to make a phone call for him.

289
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:31,215
- Who did he call?
- Gage Whitney Pace,

290
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,740
a law firm, I think.

291
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,549
The second largest in DC.

292
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,794
Go grab your laptop.
You're coming with me.

293
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,828
I am?

294
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:39,130
Why?

295
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,230
'Cause we must get to
him before his lawyers

296
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,193
and if I can get
Almeida's location,

297
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,130
I want you on-site to vet
the intelligence to our field teams.

298
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,389
Tell me about Emerson.

299
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:58,294
He's British,

300
00:16:58,797 --> 00:16:59,900
former SAS.

301
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:02,896
Urban warfare, sniping,
close-quarter combat.

302
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,269
Saw action in Beirut and Mogadishu.

303
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,882
- So he's good.
- Extremely.

304
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:10,883
But he's not some wack job
or ideologue.

305
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:15,033
He's about two things...
money and personal loyalty.

306
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,160
Sounds like you still admire him.

307
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,497
Listen, he treated me like a brother

308
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,606
when I thought I had nobody else.

309
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,039
Is this going to be a problem?

310
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,796
I know he's
on the wrong side of this.

311
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:33,853
I'll do what has to be done.

312
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,250
We're here.

313
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,088
- Where's Emerson?
- Inside.

314
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,584
Come in.

315
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,681
Good to see you.

316
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,176
Take Mr. Bauer downstairs.
I need to talk to Tony.

317
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,684
What's going on?

318
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,036
Bringing in Bauer
is not worth the risk.

319
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,593
What're you talking about?

320
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:52,992
Have a seat.

321
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:56,158
Mr. Emerson will be right with you.

322
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,992
I'd still be in FBI custody
if it wasn't for him.

323
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:09,405
- You already made your case.
- We can use him.

324
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,582
I considered it...

325
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,485
but I'm going a different way.

326
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,488
I owe him, David.

327
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,408
<i>- You understand that?
- Yeah, and I appreciate your loyalty.</i>

328
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,453
<i>I always have,
but this is business, Tony.</i>

329
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,705
You can't have a... an unknown
factor like Jack Bauer

330
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,723
coming in and messing things up.

331
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:34,310
So, what, you're going to kill him?

332
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,136
No, you are.

333
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,306
They're going to kill him.

334
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,173
- He'll get out of it.
- What if he can't?

335
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:50,927
Then Jack's death solidifies
Tony's position in the crew.

336
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:53,483
Tony was in FBI custody.

337
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,652
If he'd gone back in there
by himself,

338
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,098
the suspicion would have
rested on him alone.

339
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,073
So by deflecting it onto Jack...

340
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,092
We keep Tony's cover viable.

341
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,620
You knew this might happen
the whole time.

342
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:10,829
So did Jack.

343
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,543
Put your weapon down!

344
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,109
Put your weapon down
or I will kill him!

345
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,518
I came here to do a job,
not be double-crossed by you.

346
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,443
You're already shorthanded.
You need good men,

347
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:46,331
not like these traffic cops.

348
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,579
Look what I've done to them.

349
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:53,109
I am here because
I've got nowhere else to go.

350
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:55,966
Tony said if I helped you,
you get me out of the country.

351
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,000
If you don't believe me,
pull the trigger.

352
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,356
What, are you crazy? Kill him!

353
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:21,863
Kill him or I'm out of here.

354
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:28,832
Fine.

355
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,104
Keep it.

356
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,794
Right, I need Flight 112 reassigned
for immediate landing.

357
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,584
So you're requesting a priority
landing for Flight 112

358
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,772
- <i>out of Las Vegas?</i>
- This is not a request.

359
00:22:19,897 --> 00:22:22,528
I'm forwarding an urgent
protocol from the White House.

360
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:23,899
<i>And your name was...</i>

361
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,113
Larry Moss, Special Agent in Charge.

362
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:31,224
- This is a matter of national security.
- <i>Agent Moss,</i>

363
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,470
may I have
your level five access number?

364
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:36,674
6 2 2 3 5 1 0.

365
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:38,486
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

366
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,353
<i>Flight 112 is moved
to the head of the queue</i>

367
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,241
- <i>and should be on the ground shortly.</i>
- Thank you.

368
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:47,832
<i>President Taylor,</i>

369
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,577
<i>this is Colonel Ike Dubaku.</i>

370
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,272
<i>As you have no doubt confirmed,</i>

371
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:56,881
<i>the near-collision at JFK
International was no accident.</i>

372
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,711
<i>We have the CIP device.</i>

373
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:03,668
<i>We have the capability to kill</i>

374
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,939
<i>tens of thousands of Americans</i>

375
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,342
<i>and we are prepared to do so.</i>

376
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:12,875
I wanted you to hear it for
yourself, Prime Minister,

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,047
so that you would
understand my dilemma.

378
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:17,510
I see.

379
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:21,441
You are recalling
the invasion force.

380
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,027
Well, that determination
has yet to be made.

381
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,145
And this device over which
Dubaku has control,

382
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:29,970
it poses a significant risk
to your people?

383
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,714
It's a technology

384
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,731
that has the potential
for mass civilian casualties.

385
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:39,014
And it puts the infrastructure
of my country in grave jeopardy.

386
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,377
- What of Sangala?
- Believe me, no one

387
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,754
is more aware
of what's at stake than I.

388
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,621
So you've been informed
of the situation in Kasanga Province?

389
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:51,846
Juma's troops are advancing
on a refugee camp.

390
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:54,496
Over 2,000 lives are threatened.

391
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,184
Mostly women and children.

392
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,441
There is also the matter
of those soldiers who have,

393
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,562
on the promise of American support,

394
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,525
and joined my fighters
on the ground.

395
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:07,110
At least...

396
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:10,722
provide us the weapons we need
in order to defend ourselves.

397
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:14,437
You've been patient with us
before, Mr. Matobo.

398
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:16,788
I can only ask
that you be patient again.

399
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,750
Now, if you'll excuse me.

400
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,213
Madame President, I implore you,

401
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:26,964
do not abandon my country.

402
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:30,595
Mr. Matobo, I will do
everything that I can.

403
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:33,721
I count on you.

404
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,268
Thank you.

405
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:52,550
You didn't think that I would want
to know about the refugees in Kasanga?

406
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,874
Madame President,
you have enough to think about

407
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,931
without being burdened with details.

408
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,117
Especially details
that might push me toward

409
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:00,863
proceeding with the invasion.

410
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:01,813
Madam,

411
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,230
you have to start focusing
on alternatives to the invasion.

412
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:09,097
Give me a good alternative
and I'll consider it.

413
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:12,212
I'm not saying it's a good alternative,
but it's the only one.

414
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,356
Comply with Dubaku's demands.

415
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,951
Stand down the task force.

416
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:20,624
That's your recommendation?

417
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:22,897
- Back down?
- It is.

418
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,432
Damn it, Ethan, you heard Matobo.

419
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,451
He's has fighters
on the ground counting on us.

420
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:32,183
Do you want me to be responsible
for another Bay of Pigs?

421
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,076
Kennedy survived the Bay of Pigs,
and you'll survive this.

422
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,933
A superpower has
to act first and foremost

423
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,075
in its own best interests.

424
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:44,124
- Always?
- Always.

425
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:45,668
No apologies.

426
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,912
What about allowing a third party

427
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:50,846
to dictate its foreign policy
does a superpower do that?

428
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,332
Yes, if there's no other option.

429
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:55,506
And right now, there's not.

430
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:02,272
What have we heard about
the search for Almeida and Bauer?

431
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:04,265
Nothing, madam.

432
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,114
Check with them anyway.

433
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:13,988
No hard feelings, Jack?

434
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,815
Forget it.

435
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:21,787
Have to be careful in our profession.
I'm sure you understand.

436
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,368
- Yeah.
- We all know the drill.

437
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:29,086
Disagreements are fine,
but when a decision's made,

438
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:31,684
fall in or you're gone.

439
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,032
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

440
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,559
Good to know you mean it.

441
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:43,157
Before you were subpoenaed,

442
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:46,061
you traveled the world
more than a year.

443
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:47,416
Why?

444
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,966
What were you looking for?

445
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,367
It doesn't really matter.
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

446
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:57,731
You must have known
what was waiting.

447
00:26:57,851 --> 00:26:59,112
Why'd you come back?

448
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,660
Wanted to know what it was like
to walk into a propeller.

449
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,885
That's funny.

450
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:05,655
But no, really.

451
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:10,168
Why?

452
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:14,219
This is my home.

453
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:19,720
That doesn't explain why you turned
yourself in to the Justice Department.

454
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,903
Tony said you were
in Beirut and Mogadishu.

455
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:26,944
And Afghanistan.

456
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,323
Two tours.

457
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,897
Went back a third time
as a private contractor.

458
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:33,572
Be polite, professional,

459
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:36,236
and have a plan
to kill everyone you meet, right?

460
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:38,238
Pretty much.

461
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,077
That's the question, isn't it?

462
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,035
Where do the rules of engagement end
and the crimes begin?

463
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,247
You want to know why I came back?

464
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:47,849
That's why.

465
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,293
I'm not sure I follow.

466
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,716
I just got tired
of talking to myself.

467
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,510
You see, I believe everything
I did was right.

468
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:58,009
So I wanted to start a dialogue.

469
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:00,386
Come clean, set the record straight.

470
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:04,290
- First mistake.
- So I found out.

471
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,073
No one who hasn't been to the edge

472
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,991
and looked over can ever understand.

473
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,730
It's good to have you on board.

474
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,309
Yeah?

475
00:28:31,184 --> 00:28:32,460
What was that about?

476
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,502
He's trying to get a handle on me.

477
00:28:34,738 --> 00:28:36,390
Watch yourself around him.

478
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,134
And do not underestimate him.

479
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,950
I won't.

480
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,345
All right, listen up.

481
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,126
- I just got the call. We're a go.
- A go for what?

482
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,254
We don't even know what the job is.

483
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:56,176
Picking up a package,
delivering it to our client.

484
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:59,032
Here's the location. A residence

485
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:02,160
- at 167 Foxhall Road.
- It belongs to the State Department.

486
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,063
Memorize the layout. We don't know
the exact spot of the pickup yet,

487
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:06,702
but probably the master suite.

488
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,696
- The package is a person.
- Yeah, it is.

489
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,461
Former Prime Minister Matobo
of Sangala.

490
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:19,048
The assignment is to grab him
and deliver him to Dubaku.

491
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:22,259
He wants to ask him
some questions, and as you can imagine,

492
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,485
the colonel can be quite persuasive.

493
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,578
<i>Now, Matobo has tight security,</i>

494
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:29,368
<i>so finish arming up,
be prepared to engage.</i>

495
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:31,018
<i>We roll in two minutes.</i>

496
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,180
They're going to kidnap Matobo.
We've to alert somebody and stop this.

497
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,523
No, we do nothing.

498
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,146
You heard them, they're going
to torture him and kill him.

499
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,668
Unfortunately, yes.

500
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,393
Matobo single-handedly led the fight
against genocide in his country.

501
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:46,825
- He doesn't deserve this.
- I understand that.

502
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:50,712
But if we don't go along with the grab,
Jack and Tony will not find Dubaku,

503
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,190
and we won't get to the
bottom of this conspiracy.

504
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:55,483
Agreed?

505
00:29:58,718 --> 00:29:59,718
Agreed.

506
00:30:28,165 --> 00:30:30,244
I don't want you to wait for me.

507
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,913
Just drive away.
I'll call when I need you.

508
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:36,490
- You know I can't do that.
- We're already off the manifest, Brian.

509
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,590
She won't talk to me
unless I'm alone.

510
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,061
All right, I'll take up
a position on the bridge.

511
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:45,813
She'll never know I'm there.

512
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:49,016
All right.

513
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:24,929
- Mr. Taylor.
- Sam.

514
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:26,362
I can't stay long.

515
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:28,279
What you told me on the phone,

516
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:30,309
is it true?

517
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:33,348
Yes, they killed Roger
and made it look like a suicide.

518
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:36,071
- Who? Who did this?
- The same people who provided

519
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:39,187
false documents to the SEC to show
he'd been trading on inside information.

520
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,940
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

521
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,274
They said that they'd kill me
if I said anything.

522
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,874
Easy, Sam. Easy.

523
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,779
- I loved him.
- I know you did, Sam.

524
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:53,331
But, I really need
to know what happened.

525
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,793
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

526
00:31:57,913 --> 00:31:59,730
- That's how it started.
- When was this?

527
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,824
January. Early January.

528
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,771
The compliance officer
at his firm asked him to flag

529
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:07,620
any undisclosed ownership
in securities positions.

530
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,889
- I don't understand.
- Basically, kickbacks.

531
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,749
But what he found
was something else.

532
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:14,472
Two of his portfolio managers
had taken on a new client.

533
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,157
The Bahamas branch
of Switzerland's oldest bank:

534
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,756
- Bank Lausanne International.
- What was wrong with that?

535
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:22,481
Bank Lausanne's records revealed
that it was actively trading

536
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:24,331
with firms doing
business in Sangala.

537
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:26,560
- Sangala?
- It jumped out at Roger, too,

538
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:29,383
for obvious reasons,
and digging deeper,

539
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:32,687
he uncovered other blind accounts
that were copying the bank's trades.

540
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:34,201
Which accounts?

541
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:38,543
Accounts that were traced to a senior
member of your wife's administration.

542
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,957
Who?

543
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:42,743
I don't know.

544
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:46,884
But whoever it was had a vested interest
in the proposed military action.

545
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:48,852
Somebody who was
betting against her,

546
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:51,174
who didn't think she'd be able
to pull it off politically?

547
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:53,637
Betting heavily
in 10,000-share blocks.

548
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,642
Roger was a day or two away
from presenting her with the evidence.

549
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,991
It's all here.

550
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,397
Account numbers,

551
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,914
trading records,
everything that he knew.

552
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,619
I'm sorry that I can't
help you out more.

553
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,865
- Samantha...
- I've given you all I can.

554
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:15,533
Do what you have to do,
but leave me out of it.

555
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:16,952
Please?

556
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,248
Thank you.

557
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:46,989
Is Tanner in there?

558
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:49,415
His condition
is still listed as critical.

559
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,905
- Are his lawyers here yet?
- No. But they will be any minute.

560
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,154
Get down to the lobby
and keep an eye out for them.

561
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,031
Call me when they enter
the hospital.

562
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:58,156
Got it.

563
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,992
Hello, Mr. Tanner.

564
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:13,926
I'm Agent Walker. This is Agent Gold.
We're with the FBI.

565
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,469
I think you remember me.

566
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:19,013
I know you're in pain,
so I'll make this brief.

567
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:21,266
Tell me where Tony Almeida is.

568
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,533
Does Almeida
have another base of operations?

569
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,783
Is that where the CIP device is?

570
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,887
- My lawyers...
- Cannot help you, Mr. Tanner.

571
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:37,324
You're going to spend the rest of your
life in prison if you don't cooperate.

572
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,647
But if you do, I give you my word,
I will personally vouch for you.

573
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,961
Helping me find the device can go
a long way to reducing your sentence.

574
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:47,960
Is something funny?

575
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:53,280
- They'd never let that happen.
- Who is they?

576
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:56,153
Colonel Dubaku? Is that who Almeida
takes his orders from?

577
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:57,720
Do you work for him too?

578
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:02,457
Go away.

579
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:05,144
Open your eyes, Mr. Tanner.

580
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,969
I said open your eyes.

581
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:09,957
Look at me!

582
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:12,787
Is Dubaku here in this country?
Does he have the device?

583
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,287
Please. Renee...

584
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:21,561
What are you doing?

585
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:26,999
- Tanner's lawyers just arrived.
- <i>All right, thanks.</i>

586
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,594
His legal team is here.
I need you to stall them.

587
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,355
How am I supposed to do that?

588
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:40,220
Make something up. Just keep them
out of here as long as you can.

589
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,639
- I'm not comfortable with this.
- With what?

590
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,701
We're breaking
about 50 federal guidelines

591
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,602
- just by being here.
- Listen to me.

592
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,380
- This man is our only lead.
- That man asked for legal counsel.

593
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:51,602
I heard him.

594
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,401
Thousands of lives
are at stake here.

595
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:57,779
We either bend the rules a little bit
or we lose this chance forever.

596
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,324
I'm sorry. I just... I can't.

597
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,887
Tony Almeida and Jack Bauer
escaped custody on my watch.

598
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:05,537
I have to make this right.

599
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,875
You either help me or you don't.

600
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,447
Excuse me, gentlemen.

601
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:45,646
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner.
Tell me what you know.

602
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:48,794
You can do what you want to me.

603
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,461
I'm not going to tell you
a damn thing.

604
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:57,965
Who do you work for?

605
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:02,564
You can't do this...

606
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,715
Where is Almeida?

607
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,391
How do I find the CIP device?
Tell me now.

608
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,894
My lawyers...

609
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:37,671
You can't do this.

610
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:39,669
You're FBI.

611
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,383
This is illegal.

612
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,803
I have rights.

613
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:50,052
I suggest you use
your last breath wisely.

614
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:56,076
Go to hell.

615
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:19,650
I assure you, I'm taking
this very seriously.

616
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:22,767
- Then tell us where our client is.
- He was moved for security reasons.

617
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:25,342
Into the annex?
Then why isn't he there?

618
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,791
If I can just get on the phone,
I'll call my office.

619
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:31,308
- We'll get to the bottom of this...
- We've had enough of your help.

620
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,875
- I'm genuinely confused too.
- Excuse me.

621
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:37,903
We're trying to find our client,
Mr. Alan Tanner.

622
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:39,103
Just a minute.

623
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,137
I've got a ventilator malfunction.

624
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,678
Damn it! He's coding!

625
00:38:46,803 --> 00:38:48,882
Get a team and a crash cart over here,
STAT!

626
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:50,744
Room 421, Tanner.

627
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,231
It's blocked or something.

628
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:58,335
- We have to get in there!
- I'm trying to! It won't push.

629
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,466
Open this door!
This is an emergency!

630
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:04,508
- I can't get the door open.
- Is somebody in there with him?

631
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,710
- He's all yours, Counselor.
- Wait a minute. We need to talk to you!

632
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,315
You don't want to know, Janis.
Don't ask.

633
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,985
Have agent Alves
drive you back to the office.

634
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:24,198
- Hillinger.
- Let me speak to Larry.

635
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:27,032
Sir, I've got Walker on the line.

636
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,884
- Did you get anything?
- I have a lead on Almeida.

637
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:36,061
There's a plot in place against
the former prime minister Sangala.

638
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:39,333
Tanner says Almeida's crew
has a plan to abduct him.

639
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,931
- When?
- Pretty much now.

640
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,585
If Almeida's still a part of this
and we can get there before him,

641
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,585
- we can set a trap.
- All right.

642
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,052
I'll alert the prime minister's
security detail and scramble a Tac Team.

643
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,527
Matobo's housed
in a State Department residence:

644
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:54,837
- 167 Foxhall Road.
- I'm on my way.

645
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:57,897
- Do not go in alone. Wait for backup.
- Right.

646
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,368
- <i>Is this Major Etolo?</i>
- It is.

647
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,079
This is Agent Larry Moss, FBI.
This is not a drill.

648
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:19,249
Code: alpha alpha delta.
Lock the prime minister down.

649
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:21,892
- <i>I repeat, lock him down.</i>
- Yes, sir.

650
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:52,281
We're clear. Go.

651
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,000
- Where's Matobo?!
- I don't know...

652
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,242
Where is he?

653
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,129
I got him!

654
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,773
Drop the weapon! Now!
Put the gun down!

655
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,147
On your knees!

656
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,090
Where is Matobo?

657
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:33,774
You will not be able
to get to him now.

658
00:42:14,173 --> 00:42:15,615
What is happening, Ule?

659
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:17,620
Who is doing this to us?

660
00:42:18,146 --> 00:42:20,671
Stay calm.
It's going to be all right.

661
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:28,336
It's dead.

662
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,593
- What you got?
- It's a safe room, reinforced concrete.

663
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:37,971
Why the hell didn't
we know about this?

664
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:43,351
You have 3 s to open the door.

665
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,810
- One...
- I can't.

666
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:48,230
- Two...
- It can't be unlocked from the outside.

667
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:50,529
It can only be opened
from the inside.

668
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,674
If we leave here without Matobo,

669
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,829
we lose our only chance
of getting at Dubaku.
