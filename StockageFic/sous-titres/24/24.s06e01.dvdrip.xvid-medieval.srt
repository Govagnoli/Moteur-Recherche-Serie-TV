1
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,749
(man) America has been victimised again.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,072
Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio
was the latest in this series of bombings

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,993
that began 11 weeks ago
in ten different cities.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,355
Over 900 have been killed thus far.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,637
While no one claims responsibility
for this wave of death,

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,314
evidence points to Islamic militants.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,437
Here in Los Angeles,
the mood is tense and fearful.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,116
The Department of Homeland Security
urges all citizens to report without delay

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,475
any suspicious persons or activities.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,838
A department spokesperson says,
"We don't want to start a witch-hunt,

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,754
but we'd rather err on the side of caution
than become the next target."

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,915
He said that the vigilance of the public
is our best line of defence against attack.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,468
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,632
Stop, stop, stop. Open the doors.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,154
Please, I have to get to work.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,276
I'll be late for work.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,397
Please, open the door.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,836
Come on, man, open the door.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,675
Open the door! I can't believe you...
I can't believe you didn't open the door!

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,435
I have as much right to be on the bus as you!

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,908
(beep)

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,310
Our country is under siege.
You're the National Security Advisor, Karen.

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,311
I'm surprised by your resistance.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,598
These places you keep building
are nothing more than concentration camps.

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,511
Detention facilities.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,718
The criteria for determining
who should be detained are very reasonable.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,591
This revised plan of yours justifies locking up
every American who prays towards Mecca.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,193
That's an exaggeration.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,511
The American Muslim
community is our greatest asset.

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,239
They provided law enforcement
with hundreds of tips.

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,880
Not one member
has been implicated in the attacks.

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,871
So far.

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,317
Mr President, the people are losing faith
in our ability to protect them.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,960
We've got to do something about this now.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,077
And locking up more Muslims
will not make them safer.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,958
No, Karen, but it will make them feel safer.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,157
What about the civil unrest
your plan will create?

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,631
- There will be riots, demonstrations...
- Security has its price.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,438
So does freedom, Tom.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,512
I don't see how
I can sign off on something like this.

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,071
Three months ago I took an oath to preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,392
And what about preserving, protecting
and defending the American people?

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,391
All of these measures are legal.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,756
Blake has been all over this
with the Attorney General.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,073
There is a precedent in wartime. Lincoln
suspended habeas corpus, Roosevelt...

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,676
Yes, I know this. And Roosevelt imprisoned
over 200,000 Japanese Americans,

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,797
in what most historians
consider to be a shameful mistake.

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,429
I'd ask those historians
how many of those Japanese Americans

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,911
were thus prevented from perpetrating
acts of sabotage in this country.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,197
I realise that what I'm proposing
has its challenges,

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,592
but we cannot continue to keep
our heads buried in the sand.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,830
- Mr President.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,520
- Another attack?
- Los Angeles, a bus.

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,308
- How many casualties?
- 23 so far, including the suicide bomber.

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,151
We're still certain this Assad
is behind these attacks?

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,597
He arrived in the US three days
before the first bombing in San Antonio.

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,676
Let us not forget Assad has been calling for
the destruction of the US for the last 20 years.

58
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,197
Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's
organisation cannot survive without him,

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,271
and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,070
So this assumes the success
of the operation to terminate Assad.

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,550
CTU estimates successful probability at 75%.

62
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,952
- I think that's very generous.
- It sounds like you're anticipating failure.

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,874
I fully acknowledge, sir,
that this is our only option,

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,158
but I am fervently advocating contingencies.

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,711
Contingencies are well and good, Tom,
but CTU needs to eliminate Assad.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,155
That's all there is to it.

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,150
God knows we're paying
a steep enough price to get him.

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,435
I told you 20 times, don't send out
a report without a certified header.

69
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,954
This makes 21.
You should update your count.

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,636
Do you - I'm just curious - ever open your
mouth without sarcasm spilling out of it?

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,757
- Are we done here?
- I'm just telling you to be careful,

72
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,593
or you'll be back selling
ladies' shoes in Beverly Hills.

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,478
You're settling well into middle management.

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,599
- What's your problem with me?
- I liked you as an analyst. You were good.

75
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,989
As a boss, bit of a bore.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,998
Right.

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,196
What's going on?

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,794
Talk to your boyfriend.
Guy's on self-destruct.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,234
You promised you'd get along with Milo.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,154
I'm sorry, darling,
that's a promise I just can't keep.

81
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
Morris. Morris!

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,510
I had the same problem with
department heads. I learned to fit in.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,515
- There's no reason why you can't.
- I don't happen to be a pretty lady.

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,273
- What are you talking about?
- You're a hottie.

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,352
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. Deal with it.

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,793
- We're at work.
- So?

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,997
- It's unprofessional.
- Are you saying you don't like it?

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,234
No. I just came to see if you got a request
from Homeland on the priority channel.

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,151
No.

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,549
Why did they send it only to me?

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,200
I don't know.

92
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,159
- Just try to get along.
- Because you asked, I will.

93
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,755
Nadia, I got a weird request from Homeland.

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,037
They want to set up a channel.
I wanted to clear it with you.

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,079
- You're cleared.
- They want it formatted to military specs.

96
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,799
I'm coordinating an assault
with Cobra helicopters.

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,314
- When?
- 30 minutes.

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,472
- But assault on who?
- Assad.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
What? We don't know where Assad is.

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,679
- We will. We have a lead.
- No. If we did, I'd know about it.

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,309
- We found a way to get Assad's location.
- How?

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,477
- Jack Bauer.
- Jack's in a Chinese prison.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,715
Not any more. President negotiated
his release two days ago.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,475
- Jack's coming back?
- Yes.

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,348
Why did the Chinese let him go? Why today?
Does it have to do with the attacks?

106
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,274
- How do we think he'll lead us to Assad?
- I can't talk about this yet.

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,399
Why not? Can Bill Buchanan talk about it?

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,199
He's meeting Jack
at Point Mugu Naval Air Station.

109
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,035
Now open that military channel
and put it through to the conference area.

110
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,875
The president must have
given up a lot to make this happen.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,112
I wish he were coming back
under different circumstances.

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,554
We don't know what his state of mind will be.

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,712
If he doesn't cooperate,
we need to be prepared.

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,432
Mr Buchanan, I need your signature
on this release document.

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,829
Take those cuffs off him.

116
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,911
(speaks Chinese)

117
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,317
Jack.

118
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,437
It's OK. Come with me.

119
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,070
Please convey to your president
that Mr Bauer never broke his silence.

120
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,754
He hasn't spoken a word in nearly two years.

121
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,599
Your president has paid
a high price for Mr Bauer's freedom.

122
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,672
What he wants from him
must be very important.

123
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,078
President Palmer wants to speak to you
himself as soon as we debrief.

124
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,031
I'm sorry, Jack. How could you know?
Wayne Palmer is president.

125
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,078
He's the one who negotiated your release.

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,914
I can't even begin to imagine
what you went through over there.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,594
But there's a reason you're here now.

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,719
The last 11 weeks, our cities have been
targeted by a series of terror attacks -

129
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
buses, trains, shopping malls.

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,911
The last one was 15 minutes ago
here in Los Angeles.

131
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,915
It's Hamri Al-Assad.

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,234
Assad's here, Jack.

133
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,358
Four days ago,
one of Assad's men contacted us.

134
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,238
He said he'd give up Assad for $25 million.

135
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,199
But he's demanding something
more than money.

136
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,748
He wants you, Jack.

137
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,912
He wants you dead.

138
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,911
It's Abu Fayed.

139
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,708
He wants his pound of flesh
for what happened in Beirut.

140
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,272
We offered him other alternatives.
We did everything we could think of, Jack.

141
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,309
But he would only agree
to give us Assad in exchange for you.

142
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,474
He's demanded our surveillance protocols,
which means we can't risk an extraction.

143
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,235
Once he has you, you'll be on your own.

144
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,189
You understand what this means, Jack?

145
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,832
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself
so we can eliminate Assad.

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,431
- (whispers) Audrey.
- I can't hear you, Jack.

147
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,951
(clears throat)

148
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,518
Audrey.

149
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,989
Audrey doesn't know you're back.

150
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,791
My daughter?

151
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,950
Kim doesn't know either.

152
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,229
You keep it that way.

153
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,910
I know what's being asked of me, Curtis.
You don't need your firearm.

154
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,153
Before we do this, I would like to clean up.

155
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,709
We've got an area set up for you
and brought you some new clothes.

156
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,874
(phone rings)

157
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,354
Bill.

158
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,749
- (Bill) We have Jack.
- Good.

159
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,799
I thought I was prepared,
but he's worse than I expected, much worse.

160
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,829
I know how hard this must be for you,

161
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,276
but everything depends on this operation.

162
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,476
I understand.

163
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,154
I know you do.

164
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,839
I wish I were there with you.

165
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,798
You're where you need to be.

166
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,356
I miss you.

167
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,715
I miss you too.

168
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,793
I have to take Jack to the drop point now. Bye.

169
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,318
(man) LA has been added to the list
of major cities hit by terrorist attacks.

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,075
The Department of Homeland Security
raised the threat level to red,

171
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,628
the highest since the department was formed.

172
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,269
FBI will handle the searches outside the city.
Focus on the main grid.

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,672
- Nadia, I need to talk to you.
- Finish that up and check back with me.

174
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,513
- Did you put the military channel through?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,469
I tried to locate Bill or Curtis to find out about
Jack. There's a block on their status rosters.

176
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,676
I told you, I can't talk about this.

177
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,991
You've only been here a couple months
so you don't know me well.

178
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,598
If you did, you'd know how much Jack Bauer
means to me. Sooner or later I will find out.

179
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,830
- Tell me.
- I don't have authorisation...

180
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,029
Why don't I call Division and tell them about
when you left the Jarvis firewall unsecured?

181
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,829
If it weren't for me,
you would have been fired over that.

182
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,670
We were contacted four days ago
by a man named Fayed.

183
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,312
He offered to give us Assad's location for a
list of demands. One of them was Jack Bauer.

184
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,631
- Jack? Why does he want Jack?
- Retribution.

185
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,438
Retribution for what?

186
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,195
Fayed's brother was in the cell
that bombed our embassy in Lebanon in 1999.

187
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,113
Jack was sent to grab him
and get names of other members.

188
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,158
Fayed's brother died
while Jack was interrogating him.

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,630
- Now he wants Jack dead.
- That's right.

190
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,396
And you're really gonnajust deliver Jack
over to the terrorist to be killed?

191
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,678
- Nadia...
- We need to stop Assad.

192
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,275
We can grab Jack
once Fayed gives us Assad's location.

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,555
Fayed can detect our surveillance.

194
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,795
We gave Fayed access to our satellite
coverage, radio frequencies and air corridors.

195
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,758
He'll give us nothing
till he's free and clear with Jack.

196
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,149
How do we even know
he'll do what he says?

197
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,559
We don't.

198
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,518
I'm calling Karen. She'll talk to the president.

199
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,197
Don't you get it? Karen already knows.
So does President Palmer. He authorised it.

200
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,750
Look.

201
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,675
I'm sorry about your friend,
but there's nothing you, I or anyone can do.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,832
Right now, this is our only way
out of this crisis.

203
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,277
If we want these attacks to stop,
Jack Bauer has to be sacrificed.

204
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,474
(phone rings)

205
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,478
- I only got half those upgrades.
- You'll get the rest.

206
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,192
I needed them ten minutes ago. Don't expect
Chloe to keep running interference.

207
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,919
- You'll get your upgrades.
- When?

208
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,913
What's going on between you and Nadia?

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,879
The president got Jack back
from the Chinese. He's in LA now.

210
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,748
- Well, that's very good news.
- No, Morris, it's not.

211
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,438
(phone rings)

212
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,909
- Buchanan.
- It's the president. Is Jack with you?

213
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,470
- Yes, sir. We're almost at the drop point.
- Let me speak to him.

214
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,551
I'll put him on. Jack?

215
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,356
Jack?

216
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,509
It's President Palmer.
He wants to talk to you.

217
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,318
Mr President.

218
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,110
Jack, I've been trying to think
of what I could possibly say to you.

219
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,113
After all you've sacrificed for this country,
what you've done for me in the past

220
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,875
and, of course,
what you've done for my brother David.

221
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,478
This is a desperate measure, Jack, I know,
but it's also a measure of our desperation.

222
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,394
People are afraid to come outside,
afraid to leave their homes.

223
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,789
They're turning against each other.

224
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,192
Bill Buchanan explained the situation, sir.
I know what's happening.

225
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,670
I understand what's expected of me.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,437
You have my word. My word, Jack.
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

227
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,990
Thank you.

228
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,834
- God bless you, Jack.
- Goodbye, Mr President.

229
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,556
When I agreed to run for this office,
I thought that I understood this job.

230
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,918
I was right beside my brother David
when he had to make impossible decisions,

231
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,314
times he had to choose between bad options,
but now that I'm the one sitting in that chair,

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,313
I'm starting to wonder
if I'm the right person to lead this country.

233
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,558
- It's an irrelevant question, sir.
- Excuse me?

234
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,189
You will lead this country,
whether you want to or not.

235
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,950
You are the president.

236
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,432
This president can't shake the feeling
that sacrificing Jack Bauer is a mistake,

237
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,557
and that maybe I should
call this off before it's too late.

238
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,952
No, sir. You have not made a mistake.

239
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,036
And, for what it's worth, your brother
would be doing just the same thing.

240
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,716
- That doesn't make it right.
- It isn't right. It isn't wrong.

241
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,792
It's simply our only option.

242
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,034
Bauer has to be sacrificed
so this country can survive.

243
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,910
- I just heard a disturbing rumour.
- Huh? What rumour's that?

244
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,835
You're authorising detention facilities
at convention centres and sports arenas

245
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,198
- in Los Angeles, Detroit and Philadelphia.
- Yeah, that's correct.

246
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,511
That's against the president's order.
I was there.

247
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,037
Karen, I know where you were.
I was standing right next to you.

248
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,590
To my knowledge,
that order hasn't been rescinded.

249
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,198
You are confused. I haven't implemented
anything yet. I'm merely positioning.

250
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,795
If the president changes his mind,
as I suspect he will,

251
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,474
then we will have wasted less time.

252
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,597
I'm not confused.
You can use whatever words you like.

253
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,116
In plain English,
you're second-guessing the president.

254
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,034
Plain English does not allow
for the nuances my job requires.

255
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,553
How far will you push this?

256
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,111
The ACLU is filing complaints that
we gave the bureau too much field authority.

257
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,716
They have not been given near enough.
They need a wider net with tighter mesh.

258
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,473
And when innocent people
get caught in that net?

259
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,588
Well, like I told you before, security
has its price. Just get used to it, Karen.

260
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,991
(phone rings)

261
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,757
- Go ahead.
- Secure Bauer's wrist to the grate and leave.

262
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,435
- First tell me where Assad is.
- This isn't a negotiation.

263
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,310
If you want Assad, leave Bauer here,
get back in your car and drive away.

264
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,197
I'm watching you.

265
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,157
You listen to me, you son of a bitch...

266
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,392
He wants me to handcuff you to that grate.

267
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,512
Do it.

268
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,158
I don't know what to say, Jack.

269
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,233
Do you understand the difference between
dying for something and dying for nothing?

270
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,917
The only reason I fought to stay alive in China
was because I didn't want to die for nothing.

271
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,157
Today...

272
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,031
I can die for something.

273
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,429
My way, my choice.

274
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,272
To be honest with you, it will be a relief.

275
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,189
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Don't be.

276
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,429
Bill, you need to go.

277
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,231
Go.

278
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,589
(woman) Firemen are battling a fire
at the Al-Hamza Mosque in Culver City.

279
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,638
Members of the mosque
are calling it a retaliation

280
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,793
for this morning's suicide bombing
downtown on a metro bus.

281
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,952
- Scott shouldn't go to school.
- He has a geometry test.

282
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,511
Honey, LA was just hit. I mean,
they should be closing these schools down.

283
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,831
They will when it's not safe.

284
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,675
Until then, I don't wanna scare our son
and I don't want you scaring him, either.

285
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,638
I want us to live our lives
as normally as we can.

286
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,713
No, look, Jillian, there is nothing normal,
what's happening here.

287
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,394
Should we hide in our house
for the rest of our lives?

288
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,516
No, it's just...

289
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,635
Hi.

290
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,110
- Was Ahmed able to help?
- I didn't see him. The FBI are at his house.

291
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,350
They're arresting his dad.

292
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,998
What?

293
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,590
- (man) Why are they taking him?
- I don't know.

294
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,437
This is insane. You can't arrest somebody
without a reason. He's not a terrorist!

295
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,996
He's innocent!

296
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,269
- There's gotta be some reason.
- I'm sure it's a mistake.

297
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,839
Ahmed? What are you doing? (shouting)

298
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,911
We just wanna talk to you, OK?

299
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,232
Ahmed, get out here.

300
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,232
That contractor down the block,
Stan something.

301
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,117
I know. I'll call the police.

302
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,988
Come on! Why don't you get
the hell out of my neighbourhood?

303
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,196
- What are you doing?
- Helping Ahmed.

304
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,272
- Your father is calling the police.
- They won't do anything.

305
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,873
You're not going there.

306
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,669
I'm not hiding while he gets beat up
cos you're scared to do the right thing.

307
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,034
Scott...

308
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,917
Stay here.

309
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,398
I'll handle it.

310
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,710
- I wanna talk.
- Get out of my house.

311
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,715
- We're here to give you friendly advice.
- Stan, what the hell are you doing, man?

312
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,634
I'm trying to protect my family, Ray.
This kid's father's a terrorist.

313
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,191
- He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.
- Yeah? Then why did they arrest him?

314
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,636
- They're scared, like everyone else.
- Get out of my way.

315
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,950
Hey, Stan. Come on! Stan.

316
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,117
If you want him, you're coming through me.

317
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,595
This isn't over, Ray.

318
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,832
- You all right?
- Yeah.

319
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,754
All right, I think you should come stay with us

320
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,516
- until things get sorted with your father.
- I appreciate what you did. I'll be fine.

321
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,310
This guy is ajerk and I don't want
you staying here alone. It's dangerous.

322
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,789
I'm not taking no for an answer.

323
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,317
- Nadia, Bill Buchanan for you.
- Right.

324
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,479
- Bill.
- Jack's at the drop point. Are we set?

325
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,111
The marines have two helicopters ready.
We can hit any target in LA within 20 minutes.

326
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,398
Jack's giving his life for this operation
so I don't want any mistakes.

327
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,710
Assad must be taken out with prejudice.

328
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,157
- He will be, when Fayed gives his location.
- If he calls before I get back, loop me in.

329
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,629
- Yeah. Bill.
- Yeah?

330
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,397
- I'm sidelining Chloe on this operation.
- Why?

331
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,553
She started asking questions about Jack.
I tried putting her off but...

332
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,757
- What did you tell her?
- The truth.

333
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,793
- I'll talk to her when I get there.
- Thanks.

334
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,676
- Psst, psst. Move over.
- What are you doing?

335
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,519
- I'll try and get a visual on Jack.
- Fayed has our surveillance protocols.

336
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,592
He's monitoring radio,
satellites and transmissions.

337
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,114
I have access to a satellite
off the government grid.

338
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,636
- How?
- I worked for a consortium in Uzbekistan.

339
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,555
They needed an illegal aerial survey
of some oil fields, I needed quick cash. Aha.

340
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,633
Look, the little bird, she's still flying.
She's still flying.

341
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,269
- I think I can reposition the camera from here.
- Morris...

342
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,196
Don't thank me yet, love. Just stop sulking
and find out where Bill Buchanan left Jack.

343
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,519
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

344
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,271
(phone rings)

345
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,157
- Yes.
- There is a problem.

346
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,117
Don't move out of the tunnel yet.

347
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,113
- What?
- I intercepted a signal to a private satellite.

348
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,031
There are hundreds of them.

349
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,669
The signal is being transmitted
on a government frequency.

350
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,318
What's it looking at?

351
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,712
I can't pinpoint it, but the camera's
been repositioned to your sector.

352
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,750
Connect me to CTU.

353
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,436
Chloe, this is it. This is it.

354
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,310
When the military has Assad's location,

355
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,278
we'll work with law enforcement
to limit damage.

356
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,559
As much as we're trying to prevent civilian
losses, our priority is to take out Assad.

357
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,679
- Fayed is on the line.
- This is Nadia Yassir.

358
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,797
Redirect the satellite
you have aimed at this sector.

359
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,833
What?

360
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,913
Explain the activity on frequency
alpha zero seven zero three.

361
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,391
Bauer is dead either way.

362
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,917
But if you don't redirect that satellite
in 30 seconds, you will lose Assad.

363
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,197
- I'm telling you, there's no satellite.
- 28 seconds.

364
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,517
Nadia.

365
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,513
- Where is this coming from?
- Inside the building.

366
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,239
Where?

367
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,397
Chloe's station.

368
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,029
- Morris...
- What?

369
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,430
- Redirect that satellite. Redirect that satellite.
- The situation is under control.

370
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,956
Fayed tagged you. We may have
lost our chance to locate Assad.

371
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,271
This was a rogue operation.
We're redirecting the satellite.

372
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,918
- You have ten seconds.
- Do it!

373
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,955
9, 8...

374
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,314
- Come on!
- Hurry up.

375
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,550
- 7, 6...
- I'm going as fast as I can.

376
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,438
5, 4...

377
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,272
It's done.

378
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,237
It's moving away.
They redirected the satellite.

379
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,914
- Other channels?
- All clear.

380
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,909
Because of your deception, I will have to
think about giving you Assad's location.

381
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,309
But what about our deal?

382
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,794
Fayed?

383
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,438
(in Arabic language)

384
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,510
(engine starts)

385
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,069
- We may have spooked Fayed.
- I heard what happened!

386
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,517
- Dammit! What were you thinking?!
- It's my fault. You can fire me.

387
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,116
I'd fire both of you now but I can't
afford to lose the manpower. Chloe.

388
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,037
- Look at me.
- I'd rather not, sir.

389
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,111
Look at me.

390
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,837
Don't think you're the only one
mourning Jack. You're not.

391
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,388
That may have been our only option.

392
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,355
You both better hope to God
you didn'tjust blow it.

393
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,115
We may have sacrificed Jack for nothing.

394
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,550
- Karen.
- Have you heard from Fayed?

395
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,234
- Not yet, no.
- The president's worried.

396
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,436
Fayed should have contacted us by now.

397
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,399
There may be a problem. There's a possibility
Fayed's going back on the deal.

398
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,870
- What are you talking about?
- He caught us trying to track Jack.

399
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,713
The orders were that he was
to have a clear field.

400
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,078
Chloe thought there was a work-around.
She did it without authorisation.

401
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,109
She's your responsibility. How could you
let this happen? If we don't take out Assad...

402
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,555
I don't need a lecture. I know the stakes.

403
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,200
I don't think you do.
If these attacks don't stop,

404
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,752
there are people here willing to tear up the
Constitution in the name of national security.

405
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,709
The things they're talking about doing -
this country will never recover.

406
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,839
As soon as I hear from Fayed,
you'll be my first call.

407
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,756
I'm sorry, Bill. It's just, I'm...

408
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,549
There's no need to apologise.
We're all feeling it.

409
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,517
I have to go.

410
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,712
- Anything?
- It's clear.

411
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,837
- Are you sure?
- Yes. They're leaving us alone.

412
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,832
The money's been transferred.
Shall we call CTU?

413
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,911
Not yet.

414
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,715
You need to call CTU.

415
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,309
(speaks Arabic language)

416
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,471
(beeping)

417
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,357
I won't let you die till I'm ready. The Chinese
didn't leave much for me to work with.

418
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,070
But before you die,
you're going to feel what my brother felt.

419
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,789
I saw his body. I know how he died.

420
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,310
I know what you did to him.

421
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,593
(speaks Arabic language)

422
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,192
You don't need me to tell you
that the nerves are bundled here...

423
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,793
(beeping increases)

424
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,431
Better.

425
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,068
You need to give CTU Assad's location.

426
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,958
That was the deal.

427
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,396
Assad has lost faith in our fight.

428
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,228
He thinks our tactics are failing.

429
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,357
He's begun talking about compromise,

430
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,591
about laying down our arms and negotiating.

431
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,429
But there is no compromise, no negotiation.

432
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,796
Assad is a traitor.

433
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,031
And soon, inshallah, he will be dead.

434
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,194
That's right, Jack.

435
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,272
CTU is about to kill the wrong man.

436
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,552
Assad isn't behind these attacks.

437
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,352
He's come here to stop them.

438
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,433
He's come here... to stop... me.

439
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,591
(rapid beeping)

440
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,069
You will die for nothing.

441
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,435
If Fayed doesn't call in five minutes,
reassign everyone here.

442
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,036
- This is Buchanan.
- You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.

443
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,749
- I'm listening.
- I have a transponder at Assad's location.

444
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,275
33-58-11 north latitude.

445
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,275
118-21-40 west longitude.

446
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,716
You'll find Assad there.

447
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,078
- Where is that?
- It's coming.

448
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,671
Inglewood.

449
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,118
Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters. I'll tell
the president we're a go. Cut Fayed's access.

450
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,239
I want to lock down all of our satellites.
Shut 'em down. You got it?

451
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,074
We did everything we could.

452
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,155
I know it's truly awful, but if it stops
these attacks, it's for the greater good.

453
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,233
There's no one that understands that
more than Jack.

454
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,599
Do you remember doing this to my brother?

455
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,878
- Fayed?
- What is it?

456
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,270
There is a call for you. It's important.

457
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,069
(speaking Arabic language)

458
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,310
- Yes.
- (Ahmed) There's a problem.

459
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,359
- Tell me what happened.
- The FBI. They took my father.

460
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,794
Where are you?

461
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,674
I'm at a neighbour's. You know my father is
innocent. He has no idea what we're doing.

462
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,914
If your father is meant to be sacrificed,
that is how it will be.

463
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,958
Now tell me what the FBI said.

464
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,431
(Iong beep)

465
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,193
Good. You did the right thing.

466
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,035
- Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package?
- Yes. It's well hidden.

467
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,510
- You need to deliver it soon.
- I'll call you when I have it.

468
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,312
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

469
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,517
It was my uncle. He's trying
to find out where they took my dad.

470
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,034
- Wanna come eat?
- Yeah.

471
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,275
(speaking Arabic language)

472
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,711
Get in there!

473
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,871
Find him!

474
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,511
