1
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,635
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,257
As soon as I get the recording, we're
going to have to involve your father.

3
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:18,861
You know I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

4
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,809
Tell me what this is all about.

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,990
I will. I just need a minute.

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,369
I decide what needs to be done,
Mr. Anderson.

7
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,131
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

8
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:29,458
President Logan?

9
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,231
And a man named
Christopher Henderson.

10
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,691
I know what you did.
I know what you're doing.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,642
And I'm going to
put an end to it.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,193
You asked to see me,
Mr. President?

13
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:40,807
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller
to tender his resignation

14
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,485
and I wanted you
here as a witness.

15
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:43,032
What?!

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,849
He came here to accuse me of being
complicit in today's terrorist attacks.

17
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:50,089
- Miles set me up.
- Please come with us, Ms. O'Brian.

18
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,283
We traced your call to a public
phone at Van Nuys Airport.

19
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:56,767
If Audrey Raines is at that location,
you're in a lot of trouble.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,076
You're supposed
to be in custody.

21
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:04,415
You helped Audrey Raines
break surveillance.

22
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:07,279
You're sick and you need help
and if you try to stop me,

23
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,467
I will recommend you for
psychiatric evaluation.

24
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:10,110
Get in here.

25
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,807
I haven't been able to
contact Jack or Audrey.

26
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:15,180
I haven't talked
to them either.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,698
Whatever you tell me will remain
between the two of us. I promise you.

28
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:23,222
Not here.
Outside the south stable.

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,501
- Is Bauer dead?
- Not yet, Mr. President.

30
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:28,086
- He has the recording.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:32,938
That evidence directly implicates
me in David Palmer's death.

32
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,458
- Son of a bitch.
- What the hell's going on?!

33
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,260
They've come for the recording.

34
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:49,254
- Audrey!
- I have her, Jack!

35
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:51,847
What have you done to her?

36
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,940
The left brachial artery.

37
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,718
She has about three minutes
before she bleeds to death.

38
00:01:56,748 --> 00:02:00,327
- Now throw me that recording.
- Jack, don't do it.

39
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,418
She's running out of time.

40
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:05,128
- Don't give it up.
- Here it is.

41
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:16,311
Easy, easy.

42
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,297
- Stay with me.
- Jack!

43
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,102
Stay with me.

44
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,044
I need to loosen
the tourniquet.

45
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,204
Good. The bleeding's stopped,

46
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:38,309
which means he didn't
sever the brachial artery.

47
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,689
I need to get you to a doctor.
Jack, I can wait.

48
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,000
Do what you have to do.

49
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,565
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

50
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,706
Keep your arm elevated.

51
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,543
Chloe O'Brian is not available.

52
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,332
Chloe's not picking
up her phone.

53
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:57,008
Is there someone else who
can help you track Henderson?

54
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,769
No one who has the same access
to the CTU satellite network.

55
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,529
Jack, I'm so sorry.
This is my fault.

56
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,646
Audrey, stop it.

57
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,781
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,819
- This is Jack Bauer.
- Jack?

59
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,151
Why are you answering
Wexler's phone?

60
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,097
Wexler's dead.

61
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,965
Henderson and a commando unit
attacked us 15 minutes ago.

62
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,246
They killed all your men
and took the recording back.

63
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,041
- Is Audrey all right?
- She's fine.

64
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,062
Did you cut your
deal with Logan?

65
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,205
Logan accepted my terms.

66
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:41,438
Then he took a call,
and suddenly changed his mind.

67
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,402
That call must have
come from Henderson.

68
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,257
Jack, we have to get
the recording back.

69
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,840
If there's anything I can do to help,
let me know.

70
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,614
With all due respect,
Mr. Secretary,

71
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,994
I asked you for your help,
and you betrayed me.

72
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,743
Jack, I did what I thought
was best for this country.

73
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,029
I made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

74
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:00,642
I need to go, sir.

75
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:09,266
Come on.

76
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,496
- Hello?
- Bill, it's Jack.

77
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,119
Jack, we've been waiting
to hear from you.

78
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,019
Did you get the recording
to Secretary Heller?

79
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,433
I don't have time to explain.
Henderson's got the recording.

80
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:22,662
I need Chloe to help me find him,
but I can't reach her.

81
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,168
Chloe's here with me, Jack.

82
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,462
She was arrested by Homeland
Security for helping you,

83
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,042
- but she managed to get away.
- Put her on speaker.

84
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:32,256
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm at Van Nuys Airfield.

85
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,626
Chloe, listen to me.
Henderson left here ten minutes ago

86
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,576
with a recording that
implicates President Logan.

87
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:40,306
I need you to access CTU's satellite
data streams so that we can find him.

88
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:43,481
If I log onto their system, they're
gonna find me eventually, no matter what
I do.

89
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,146
I don't need you to track him for long.
Do you think you can do it?

90
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:48,429
I guess I can try to slip
in through the subnets.

91
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,714
Get back to me when you're in.

92
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:52,308
I'll set up a VPN pathway,
so that they can't trace our call,

93
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:54,355
but it will only work with
the phone you're using.

94
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:58,536
Okay. I got a hold of Chloe.
We need to go. Can you get up?

95
00:04:58,678 --> 00:04:59,862
- Yeah.
- Slowly.

96
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,644
If we're going to do
extensive satellite tracking,

97
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,173
I need more than my laptop. I'm gonna
have to network onto your computer,

98
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:12,545
even though it's
kind of pathetic,

99
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,638
and I need you to get that
screen to work for me.

100
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:15,022
All right.

101
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,819
I hope you don't mind
me bossing you around,

102
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,527
but  technically,
I don't work for you anymore.

103
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:20,207
- That's all right, Chloe.
- Good.

104
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,626
Bauer.

105
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:34,866
Jack, I'm pulling up satellite footage
of the airfield from 15 minutes ago.

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,833
Look for an explosion in
the northwest corner.

107
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:37,856
Okay, I see it.

108
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,914
About  five minutes after that,
a vehicle leaves the airfield.

109
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,275
That'll be Henderson.

110
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:44,002
He went south on the service drive,
and east on Menders,

111
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:45,432
then I lose him on the grid.

112
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:48,427
Use another satellite, traffic cams,
whatever you have to, just find him.

113
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,883
It's gonna take
us a few minutes.

114
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,520
We're just setting up,
but we're on it.

115
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,750
Copy that. Get back to me as soon
as you got him on a live feed.

116
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:12,889
What makes you think that

117
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,483
Henderson hasn't already
destroyed the recording?

118
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,051
He would have done it immediately,
in front of me.

119
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,321
Given me less of a reason
to come after him.

120
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:23,123
- Why would he keep it?
- It's his insurance.

121
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,408
- Yes.
- Is Bauer dead?

122
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:31,925
No.

123
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:33,995
What happened?

124
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,444
All that matters is that
I have the recording.

125
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,353
- Have you destroyed it?
- No, sir, I have not.

126
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,971
Why, what's the problem?

127
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,737
Actually, I'm making sure
they're won't be any problems.

128
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,001
I don't understand.

129
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,907
I may need protection.
That recording gives it to me.

130
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,710
- Protection?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,464
Do you mean from me?

132
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,424
That's absurd.

133
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,010
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

134
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,664
it isn't absurd,
as evidenced by Walt Cummings suicide.

135
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,751
That was different.

136
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:08,221
You told me yourself
that was necessary.

137
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:09,662
And I'm assuming that one day,

138
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,192
others will tell you the
very same thing about me.

139
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:17,272
Chris, you and I have been
in this from the beginning.

140
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:20,130
Destroying that recording
protects both of us.

141
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:21,789
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

142
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,930
I give you my word it will be
kept in a very place safe,

143
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:30,277
and will only be made public should
I meet with some... accident.

144
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,152
Chris, this is
completely unnecessary.

145
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,613
I'm sure it is, sir.
Then again, I am a very cautious man.

146
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,907
Chloe, have you
got Henderson yet?

147
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,165
Yes, his car is three quarters
of a mile in front of you.

148
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,682
He had a head start.
He should be farther along than that.

149
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:55,924
I don't know what to tell you.

150
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,525
It's definitely the car
he left the airport in.

151
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,205
How long until
I've got a visual?

152
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:00,815
The road curves up ahead, Jack.

153
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,460
You should be able to see
him once it straightens out.

154
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,054
Hold on.

155
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:13,700
Got him.

156
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,338
Get down.

157
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:01,413
Damn!

158
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,226
It's over, Christopher.

159
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,126
Turn around!

160
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:23,269
Put the gun down and keep
your hands where I can them.

161
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,648
Do it or I will kill you!

162
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,193
You kill me, Jack,
Secretary Heller dies, too.

163
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,767
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,792
There's always a contingency plan, Jack.
You know that.

165
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,510
My men have been tracking Heller from a
chopper ever since he left
Logan's Retreat.

166
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,470
Now, if I can't contact them
every 15 minutes on the dot,

167
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,558
they have orders to
kill Secretary Heller.

168
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,738
Which means, you got about
three minutes to save his life.

169
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:51,632
Jack?

170
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,466
Audrey, please get
back in the car.

171
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,857
Is he lying about my father?

172
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,566
Slowly walk towards me.

173
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,862
Put your hands
behind your head.

174
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,329
Get on your knees.

175
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,826
Cuff yourself.

176
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:19,720
Yeah, Jack.

177
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:22,382
Chloe, patch me through to
Secretary Heller's cell phone.

178
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,523
See if you can get a satellite
to lock on his signal.

179
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:27,403
I need you to download a visual
of his vehicle on my PDA.

180
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,103
He was leaving Logan's
retreat just before 1:00.

181
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,993
On it. Open up the parallel
channel on the NSA's landsats,

182
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:38,470
can radial slices in three mile
increments, emanating from the
Retreat... sir.

183
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,896
Okay, Jack,
I'm pulling up the DOD database.

184
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,676
Here it is,
I'm patching you through.

185
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:43,654
Copy that.

186
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,491
- Heller.
- Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.

187
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:54,693
I need you to confirm for me if a
helicopter's been tracking your vehicle?

188
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,979
- What's going on, Jack?
- Sir, time is critical.

189
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,959
Is there a helicopter
above you or not?

190
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,340
Yeah, there's a chopper above me.
Who are they?

191
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,221
Henderson's men.

192
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,453
He claims he's given them orders
to kill you if I don't let him go.

193
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:10,765
Is he bluffing?

194
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,585
He doesn't do that, sir.

195
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,888
Jack, I've got Heller's car.
I'm patching it through to your PDA.

196
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:18,721
Copy that.

197
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:31,599
Jack...  they have a laser
sight trained on me.

198
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:33,908
Get up.

199
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:40,487
You give me the recording, I let you go:
that's the deal.

200
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:41,203
No.

201
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,213
Come on, Jack,
you're wasting time.

202
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,304
We both know you're not
going to let Heller die.

203
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,401
I  can hear him, Jack;
don't let him do this.

204
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,771
I'm going to walk
out of here, Jack,

205
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,471
and you're not gonna stop me,
so uncuff me.

206
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,515
Jack, don't let him go.

207
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,388
- I don't have a choice, sir.
- Yes, you do.

208
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,049
If I had listened to
you in the first place,

209
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,029
none of this would be happening.
This is my responsibility,

210
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:05,857
I will not allow Logan and
Henderson to use me as a pawn.

211
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:06,608
Sir?

212
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:08,603
Do not let them
get away with this.

213
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:12,658
Make sure that the recording
gets to the right people.

214
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,138
Tell Audrey I love her.

215
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,111
Mr. Secretary,
what are you doing?!

216
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:20,592
No.

217
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,298
Chloe, are you
still on the line?!

218
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,145
Can you confirm that Heller just
drove his car into the lake?

219
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:54,991
- Yes.
- Damn you!

220
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,389
Oh, my God, no.

221
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:06,124
How could you do this?

222
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:10,511
This isn't about what you
think is best for the country.

223
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:13,396
This is about your
greed for power.

224
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:17,233
Today, you have been responsible for
killing an ex-president, David Palmer,

225
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:21,021
and the secretary of defense,
two real patriots.

226
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,392
Damn you!

227
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,749
What happened to you?

228
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,791
- Give me the recording.
- I don't have it.

229
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,351
Where is it?!

230
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,755
I'm not going to tell you, Jack, and you
know that-- no matter what you do
to me.

231
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:37,819
Do it.

232
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,237
Kill him, Jack. Do it!

233
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:03,228
Yeah.

234
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,918
- Graham?
- Yes.

235
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,058
You need to cancel the action
against Henderson immediately.

236
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:08,718
Why?

237
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,165
He has the recording,
but he's made arrangements

238
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,545
to have it released if
anything happens to him.

239
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,912
You should have exercised
more control over him.

240
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,792
There's a limit to
how much I can do.

241
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:20,983
- Apparently.
- Don't.

242
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,424
Don't you use that tone with me.
We've both made mistakes today.

243
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:28,616
You're right, Mr. President,
my apologies, but the fact is,

244
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,945
I think we have a bigger
problem than Henderson.

245
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,750
What? What are
you talking about?

246
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,867
At least he can be trusted to act
rationally, in his own interest.

247
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,852
Unfortunately, the same
is not true of your wife.

248
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,034
My wife.

249
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:47,282
Apparently, there's a secret
service agent named Aaron Pierce

250
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,855
who knows a little
more than he should.

251
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,553
He intends to share
that with Martha.

252
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,924
I'm well aware of that, and I've
taken steps to deal with Agent Pierce.

253
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,859
But the real problem
is Mrs. Logan.

254
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:59,505
She continues to talk, to ask questions,
talk about her suspicions.

255
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:02,067
People don't take her seriously.
They think she's unstable.

256
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,825
There are too many
loose ends lying around.

257
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:06,685
We cannot afford to have her pull
on one and unravel everything.

258
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:08,286
You think I don't realize that?

259
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,955
I think you're in a
very difficult position

260
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:15,045
and that you have been hoping the
situation with Martha would
resolve itself,

261
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,507
but it hasn't.
You must silence her.

262
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:22,191
- I know.
- But I'll handle this myself.

263
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:29,635
Mrs.  Logan,
Agent Pierce was transferred.

264
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,631
That's what you keep saying,
but it doesn't make any sense,

265
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,011
not at 1:00 in the morning.

266
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,031
We work around
the clock, ma'am.

267
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:39,513
It's quite common for agents to get
pulled off details at odd hours.

268
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:44,668
Right when they're supposed to have a
meeting with the First Lady of the US?

269
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:46,694
I don't know anything
about a meeting.

270
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:51,359
Well, I do! I found Aaron's
phone laying on the ground,

271
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,131
right where we were
supposed to meet.

272
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,021
Now, I want you to
find Agent Pierce,

273
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,030
and I want you to get him back here,
right now!

274
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,693
There's a glitch in the
scheduling software,

275
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,115
I can not pull that
record up right now.

276
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,433
And are these glitches quite common,
as well?

277
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:04,741
- Actually, no, but...
- Mrs. Logan.

278
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,497
I'm Agent Adams.
I think I can explain everything.

279
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:09,349
Well?

280
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:11,091
This is a sensitive
issue, ma'am.

281
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,471
President Logan would
like you to come with me.

282
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:25,981
Ma'am.

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,610
What is this
"sensitive" information?

284
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,890
Is it about Agent Pierce?

285
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,058
I'm sorry-- you need to talk
to the president about that.

286
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,896
I'm asking you.

287
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:34,670
Do you know where
Aaron Pierce is?

288
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,908
No, ma'am, I don't.

289
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:40,362
Is this where my husband is?
I want to talk to him.

290
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,474
Charles?

291
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,187
Hello?

292
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,134
Yeah.

293
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,564
Henderson wasn't lying.
He doesn't have the recording on him.

294
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:16,697
Could it be in his car?

295
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:17,929
No, he wouldn't have
left it behind.

296
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,213
There must have been some kind
of a hand-off. What do you mean?

297
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,091
Well, that would explain why he
wasn't any farther ahead of me

298
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,921
when I left Van Nuys Airfield. He must
have stopped and given it to someone.

299
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:28,239
Okay, I'll back trace the
route with the satellite,

300
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,094
see if I can spot anything.

301
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:30,855
Yeah.

302
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:34,587
Jack, we're getting that
recording and exposing Logan.

303
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:39,194
I don't care how far I have to go or
what I have to do, do you
understand, Jack?

304
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,087
Yes.

305
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:44,866
Go ahead.

306
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,110
Jack, you were right,
I found the hand-off.

307
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,108
Henderson stopped and
rendezvoused with another car.

308
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,571
I'm sorry I didn't
see it before.

309
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:51,754
Can you track the other car?

310
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:54,279
We're tracking it now, Jack.
It headed back to Van Nuys.

311
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,559
Looks like the civilian
side of the airfield.

312
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,236
Pulled onto the tarmac.

313
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,662
Whoever was in it got out and
got directly onto the plane.

314
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:03,096
Isn't air traffic
still grounded?

315
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,565
Yeah, this is not a
commercial flight.

316
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:05,712
I'll find out what
I can about it.

317
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,745
Jack, the plane is servicing.
It's about to take off.

318
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,344
Has Curtis been relieved of his duty,
or is he still attached to CTU?

319
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:12,508
He's at CTU,
taking orders from Homeland Security,

320
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,129
but I think we can
trust him, Jack.

321
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,780
- Where is he?
- According to the deployment grid,

322
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:19,774
he's 25 miles northwest of you,
with a tac team.

323
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:20,971
Bill, I want you to call him.

324
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,853
Get him to this location
as soon as possible.

325
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:25,683
I want him to transfer Henderson
and Audrey back to CTU.

326
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:28,332
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Logan's in control at CTU.

327
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,709
Curtis will be able
to protect them.

328
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,512
Right now,
it's our best chance to secure Henderson

329
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,319
and get Audrey the medical
attention she needs.

330
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,502
- Calling Curtis now, Jack.
- Thanks.

331
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:37,443
What's happening?

332
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,217
The person Henderson
gave the recording to

333
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,347
just boarded a plane
at Van Nuys Airfield.

334
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,863
Why aren't you going now?

335
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,375
I'll go as soon as Curtis gets here--
he's not far.

336
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:48,073
- Jack, I'll be fine until then.
- I'm not leaving you here alone.

337
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:51,903
Jack,  if you don't get that recording,
my father will have died for nothing.

338
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,856
Jack... for me.

339
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,596
Henderson is secure.

340
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,947
When he regains consciousness, I don't
want you going anywhere near him.

341
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:14,662
You don't even talk to him.
You understand me?

342
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:15,683
I understand.

343
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,448
We have to assume his people
are still looking for him.

344
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:23,004
They're gonna be monitoring
all non-VPN cell traffic,

345
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,734
which means, you can't make or receive
any calls unless they come from me.

346
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,305
Here's Wexler's cell.
I've got the number.

347
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:31,960
All right.

348
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,955
Audrey, I don't feel
right about this.

349
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,335
I'm going to be all right.

350
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:49,958
I'm so sorry.

351
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,170
Jack, you have to go now.

352
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:02,558
Jack?

353
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:07,054
Make sure you get
that recording.

354
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,643
I will.

355
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,196
Let me know as soon
as you're done.

356
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,433
Vladimir Bierko has
regained consciousness.

357
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,746
But we're still waiting
for the medical assessment

358
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,113
to be finished before we
can begin the interrogation.

359
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,092
Let me know when they
give us the go ahead.

360
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,339
Final protocol shifts.

361
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,897
You can tell Washington

362
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:37,709
the transfer of authority from CTU
to Homeland is officially complete.

363
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:39,524
Okay.

364
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:47,093
Two hours ahead of schedule, Karen.
That is remarkable.

365
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:49,380
I'm sorry,
my head is somewhere else.

366
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:50,463
Where?

367
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:53,107
We gave the President Bauer's
location over an hour ago.

368
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,758
We should have heard
something by now.

369
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,999
The military authority
is handling Bauer.

370
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,650
Yes, I know,
but this doesn't make any sense.

371
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:03,098
The President insisted we redirect
our focus from Henderson to Bauer.

372
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,342
We find Bauer, and then he hands
the mission over to the military.

373
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,471
Karen, we're out of that loop.

374
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,293
- Karen Hayes.
- Ma'am, we have a problem.

375
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,075
Chloe O'Brian got
out of holding,

376
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:17,314
and as far as I can tell,
she's not in the building.

377
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,125
Not in the building?
How's that possible?

378
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,803
I'm still gathering the details.
But I reviewed the surveillance tape,

379
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,349
and it looks like Shari had a
conversation with her, and Shari let
her go.

380
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:27,218
Shari didn't try
to stop her? Why?

381
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:30,254
I don't know. She won't tell me.
I had security take her into custody.

382
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,219
Good. Bring her up
here right now.

383
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:38,836
We need to focus on
how we find Chloe now.

384
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:41,744
My guess is she'll
try to contact Bauer.

385
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,133
I agree, but how?

386
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:45,978
She was using CTU resources
before to help Bauer.

387
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:47,319
Maybe she'll try that again.

388
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,710
Which means she could try to
access our system remotely.

389
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,095
- All she needs is a laptop.
- That's right.

390
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,797
- She'll disguise her traffic.
- Can you get through that?

391
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,417
I can trace her physical location
by looking at the binaries.

392
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:58,412
Do it.

393
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:06,681
Wait outside.

394
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,088
Why did you let Chloe escape?

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,460
- She intimidated me.
- She intimidated you? Sit down.

396
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,018
You are in a great deal trouble,
Miss Rothenberg.

397
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,616
You had better start
talking to me now.

398
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:27,528
She said she'd recommend me
for psychiatric evaluation.

399
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,462
I'd lose my job.
I'm sorry, Miss Hayes.

400
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:34,359
There's something wrong with me,
I know that. Shari...

401
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:35,853
And I should probably
see someone...

402
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:36,539
Shari!

403
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:39,539
Did Chloe tell you why she was
helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

404
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:42,624
- She thinks Jack is innocent.
- Based on what?

405
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,980
Based on some absurd idea that
President Logan framed Bauer.

406
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,502
She even said something about
President Logan being involved

407
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:57,380
in the assassination of David Palmer.
I mean, can you believe her?

408
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,306
And people think I'm crazy.

409
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,230
Damn it, open this door!

410
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,489
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but you'd better think again!

411
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,268
Unlock it.

412
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:09,205
Open it!

413
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,753
Charles.

414
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:16,278
I want that man arrested!

415
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,114
And I want know where
Aaron Pierce is.

416
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:19,706
Shh.

417
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,738
Martha, calm down.

418
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:25,023
All right? Aaron's fine.

419
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:28,677
I just transferred him back
to Washington, that's all.

420
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,337
In the middle of the night?

421
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,449
Doesn't make any sense.
And why am I locked in this room?

422
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,657
'Cause we need to talk.

423
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:36,612
About what?

424
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,987
Martha, I've been
wanting to tell you this,

425
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:52,867
but I told myself that you
were too fragile to handle it.

426
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:55,114
But that's not the truth.

427
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,896
The truth is, I've kept this
from you because it's horrible

428
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:03,019
and because it's ugly.

429
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,368
What are you talking about?

430
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:11,219
What happened to David Palmer
wasn't supposed to happen.

431
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,656
He put himself in harm's way,

432
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:15,180
and he got involved with
something that he shouldn't have.

433
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,594
What are you saying?

434
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,230
That I never
authorized his death.

435
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:26,935
You... mean...

436
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:30,114
you know who killed David?

437
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:30,887
Yes.

438
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,814
How do you know that?

439
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:38,110
- He works for me.
- What?

440
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,047
- Martha, it's very complicated.
- What?!

441
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:43,390
- There's an explanation.
- What?! An explanation?! Oh, my God!

442
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:44,607
- Stop!
- Go to hell!

443
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:46,432
Stop! You don't understand!

444
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:50,038
Oh, my God!
You're involved in David's murder.

445
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,986
Martha...

446
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:54,582
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Why are you telling me this?

447
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:56,980
Why are you telling me this?

448
00:24:57,135 --> 00:25:00,335
Because you're on your way to
finding out the truth on your own.

449
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:03,361
And because you need to stop.

450
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,053
Stop what?

451
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:08,490
You have to stop
asking questions,

452
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,341
you have to stop talking about
this to everyone. Never again.

453
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,690
Martha, do you realize how traumatic
this would be for the country

454
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,869
if people were to find out?

455
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,875
Oh, yes,
we're worried about the country.

456
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:22,536
Damn it, Martha!
That's the most important part of this!

457
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,884
This scandal would destroy the American
people's faith in their government.

458
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:30,808
It would destroy our
credibility all over the world.

459
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,028
You lied to me.

460
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:34,631
Everything.

461
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:38,859
This whole day has
been one giant lie.

462
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:40,903
What you've done makes me sick!

463
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,423
Martha, enough!

464
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:48,034
I know that what I did,
what I allowed to happen, was a mistake.

465
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,128
It was a terrible mistake.

466
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,089
But it's done.

467
00:25:54,184 --> 00:26:01,234
Right now, I need you to swear to
me that you will do as I ask...

468
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,026
for the country, Martha.

469
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,819
I've forgiven you many things,
Charles, but not this.

470
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:23,445
You've broken my heart.

471
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:27,271
I'm looking at you...

472
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:31,099
I hate you.

473
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:45,360
But I will keep my mouth shut.

474
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,088
Because the people of this
country don't deserve to suffer.

475
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:55,912
You do, Charles. You do.

476
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:22,888
Are you sure we're going to get
through this the way we planned?

477
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:24,169
What does that mean?

478
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,244
There's too many loose ends.

479
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,401
What operation doesn't
have loose ends?

480
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,338
Of course we're not going to get
through this the way we planned.

481
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:34,281
No one ever does.

482
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,206
I have never made
a deal in my life

483
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:39,156
that didn't feel like it was going
to fall apart in the 11th hour.

484
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:42,264
Now, if you don't have the
stomach to deal with a few bumps,

485
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:44,864
then this is not the
room where you belong.

486
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:48,190
And that goes for all of you.

487
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,853
You're starting to have doubts.

488
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,348
I can smell it,
and I don't like it.

489
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,940
You need to remember the strength we had
18 months ago when we started
this thing.

490
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,227
We okay, Ron?

491
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,520
Yeah.

492
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:06,959
Think about your kids.

493
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:10,354
That's what I do when
I need to get focused.

494
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:11,467
Yeah?

495
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:14,410
The situation with
Martha is taken care of.

496
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:17,005
- I spoke to her.
- And?

497
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:21,291
And I made it very clear that if
she continues with this behavior,

498
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:24,026
I will send her back to
the hospital in Vermont.

499
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,686
Well, you were going to have
her committed earlier today.

500
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:28,517
But you changed your mind?

501
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,817
It's because she
found out the truth.

502
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:33,934
And I decided I should
keep her close.

503
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:36,926
What if she finds
out the truth again?

504
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,235
She won't.

505
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:43,508
And if she does, I will handle it,
just like I have all day.

506
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,560
Okay. Fair enough.

507
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:49,990
You have done a remarkable job today,
Mr. President. I will admit that.

508
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:51,355
Thank you.

509
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:54,753
It's about time I heard
some words of appreciation.

510
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,546
Oh, listen to me,
we were just talking about

511
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,839
how you've had to be on the
front line through this,

512
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,965
how you've had to
get your hands dirty,

513
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,372
while we could just sit back
and watch from a safe distance.

514
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,195
You've earned our trust.
And I am sure...

515
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,105
that you will do whatever it
takes to keep your wife in line.

516
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:32,002
Audrey.

517
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,984
Where's Jack?

518
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,689
Audrey.

519
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:41,217
I'm sorry about your father.

520
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,245
I never intended your father
to get in the middle of this.

521
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:49,524
I've known Secretary Heller a very
long time. He's an honorable man.

522
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:53,279
What time is it?

523
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,533
It's ten to 12 minutes since...

524
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:00,230
If those windows didn't collapse
when that car hit the water,

525
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,335
it could have created an
air pocket or something.

526
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:06,209
20, 30 minutes in a submerged car, even
at 100 feet, if there was an air pocket.

527
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:06,848
Stop it.

528
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:08,841
Your father could be alive.

529
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:13,687
Secretary... Secretary Heller
could be alive inside that car.

530
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,848
If he's alive,
you got to do something about it.

531
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,794
I mean, if there's a
possibility that he's living,

532
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:21,524
you got to call military authority or
the emergency services or something.

533
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,160
I mean, for God's sake,
he's your father.

534
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,342
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop talking!

535
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,233
What, do you think I'm stupid?

536
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:45,619
You want me to make that phone call
so that your people can find me.

537
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:47,872
Audrey, my people are
going to find us anyway.

538
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:49,934
And Jack's not going
to stop all this.

539
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:51,814
I'm trying to help your father.

540
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:55,375
Your father's drowning in a car,
and you're not doing anything about it.

541
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:57,372
You're gonna live with that
the rest of your life.

542
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:58,141
Shut up.

543
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,263
He is dying, and you are doing nothing,
Audrey. You are doing nothing.

544
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:07,134
I swear to God,
not another word.

545
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:28,772
- Yeah?
- Jack.

546
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,495
I've got a visual on the plane.

547
00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:32,365
It must be some kind
of diplomatic flight.

548
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,273
There's a lot of
security on the ground.

549
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,946
- We have a problem.
- What?

550
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,839
I've been tracking the helicopter that
Henderson's men used to shadow
Secretary Heller.

551
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:40,317
And?

552
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:44,082
It changed course, it's heading towards
where Audrey's holding Henderson.

553
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,351
How could they find them?

554
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,423
I don't know-- maybe they're
using satellite imagery, too.

555
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,395
The point is,
they're going to be there any second.

556
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,354
Where's Curtis?

557
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:51,666
Based on the speed
of the chopper,

558
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:54,187
he might not make it there
before Henderson's men, Jack.

559
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:56,072
Upload your visual to my PDA.

560
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,791
Advise Curtis of the situation,
I'll get back to you.

561
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,556
- Jack?
- Audrey, listen to me.

562
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:11,750
Henderson's men have zeroed
in on your location,

563
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,160
they're heading
back towards you.

564
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,697
You've got to get
out of there now.

565
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,835
- And just leave him?
- We don't have a choice.

566
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,549
Yes, we do, Jack.
I have the gun and I can kill him.

567
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:22,410
Audrey, we need him alive.
Curtis's team is almost there,

568
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,553
they'll track him down
and they will secure him.

569
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,693
You've got to get out of there.

570
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:27,927
Jack, he's responsible for the
death of my father's death.

571
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:29,714
I can't just leave him here!

572
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:31,474
Audrey, please,
listen to what I'm telling you.

573
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:33,217
You've got to start moving now.

574
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:34,564
Audrey!

575
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,909
Stipes, get over and get
these handcuffs off me.

576
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:08,069
Heller's daughter's somewhere
in this building-- kill her.

577
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:10,908
Then get back here,
we'll deal with Bauer.

578
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:28,158
Audrey, it's Curtis.
Stay behind me.

579
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,479
Secure him for
transport back to CTU.

580
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:56,386
Yes, sir.

581
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,688
- You okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:02,906
Hostiles are down and we
have Henderson in custody.

583
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,038
- Yeah?
- It's me.

584
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:22,041
What's happening?

585
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:26,178
Curtis's team killed Henderson's men and
they're taking Henderson into custody.

586
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:30,941
Jack, I tried to shoot him,
but I couldn't.

587
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,240
The only thing that matters
is that you're safe.

588
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,777
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

589
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,580
Yeah. Okay, good.
Let me speak to Curtis.

590
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:41,887
Curtis? It's Jack.

591
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:43,884
Go ahead.

592
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:47,307
Yeah, Jack?

593
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:51,057
Curtis, I want you to transport Audrey
back to CTU as quickly as possible.

594
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,436
And get her over to Medical.

595
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,741
And I want you to
tell Karen Hayes

596
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:55,932
that no one is have access
to Christopher Henderson.

597
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,116
She'll be taken care of.

598
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:58,499
But as far as Henderson goes,

599
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,879
CTU is more interested in apprehending
you than taking your advice.

600
00:35:01,904 --> 00:35:04,295
Just do what you can.
I'll get back to you.

601
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:10,063
Jack, is Audrey all right?

602
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,970
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.
Curtis is in control of the situation.

603
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,665
Chloe, what have you
got on the plane?

604
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,909
The details just came in.

605
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,241
You were right,
it is a chartered diplomatic flight,

606
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:21,187
security-level eight, scheduled
to leave at 2:00 A.M. or sooner.

607
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:24,106
Okay, we need to find out who's
onboard so we can try and figure out

608
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:26,109
who Henderson passed
off the recording to.

609
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,946
I'll try-- it's not going to be easy
getting past the State
Department's firewall.

610
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:29,791
I understand.

611
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:32,034
Bill, see if you could slow down
the departure of this flight

612
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:33,716
so I can figure out
a way to get on it.

613
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:34,579
All right, Jack.

614
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,247
There's a maintenance gate on the
northwest side of the airfield.

615
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:41,292
You should be able to get
close to the plane there.

616
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,497
I know, I'm there.

617
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:44,781
Just get back to me as soon as
you've got the passenger list.

618
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:45,619
Copy that.

619
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,927
- All clear.
- Go ahead.

620
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:14,917
Yeah?

621
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,580
Jack, we've tried everything we can,
there's no way to delay the plane.

622
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:20,544
It's taking off in
less than ten minutes.

623
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,724
Okay. Has Chloe got
the passenger list yet?

624
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,587
I still can't get
past the firewall.

625
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,282
- Chloe, I need that list.
- Jack, I'm trying.

626
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,644
There you are.

627
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:49,854
- Yeah?
- I got O'Brian.

628
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:51,330
Did you find her on our system?

629
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,577
Yes, she's using
one of our nodes

630
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,608
to try to log-in to the
State Department network.

631
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,573
Do we know why?

632
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,161
No, but she was using a work
around I'd never seen before.

633
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:00,351
So I machine-coded a
matrix to get through...

634
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,851
Miles, we just need to find her.
Where she is?

635
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:05,570
I'm running a physical trace.

636
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,869
It's a private house.

637
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:14,626
Cross-referencing with
property records.

638
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:21,277
Karen... she's working out
of Bill Buchanan's house.

639
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:22,974
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

640
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:27,084
We have a Tac Team not far away.
I'll dispatch them now.

641
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,369
What's their ETA?

642
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,242
I'm showing less
then seven minutes.

643
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:32,712
Good, keep me posted.

644
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:46,158
Novick.

645
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:47,938
Mike, it's Karen Hayes.

646
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:52,599
Karen. How are things
going over there?

647
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:56,308
It's a rough transition from CTU to
Homeland, but we're getting through it.

648
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,171
That's good to hear.
What do you need?

649
00:38:58,201 --> 00:38:59,689
I need some clarification.

650
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:02,046
We were sent over here on a
directive from the White House,

651
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:05,000
but we've been dealing exclusively
with Vice President Gardner

652
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,868
until about two hours ago.

653
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,380
What happened two hours ago?

654
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:11,567
The president called me himself
and ordered me to arrest Jack Bauer

655
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:14,197
on evidence he was
unwilling to share with me.

656
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,173
Yes. I know about that.

657
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:19,311
Have you seen the evidence?

658
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:20,983
No, actually, I haven't.

659
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:23,862
Mike... Who has seen it?

660
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:27,335
I don't have a good
answer for that.

661
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:30,144
Are you telling me
you're not in the loop?

662
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,592
Actually...

663
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:34,173
I don't even think
there is a loop.

664
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:37,584
The president is keeping his
own counsel at the moment.

665
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:43,396
- That's a first.
- Yes. It is.

666
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,818
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

667
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,589
Uh, nothing that I can
say with any authority.

668
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:52,242
All I know is that...

669
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:54,852
it's been a strange night.

670
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:56,315
I see.

671
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,977
I wish I could be more helpful.

672
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:01,652
No, Mike, actually,
you've been very helpful. Thank you.

673
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,738
- Hello?
- This is Karen Hayes.

674
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,744
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out of there.

675
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,982
Karen, I don't know what you're
talking about, Chloe's not here.

676
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:39,114
Bill, stop. Miles traced Chloe
through a remote node she's accessing.

677
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:40,598
And if you don't believe me,

678
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:43,621
tell her he used a machine-coded
matrix to find her.

679
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:52,252
Karen, why are you warning us?

680
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:54,636
Because I may have made
a mistake earlier.

681
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:57,654
A lot of things have
not made sense today,

682
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,794
until Shari told me
what Chloe said.

683
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,825
About President Logan
being... involved.

684
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:09,819
I've got to go.
Just get out of there, now.

685
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:11,342
Chloe, we have to go.

686
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,299
I can't leave yet.
Jack needs the passenger list.

687
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,779
Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested.

688
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:17,812
- You have to go now!
- Not yet.

689
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,376
It's the last one! Let's get this
thing out of here. Let's go!
