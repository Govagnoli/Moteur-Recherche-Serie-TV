<i>Put the gun down Team</i>

2
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,453
Put down your weapon. Now!

3
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,613
- What the hell's going on?
- Where's Ryan Burnett?

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,173
Where is the senator Mayer's
chief of staff?

5
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:28,069
Tony double-backed to his contact who
gave him information of a second attack.

6
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,363
It's gonna take place here
within the hour.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,824
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
Burnett's been supporting them.

8
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,119
He knows where the attack's gonna take
place, so you can tell me where he is,

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,579
or I will find him myself.

10
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:41,771
Mr. Burnett, you are a traitor
and a terrorist.

11
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,668
I am not. I love my country.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,297
- <i>Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.
</i>- Where's the target?!

13
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:53,348
What you're doing
is against the law, Mr. Bauer.

14
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,976
I am ordering you to stand down.

15
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,306
Take Mr. Bauer away.
He's under arrest.

16
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,354
You should have come to me.
You should have presented your case.

17
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,690
And would it really
have made a difference?

18
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,485
Colonel Dubaku is dead.

19
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:14,824
Laurent must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.

20
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:16,784
There is no sign of my father.

21
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,662
Let me take his place
on the assault team.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,666
Spoken like a true Dubaku.
Laurent, it is time for us to go.

23
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:27,586
This is it, Larry, no question.
They're moving out.

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,354
- Any idea what the next target is?
- <i>No.</i>

25
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,388
From here, it is approximately
100 meters to the entrance.

26
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:44,609
Let's move.

27
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,084
I need to see her right now.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,821
Ms. Taylor, the president
will see you as soon as she's able.

29
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,715
Tell her her daughter
is done waiting.

30
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,914
I'm going to the hospital
to be with my father.

31
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,137
I think it would be a good idea to talk
to your mother before you do that.

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,220
The president's orders
are that you remain in the White House.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,020
So if I try to leave, you will actually
physically restrain me?

34
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,774
That would never happen, Ms. Taylor,

35
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,903
because I know you have too much
respect for your mother and her office

36
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,171
to ever let things get that far.

37
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,246
Well done, Agent.

38
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,887
- You've been at this a while.
- Five administrations, ma'am.

39
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,234
Olivia,

40
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,555
your mother asked me to fill you in
on what's happening.

41
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:46,302
Well, with all due respect, you're
the last person she should be sending.

42
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:49,520
There's about to be
another terrorist attack on this city.

43
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,381
That's why she wants you
to remain here.

44
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,859
Are we talking about more planes
going down?

45
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,696
We don't know. But whatever's going
to happen will happen soon.

46
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:02,032
I'm heading to the Pentagon.
On top of all of this,

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,700
there's also the invasion
to deal with.

48
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,800
So, bear in mind,

49
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,999
your mother's under
tremendous pressure right now.

50
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:17,569
The media will soon picks up
on the heightened security measures.

51
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:19,832
I want to issue a statement
before that happens.

52
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,886
Play down the actual likelihood
of an attack,

53
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,959
talk about the security measures
as being due diligence, rather than...

54
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:28,684
Meredith. The public deserves the truth.
We stress caution and calm,

55
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,854
but we acknowledge we have intel
about another terrorist action.

56
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,149
Yes, ma'am. Angela and I will have
something for you as soon as possible.

57
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:42,802
 Larry Moss is calling in.
He says he's got a lead on the attack.

58
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,227
Put him through.

59
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,327
You're on with the president.

60
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,705
Madam President, we've discovered
what we believe was a staging area

61
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,222
being used by terrorists
on the south shore of the Potomac,

62
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:54,084
near the ITP rail and shipyards.

63
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,255
Madam President, we've identified
one of the men as General Juma.

64
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,508
What?! Juma's in DC?

65
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,220
Yes. We know that there are at least a
dozen other men involved in the attack,

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,298
and they are armed for a small war.

67
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:10,059
Have you found evidence
that tells us where the target might be?

68
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:13,771
No, but we have search teams out looking
for the men, and we're hoping that

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,139
Agent Walker has more information.

70
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,484
She's the one who I.D.'d Juma, but,

71
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,695
- <i>we've lost contact with her.</i>
- Lost contact?

72
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,113
<i>Yes, Madam President,</i>

73
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,951
but we have reason to hope that she's
alive and in pursuit of the terrorists.

74
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,704
If she's out there, ma'am,
we'll find her.

75
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,056
Hold it right there!

76
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,601
I'm Agent Renee Walker, FBI.

77
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,604
- We just got an alert on you.
- You need to call Larry Moss

78
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,607
at FBI right now. There's gonna be
a terrorist attack on the White House.

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,859
Yes. I'll call it in right away.
This is Thompson...

80
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,333
<i>Ranger Thompson, please respond
and report your location.</i>

81
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,220
Bill.

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,265
The attorney general
wants you transferred

83
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,933
so he can file criminal charges.

84
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,060
Have we learned anything else
about the attack?

85
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,522
I reached Tony. He couldn't get
any more information from his guy.

86
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,691
According to the FBI, Renee Walker

87
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,016
followed a lead on her own to
an abandoned warehouse on the Potomac.

88
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,448
Got a visual on a heavily-armed commando
led by Juma himself.

89
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,451
- But she went missing.
- What do you mean, missing?

90
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,909
We're not sure. The FBI's searching
the area, but there's no sign of her,

91
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:56,083
or any evidence
telling us what the target might be.

92
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,061
- Burnett knows.
- The president offered him immunity.

93
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,722
- He turned it down, hasn't said a word.
- He was talking when they stopped me.

94
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:06,050
Put me in a room with him for 5 mins,
and we can stop this thing.

95
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,781
Even if I was willing to release you,
he's being transported to the hospital.

96
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,265
- You couldn't get access to him.
- Then you do it. You can get access.

97
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:15,635
I'm not trained
in coercive techniques.

98
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,294
This is not a maybe. Ryan Burnett
is an accessory to a terrorist attack.

99
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,148
If you don't do this,
people will die.

100
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,526
I'm not arguing about what needs to be
done. But I can't do it.It's not me.

101
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,237
That's not good enough.
Damn it, Bill. That's not good enough.

102
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,658
You told me, "people who stand by
might as well help them plant the bomb".

103
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:35,871
You can do this.

104
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,839
Bill, you have to do this.

105
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,167
I can't, Jack. I'm sorry.

106
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,708
I can't.

107
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,575
This is it, General.

108
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,927
We're on the other side
of the conduit.

109
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,595
<i>Are you in position?</i>

110
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,263
Yes, General. I'll be ready for you.

111
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,041
What was that?

112
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,356
I thought I heard you say something.

113
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,606
Just talking to myself.

114
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,778
I tell you we're having people over
on Saturday?

115
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,156
Nothing fancy.
We're bringing in Chinese.

116
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,704
You think you're gonna
make it this time?

117
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,405
Chinese.

118
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,622
But I was looking forward
to Sheila's cooking.

119
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,564
All clear, General.

120
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:27,691
Excellent.

121
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,316
We'll have access in ten seconds.

122
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:49,602
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes
until the proximity alarms come back up.

123
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,173
Five,

124
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,173
four, three,

125
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,427
two, one...

126
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,263
Move!

127
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:41,131
I've accessed
the Secret Service tracking grid.

128
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,062
- Where is she?
- Right here in the Oval Office.

129
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,438
Let's go.

130
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:19,398
Clear.

131
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:33,714
We will meet resistance,
which we must counter quickly.

132
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,839
Silently.

133
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:39,906
We have nine minutes
until the next Secret Service roll call.

134
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,742
We must find the president by then.

135
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,943
The president is preparing to issue
a statement that will clarify that.

136
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:13,558
Yeah, I'll let you know,
as soon as it's ready for release.

137
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
Let go of the phone.

138
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,365
Five minutes until roll call,
General.

139
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,274
Juma had your father killed.

140
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:57,859
What?

141
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,382
Listen to me,
I know that Dubaku is your father.

142
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:02,739
Juma's been lying to you.
Your father is dead.

143
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,241
My father is alive!

144
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,739
Juma had to make sure
that your father didn't talk.

145
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:09,462
So he sent a man named Udo
to murder him.

146
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,499
I don't believe you.

147
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,127
I was there when Udo did it.
That's how I found you.

148
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,546
By following him back
to the rail car.

149
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:19,798
General Juma betrayed you.

150
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,551
You are lying. You are lying!

151
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,279
I know the target.

152
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,257
Reissued warrants
and order for transport, sir.

153
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:08,472
Sorry, Jack.

154
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,015
This way, Mr. Bauer.

155
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,966
- Bill Buchanan.
- It's Larry Moss.

156
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,225
Renee Walker says the target
is the White House.

157
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:24,446
- How good is her intel?
- Firsthand. They're getting in via

158
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,823
- <i>subterranean access.</i>
- I'll initiate a lockdown.

159
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,325
You alert CIRG.

160
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,869
This is Bill Buchanan.

161
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,794
I have confirmation the White House
is a target of a terrorist attack.

162
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,334
Condition red. Repeat: Condition red.
Secure the president. Get to your posts.

163
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,696
Jack, I could use your help.

164
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,120
I need to know
you'll do exactly as I say.

165
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,617
You have my word.

166
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:49,850
- Where's the president now?
- Oval Office.

167
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,270
- What's the meaning of this?
- The White House is under attack.

168
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,583
We need to go.

169
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,925
- Ma'am, we need to go right now.
- Ms. Taylor.

170
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,571
I've got the president's daughter.
We're on our way to the lockdown.

171
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,753
Men are down.
There's no safe path out.

172
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,867
We need to secure her
in the first floor lockdown.

173
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:12,911
We're clear.

174
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,247
- What the hell is he doing here?
- He's with me.

175
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,791
Madam President, you need
all the help you can get.

176
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,758
- Where's my daughter?
- Aaron Pierce is taking her to lockdown

177
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:24,756
- as we speak, but we need to move.
- Agents in zones five, seven and nine,

178
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,842
<i>please respond.
Five, seven and nine, respond.</i>

179
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:32,347
I can't reach anyone in the quadrant.
Juma's men are headed straight for us.

180
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,559
They know where she is.
They're tracking her, Bill.

181
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,258
Madam President,
let me see your tracker.

182
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:42,148
- The most direct route to the lockdown?
- From the east.

183
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,517
I'll head west with the tracker and
draw them away. You go with Jack.

184
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,991
- Agent Bauer.
- This is your house. I'll follow.

185
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,248
<i>We're moving the president to lockdown.
Agent Hovis, we've got agents down</i>

186
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,138
<i>in multiple quadrants.
We need reinforcements, sir.</i>

187
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:04,087
Copy that. We're on our way
to the lockdown now.

188
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:05,717
Let's go.

189
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,471
General.

190
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,654
The president has left the Oval Office.
She's heading down the west corridor.

191
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,909
Udo, take your team that way.
We'll trap her in between us.

192
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,263
We're getting close to the president.
Up ahead, around this corner.

193
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,962
The president's tracker, sir.

194
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:13,573
They know we're here. They're moving
the president to the lockdown.

195
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:14,828
Find her.

196
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,961
Take him. We need hostages.

197
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,838
Start gathering 'em up.

198
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,056
Let's move.

199
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,192
We've engaged hostiles
on the way to the lockdown.

200
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,017
We don't have a visual on the president.
We're still 2 mins away.

201
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,583
Get up! Get up! Get up!

202
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,330
Move it! Come on!
Come on, move it! Come on!

203
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,735
It's Jack. I'm with the president,
approaching lockdown. Where are you?

204
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,335
<i>We're still upstairs, Jack.</i>

205
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,879
Move! Move!

206
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,508
Hostiles are in control of the area.

207
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,887
Looking for a way past them
to the lockdown.

208
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,263
Copy that. Juma's men
are closing on our position.

209
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,051
You're going to have about 30 s
to get here before I  seal this door.

210
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:22,183
<i>Understood.</i>

211
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,311
You will not close this door
until my daughter gets here.

212
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,106
Your life is the priority, whether you
like it or not. Step inside.

213
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:47,267
Madam President, are you all right?

214
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,379
We're sealed off in the lockdown.
We didn't have a choice.

215
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,175
We couldn't have made it anyway. We'll
try to find a way out of the building.

216
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:57,563
- Copy that, Aaron...
- Jack.

217
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:59,429
Jack, do you read me?

218
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,940
Aaron, it's Jack.
Do you copy?

219
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,604
Damn it. Juma's cut off
our communication.

220
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,689
I need to know that
my daughter's safe.

221
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,441
I can't answer that yet.

222
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:18,948
Abo.

223
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:46,893
General Juma,

224
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,854
<i>they brought in reinforcements.
I don't know how much longer</i>

225
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,892
<i>we can hold them off
from your position.</i>

226
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:53,548
Stand by.

227
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,152
Ngozi?

228
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,158
Agents are moving in from everywhere;
we will be heavily outnumbered.

229
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:07,747
Does Secret Service know the president
is secured in the lockdown?

230
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,883
- The only ones who saw are dead.
- Put me on to their com channel.

231
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,183
Go ahead, sir.

232
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:16,714
This is General Juma.

233
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,718
<i>I have the president.
Evacuate immediately, or she will die.</i>

234
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,033
I need proof you have the president
before I can give that order.

235
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:30,061
- Let us speak to her.
- Who is this?

236
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,022
- Special Agent Hovis.
- Agent Hovis,

237
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:36,224
move your men out of the building
and beyond the fence line,

238
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,394
or I will kill the president.

239
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,769
<i>And her death will be on your head.</i>

240
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,194
<i>Agent Hovis?</i>

241
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,744
We're pulling back.

242
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,112
All agents, fall back immediately!

243
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,417
I repeat: All agents fall back.

244
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,180
Secret Service is retreating.

245
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,129
They are retreating, General.

246
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:14,939
- All of them?
- Yes, sir.

247
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,360
Gather all the hostages
and bring them here.

248
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,198
Lock down the exits. Move.

249
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,800
Confirming Secret Service
retreat in western quadrant.

250
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:41,483
Copy, General.

251
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:47,513
The only reason they would retreat is
if they thought Juma had the president.

252
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,325
But that man, Bauer, said he got
my mother into the lockdown.

253
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,811
Juma's bluffing them.
We need to get out of here

254
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:57,023
and let our people know that ASAP
so they can retake the building.

255
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,858
How? They're everywhere.

256
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,026
Move it!

257
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,425
Keep your hands on your head.
Move it!

258
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:23,967
Get out here.

259
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,725
Right here. Keep going.
Come on. Move it!

260
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:30,890
Everbody down!
Everyone down!

261
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,141
Get down!

262
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,479
Turn around.

263
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,492
Can you open it?

264
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,192
Yes.

265
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:54,038
Assuming the specifications
Hodges gave us are correct.

266
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:56,617
- How long?
- 15 minutes.

267
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,882
We confronted them
in one of the first floor corridors.

268
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,489
At that point,
Juma ordered us to retreat,

269
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:36,357
threatening to kill the
president if we didn't comply.

270
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,165
He never gave a visual confirmation
he was holding the president?

271
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,236
No, he didn't, but I felt at that point,
I had no choice but to pull back.

272
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,118
His men were killing
civilians and agents.

273
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:47,299
- Any idea how many people are inside?
- Cross-checking the evacuees

274
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:50,774
with the White House manifest,
so far, it looks like 53.

275
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,014
- Any Secret Service?
- As far as I know,

276
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,665
we have no agents left
in there still alive.

277
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:58,285
Hostage rescue teams
are moving into place.

278
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,485
They're prepared to storm the building
as soon as the order is given.

279
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,068
Yeah, well, at this point, that order
has to be given by the vice president.

280
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,904
- What's his status?
- Secret Service has him en route

281
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,295
to a secure location.

282
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,971
All right, let me know
as soon as he's locked down.

283
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,660
And Hovis, I need an infrared
SAT-SCAN of the building.

284
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,378
- Highest resolution possible.
- Got it.

285
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,167
You didn't tell me
Jack was in the White House.

286
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,300
He was under arrest.
Being held under guard

287
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,410
- when the attack took place.
- Under arrest for what?

288
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:34,886
He found out an aide to Senator Mayer
named Burnett

289
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:36,663
was part of the conspiracy.

290
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,229
He was caught torturing him...
in the White House.

291
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,941
Almost killed the man
before he was stopped.

292
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,622
Renee, the president is our priority,
not Jack Bauer. Are we clear?

293
00:24:52,747 --> 00:24:53,996
- Clear.
- Are you sure?

294
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,087
They're bringing in more hostages.

295
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,165
Get down! Now!

296
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,591
Get in here! Sit!

297
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:12,510
No talking!

298
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,833
Silence!

299
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,213
I don't see Olivia.

300
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,771
Madam President, that's good news.

301
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,019
I know Aaron Pierce.
He'll do everything in his power

302
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,254
to make sure that your
daughter is safe.

303
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,385
This is the White House,
for God's sake.

304
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,485
How could they get around
our security protocols?

305
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,155
There's only one explanation.
They had help on the inside.

306
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:34,048
From whom?

307
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:41,527
This is insane.

308
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:46,162
Juma must realize that there's no way
for him to get out of this alive.

309
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,491
I'm afraid he does.
This is his endgame.

310
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,215
He came to make a statement
and he's willing to die for it.

311
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,885
When the rescue teams realize
you're secure, they'll move in.

312
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:56,213
It's only a matter of time.

313
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:58,185
What's he doing?

314
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,561
- Is that some kind of explosive?
- No.

315
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:03,283
My God.

316
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:05,813
They've got the access codes.

317
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:09,150
- I need to get into that panel.
- Is there something I can do?

318
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:12,278
Yeah, give me that toolbox over there.
Put it on the table.

319
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:31,979
Damn it.

320
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,306
Madam President, plug the cord
into the wall, please.

321
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:41,775
Now.

322
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,393
General.

323
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,160
- What's wrong?
- It just went dead.

324
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:10,086
Somehow, they must have disabled
the circuitry from inside.

325
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:12,672
Then, we'll use C4
to blow open the door.

326
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,318
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each
of the 11 locking rods.

327
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:19,470
It'll take too long.
Depending on how the steel is hardened,

328
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,097
C4 might not even work.

329
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:24,728
Then we'll find another way.

330
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,118
There can be no room for doubt.

331
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:44,915
We have the president trapped.

332
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,422
We open up that door,
we become a part of history.

333
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,708
We will find another way.

334
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,603
Just a moment.

335
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:24,225
- Call came in on the dedicated uplink.
- I heard it.

336
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:25,776
It's him, sir.

337
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:33,544
Put him on speaker.

338
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,383
General, didn't expect
to be hearing from you directly.

339
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,553
- What is it I can do for you?
- <i>We have a problem.</i>

340
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,410
The president is secured
in the lockdown.

341
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,591
We prepared you
for that possibility.

342
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,852
We gave you the specs
for the locking mechanism.

343
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:52,563
They shorted the lock out
from the inside.

344
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:55,458
I need you to find me
another way in.

345
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,047
General, I've given you
everything I have to give.

346
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,653
My part in this thing is over.

347
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,664
Are you forgetting that you don't have
the shipment yet?

348
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:14,043
Now, General,
I expect you to be an honorable man.

349
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,663
We made a deal.
We held up our end of the bargain.

350
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,799
We got you in the White House.
I expect you to hold up yours.

351
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,204
I don't care about
your expectations.

352
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,685
You help me,
or I will destroy that shipment

353
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,555
before it ever arrives to you.

354
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:29,622
Hang on.

355
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:34,096
Seaton, what do you think?

356
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,319
Can he do what he says?

357
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,901
The shipment's not due in the port
for another two hours.

358
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,363
His men will have plenty of time
to destroy it, render it useless.

359
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,456
General?

360
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,010
<i>Tell me who else is in
the lockdown with the president?</i>

361
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,585
My men saw her enter
with another man.

362
00:29:59,535 --> 00:30:02,085
I'm looking at the White House
manifest,

363
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:05,094
and according to this, Olivia Taylor

364
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:07,721
is presently in the building
with you.

365
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,141
The president's daughter?

366
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,101
Are you sure?

367
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,551
Their system logs everyone
in and out electronically.

368
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:18,487
If it says that she's in there,
she's in there. You find Olivia Taylor,

369
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:21,418
and you'll get the president
to open that door.

370
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:24,088
Your shipment will
arrive as planned.

371
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:25,894
Thank you.

372
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,843
There, you see? Stress.
Stress...

373
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,965
is the fertilizer of creativity.

374
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,412
Let's play some darts.

375
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,651
The president's daughter
is somewhere in the White House.

376
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,026
Let's find her.

377
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,186
Raise your heads.

378
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,015
Show me your faces.

379
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:14,464
What do you think's going on?

380
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,692
I asked you a question,
Mr. Buchanan.

381
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:24,215
You think I made the
wrong call with Bauer?

382
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,485
You think that if I'd signed off

383
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,637
on him torturing Ryan Burnett,
all of this could have been avoided?

384
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:35,059
You don't know what I'm thinking,
Senator.

385
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:43,335
She's not here.

386
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:48,322
Go ahead and find her
and bring her to me.

387
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:15,391
- What happened? What did you see?
- The door's guarded.

388
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,311
- There's got to be another way out.
- They cover the 3 exits of the wing.

389
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:21,918
The windows are sealed and hardened.
Unbreakable.

390
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:24,784
We have to let them know
that they don't have my mother.

391
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,409
Our only option
is to get a signal out.

392
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:30,406
- We can do it from the windows.
- Okay, okay, good.

393
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,575
You'll be safer if I leave you
in a secure area.

394
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:35,185
I'll get the signal out
and come back for you.

395
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,604
Iwon't sit and hide
in some damn vent, Agent Pierce.

396
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:39,688
Ma'am, it is a long way,

397
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:42,018
and we're gonna encounter
more of Juma's men.

398
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:44,285
- It's too dangerous.
- I don't care.

399
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,513
I'm going with you
and don't try to argue.

400
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:48,173
We don't have the time.

401
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:50,366
Okay.

402
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:52,124
Stay behind me.

403
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:09,371
Agent Moss, SAT-SCAN's
all set up here.

404
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:14,074
We can see the cluster of hostages,
but not the individual bodies.

405
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:16,313
They can't boost
the resolution on this?

406
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:20,442
No. The White House is one of the most
heavily shielded buildings in the world.

407
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,266
Yeah, got it.
The vice president's ready.

408
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:25,596
- They're initiating communication.
- Thanks.

409
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:30,883
Give us the room.

410
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,292
<i>You're on with the Vice President.</i>

411
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,389
Mr. Vice President,
I'm Special Agent Moss,

412
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,065
head of the FBI's DC branch.

413
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,783
This is Agent Walker.

414
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,367
I've been briefed
on the general situation.

415
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:53,579
- What are the latest facts?
- <i>There's nothing further from Juma,</i>

416
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:56,302
but an infrared scan shows
he's holding the hostages

417
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:58,327
in a hallway
outside the Roosevelt Room.

418
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,580
<i>Now this is very possibly good news </i>

419
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,581
- <i>for the president.</i>
- Explain.

420
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:05,782
The area's not one of the more
defensible places in the building.

421
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:08,379
Tactically, it makes no sense 
that Juma chose it as a base.

422
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,952
However, the area is adjacent
to the ground floor lockdown,

423
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:14,176
which we know the president
was en route to.

424
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,389
<i>So, you think the president
made it into the lockdown?</i>

425
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,598
That's our best explanation
for him being there.

426
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,302
<i>So, we ask you to authorize
the rescue operation</i>

427
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,603
<i>before Juma manages
to penetrate the lockdown.</i>

428
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,132
<i>Do you have any other evidence</i>

429
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:35,007
<i>that supports your theory
that the president is in the lockdown?</i>

430
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:38,682
There's the fact
that he couldn't produce the president

431
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:41,704
- when we asked him to prove he had her.
- <i>Couldn't or wouldn't?</i>

432
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,414
You can't be certain, can you?

433
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,423
<i>Certainty's not possible
in this case.</i>

434
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:48,711
We're giving you our best estimation
and we urge you to allow us to launch.

435
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:53,364
<i>What if you're wrong?
What if Juma does have the president?</i>

436
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,221
<i>He will kill her as soon as
he realizes what you're doing.</i>

437
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,554
Inaction has its own risks too, sir.

438
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,934
The more time Juma has
to reinforce his position,

439
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,559
the more difficult it'll be to take
the building andsave lives.

440
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:05,978
I understand.

441
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,282
But my priority must be
the president's life.

442
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,923
Prudence dictates that I hold off
on authorizing the rescue operation

443
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:14,027
until we can be more certain
of her status.

444
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:17,406
Mr. Vice President, terrorists
are in control of the White House.

445
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:21,702
I'd ask you to consider if prudence
is appropriate in this situation.

446
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,998
<i>I thank you for your thoughts,
Agent Walker.</i>

447
00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:28,333
<i>But until you can provide me</i>

448
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,045
<i>with more intel
on what's going on in there,</i>

449
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:35,090
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

450
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,811
Keep me apprised of any further
developments.

451
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,241
All he's interested in
is covering himself.

452
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,642
He's the Vice President.

453
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,010
Right now, he's calling the shots.

454
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,177
It was the right call, sir.

455
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:54,112
You can't order an operation
that results in the president's death

456
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,945
and your own elevation to the job.
It'd be politically untenable.

457
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,062
Never let anyone hear you
talking like that, Derek.

458
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,727
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

459
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:30,514
My God, Aaron!

460
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:32,713
They would've heard those shots.

461
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,473
You're going to need to get
the signal out before they get back.

462
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:38,487
There's a security kit
behind that door in the bureau.

463
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,406
It's got first aid and a flashlight.

464
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,659
You'll flash Morse Code
out the window.

465
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,327
Reach in my jacket.
I got a pen. Here.

466
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:49,248
Give it to me.

467
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,690
Give me your hand.

468
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,964
This is called "Code Green."
A dot is a short blink,

469
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,799
a dash is a long one.

470
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,670
"Code Green" will signal them
to move in.

471
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,137
Go!

472
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:33,882
General Juma,

473
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,174
- I have the president's daughter.
- Bring her to me.

474
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:42,395
Bring him.

475
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,131
<i>Sources have confirmed that
the siege inside the White House</i>

476
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,839
<i>began approximately 40 minutes ago.
We do not yet have confirmation</i>

477
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:15,167
<i>on the number of hostages being held,
or if the president is among them.</i>

478
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:19,831
<i>Behind me, you can see dozens
of tactical assault units standing by.</i>

479
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:23,292
<i>Government analysts tell us
the order to launch any operation</i>

480
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:26,386
<i>in these circumstances would
rest with the vice president.</i>

481
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,601
General,

482
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:32,100
I discovered fiber-optic cameras
embedded in the chandelier.

483
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,667
Silence!

484
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,221
- Sit!
- Get me a chair.

485
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:58,496
Yes, General.

486
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,558
He spotted the cameras.

487
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,563
Give me a secure channel.

488
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:21,191
Go ahead, sir.

489
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:23,652
<i>President Taylor,</i>

490
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:27,322
<i>I see now
that you've been watching us.</i>

491
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:28,608
<i>Good.</i>

492
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:31,622
<i>There is something else
I think you should see.</i>

493
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:40,836
God, no.

494
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,733
<i>If you don't open the door,</i>

495
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:50,412
I'm going to cut out
your daughter's eyes

496
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,900
one by one.

497
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:56,184
<i>And then I'm going to cut out</i>

498
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,350
her tongue...

499
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,399
- ... and then her head.
- Mom, don't listen!

500
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:04,526
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

501
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,071
<i>How do you know if you open the door
that I won't kill her?</i>

502
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,612
All you need to know
is that I most certainly will kill her

503
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:12,976
if you don't.

504
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,656
- Open the door.
- Madam President...

505
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:23,420
- Open the door! Open the door!
- I can't!

506
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,340
That is my daughter out there.

507
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,908
Do you understand?

508
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,968
I've already lost my son.

509
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,888
Have you any idea
what it's like to lose a child?

510
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,283
Madam President,
I am genuinely sorry,

511
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:38,560
but I cannot let them take you.
There's nothing you can do for her now.

512
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,147
Do you have children, Jack?

513
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:45,859
I have a daughter.

514
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:49,223
Could you do
what you're asking me to do?

515
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,364
Just stand by
and watch her butchered?

516
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,651
No, ma'am.

517
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:55,952
But I am not the President
of the United States.

518
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,607
Well, I am the president.

519
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:01,472
And I am ordering you
to open that door.

520
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:23,647
You're running out of time.

521
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:29,589
Mom...

522
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:32,709
Perhaps this will make
your mother decide more quickly.

523
00:41:57,646 --> 00:41:59,307
Mom, you shouldn't have...

524
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:02,528
I wouldn't let them hurt you,
darling.

525
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,560
Damn it, Bauer.
What have you done?

526
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,704
All right, General,
you've got me now.

527
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,909
There's no reason to hold
anyone else.

528
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,367
Let them go.

529
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,659
You...
don't give orders to me.

530
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,701
Get the camera ready
for her statement.

531
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:44,664
What statement?

532
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:48,661
The last one you'll ever give.
