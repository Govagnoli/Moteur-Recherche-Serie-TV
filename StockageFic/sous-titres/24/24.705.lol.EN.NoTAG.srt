Version 1.00

4
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,824
<i>This is Colonel Iké Dubaku.</i>

5
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:19,158
<i>We have the CIP device.</i>

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,539
<i>We demand</i>

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,495
<i>the complete withdrawal
of the U.S. Naval Strike Force</i>

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>by this time tomorrow.</i>

9
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,694
You are recalling
the invasion force.

10
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:31,258
Well, that determination
has yet to be made.

11
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:34,116
I implore you,
do not abandon my country.

12
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:36,231
It's Samantha Roth.

13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,956
She says she has new information
regarding my son's death.

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,792
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,502
He uncovered other blind accounts,

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,196
accounts that were traced to a member
of your wife's administration.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,929
It's all here.

18
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:52,969
Account numbers, trading records,
everything that he knew.

19
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,305
Bauer must have worked out this escape
with Almeida's people.

20
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,405
That son of a bitch played me. Had me
believing the Bureau was compromised,

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,625
someone inside working against us.
I realize now it was him all along.

22
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,273
- He played us both.
- I'm going to make this right, Larry.

23
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,859
Whatever it takes,
I will find Bauer and Almeida.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,493
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner.
Tell me what you know.

25
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:14,475
- I won't tell you a damn thing.
- Where is Almeida?

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,076
Tanner says Almeida's crew
has a plan to abduct

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,620
<i>- former Prime Minister of Sangala.
</i>- Matobo?

28
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,871
- When?
- Now.

29
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,614
- Why didn't you call the authorities?
- He couldn't.

30
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:24,739
Why not?

31
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:27,215
He found out
Emerson's client was Dubaku.

32
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:30,089
That's who has agents
inside the government.

33
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,966
Dubaku is the key
to this thing, Jack.

34
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,883
If we're going to uncover
the conspiracy,

35
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,178
we have to get to him
before he leaves the U.S.

36
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,472
<i>- I got away from the FBI.</i>
- Yeah, I heard.

37
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,350
I also heard it was Jack Bauer
who broke you out.

38
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,601
He's on board now.

39
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:44,311
The package is a person.

40
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,982
Former Prime Minister Matobo
of Sangala.

41
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,776
The assignment is to grab him,
deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.

42
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,239
Where's Matobo?!
Where is he?!

43
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,038
It's a safe room,
reinforced concrete.

44
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:06,542
Jack, we leave here without Matobo,
we lose our only chance to get Dubaku.

45
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:13,801
CES ÉVÈNEMENTS SE DÉROULENT
ENTRE 11 H 00 ET 12 H 00.

46
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:18,012
Matobo's security chief said
there's a safe room at his residence.

47
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,264
They should have him and his wife
locked down by now.

48
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,583
They'll be safe
till your team gets there.

49
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,977
Your priority is to grab Almeida
and bring him back here.

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,979
We'll make every effort
to use nonlethal force, but

51
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,770
Almeida's crew is ex-military.

52
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,151
They'll be hard to subdue
unless my men can return fire.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,111
I understand
you'll be exposing your men,

54
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,780
but it's a risk you need to take.

55
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,095
Almeida is the only viable lead
we've got

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,825
to retrieve the CIP device.

57
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,161
You need to bring him in alive,
is that understood?

58
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,038
Understood.

59
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:48,209
Let's move out.
We'll get our updates in the van.

60
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,296
Open the safe room.

61
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,251
I will keep going
until you open the door.

62
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,520
I've already told you.

63
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:07,541
Once it's closed,
you can only open it from the inside.

64
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,212
Do whatever you want to me,
but you will never get into that room.

65
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:19,240
We've got to get Matobo.
Without him, we've got nothing.

66
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:20,627
I know.

67
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,791
- Find a way in yet?
- No.

68
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,586
Litvak, any luck
reconnecting the intercom?

69
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,672
Not yet.
I'm working on it.

70
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:46,943
- Sir, this just came in...
- I don't have a lot of time right now.

71
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,603
It's from the attorney general.
I think you should make time for this.

72
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,773
- What is it?
- Tanner files a complaint against us.

73
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,059
- Walker.
<i>- Renee, it's me.</i>

74
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:17,173
I'm 15 minutes away from Matobo's house.
Once there, I'll recon for the Tac Team.

75
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,994
- Stop a second.
<i>- What?</i>

76
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,387
This information
about Matobo being abducted...

77
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,702
- tell me how you got it.
- You know that. I questioned Tanner.

78
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:28,888
- You questioned him?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,564
Tanner's lawyers are saying
you locked them out of his hospital room

80
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,535
then cut off his ventilator.

81
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,766
They said you applied pressure
to his gunshot wound.

82
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,780
We needed Almeida's location.
Tanner was not about to cooperate.

83
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,657
So you tortured him.

84
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,038
What the hell were you thinking?

85
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,583
I got the information we needed.

86
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,752
Information
that may not even be valid.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,995
You know as well as I do,
coercive interrogation is unreliable.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,340
No, Tanner was not lying.

89
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:02,218
How do you know he wasn't telling you
what you wanted to hear?

90
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,053
I'll know
when I get to Matobo's house.

91
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,178
No, you're not going to Matobo's.
You're coming back here to the office.

92
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,012
The attorney general
is sending somebody

93
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,185
and you're going to tell him
what happened.

94
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,881
It's my fault that Bauer and Almeida are
still at large. Let me play this out.

95
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,858
I will deal with the consequences
after we find the CIP device.

96
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,860
The field team can handle this.

97
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,697
Get back here now.

98
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,076
I'm sorry, Larry,

99
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,059
but I need to make this right.

100
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:36,853
Damn it.

101
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:46,016
I'm glad you're all right.

102
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:49,640
The attendant said something about us
getting a priority clearance to land.

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,214
You got lucky.

104
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:52,814
Did I?

105
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:55,209
I mean, it happened
just after we spoke,

106
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,648
so I thought maybe
you had something to do with it.

107
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,975
Me? How could I have done anything?

108
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,101
Listen,

109
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,654
I might be late tonight.
There's a lot going on at work.

110
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,895
I haven't seen you in a week.

111
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,658
We could spend some time together.

112
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,051
Dinner, and maybe...

113
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>- you know.</i>
- Sorry, I have to get back to work.

114
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,528
<i>- Call me later.</i>
- Okay.

115
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:21,630
- Did you deploy the field teams?
- Yeah, they just left.

116
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,633
We need to coordinate
with Matobo's security chief. Call him.

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,929
These people,
they work for Dubaku, don't they?

118
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,163
Possibly.

119
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:45,946
Yes, probably. But if they wanted
me dead, I would be dead.

120
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,782
- Then what do they want?
- Names.

121
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,093
Names?

122
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,787
Of my allies inside Sangala.

123
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:57,841
You would die before you exposed them,
they know that.

124
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,499
Yes, they do, but...

125
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,605
Then it's me.

126
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,347
It's me.

127
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,808
They want to use me
to get you to talk?

128
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,979
Don't worry.
We'll be safe in here until they leave.

129
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,323
Ule, I'm scared.

130
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,025
Alama, listen to me.

131
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,020
We need to stay calm.
We'll be fine.

132
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,280
The FBI knows we are here.
They'll come for us soon.

133
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:29,777
Okay?

134
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,826
<i>Mr. Matobo?</i>

135
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,478
<i>I know you can see and hear me.</i>

136
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,836
Come out now
<i></i>and nobody has to get hurt.

137
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,694
You're wasting your time.

138
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:51,195
Come out now
or I will kill your man.

139
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,222
You have one minute.

140
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,711
<i>Fifty...</i>

141
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,570
I am prepared to die, sir.

142
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,490
<i>For you and for Sangala.</i>

143
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,806
Eto is right.

144
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,282
Without you, Sangala has no leader.

145
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,336
The people need you.

146
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,732
30 seconds.

147
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,264
Eto's courage is stronger
than your threats.

148
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,349
<i>He is willing to die.</i>

149
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:41,395
<i>And for that sacrifice
he has my eternal gratitude,</i>

150
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,605
and the gratitude
of the people of Sangala.

151
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,193
Ten seconds.

152
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:58,937
Time's up.

153
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,763
I just got through to him
15 minutes ago.

154
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:20,139
- He's not answering now.
- Get me someone else at the residence.

155
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,187
It's the FBI.

156
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,394
Does the FBI know we're here?

157
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,171
Tanner.

158
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,910
He's the only one who knew about Matobo.
He must have talked.

159
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,864
We need to go before they get here.

160
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:42,406
- Not without Matobo.
- Those walls are two feet thick.

161
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,250
Even if we blow a hole with a charge,
they'll kill everyone inside.

162
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,710
I found a way.

163
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,008
- Yeah? Like what?
- We can gas them out.

164
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,303
- We don't have anything!
- We'll find something!

165
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:53,300
There's a ventilation
into the safe room.

166
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,385
If I can feed the gas,
it'll flush 'em out.

167
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:56,803
The FBI is coming!

168
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,844
They won't be here
for at least 15 minutes.

169
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,060
How do you know?

170
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,872
If they knew anything
before we got here

171
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:04,186
- they'd have evacuated Matobo.
- That's just guesswork.

172
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,855
The tac teams are staged
out of the DC branch office,

173
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,504
That's 21 miles from here, with traffic.
That gives us at least 15 minutes.

174
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,226
We're not leaving without Matobo.
That's what Dubaku is paying us for.

175
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,280
- You're not seriously considering...
- Shut up!

176
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,486
- What gas are you talking about?
- Ammonium dysterate.

177
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,821
We can make it
from basic household products.

178
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:21,946
Do it.

179
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,665
Tony, give me a hand.

180
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,469
Ammonium dysterate could kill them

181
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:36,093
- as easily as flush them out.
- That's a chance we have to take.

182
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:40,514
Delivering Matobo is our only chance
to get to Dubaku and the CIP device.

183
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,976
I got it. Grab those bowls.

184
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,739
- Gotten into the vent yet?
- Yeah!

185
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,392
The FBI will be here any minute.

186
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:11,957
Mr. Matobo...

187
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,734
we've accessed the air intake
to your safe room.

188
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,572
We are now feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

189
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,864
If you do not open the door
you will die.

190
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,668
I believe that you are willing
to sacrifice your life.

191
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:28,381
But are you also willing
to sentence your wife to death?

192
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,544
Ule...

193
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:42,010
You know what they will do
if we open the door.

194
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,556
I know.

195
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,476
I can't let them force me
to name names.

196
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,480
Our cause is more important
than we are.

197
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,154
Take my hand.

198
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,879
- Janis Gold?
- Yes?

199
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,546
I'm Raymond Howell
from the Attorney General's office,

200
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,851
- Is there some place we can talk?
- About?

201
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,960
What happened at the hospital,
Ms. Gold.

202
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,636
Agent Walker's being accused
of torturing your suspect.

203
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,766
He's not my suspect, I have no idea
what happened after I left that room,

204
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,248
I am not involved.

205
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:32,764
The suspect's attorneys claim
that you sent them to the wrong room,

206
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,398
to buy Agent Walker more time.
It sounds to me like you were involved.

207
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,776
This is going to have to wait.
Janis, I need you on comm, now.

208
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,237
The A.G. personally initiated
this investigation.

209
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,374
Open your eyes, we have a situation.
She cannot deal with this right now.

210
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:46,950
Please, have a seat.

211
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,857
- Come here.
- What's going on?

212
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:51,201
We think Almeida
and his crew may already at Matobo's.

213
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:53,883
- We can't reach Renee to warn her.
- Why can't you reach her?

214
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,574
When I heard what she did to Tanner,
I ordered her back to headquarters

215
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,338
to talk to the A.G's office,
and she refused, turned off her cell.

216
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,550
- I need you running point on SWAT.
- Okay, thanks.

217
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,969
Hillinger,
keep trying to reach Renee.

218
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,587
We're running out of time.

219
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,590
- Put more gas in!
- If we do, it'll kill them instantly.

220
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,098
How much time is it going to take,
Jack?

221
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:53,816
It's up to them.

222
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:01,877
I can't breathe.

223
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,202
Just close your eyes,

224
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:05,654
let it happen.

225
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,167
I know if we open that door,
it will be worse.

226
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:18,797
I love you.

227
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,031
Alama, no!

228
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,739
Get him out of there!

229
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,562
Get the woman, too.

230
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,699
Just breathe, you'll be all right.

231
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,161
Okay, let's go!

232
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,495
I'm so sorry.

233
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,423
Let's go.

234
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:29,768
- It's Moss.
- Larry, it's Renee.

235
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,061
Renee, listen. Bauer and Almeida
may already be at Matobo's.

236
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:36,204
I've got a visual on them loading
Matobo and his wife into a truck.

237
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,663
- Where the hell is SWAT?
- How long for SWAT?

238
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:40,781
They're still about five minutes out.
Listen to me,

239
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:44,252
I want you to stand down and fallback
until they get there. Do you hear me?

240
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,410
Let me just get a plate
on the vehicle.

241
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:47,964
Drop the gun.

242
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,806
Damn it!

243
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:00,645
Janis, try getting her back.

244
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,925
- Whose team will be first on scene?
- Remick's.

245
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,427
Get him for me, now.

246
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,817
Move!

247
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,676
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

248
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,745
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.

249
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,373
She's FBI. Her name is Walker.

250
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:29,172
She pulled me out of the Senate hearing
to help me find Tony.

251
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,719
- Don't be stupid.
- What are you talking about?

252
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,749
How much does Tanner know
about your operation?

253
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,525
Enough to cause problems.

254
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,689
We need to find out from her
what he told the FBI...

255
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:40,058
- till then we do nothing.
- He's right, David.

256
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,032
We need to be sure
nothing else has been compromised.

257
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,946
Get her in the cage.

258
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,965
Don't you touch me.

259
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:54,163
- Get your hands off of me!
- Shut up or I will shut you up.

260
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,371
- She's clean.
- Let's go!

261
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,778
<i>- Do you have Matobo?</i>
- Yeah.

262
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,746
And the wife,
but we ran into a complication.

263
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:37,991
A complication?

264
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,997
FBI knew about the operation.
Which means Tanner talked.

265
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,750
- I don't like this.
- No, neither do I.

266
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,684
We got one of their agents with us,
her name's Walker.

267
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,113
I need you to check
with your source at the Bureau,

268
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:51,437
- find out how much she knows.
- All right.

269
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:54,674
If your source doesn't find anything,
we'll interrogate her when we get there.

270
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,042
Can't believe I trusted you.

271
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,871
You lying son of a bitch.

272
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:27,801
This is important, man.

273
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:29,515
To him and me.

274
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,436
Thanks, appreciate it.

275
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:37,520
- Any luck?
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry it took so long,

276
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:40,372
but I tracked down a friend
who does crypto for the private sector,

277
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,873
he says he should be able
to crack the files on the thumb-drive.

278
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:46,083
Provided the encryption
isn't military grade or better.

279
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,728
I doubt Roger would have had access
to anything like that.

280
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:52,148
He also said you'd have a lot easier job
if you just went to the NSA.

281
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,361
Not until we know how badly my wife's
administration's been compromised.

282
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,822
My friend said he'd meet us
at his apartment in 20 minutes.

283
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:01,859
- Do you trust him?
- Yes.

284
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:06,621
Samantha says the documents
will prove my son was murdered.

285
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:09,916
I'll make sure he understands
this can't go anywhere.

286
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,199
Thank you, Brian.

287
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,257
You don't know what it's been like.

288
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,864
All this time, knowing in my bones
Roger didn't commit suicide,

289
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:24,246
and having people just tolerate me,

290
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:27,183
tell me it was my grief talking.

291
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,519
I'm going to find the people
who did this to my son, Brian.

292
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:35,525
And I am going to make them pay.

293
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:37,610
Sir, if I may...

294
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,529
What is it?

295
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,574
Shouldn't you at least
tell the President what you're doing?

296
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,468
I can't take this to my wife...

297
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,331
until I can prove it.

298
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,182
You wanted to see me?

299
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,483
One thing I've learned:

300
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,127
presidents don't make new friends.

301
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,134
That's why they lean
on their old ones.

302
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:14,355
I'll need your support, Ethan.

303
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:18,401
I'm going to authorize the military
operation in Sangala as planned.

304
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,863
You don't need to list
the consequences, Ethan.

305
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,545
Any action I take in West Africa

306
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,076
will likely result
in a terrorist attack here,

307
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,274
but if I take no action,

308
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,665
an entire generation of Sangalans
will be wiped out.

309
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,282
Your critics will point out

310
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,891
you took an oath
to protect the people of this country.

311
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:38,338
And the way to do that

312
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,466
is not give in
to blackmail and threats.

313
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:48,204
Taking a stand
against the genocide in Sangala

314
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:52,160
has reestablished our leadership
and our moral authority

315
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:56,216
in the eyes of the world.
I cannot and I will not back down.

316
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,175
- Yes?
- <i>Madame President, </i>

317
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,004
<i>Secretary of State Stevens
is here to see you. It's urgent.</i>

318
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:04,238
Send him in.

319
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,278
What is it, Joe?

320
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,768
The FBI just reported
that Prime Minister Matobo

321
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,822
and his wife were abducted
from their residence.

322
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:12,956
What?!

323
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,582
Abducted by whom?

324
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:18,127
His bodyguards identified Bauer
and Almeida as two of the men involved,

325
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,797
which means Dubaku
has the CIP device and Matobo.

326
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,401
Where is the FBI on finding him?

327
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,723
- Do they have any active leads?
- Not yet. Mrs President.

328
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:28,899
They're just beginning
the search operation.

329
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:32,934
I think we need to talk about how
Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.

330
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,752
Matobo is the only man
with enough popular support

331
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:39,148
and strength to lead Sangala
after an invasion.

332
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,338
Without him, the country would collapse
in complete bloodshed and chaos.

333
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:46,493
Which means the best course of action
may be to meet Dubaku's demand

334
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,450
and withdraw our forces.

335
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:53,246
The best course of action is to find
Matobo and the people who took him.

336
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,669
And make sure the FBI brings in
every relevant agency.

337
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,169
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:06,676
So, where do we stand with your decision
to go through with the invasion?

339
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,083
We still have 30 minutes
before Dubaku's deadline.

340
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,745
I want Matobo found by then.

341
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:20,323
I just sent you new search coordinates.
Upload a grid to the ground teams.

342
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,650
I already did, they're adjusting
their perimeter now.

343
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,549
All right, thanks.

344
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,618
- Listen, Erika.
- What?

345
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,465
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

346
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,966
You're worried
about your wife on a plane. It's cool.

347
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,685
She's on the ground now.

348
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,938
Her plane landed, she got lucky.

349
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:39,809
That's great news.
I'm glad she's okay.

350
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:42,487
Hey, Sean.

351
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:45,048
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

352
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:46,939
Yeah, me, too.

353
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:49,677
Excuse me.

354
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,844
Sean, I need you to babysit
the downloads on my computer.

355
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:56,401
They're coming in from the forensics
team at Matobo's residence.

356
00:23:58,769 --> 00:23:59,931
Now, please.

357
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:01,674
Okay, sure.

358
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,638
Excuse me.

359
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:11,574
Remick's team just finished
a sweep of the Matobo residence.

360
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,117
He's on line two
if you want to talk to him.

361
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:15,203
Janis, wait.

362
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,587
- Did you find Renee?
- <i>No, sir,</i>

363
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:22,126
but one of Matobo's bodyguards saw
her being taken by Bauer and Almeida.

364
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,213
- Then she's alive.
- <i>She's with the Matobos.</i>

365
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,673
We'll run a trace on her cell.

366
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,158
Can't do that, sir.

367
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:32,307
We recovered Agent Walker's phone
and weapon on-site.

368
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,055
Forensics is still sweeping
the scene.

369
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,409
I want to be the first to know
if they find something.

370
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:42,980
All right...

371
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:47,510
get Renee's picture
and description out to all agencies.

372
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:50,571
Put me in the queue
for a real-time update from Homeland.

373
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,809
Janis.

374
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,129
I want everybody in this office

375
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,454
to make finding her
their top priority.

376
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,748
- Is that understood?
- It is.

377
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,794
Are you going to be okay?

378
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:08,798
What are you talking about?

379
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,218
Just get to work.

380
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,307
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you,
sir.

381
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:42,005
You have nothing to apologize for.

382
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,011
How much are they paying you, Jack?
I hope it's enough to live with yourself

383
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,427
when they kill innocent Americans
with the CIP device.

384
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,469
Shut up.

385
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,048
How many people are gonna die
because of what you're doing?

386
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:03,603
- Emerson.
- <i>You were right.</i>

387
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,572
Agent Walker broke Tanner.

388
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,189
<i>How much did Tanner spill?</i>

389
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:10,443
Other than the details
of Matobo's abduction, nothing.

390
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,296
- You're sure?
- Positive.

391
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,041
Walker is extraneous.

392
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,930
Kill her before you get here.

393
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,045
- We'll be with you soon.
- Be quick about it.

394
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,579
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands
on the prime minister.

395
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,904
Nichols checked with his source
at the Bureau.

396
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,420
Walker doesn't know anything
that can compromise the operation.

397
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,125
You trust Nichols' source?

398
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,382
Nichols does.
That's good enough for me.

399
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,885
Litvak, change of plan.

400
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,566
Take a right on Morrison Avenue.

401
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,510
What's on Morrison?

402
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,492
Abandoned construction site,
we'll dump her there.

403
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,274
Shouldn't we find out for ourselves
what she knows?

404
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,899
Nichols wants her out of the way
before we deliver Matobo.

405
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,832
I understand your deployment's
stretched thin,

406
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:23,516
but one of our own agents is missing.
That's a priority, too.

407
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,477
Look, I don't care
where you find the men.

408
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,437
Just get them out there looking.

409
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:34,151
Never seen him like that.
He looks like his head's gonna explode.

410
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,502
- Thank you. I'm not surprised.
- Meaning?

411
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:40,199
Meaning it's fairly obvious
he has feelings for Renee.

412
00:27:40,557 --> 00:27:41,784
Why do you think that?

413
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:45,025
Instinct. I just know.

414
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:49,490
Stay on task.

415
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:20,573
General Juma says the American carrier
troop still has not begun to withdraw.

416
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,908
Well, they haven't launched
their invasion either.

417
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,453
I gave this president a deadline
and it's almost past.

418
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,961
Apparently, our demonstration was not
convincing enough.

419
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,903
This woman is more stubborn
than we expected.

420
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,784
Once she realizes we have Matobo,
she'll change her mind.

421
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:35,963
And if she doesn't?

422
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,491
You have the CIP module.

423
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,412
Launch another attack.

424
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:47,524
Let's see how stubborn she is
after American civilians start dying.

425
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,854
- When will Matobo be here?
- Within an hour.

426
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:55,483
- What caused the delay?
- An FBI agent got in the way.

427
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,721
I needed to make sure
she hadn't compromised our operation.

428
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,396
- And has she?
- No.

429
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,221
As soon as my men get rid of her,
I'll pick up Matobo personally

430
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:04,843
and bring him to you.

431
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:22,653
This friend of yours,

432
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:25,283
you're sure he's gonna have
everything he needs to access the files?

433
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,410
He said he didn't think
it'd be a problem.

434
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,016
Thank you, Brian.

435
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,019
- For all your help, and your loyalty.
- You don't need to thank me, sir.

436
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,730
Yes, I do.
You're risking a lot to do this,

437
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,933
especially after
what happened this morning.

438
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:39,652
You'll thank me after we confirm
the information is on that drive.

439
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:43,548
Said the key
should be under the mat.

440
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:47,860
There it is.

441
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,388
When will your friend be here?

442
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,814
He should be here any minute.

443
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:13,116
Would you mind turning on the air?

444
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,504
- It's really hot in here.
- Of course.

445
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,917
It's Samantha and Roger.

446
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:32,206
This is Samantha's apartment, sir.

447
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
You.

448
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,214
I'm sorry, sir.

449
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,730
Why?

450
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:48,929
Roger was looking into things
he shouldn't have.

451
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:51,807
I tried to protect him, too,

452
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:53,809
but he wouldn't let me.

453
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:57,132
He inherited your determination.

454
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:02,401
You killed my son.

455
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:09,330
You...

456
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,441
killed Roger.

457
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,820
It's Tetradyzine, sir.

458
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,423
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

459
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:33,431
Don't try to speak, the Tetradyzine
also paralyzes your vocal chords.

460
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,106
If it's any consolation, sir,

461
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:43,137
Roger died quickly.

462
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:46,191
And I'm going to make sure...

463
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,239
you do, too.

464
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:14,597
<i>Situation here is in control.
Are you tracking Ms. Roth?</i>

465
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,772
Yeah.

466
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,644
Time to get her back
to her apartment.

467
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:22,672
- Are you sure this is going to work?
<i>- It'll work fine.</i>

468
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:25,596
<i>Mr. Taylor came to her apartment
to confront her about Roger,</i>

469
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:28,779
lost his temper and killed her.
Took his own life, OK?

470
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:32,104
All right. I'll let you know
if there are any problems.

471
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,362
I really am sorry, sir.

472
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,763
If only you'd left
well enough alone.

473
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,592
Ms. Roth.

474
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,942
- Agent Vossler.
- Henry Taylor sent me.

475
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:10,554
Mr. Taylor's been looking
into the matter you discussed.

476
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,865
He believes
you're in imminent danger.

477
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,773
My God...

478
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,695
What am I supposed to do?

479
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,709
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

480
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,040
- Escort you to a safe house.
- Now?

481
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:23,958
My orders are to take you there
immediately.

482
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,036
We can stop at your apartment first,
so you can pack clothes, essentials.

483
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:33,446
- But I just need to call my office.
- Not until we get you locked down.

484
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:37,572
Please.

485
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,061
- OK.
- Right this way.

486
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:00,579
Your friend from the A.G.
is still here.

487
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:02,513
- I know.
- What's going on?

488
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,417
He wants to talk
about what Renee did in the hospital.

489
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,628
What did Renee do to Tanner
at the hospital?

490
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't know, but Howell is claiming
she tortured Tanner.

491
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,005
Renee?

492
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,008
- I don't believe that.
- Maybe you should.

493
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,510
Tanner wasn't talking...
and she kicked me out of the room.

494
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:22,142
The next thing I know the alarm
on his ventilator is going off.

495
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:25,337
And Renee
had the information she needed?

496
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:33,050
If you weren't in the room,
you don't have a problem.

497
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:35,948
I do, actually...
she asked me to stall his lawyers.

498
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,420
And you did?

499
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,757
- Come on, Gold. What were you thinking?
- She gave me a direct order,

500
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,163
- what was I supposed to do?
- Say no.

501
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,464
Do you realize

502
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:47,642
if they prove that Renee tortured him
you're an accessory?

503
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,753
- And Larry is not gonna protect you.
- I know.

504
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,141
Let's hope the A.G. will have moved on
to something else when this is all over.

505
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:01,142
I'm getting back to work.

506
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,220
Agent Moss.

507
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:13,277
- What do you want?
- Forgive my interruption,

508
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,446
but it's just been brought to my
attention that Agent Walker is missing.

509
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:22,494
Yes, she may have been abducted
by the same people responsible

510
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,913
for kidnapping Matobo and his wife.

511
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,855
I'm very sorry to hear that.

512
00:35:28,725 --> 00:35:32,379
And want you to know that I appreciate
the pressure that you are under.

513
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,757
- Glad to hear it.
- Nevertheless, the Attorney General

514
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,593
is still pressing for a full account
of Agent Walker's handling

515
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,054
of the Tanner interrogation,
and at this moment,

516
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,514
Janis Gold
is the only witness available to me.

517
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:46,548
She's not available to you.
She can't be spared right now.

518
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,847
- I need a short time with her.
- You can't have her.

519
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:51,165
Are you going to force me
to get the A.G. on the line?

520
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,885
You've got to be kidding me.
You really want to press this now?!

521
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,903
We're in the middle
of an international crisis.

522
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:58,363
- I'm aware of that.
- And all you seem interested in

523
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,364
is condemning an agent who's in danger
so you can nail her to the wall.

524
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:06,246
If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines
and used illegal tactics to get info,

525
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:08,168
then, yes, she will be prosecuted.

526
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:11,377
Then maybe you can let us get her back
before you throw her to the wolves,

527
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,295
I mean, if that's okay with you.

528
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,226
Yes?

529
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,428
<i>NSA just relayed a call
they intercepted to us.</i>

530
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,027
<i>Renee was referenced.</i>

531
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:25,260
Referenced how?

532
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,632
<i>I think you need
to come hear it yourself.</i>

533
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:31,991
I'll be right there.

534
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:33,732
- Excuse me.
- We're not done here.

535
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,520
Agent Moss!

536
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,656
- Did you source it?
- Five minutes ago.

537
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,616
- It's legit.
- Check it again.

538
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,328
- I already did, twice.
- Where's the intercept code?

539
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,735
Right there
above the decryption algorithm.

540
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,049
- They routed it on a priority channel.
- Do we have verbal confirmation?

541
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:53,919
It won't change
the content of the call.

542
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,591
I know, I just...

543
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,089
What's on the NSA intercept?

544
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:00,217
You said Renee was referenced.
What's on it?

545
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:02,886
It's only a fragment,
but she's referenced, yeah.

546
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,855
- Enough to get a GPS fix?
- The clip's not even 20 s long.

547
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,615
The best we can say
is that it's in the Metro area.

548
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,643
Play it.

549
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,189
<i>Emerson, you were right,</i>

550
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,358
<i>Agent Walker broke Tanner.</i>

551
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,195
<i>How much did Tanner spill?</i>

552
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,135
<i>Other than the details
of Matobo's abduction, nothing.</i>

553
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,898
- <i>You're sure?</i>
- <i>Walker is extraneous.</i>

554
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:27,975
- <i>Kill her before you get here.</i>
- <i>We'll be with you soon.</i>

555
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,288
<i>Be quick about it.</i>

556
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,874
<i>Dubaku's anxious to get his hands
on the Prime Minister.</i>

557
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:41,318
- When was this call made?
- Ten minutes ago.

558
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,135
Run a trace.

559
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,012
- I already did.
- Run it again!

560
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,291
The ditch.

561
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,268
Kill her.

562
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:41,837
Step down.

563
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,010
Step down!

564
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:53,288
You could either walk
or I could drag you.

565
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,113
You're really going to kill me?

566
00:39:03,756 --> 00:39:06,206
I'm not going to beg
for my life, Jack.

567
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,962
So everything
that you told me was a lie?

568
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:25,779
I'm doing what I have to.
I don't expect you to understand.

569
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:29,535
I understand that you are a traitor
and a murderer.

570
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,001
Turn around.

571
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:37,708
You're going to have to look at me
when you pull that trigger.

572
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,543
I said turn around.

573
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,587
If you trust me,
I will get you through this alive.

574
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,880
Get on your knees.

575
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,596
For a second there,
I didn't think you were going to do it.

576
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,805
Now bury her.

577
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:36,394
We're on a timetable.

578
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,764
Can't have anyone finding her
before we leave the country.

579
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,020
Give him a hand, Tony.
