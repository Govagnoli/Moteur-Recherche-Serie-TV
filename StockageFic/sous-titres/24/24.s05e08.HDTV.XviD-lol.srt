1
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,901
You helped terrorists acquire

2
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:16,734
weaponized nerve gas!

3
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,767
I told you we were going
to trigger the canisters

4
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,267
once the separatists reached
their base in Central Asia.

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,734
Damn it, Walt, you got into bed

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,734
with these people and
now they're threatening

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,834
to use the gas
on American citizens!

8
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,500
What do we do about Walt?

9
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:29,834
We keep him out of sight

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,667
long enough for us to construct
a credible narrative.

11
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,801
Are you talking
about a cover-up?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,567
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

13
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:40,434
If we go public with Cummings,

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,267
the credibility
of this office
will be destroyed.

15
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,867
Mr. President...

16
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:46,967
What is it, Mike?

17
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,068
I think you should come here.

18
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:48,801
What's going on?

19
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:51,134
Just come here, sir.

20
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:52,300
Lynn?

21
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,168
What is it?

22
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:55,367
I know you're busy,

23
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:56,300
but I need to see you, please.

24
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,701
( groaning )

25
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,034
Hurry up!

26
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:02,801
I need you to do
some work for us

27
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,168
and I'm going to need it
done fast.

28
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,333
Get the canisters!

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,333
You have to cut precisely

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,934
ten centimeters

31
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,634
from the bottom of the casing.

32
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,634
You and I need a place
where we can meet.

33
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,367
Call you back in five minutes.

34
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,367
Logan has asked Jack

35
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,267
to be reinstated on
a provisional basis.

36
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,667
He's been given
full autonomy and access.

37
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,801
We got a possible intercept
on Erwich.

38
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,367
A man named Jacob Rossler--

39
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,634
a software programmer

40
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,400
indicted for high-security code
infiltration.

41
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:28,500
Never convicted.

42
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,333
Copy that.

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Federal agent!

44
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:35,467
Rossler is in custody!
I repeat, Rossler is in custody!

45
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:36,634
( phone ringing )

46
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,667
Answer.

47
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:39,367
Yes?

48
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,867
We have the identification.

49
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:44,534
No!

50
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:46,434
Is he gonna make it?

51
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,801
No. He's dead.

52
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,634
Rossler's our only link
to those canisters.

53
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,967
Erwich's gonna call here
any minute.

54
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:57,667
He's gonna expect
to talk to him.

55
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,267
What's the situation?

56
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,600
Rossler's dead, shot
by his female companion.

57
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,001
What does that do to our plan?

58
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,867
We intended
to use Rossler

59
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,567
to lead us to Erwich
and the Sentox.

60
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:35,701
How?

61
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,600
Rossler was going
to sell Erwich a chip

62
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,267
that would enable him
to activate the canisters

63
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,400
and release the Sentox.

64
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,634
And we put a tracker
on the chip?

65
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,134
Yes, to follow Erwich
back to the canisters.

66
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,701
Obviously that plan
has to change.

67
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,333
Has Erwich set a time and place
for the meeting yet?

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,367
No.

69
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,901
We've also picked-up
increased chatter

70
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:51,934
related to
the canisters.

71
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:52,967
Related how?

72
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,200
Erwich's been
putting out feelers

73
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,767
to terrorist organizations

74
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,634
with sleeper cells
established here.

75
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,101
He's asking for help
launching nerve gas

76
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:00,901
attacks on larger targets,
across the country.

77
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,767
There's a call coming
in on Rossler's phone.

78
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,934
We assume it's Erwich.

79
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,068
What do you
want to do?

80
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,967
Put it on the speaker.

81
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,233
( phone ringing )

82
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,101
Jack, this has to be Erwich.

83
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,134
You ready?

84
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,101
Yeah.

85
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,667
Five minutes.

86
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,834
Roof of the parking garage,

87
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,101
corner of White
Oak and Mattison.

88
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:28,101
One of my men
will meet you.

89
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,034
Look for a blue van.

90
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,434
( dial tone )

91
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,134
What do you think?

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,367
I think we caught a break.

93
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,333
Give me the chip.

94
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:44,500
This is Jack Bauer.

95
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:45,634
Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,333
Buchanan.

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,634
Bill, did you
get that?

98
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,434
Yes. Erwich is sending someone
else to the meeting.

99
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,534
That's a problem.

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,701
No, I don't think so.

101
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,734
It means I can pass
myself off as Rossler.

102
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:56,734
We can keep
the meeting.

103
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,068
We can control
this thing.

104
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,801
Rossler and the man Erwich is
sending may know each other.

105
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,367
No, he said, look
for a blue van.

106
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,034
He wouldn't have said that
if they knew each other.

107
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,233
It's a big risk, Jack.

108
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,667
Jack, they will probably
kill you,

109
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,068
even if they do think
you're Rossler.

110
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,867
It ties up a loose end.

111
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,801
Well, right now, we don't
have a choice. If we're lucky,

112
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,300
this guy will take the chip
back to Erwich.

113
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,267
That will lead us
to the nerve gas.

114
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,467
All right, Jack.

115
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:21,734
Do it.

116
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,034
Thank you.

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,834
Chloe, Edgar, Jack
is gonna need you

118
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,934
to tech support him through
the installation of that chip.

119
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,400
We'll pull up the schematics.

120
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:31,667
Already on it.

121
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,467
All right, the chip you'll
be giving them is genuine,

122
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,967
but it's useless without
the correct unlock code.

123
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,267
The tracker's built
into the chip itself.

124
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,801
Okay. Thanks.

125
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,200
How do you want
to play this?

126
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,467
Passive, nonthreatening.

127
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,068
I want these people
to think I'm scared of them.

128
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,267
All right, get TAC teams
ready. We're on the move.

129
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,934
You'll need a new com
unit with fresh battery.

130
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,467
You'll be patched
into CTU at all times.

131
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,500
With this, we'll be
able to hear everything

132
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,600
within a 20 foot
radius of you.

133
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,667
I'll be watching your back.

134
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,367
Thanks.

135
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,734
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing, one, two, three.

136
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,600
He'll be waiting
for you there.

137
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,434
Let me know if
there's a problem.

138
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,934
Do we have the
new chip yet?

139
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,233
No.

140
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,567
I sent Polakov and Komar
to meet Rossler.

141
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,534
They should have it
in a few minutes.

142
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,901
Anything?

143
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,667
Remote will always be
the most effective way

144
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,267
of triggering the canisters.

145
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,267
I understand, but what
if the new chip doesn't work?

146
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,901
I need options
in case Rossler fails us.

147
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,567
There may be a workaround,

148
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,801
but someone will
have to be on site

149
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,901
with the canister.

150
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Get it done.

151
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,200
Excuse me, Mr. President,
I thought you should know,

152
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,034
Walt's body has been moved
to the Secret Service

153
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,801
Outbuilding for
the time being.

154
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,934
You realize, sir, we still need

155
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,400
to issue a public statement
about his death.

156
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,233
No statement till his wife's
been notified.

157
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,667
Of course.

158
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,400
Sir, if you don't mind
me saying,

159
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,634
I think perhaps
we have an opportunity here.

160
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,901
This statement
you and Mrs. Logan
plan to release--

161
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:14,001
disclosing the
fact that Walt was
part of a conspiracy

162
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:16,233
to supply the terrorists
with nerve gas,

163
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,001
and that he was involved

164
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:19,233
in David Palmer's
assassination...

165
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,434
What's your point, Mike?

166
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,734
I'm sorry, sir.

167
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:25,834
I wonder if his death
might render all that moot.

168
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,333
Go on.

169
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Very little will come
from dragging Walt's name

170
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,801
through the mud

171
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,367
when he's not here to answer
for what he's done.

172
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,101
And it would be devastating
for this country,

173
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,701
particularly, if, God forbid,

174
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,200
that nerve gas is
used against us.

175
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,101
What are you suggesting?

176
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:52,600
We could attribute Walt's
suicide to a despondency

177
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,001
over the
day's events.

178
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:55,300
Overwork.

179
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:56,801
Personal issues.

180
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,934
Let him go out
with some dignity, you mean,

181
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,300
and not as a traitor.

182
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,034
Yes, sir.

183
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,367
My wife will have a
considerable problem with that.

184
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,467
Well... I respect

185
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:14,467
the First Lady's
moral conviction,

186
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,168
but this is your decision,

187
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,867
not hers.

188
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,400
Is there anything else
I can get you, Mrs. Logan?

189
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,267
No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

190
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,233
Can I ask your advice
on something?

191
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Of course.

192
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,434
Some of the staff
are asking questions.

193
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,233
About?

194
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,567
Walt Cummings' death.

195
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,901
Evelyn, I'm helping prepare
a statement right now

196
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,734
that the President's
gonna give later.

197
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,068
It'll explain everything.

198
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:00,068
( clears throat )

199
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:02,068
Is there something else, Evelyn?

200
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:04,767
Yes.

201
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,400
What?

202
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,934
What is it?

203
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:09,434
Why did he do it?

204
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,400
Why did Walt kill himself?

205
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,367
I deserve to know.

206
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,467
A violent thing happened
to someone

207
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,734
that I work with every day,
someone

208
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,767
who had no visible signs
of depression.

209
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,667
What if it wasn't suicide?

210
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,367
What if we're in danger?

211
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:26,834
I don't know
what to think.

212
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,400
It was suicide.

213
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,600
How can you be so sure?

214
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,567
Evelyn, listen to me.

215
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,068
What I'm going to say to you
has to stay in this room

216
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:42,467
until its made public,
do you understand?

217
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:43,867
You do understand?

218
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,500
Even his family doesn't
know the truth yet.

219
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,767
Okay.

220
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,500
Walt Cummings was a traitor.

221
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,634
What?

222
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm not going to go
into any details,

223
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,934
but suffice it to say
that Walt was responsible

224
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,233
for some of the awful things
that have happened today.

225
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,567
I can't believe that.

226
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,801
The President
just found out.

227
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,101
I suppose that Walt didn't want
to face the humiliation

228
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,233
of a long public trial and...

229
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,667
and he decided to kill himself.

230
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,200
Was he working
with the terrorists?

231
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:14,267
Our enforcement agencies
are trying to figure that out.

232
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,500
( sighs )

233
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,701
Jack's arrived
at the rendezvous point.

234
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,200
Maintain your distance.

235
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,068
CURTIS:
All right, head's up.

236
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:41,834
We have a blue van
entering the parking garage,

237
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,134
license plate six-Quebec-four

238
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,333
nine-nine-five-one.

239
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,767
Repeat, six-Quebec-four,
nine-nine-five-one.

240
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,500
Running the plates.

241
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,667
CURTIS:
He's heading up the ramp
towards you, Jack.

242
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,467
Couldn't get a visual
on who's inside.

243
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,767
I have a hit from DMV.

244
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,168
The plates don't match
the vehicle.

245
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,233
They probably stole the van
and put clean plates on it.

246
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,934
( softly ):
Two men are getting out.

247
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,267
Show time.

248
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,967
Rossler?

249
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,300
I was told
there'd only be one of you.

250
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,300
Is that a problem?

251
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,467
Yeah-- I don't like surprises.

252
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,600
Relax... we've got your money.

253
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:47,534
Let me see it.

254
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,634
When I see the chip.

255
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,367
MAN ( over speaker ):
Erwich says you have
to install it.

256
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:03,734
JACK:
Where's the remote trigger?

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,233
Let's go.

258
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,767
Okay, Jack,

259
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,233
you need to remove
the backing.

260
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,134
Inside, there are five jumpers.

261
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,001
Toggle the one
in the middle to the left.

262
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,300
Pry out the old chip,
do it gently.

263
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,168
When it's out, clear your throat
or something.

264
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:50,734
Okay, insert the new chip
in the slot,

265
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,934
press the reset button
under the slot.

266
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:56,001
Screw the back on,
and you're done.

267
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,701
The trigger's
been reconfigured,

268
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,168
you can activate
the canisters now.

269
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,367
You'd better
hope it works.

270
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,034
You're coming with us,

271
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,867
just to make sure.

272
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,101
( groans )

273
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,267
( blows thudding;
Jack groaning )

274
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,333
What are they doing?

275
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
( softly ):
We are on the move.

276
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:49,034
JACK:
This isn't the deal
I made with Erwich.

277
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,001
I reconfigured the trigger--

278
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,767
you're supposed to just
give me the money!

279
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,101
Standing by to move in.

280
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,767
BUCHANAN:
Hold on, Curtis.

281
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,801
Erwich knows
who Jack is;

282
00:12:58,867 --> 00:12:59,801
he saw him
at the airport.

283
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,434
They'll kill him.

284
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,200
By the time Jack gets
close enough to be recognized,

285
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,200
the TAC teams will move in.

286
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,200
No, we need
to move in now,

287
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,233
take the two terrorists

288
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,734
and make them tell us
where Erwich is.

289
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,134
We don't have time.

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,901
Erwich will know something's
wrong and we'll lose him.

291
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,333
This is our only shot.

292
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,434
Bill?!

293
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,467
Are we letting them take Jack?

294
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,434
I'm awaiting orders.

295
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,567
Stand down, Curtis.

296
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,600
Take no action.

297
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,034
Reassemble
the TAC teams

298
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,600
and mount a follow operation.

299
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,267
All teams stand by.

300
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,400
Lynn's right.

301
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,101
Whatever happens,
Jack can handle it.

302
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:48,934
He has to.

303
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,004
Come in.

304
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,171
Excuse me, Mrs. Logan.

305
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:09,637
What is it?

306
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:10,937
Laura Campbell gave me
the press release

307
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:12,171
to give to you.

308
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:13,704
I'm confused.
About what?

309
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,770
It's not what you said.

310
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:15,737
They're calling
Walt Cummings a hero,

311
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:18,071
not a traitor.

312
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:20,171
I don't believe this!

313
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,971
Well? Is CTU any closer?

314
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:28,837
They're mounting an
undercover operation,

315
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,770
which they hope will lead
them to the canisters.

316
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:31,804
Hope is not good enough.

317
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,104
We want results.

318
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,104
You need to make that
abundantly clear to them, Mike!

319
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,537
I believe they're doing

320
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,670
everything that
can be done, sir.

321
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,704
I just read the statement

322
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,037
you issued about
Walt's death.

323
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:47,637
"Stress due to overwork
robbed this country

324
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,670
of one of its most dedicated
public servants."

325
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,604
"His work with
this administration has..."

326
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,071
( sighs )

327
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,171
You're covering everything up.

328
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:59,171
I'll wait outside.

329
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:00,537
Don't go anywhere, Mike.

330
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:02,637
Your fingerprints
are all over this.

331
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,737
Charles, we worked
on this together.

332
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,004
I thought we'd
both agreed

333
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,238
that you needed to go public
about Walt's involvement

334
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,637
with everything
that is going on today.

335
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:13,204
I know. I know
you're disappointed,

336
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,570
but I think it's obvious

337
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,370
that Walt taking his own life
changes things.

338
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,604
What's obvious is that this
is a pack of lies!

339
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,104
Mrs. Logan...

340
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,304
full disclosure would
have been necessary

341
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,403
to ensure Walt
faced justice

342
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,171
for what he'd done.

343
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:28,171
With his death making
that a non-issue,

344
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:32,137
it was decided this course
was best for his family.

345
00:15:32,204 --> 00:15:33,403
Oh... don't.

346
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,403
You don't care

347
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,770
about his family.

348
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:38,037
You decided
that this was best for you.

349
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,104
But, Charles, you
are dead wrong...

350
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,171
Martha,
that's enough!

351
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,537
I made my decision...

352
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:46,104
and I am the president.

353
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:49,137
Which means it's your job
to tell the truth...

354
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,770
even when it's ugly.

355
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,704
And if you don't,
I will.

356
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,804
If you feel so strongly
about telling the truth,

357
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,104
you can start with Walt's wife

358
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,037
when she arrives.

359
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,004
Suzanne's coming here?

360
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,704
To collect her husband's body.

361
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,570
So you can be
the one to tell her

362
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,104
that the real reason
that Walt took

363
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,171
the coward's
way out

364
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:11,704
was because
he disgraced himself

365
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,704
and he betrayed his country.

366
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,604
All right.

367
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,637
It'll be very painful...

368
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,137
but it's
the right thing to do.

369
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:34,204
We're one mile behind Jack,
heading west

370
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:36,171
on Nordhoff,
just passing Sepulveda.

371
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:37,171
Maintain your distance.

372
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,238
We've got them on satellite.

373
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:39,503
We're not going to lose them.

374
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,904
JACK ( on speaker ):
Where are we going?

375
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,770
What does it matter?

376
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:43,937
I have another appointment,

377
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,904
I just want to know
if I'm going to make it.

378
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,004
We're almost there.

379
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,637
How long it takes
once we get there

380
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:50,137
is up to you.

381
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,137
What do you mean?

382
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,338
I told you.

383
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:53,437
We need to make sure

384
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,837
the remote trigger works
on the canisters.

385
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:02,071
Oh, my God, you've got
one of the canisters with you.

386
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,238
Erwich wants
a field test.

387
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,537
I'm not going to be within
50 miles of that thing

388
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,403
when it goes off.
We have masks.

389
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:13,704
What's the target?

390
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,304
Curtis, are you
reading this?

391
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,637
Yeah. You want me to reposition
the TAC team for an intercept?

392
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,204
No! Not till we have a visual

393
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,171
on the canister.

394
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,871
If they stay on Nordhoff,

395
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:29,238
up ahead there's
an industrial park

396
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:30,971
and two retail complexes.

397
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:35,037
They just turned north.

398
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,071
That's not good.

399
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:37,338
What is it, Chloe,

400
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,470
what's the potential target?

401
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,537
The Sunrise Hills Mall.

402
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,837
BUCHANAN:
Curtis, the intended target is

403
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,470
the Sunrise Hills Mall.

404
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:06,637
Repeat-- the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

405
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,204
Uploading schematics
of the mall,

406
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,370
surrounding streets,

407
00:18:09,437 --> 00:18:10,837
to TAC teams now.

408
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:12,904
All right, all teams
stand by for positioning.

409
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:14,137
CURTIS:
We're setting up

410
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:15,904
at the second level
of the parking structure.

411
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,104
This is it.

412
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:39,837
BUCHANAN:
Curtis?

413
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,204
Do you have Jack on visual?

414
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:42,537
Yeah. He and
the two hostiles

415
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:43,904
are in
the south parking lot.

416
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,304
Alpha Team, take
the position

417
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,570
on the perimeter
of the lot.

418
00:18:46,637 --> 00:18:48,470
Bravo Team, I want your
plainclothes agents

419
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:49,770
in position
at the mall doors.

420
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:54,004
How are you going to get
the canister inside?

421
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,037
Through the front door.

422
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,704
Anyone asks,

423
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,904
we're working on
the air-conditioning.

424
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,403
I didn't agree to this.

425
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,470
I'm not going in.

426
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:02,470
Yes, you are.

427
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,403
Jack is trying
to stall for time.

428
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,503
What are we waiting for?

429
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,503
There are hundreds of
video cameras in there.

430
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,570
This entire country
will know what we look like

431
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:10,737
in the next few hours.

432
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:13,071
We want your leaders to know
who did this to them.

433
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,304
This is your fight.

434
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,670
The deal I made with Erwich
was to sell him the chip,

435
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,238
not to get my face
all over the news.

436
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,637
Erwich prefers
to keep you alive,

437
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,071
but only if you cooperate.

438
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:24,403
Now, hand me
the jackets.

439
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,804
Jack, we're moving
the TAC teams in

440
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,904
to recover the canister
before you go inside the mall.

441
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,437
Fine, let's get this over with.

442
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,537
AUDREY ( over earpiece ):
I'll let you know

443
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,171
as soon as we're in position.

444
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:42,670
CHLOE:
Sending redeployment orders now.

445
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:43,770
Hold off on that.

446
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:45,370
AUDREY:
What? Lynn?!

447
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,037
We have got to stop them
before they get inside.

448
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,604
If we move in now,

449
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,871
Erwich will know
that we're onto him,

450
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:51,403
and we won't be led
to the other canisters.

451
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:56,370
Are you talking about letting
them go through with this?

452
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,770
Sacrificing the lives
of all those people?

453
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,071
We're talking about
accepting the damage

454
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:02,537
that one canister can do,

455
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:04,037
versus what
the other 19 can do.

456
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,370
This is insane.

457
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,470
Bill?!

458
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,403
Bill's not in charge here, I am!

459
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,737
We need to call the president.

460
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,034
I just got into the mall's

461
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,800
internal video
surveillance server.

462
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,468
We should be able to see Jack.

463
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:09,234
Jack, we're still waiting
for the president to call.

464
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,434
I'll let you know as
soon as we have him.

465
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,534
( kids singing
"Happy Birthday" )

466
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,967
* Happy birthday to you *

467
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,401
* Cha cha cha! *

468
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,468
Get the security guard.

469
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,568
Knock on the glass.

470
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,367
What are you guys doing here?

471
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,134
Servicing the HVAC units.
We didn't

472
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,367
get a call about that.

473
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:56,034
I don't know what to tell you.
We did.

474
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,134
You got paperwork?

475
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,201
Just a minute.

476
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,767
Will this work?

477
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:13,867
Yeah.

478
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,934
Do it.

479
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,633
Throw me the bag.

480
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,101
And your jacket.

481
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,167
WOMAN:
Mr. Buchanan, the president
is on line one.

482
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,667
Put him through.

483
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,434
Jack, we have the
president on the line.

484
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:43,733
I'm gonna patch you in.

485
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,767
LOGAN:
Yes?

486
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,334
Mr. President,
this is Lynn McGill.

487
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:47,900
You also have Bill Buchanan,

488
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,301
Audrey Raines, Chloe O'Brian,
and Edgar Stiles in the room.

489
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,401
Go ahead.

490
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,000
Sir, we're calling you
for a decision

491
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,367
on a critical
operational matter.

492
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:56,367
What is it?

493
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,767
Jack Bauer is
currently undercover

494
00:22:58,834 --> 00:22:59,934
with some of the terrorists.

495
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,967
They're expecting Jack
to help them release

496
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,700
a single canister
of Sentox nerve gas

497
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,034
in the Sunrise Hills
Shopping Mall.

498
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,800
where they are right now.

499
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,767
Well, then arrest them.
What's the problem?

500
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,800
Sir, the problem is, if we
don't maintain Jack's cover,

501
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,000
there's no guarantee
that they'll lead us back

502
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,867
to the other 19 canisters.

503
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:22,167
Do you mean actually let them
release the Sentox?

504
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,234
Are you out of your mind?!

505
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:25,434
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan.

506
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,234
I had the same initial reaction.

507
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,167
Then I looked at our
updated scenarios.

508
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:30,733
With the help of other
terrorist organizations,

509
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,301
the remaining 19 canisters

510
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:36,167
could be deployed at other, more
crowded public areas, such as

511
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:40,101
subway stations, hospitals
and sports arenas, sir.

512
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,401
The loss of life could exceed

513
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:43,800
hundreds of thousands of people.

514
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,134
My God.

515
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,967
Bring it over here.

516
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,468
LOGAN:
What kind of casualties

517
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,967
are you predicting at the mall?

518
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,301
We don't have exact numbers, but
based on our video surveillance,

519
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,000
our best guess is between
eight and nine hundred.

520
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:18,201
Sir, many of them are children.

521
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,834
Can't you evacuate the mall?

522
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,834
Not without
the terrorists knowing.

523
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,034
The public will not tolerate the
government's complicity in this.

524
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:28,301
They wouldn't know, sir.

525
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,767
This would be a
covert decision.

526
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,434
McGILL:
We have the terrorists
under surveillance.

527
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,867
Even if they kill Bauer,

528
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,867
we will be able to track them
back to the remaining canisters.

529
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:47,834
What's your recommendation?

530
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,234
Bill Buchanan and I agree

531
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:52,101
that the greatest good would
be served by allowing them

532
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,900
to release this single canister
of Sentox nerve gas.

533
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:57,633
And I believe, sir,
that we have no right

534
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,267
to sanction the deaths
of innocent people.

535
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,900
We should take our chances,
interrogate these men,

536
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,600
and find the location
of the other canisters.

537
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,334
Are we ready?

538
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,067
Almost.

539
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:16,900
Mr. President,
we're running out of time.

540
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,034
We need your decision, sir.

541
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,700
This is a field operation.

542
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,434
It's up to you.

543
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,934
With all due respect,
Mr. President, it's not.

544
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
We don't have
the legal authority

545
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,434
to make this decision,
only you do.

546
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:34,600
You're putting me
in a terrible position.

547
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,900
Hold on.

548
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,900
Mike?

549
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:43,633
CTU has laid out the facts well.

550
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,434
But you have to make the call.

551
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,267
All right.

552
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,401
The terrorists are forcing us
to make a tragic choice.

553
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:01,301
I'll go along
with your assessment.

554
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:03,568
Let them release the Sentox.

555
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,267
But you better find
those other canisters

556
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:08,401
or those people
will have died in vain.

557
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,301
( dial tone )

558
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:14,434
Pull our TAC teams
out of the mall.

559
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,301
Jack, you heard
the president's decision.

560
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,134
Let's go.

561
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,468
Put your masks on.

562
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,534
Go and arm the valve.

563
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,667
What's the unlock code?

564
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:35,267
Jack, the unlock code
is alpha-kilo-charlie.

565
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:38,867
I repeat, alpha-kilo-charlie.

566
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:40,034
Come on!

567
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,700
What's the unlock code?!

568
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:46,101
Alpha-kilo-charlie.

569
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,501
Echo-bravo-charlie.

570
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,534
McGILL:
Enter the correct code, Jack.

571
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,568
That's an order.

572
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,900
Jack, this is a direct order
from the president!

573
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,867
Now enter the correct code,
let them release the gas! Now!

574
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,800
It's not arming the canister.

575
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:08,867
Why isn't it working?

576
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,800
Maybe the remote's been damaged.

577
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,767
Make it work or I'll kill you.

578
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,167
There's nothing I can do.

579
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,234
Make it work!

580
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,167
I told you there's
nothing I can do!

581
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,934
Jack, can you hear me?

582
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,967
Yes?

583
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,633
We can't arm the canisters!

584
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,167
What is the problem?

585
00:27:38,234 --> 00:27:40,167
Rossler says he doesn't know.

586
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:41,134
Do you believe him?

587
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,201
I don't know.

588
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,267
Should I kill him?

589
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,700
Not until we are sure we have
another way to release the gas.

590
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,000
Andrei thinks

591
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,000
he's discovered an alternative.

592
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,267
I'll put him on.

593
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,367
Get him in the other room.

594
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,167
Polakov.

595
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:26,867
What's going on?

596
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,434
Andrei thinks he may have
another way to release the gas.

597
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,401
Now move the jumper over.

598
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:04,434
Expose the red and yellow wire.

599
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:10,100
Hang on, I'm gonna
put you on speakerphone.

600
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,467
POLAKOV:
Are you sure the valve
can't open without warning?

601
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,201
ANDREI:
If you make a mistake, it could,

602
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:16,833
so pay attention.

603
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,800
Five more splices to go.

604
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,201
Get the masks.
We're almost ready.

605
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,067
Lynn, there is still time
to move in and stop them

606
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,367
before they murder
all those people.

607
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,100
Audrey, we have a directive
from the president.

608
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,634
The president's not looking
at these children

609
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,267
whose death warrant
he just signed.

610
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,000
Don't you realize how many
more people could die

611
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,067
if these men don't lead us
to the other 19 canisters?

612
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,234
They could.

613
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:01,733
That's theoretical right now.

614
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,167
Those children will die
within minutes!

615
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,034
Look at them.
Look at the monitors!

616
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,434
Audrey, that's enough.

617
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,934
No, it's not. Lynn, you tell me,
if you were in Jack's shoes,

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,668
could you follow
through with that order,

619
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,800
stand by and watch as they
murder all those people?

620
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:12,800
This is war.

621
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,100
There are going
to be casualties.

622
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,334
And if those are orders
of the president, yes!

623
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:18,967
I would have to.

624
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,000
I hope that's not true.

625
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,568
For your sake.

626
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,668
POLAKOV:
Got two more wires to go.

627
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,201
All right,
the wires are together.

628
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,301
ANDREI:
Put your mask on.

629
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,434
Next pair you splice
will open the valve.

630
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,167
Go kill Rossler.

631
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:14,733
Polakov.

632
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,668
Are you there?

633
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,301
McGILL:
Jack, can you hear me?

634
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,634
( gas escaping )

635
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,833
What's happening, Jack?

636
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,267
What's your status?

637
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,967
I've managed to stop
the flow of gas,

638
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,401
but some got
into the air system.

639
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,234
We need to evacuate
the mall, now.

640
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,568
What about the terrorists?

641
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:05,867
One's dead, one escaped.

642
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:08,534
Have Curtis and his men
start looking for them.

643
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:09,767
Curtis, this is Buchanan.

644
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,700
Move in, now.
About time. Move in!

645
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,800
Move in! All teams, move in!

646
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,367
Hey.

647
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:19,534
I'm a federal agent.

648
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,668
Terrorists have released
a toxic substance

649
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:21,767
into the air system.

650
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,401
You need to evacuate
people now.

651
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:25,467
This is not a joke.

652
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,568
This is not a robbery

653
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:28,367
or a drill--
do it now!

654
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:29,601
Uh, we have a red alert.

655
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:31,534
Begin evacuation procedures
immediately!

656
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,401
Where is the power source
for the air system?

657
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,668
It's next to the food court.

658
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:35,900
The control room door's
right there.

659
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,900
Get everybody out now!

660
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,833
MAN: ( over PA system ):
Proceed to the nearest mall exit
in an orderly fashion.

661
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,800
A mall evacuation
is in progress.

662
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,434
I repeat: the mall

663
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:45,867
is being evacuated.

664
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:48,234
Everyone inside the building
must proceed

665
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,900
to the nearest exit as quickly
and as safely as possible.

666
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,434
Curtis, do you copy?

667
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,234
Yeah, Jack, we're
closing in on the mall.

668
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm going to try and shut down
the air system in the mall.

669
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:59,000
I do not have a visual
on the hostile.

670
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:01,301
Make sure your men
take him alive.

671
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,967
Understood.

672
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:06,000
Attention: will everyone
please proceed
( patrons screaming )

673
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,467
to the nearest mall exit
in an orderly fashion.

674
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:10,700
A mall evacuation
is in progress.

675
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:14,334
I repeat,
the mall is being evacuated.

676
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:18,134
Everyone inside the building
must proceed to the nearest exit

677
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:22,467
as quickly and as safely
as possible.

678
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,700
( loud screaming )

679
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,867
( gunshot )

680
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:58,634
Curtis, it's Jack.

681
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,534
The Sentox that escaped
has managed to stay

682
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,634
in the food court.

683
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,800
We've got at least
11 people down.

684
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,000
I need assistance.

685
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,800
I need assistance now!

686
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,867
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

687
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,534
I want you
to hold the mask.

688
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:13,634
when I take it off, okay?

689
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,568
Okay.

690
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,833
Here you go.

691
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,634
All right, everyone, masks on.

692
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,833
Inject anyone who's down.

693
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,467
Get them outside
as soon as possible.

694
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:32,067
I need a shot of atropine
for a child under 12!

695
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:33,867
Curtis, give me that
jacket for her head.

696
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,401
I'm losing her!

697
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:51,800
Come on.

698
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,267
She's responding.

699
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,034
Her pulse is stabilizing.

700
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
BUCHANAN ( over telephone ):
Jack, we've secured the exits.

701
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,934
We don't have a visual
on the other terrorist.

702
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,201
If he got out
of the mall

703
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,401
before we locked down,
he may be lost.

704
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,733
And our only remaining chance
of finding Erwich.

705
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,367
Monitor the tracking device
in the remote trigger.

706
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:11,434
The hostile that escaped
still had it on him.

707
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:13,833
Chloe.

708
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,367
Jack's right:
the signal's moving

709
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:18,534
away from the mall;
looks like he's on foot.

710
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,733
Michaels.

711
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,234
Jack and I are going
after the remote trigger.

712
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,267
You're in charge here. Report
directly to Bill Buchanan.

713
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:24,568
Walsh, gather
your team.

714
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,967
You're with us.

715
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,467
Don't be scared.

716
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:29,700
You're gonna be all right.

717
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:31,700
This man's going to
take care of you.

718
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,800
Yes.

719
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,268
Rossler--
or whoever he was--

720
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,433
killed Komar
and tried to stop us.

721
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,734
What are you talking about?
Why?

722
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,934
I don't know!

723
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,500
I managed to activate the valve
before I got away.

724
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,901
At least some of the gas
was released in the mall.

725
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:01,967
You sure
you're not being followed?

726
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,034
Yes.

727
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,500
What do you want me to do?

728
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,600
Come back.

729
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:09,533
I'll be there soon.

730
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,533
He's turning left on Reese.

731
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
We're six blocks out.

732
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,067
WOMAN:
Hold on, Mr. McGill.

733
00:37:23,134 --> 00:37:25,500
I'll connect you
to the President.

734
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:26,934
LOGAN:
Yes.

735
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:29,234
Mr. President, I know this is
not what your order stipulated.

736
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:30,634
That's why I thought
it was important

737
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,101
to let you know
what was happening.

738
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,667
What's happening is
I sent you over there

739
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,067
to make sure CTU
was running smoothly

740
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,834
in a time of crisis,

741
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,834
and you seem to be
incapable doing that.

742
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:40,467
Sir, Bauer refused
the order.

743
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:41,834
There was nothing
I could do.

744
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:42,867
No. I don't want
excuses.

745
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:44,301
Just do your job.

746
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:47,034
And if you can't do it,
I'll find somebody else who can.

747
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,967
The estimates from the mall
are much lower

748
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,600
than we originally
anticipated.

749
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,101
It appears the fatalities
will be limited

750
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,001
to between ten
and 20 people.

751
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,234
Thank God.

752
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,867
So, what are we telling
the media?

753
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,433
Nothing yet.

754
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,467
CTU is maintaining a blackout
on the ground there

755
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,467
until we give them direction
on a cover story.

756
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,067
What about the other
19 canisters?

757
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:11,368
CTU has a terrorist

758
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,034
under surveillance
as we speak.

759
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,467
They believe there's
a good chance

760
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,567
he'll lead
them to Erwich

761
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:17,867
and the rest of the canisters.

762
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:20,268
All right, good.

763
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:22,301
There's something else, sir.

764
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:26,234
Suzanne Cummings has arrived
to claim Walt's body.

765
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,734
Martha is on her way
to speak with her now.

766
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,400
Thank you, Mike.

767
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,667
Suzanne.

768
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,467
Hi, honey.

769
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,400
( softly ):
I can't believe he's gone.

770
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:19,301
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:22,500
I'm so, so sorry.

772
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:26,034
I should have been
with him today.

773
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,500
I wanted to be.

774
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:28,867
Honey, don't,
don't do that.

775
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:29,934
Don't blame yourself.

776
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,334
( sobbing )

777
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,934
You know how much
we love you, honey.

778
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,368
And no matter what you need,

779
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:46,268
we'll always be
here for you.

780
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:49,433
I just don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

781
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:53,500
You were with him today.

782
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,567
Why, Martha,
why in the world

783
00:39:56,634 --> 00:40:00,867
would... Walt do this?

784
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:08,301
Suzanne...

785
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:12,934
Walt...

786
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:17,268
loved this country.

787
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,934
And he loved you.

788
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,934
( sniffles )

789
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,767
( sighs )
I'm sorry.

790
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:37,134
I think I need a moment.

791
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,301
Of course.

792
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:41,467
All right.

793
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:45,600
( Suzanne sobbing )

794
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,600
( tires screeching )

795
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,368
He's slowing down.

796
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:13,600
He's stopping.

797
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,634
Cross-referencing
with the street grid.

798
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,600
He's in front
of 1136 East Muldauer.

799
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:20,234
Bill, we're going to have
to hit him hard and fast,

800
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,433
to try and stop him
from releasing any more Sentox

801
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
from the canisters.

802
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,567
Agreed.

803
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,067
Set up a perimeter

804
00:41:28,134 --> 00:41:29,400
and begin your approach.

805
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,400
All right, teams,
we're moving in.

806
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:33,368
Put your gas masks on.

807
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:07,500
( panting )

808
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,500
Team B, take the front entrance
off the street.

809
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,067
We're taking the side.
Go now. Go.

810
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,368
( phone ringing )

811
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,667
Yes.

812
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:19,500
You were followed.

813
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:20,834
I don't know how.

814
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,500
It doesn't matter.

815
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,001
You know what to do.

816
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:26,400
Yes.

817
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:30,567
( gunshot )
No!

818
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,301
JACK:
Hostile down! I repeat!

819
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:35,201
Hostile down!

820
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,134
Erwich's gone!

821
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:40,533
Curtis, have your men
call in now.

822
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,667
Team A, Team B, report.

823
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,533
Come on, guys.
What do you got?

824
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:48,667
Place is empty.

825
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,001
Erwich is gone.
The canisters are gone.

826
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,667
We've got nothing here!

827
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:54,433
Damn it!

830
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:00,000
