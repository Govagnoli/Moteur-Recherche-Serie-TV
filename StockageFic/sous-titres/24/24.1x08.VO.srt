1
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,166
Right now, terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,721
My teenage daughter is missing.

3
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,283
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,163
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:30,928
Today is going to be
the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:37,362
You need to
come out with the storyyourself.

7
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,490
My son was involved in another man's death.

8
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:44,290
- At this breakfast I'll tell our side of the story.
- "Our" side?

9
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:47,809
Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out
and spin it the wrong way.

10
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:51,408
- Rick, help me get out of here.
- How?

11
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:55,042
- This place is like a prison.
- People break out of prison all the time.

12
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,089
Bauer's wife knows you're not York.

13
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:01,644
Someone took my daughter. This man
knows where she is. What are you doing?

14
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,203
- Oh, God! No!
- Put her in the car.

15
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,764
- That's my mom.
- We gotta go!

16
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:13,368
- I can't just leave her there.
- Where's my daughter?!

17
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:18,122
- What do you want me to do?
- Replace the key card we gave you

18
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:20,852
with the one your people
are trying to decrypt.

19
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,403
- Where's the key card, Jack?
- Take care of this, Jack.

20
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:28,247
Kimberly's dead if you don't do it!
Shoot her, Jack! Shoot her!

21
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,561
Why'd he give her a flak jacket?

22
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:31,331
It is 7am on the West Coast and
the California primary is officially under way.

23
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:34,723
We're here outside the San Clarita
power plant in Los Angeles,

24
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:38,249
where Senator David Palmer will be
addressing local labour leaders

25
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,121
and members of the state energy council.
The senator pledged his support...

26
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,969
- Yeah?
- Bauer's on his way. You in yet?

27
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,568
- Just about.
- Good.

28
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:57,525
This promises to be a landmark
day, as it's expected that Senator Palmer

29
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:02,448
will get the delegates he needs to become the
firstAfrican-American presidential candidate

30
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,603
ofa major political party.

31
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:09,767
Ofthe eleven states looking for delegates
today, California is expected to be crucial.

32
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:15,371
And most ofthe polls say that
David Palmer will win by a decisive margin.

33
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,328
Have you decided?

34
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,842
I've rewritten the speech
I was gonna give this morning.

35
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,242
I'm gonna tell them about Keith.

36
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:37,571
- What are you gonna say?
- The truth.

37
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:42,169
That seven years ago he was
involved in an accidental death.

38
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:46,451
I need you to stand by me, Sherry.
It's the only way to protect Keith.

39
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:58,932
I will never forgive you
if something bad happens to my son.

40
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:02,088
He's my son too.

41
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,842
And we'll get through this.

42
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,605
I hope so, David.

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,403
Hey, Mom.

44
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,326
Good morning, honey. Where's your sister?

45
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:20,291
- She changed her mind. She's not going.
- Really?

46
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,648
She went to pick up
Suzy and Rachel instead.

47
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:26,687
Oh, that's right, the Brenner girls are flying in.

48
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,243
So, uh, what's gonna happen this morning?

49
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,483
We have to put this thing behind us, Keith.

50
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:37,010
Oh, by me being in prison and you in the
Oval Office? That how we put it behind us?

51
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,649
You're not going to prison.
You didn't do anything wrong.

52
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:45,488
- That's not how a jury will see it.
- Just have a little faith in the system.

53
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:48,087
What's this fairy tale that you're living in?

54
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:52,052
Look, the world's gonna believe that
I killed a white kid who raped my sister.

55
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,567
You think anyone will
believe it was an accident?

56
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,211
- Yes, I do.
- Then you're a fool.

57
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,853
- Keith, no...
- No, that's all right.

58
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,406
You talk about fairy tales.
You think you can run from this?

59
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,927
You think it's gonna make things better?

60
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:11,406
I'm not running anywhere. I'd just rather not
spend my last hour of freedom with you.

61
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,241
Let's go and get this over with.

62
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,002
- Martin Belkin?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:27,881
Hi. I'm Jessica Abrams,
I work for Senator Palmer.

64
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:30,487
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you. Can I help you...?

65
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:33,724
- I got it.
- OK. Great. Follow me.

66
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:36,930
- Is the senator here yet?
- Not yet, but he is on his way.

67
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:39,527
- Great.
- I am a huge fan of your work.

68
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:42,332
- Thank you.
- Right this way, please.

69
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:48,284
Hi. I'm going to be taking
some photographs of the senator.

70
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:58,405
I need a check on a Belkin. B-e-I-k-i-n.

71
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,848
First name Martin.

72
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:09,368
- Clear on Belkin.
- All right, copy that. Thank you.

73
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,727
You can go in.

74
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,764
Turn right at the light.

75
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:46,252
- You see the bus stop on your left?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,484
Pull over to it.

77
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,964
Hey, Jack.

78
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,244
Howyou doing?

79
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:19,603
- Don't touch it until I tell you to. Now go.
- Not until I can talk to my wife and daughter.

80
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:24,244
Oh, you'll do this, because it really isn't an
inconvenience for me to hurt your daughter.

81
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,643
Or your wife, for that matter.
In fact, here she is.

82
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,805
Would you like to speak to your husband?

83
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:33,771
Say anything you want.
Tell him you love him.

84
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:36,681
- Jack?
- Teri!

85
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,446
I don't know where I am.
I haven't seen Kimberly or...

86
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,605
You were saying, Jack?
You're not sure you want to do this?

87
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:49,566
That's what I thought. San Clarita power
station, 417 Ridgeway Road. Go there now.

88
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:03,807
This is temporary, Mrs Bauer. If Jack follows
instructions you'll be free within the hour.

89
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,691
- Where's my daughter?
- She's here and she's safe.

90
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,521
Would you take me to her, please?

91
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:53,526
- Hey.
- What, Milo?

92
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,683
- What happened to Nina?
- She got called out.

93
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:59,368
So what do I do about this key card?
This was supposed to be important.

94
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,445
They brought me in on highest priority
and I'm sitting around.

95
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,651
I think Nina got some new intel that
pre-empts this. That's why she had to run out.

96
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,930
- So what should I do?
- Why don't you help me format some files?

97
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:14,404
They didn't bring me here
at five in the morning to format files!

98
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,367
Does Milo know he's working
on the wrong key card?

99
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,082
Is this gonna be a problem?

100
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,927
Nina Myers is dead. Make up
a story for why she's not there.

101
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,884
- Mom!
- Kimberly!

102
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,602
It's OK. It's OK, honey.

103
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,843
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know.

104
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:17,132
- Does he know we're in trouble?
- Yeah, he does.

105
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,171
He's doing everything he can, baby.

106
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:24,929
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's not your fault.

107
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,164
It's not your fault, honey.

108
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,212
Why don't you tell me about these boys?

109
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,887
I met them through Janet, and...

110
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:44,761
she started dating this guy, Dan,
and his friend Rick came into town,

111
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,242
and we just hang out, and... oh, God.

112
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:52,771
- Have they kept you here the whole time?
- Yes.

113
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,401
Janet was hit by a car.

114
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,208
- I know.
- You do?

115
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:15,448
We are gonna get through this, I promise you.

116
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,609
Hello?

117
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,402
Come on, Jamey, pick up.

118
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,047
- Almeida.
- Tony.

119
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:39,330
- Nina, where you been?
- I can't get into it.

120
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:42,371
Well, force yourself. Where are you?

121
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,683
Just east of downtown.

122
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:49,369
- What are you doing there?
- Tony, you have to listen to me carefully.

123
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,490
No one at CTU can know I'm alive.

124
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:56,088
- Who would think you were dead?
- I can't tell you any more right now.

125
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,165
- Where's Jamey?
- She's working with Milo.

126
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:02,131
- Get her for me.
- No, not till you tell me what's going on.

127
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:03,885
Please, Tony, this is an order.

128
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,887
- I needyour help.
- All right.

129
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:19,128
Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer -
this is a giant waste of time.

130
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:22,888
- When is Nina coming back?
- Probably not for a couple of hours.

131
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,328
What makes you say that?

132
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:28,849
- I just talked to her.
- When?

133
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:33,927
Couple of minutes ago. She's at Division.
It's possible she'll be there all day.

134
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,928
What do you need?

135
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,724
Never mind.

136
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:46,282
Look, if somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on, I'm going to Chapelle.

137
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:48,443
I told you, I have to speak to Jamey.

138
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:53,163
Yeah, and I just heard her tell Milo you were
at Division and you might be there all day.

139
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,925
- Oh, my God.
- What?

140
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:58,483
- Who did she hear that from?
- She said she just talked to you.

141
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,969
- Nina, what is going on?
- We can't trust Jamey.

142
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:07,207
- Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.
- Are you saying Jamey's a spy?

143
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:10,251
Why else would she lie?
She must think I'm dead.

144
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:14,804
- Why would she think that?
- I'll explain later. You have to bring me in.

145
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,924
OK. I'll come get you.

146
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:19,766
No. Stay there. Act as ifeverything's all right.

147
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:24,251
Jack behaved very strangely when he was
at CTU. These people must be watching us.

148
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,245
I dunno, probably through
our own surveillance.

149
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,723
All right, look, I'll send a car.
What's your address?

150
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:56,363
- Good morning.
- Mrs Palmer.

151
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,728
How are you?

152
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,608
How you doing today?

153
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,208
Allyou have to do now,
Jack, is get through security.

154
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,810
Jack Bauer, CTU. I've been
cleared by Frank Simes.

155
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,207
All right, I'll need you to open the case.

156
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,284
Sure.

157
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:12,809
What do you need a laptop for?

158
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:17,842
Everything we compiled on Palmer
over the last eight hours is in there.

159
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,572
All right, you wanna lift that up, please?

160
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,043
Turn it on.

161
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,601
Just press any two buttons, Jack.

162
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,002
- All right, go ahead.
- Thank you.

163
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,407
Thank you. Where is Senator Palmer now?

164
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,484
- He's on his way up.
- Good.

165
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,284
Excuse me.

166
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,251
Jack Bauer?

167
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,731
Jessica Abrams?

168
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:16,567
Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here?

169
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:20,009
- I'm working security.
- Wow. How many years has it been, huh?

170
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:23,927
- Since high school?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, I've got to get going.

171
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:26,083
Hey, are you still racing motorcycles?

172
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,290
- Keep moving, Jack.
- Not since my daughter was born.

173
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:33,013
Look, I'd like to catch up later.
I've just gotta go.

174
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,129
- Great, I'll be here.
- OK.

175
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:43,251
- What do I do now?
- Hand the briefcase to one of our people.

176
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,801
- Who?
- I'll tell you when it's time.

177
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,971
Go wait by the buffet table.

178
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,969
Now our election coverage
shifts to the polls.

179
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,011
Back east we've had some
interesting developments...

180
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,442
- Senator, I'd like you to meet Martin Belkin.
- Senator.

181
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:55,526
Good you could make it, Martin.
Jessica says you're the best.

182
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,482
I look forward to working with you.

183
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,924
You're so tired.

184
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,324
Oh. Hi.

185
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,087
I brought you some breakfast.

186
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,563
- Is Kim OK?
- Who are you?

187
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:09,202
- Rick.
- You're the one who kidnapped my daughter.

188
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:12,012
- I didn't know.
- How could you not know?

189
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,765
Hey! I tried to help her get out...

190
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:16,890
Gaines wants to go over some stuff with us.

191
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:21,401
- What's goin' on here, Rick?
- Nothin'.

192
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,049
- Don't make friends.
- I wasn't.

193
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,647
- Good. They won't be around much longer.
- What?

194
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,724
Move it.

195
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,928
OK, time to move, Jack.
Let's head across the floor.

196
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:46,764
Excuse me.

197
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,252
Excuse me.

198
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:54,128
OK, Jack, head towards the south wall.

199
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,129
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Jess.

200
00:21:57,213 --> 00:22:01,126
Hey, do you remember Tracy Zigler?

201
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,443
Yeah. Yeah, I just saw her last winter.

202
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:07,287
Well, we keep in touch,
and she said you and Teri got divorced.

203
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:12,328
- Get out ofthere, Jack.
- No, we... We just got separated.

204
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,052
Jared, take care of this.

205
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:24,368
Look, if you ever wanted to get in touch,
you can reach me at this number here...

206
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:28,691
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

207
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,764
- I am so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

208
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:32,491
- You sure?
- Yes.

209
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:43,086
He's heading across now.

210
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:47,845
Take a left in front ofthe turbines, Jack.

211
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:57,128
Show him your ID.

212
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:59,010
Jack Bauer, CTU.

213
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,084
That's my boy.

214
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:06,204
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

215
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,084
Go to the end.

216
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:22,972
On your left is medical station three.

217
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:35,523
- I'm here.
- That's where I wantyou. Go in and wait.

218
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:03,968
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- I'm OK.

219
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,808
You don't look OK.

220
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:14,811
- Is it safe to come in here?
- Yeah, I looped the cameras.

221
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:16,884
They can't see us.

222
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,849
- Why is Jack doing all this?
- They've kidnapped his wife and daughter.

223
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,606
- How long have you known this?
- Not long.

224
00:24:25,693 --> 00:24:29,083
- And you chose not to tell me?
- That's right. I was acting on orders.

225
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:32,165
- Screw orders!
- Shh. Tony, I'm sorry.

226
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,965
- Where's Jamey?
- She's still working with Milo.

227
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:40,328
So what do you wanna do? Do you
wanna restrain her, call in Division?

228
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,369
No, we can't call anyone yet.

229
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,648
- We gotta do something.
- I know.

230
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:49,045
This thing must be about Palmer. They're
using Jack to, what, stop the investigation?

231
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,612
Maybe.

232
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:53,161
Hang on. We gotta do something.

233
00:24:55,653 --> 00:25:00,329
- Are you sure this room is dark?
- Yeah, I checked the log. No active cameras.

234
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,724
We should call Secret Service.

235
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:07,249
If we do, the people holding Teri and Kim
will think Jack gave the order.

236
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:11,087
I hate to say it, but it's not our problem.
We have one mandate - protect Palmer.

237
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:13,528
- We gotta make the call now.
- Wait!

238
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,363
Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger.

239
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:18,967
Let's try to find out more
before we do anything.

240
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:22,363
Are you giving me an order
not to call Secret Service?

241
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:27,844
No, you're right.

242
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,211
Hey, this is Tony. Get me
Agent Pierce's number, please.

243
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:58,844
Assemble it.

244
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,812
You want my prints on this weapon.

245
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:47,204
Do you really think that anybody's
going to believe that I shot David Palmer?

246
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,050
You better put that away.
Somebody might get hurt.

247
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:32,968
We're watching Senator Palmer work the
room a little bit before he gets to the speech...

248
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,808
Milo, come here.

249
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:44,763
- You were right.
- About what?

250
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:48,212
The key card. It was a forgery.
We found the original.

251
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,602
- Where?
- Jack's office.

252
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:52,888
- Why did he swap it out?
- Doesn't matter.

253
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:56,204
Look, I sent it down to Archiving
to make a backup of all the data.

254
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:59,444
Then it's going straight to you.
You'll have to work quickly.

255
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,524
Just get it to me.

256
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,932
A forged key card. What's that about?

257
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,371
I have no idea.

258
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:22,969
She's squirming.

259
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:29,971
- Almeida.
- This is Pierce from Secret Service.

260
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:33,841
Aaron, I calledyou because we have
new information you should know about.

261
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:38,285
- One of our agents, Jack Bauer, may be there.
- Yeah, he's here. I cleared him.

262
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:41,729
Well, we learned that
he may have been compromised.

263
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,121
- He may not be acting to protect the senator.
- Are you saying he's a threat?

264
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:49,606
Yeah.

265
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,048
Take the appropriate actions.

266
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,124
She's on the move.

267
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,811
OK, ladies' rest room. Second-to-last stall.

268
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,566
- These cameras are on a 20-second loop.
- Am I clear?

269
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:13,889
No, not yet.

270
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:29,172
Go. You got 20 seconds.

271
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,490
Get out. Now.

272
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:41,165
Get out!

273
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,847
Get out! Out! Go!

274
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:02,572
I gotta keep you guys working. The fatter
your pay cheque, the more tax you can afford.

275
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,242
Excuse me, guys.

276
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,086
- What's up?
- I just got a call from CTU.

277
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:12,403
- We need to get you out of here, sir.
- Why?

278
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:16,248
- There's a problem with one of their agents.
- What kind of problem?

279
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,006
He could be a threat to you.

280
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:22,210
If he's one of ours, find him
and take care of this quietly.

281
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,363
We are trying, sir.

282
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:29,928
I tell you what. I'll lose the
face time, but the speech stays.

283
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:34,325
- There's something I have to say.
- With all due respect, it's a mistake, sir.

284
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:38,406
This information comes
directly from CTU headquarters.

285
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,406
I am sure your people will take care of us.

286
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:53,690
All right, everyone on the floor,
listen up. This is Pierce.

287
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:58,483
Palmer has decided to proceed.
I repeat, Palmer will remain.

288
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:01,406
We need to locate and detain a suspect.

289
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,768
His name is Jack Bauer.

290
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:08,131
Bauer's 5'11", blond hair, 160 pounds.

291
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:10,090
He is wearing a dark...

292
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:13,483
brown jacket that may display CTU ID.

293
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:17,009
This is Hayes. Possible 20 on Bauer.
How would you like me to proceed?

294
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,005
- Hold your position. I'll be right there.
- Copy.

295
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:32,168
Hi, Jamey.

296
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,808
What's this all about?

297
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:39,090
- Why don't you tell us?
- I've no idea what you're talking about.

298
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:42,927
- Who were you going to contact?
- None of your business. It was personal.

299
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:45,447
The same people who set me up to be killed?

300
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:49,287
- To be killed? What are you talking about?
- We don't have time for this.

301
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:53,127
Talk to us, Jamey. Who's got
Jack's wife and daughter?

302
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:56,125
- What are they making Jack do?
- I don't know!

303
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:59,366
Richard Walsh is dead. So is Scott Baylor.

304
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:04,573
You will be charged with murder and treason.
I suggest you tell me what's going on!

305
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,449
- They told me nobody would get hurt.
- Who are "they"?

306
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:12,208
- I can't tell you.
- Telling us everything is the only way out!

307
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,284
You understand?

308
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:20,529
I was just supposed to tap into the
surveillance. All the security cameras.

309
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:23,207
Then they asked me
to start sending messages.

310
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,404
What messages?

311
00:32:25,493 --> 00:32:27,484
What messages?!

312
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,324
Mostly about Jack.

313
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:39,163
Then about the key card. I didn't know this
was gonna happen. You have to believe that.

314
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:42,723
OK, fine. We do. But now you have to help us.

315
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,849
Who were you doing all this for?

316
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:51,205
- No. I have to talk to someone first.
- What? No! There is no time, Jamey!

317
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:57,084
Palmer is exposed. Jack's family is in danger.
You have to start talking to us. Now!

318
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:04,368
All right, look, I'll make sure everything you
tell us goes into cutting you a deal, OK?

319
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:11,561
No, I'm not saying anything.
Not until I get agency counsel.

320
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,248
Sit.

321
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:43,169
As Mayor ofLos Angeles, I often get the
opportunity to meet truly remarkable people.

322
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:47,724
People that strive for the greater good,
that work to make our world a better place.

323
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:53,092
One ofthose people is here today, and
"remarkable" only begins to describe him.

324
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:57,325
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president
ofthe United States, and my good friend,

325
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:59,210
David Palmer.

326
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,243
I love you, Kimberly. You know that?

327
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:27,444
Yeah.

328
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,364
Good.

329
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:35,211
It's important that you know that.

330
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,805
Mom, if you're feeling guilty
about our fight yesterday...

331
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:42,282
I'm over it. I just wanna get home.

332
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:46,889
That's not why I'm saying that.
It's just... we're stuck in this awful place

333
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:49,965
and I just want you to know
that you're not alone.

334
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,284
Mom, you're scaring me.

335
00:34:57,173 --> 00:35:00,722
It's like you're saying this cos you
know something bad's gonna happen.

336
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:02,804
No, no, no, no.

337
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,124
It's just...

338
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:15,083
I'm trying to explain to you what a simple,
powerful thing my love for you is.

339
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:22,087
So no matter how bad things get, or how
good they get, that's not gonna change.

340
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:28,246
I just don't know how
to do anything but love you.

341
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,291
Thank you. Thank you very much.

342
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:54,771
Thank you.

343
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:57,562
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

344
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:02,562
Thank you, Mayor Nelson.

345
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:06,089
And thank you, kind citizens of Los Angeles.

346
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:13,250
Identification, please.

347
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:18,282
Now, this country
depends on a healthy economy in California.

348
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:22,964
And the nucleus of that economy is energy.

349
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,766
Jack, step out.

350
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,124
We're ready foryou.

351
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:31,881
- To do what?
- Relax, it will be over in five minutes.

352
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,484
.. is standing
right here in this room today.

353
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:44,926
Do you see the photographer?

354
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:48,885
- Yeah, I see him.
- Go over andjoin him.

355
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:02,328
After he shoots Palmer,
he will handyou his weapon.

356
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:05,530
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know you'll be tempted to intervene,

357
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:10,812
but you must believe me, if you do, your
family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway.

358
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,162
I understand.

359
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:17,490
When I started my campaign over a year ago,

360
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,406
I made a promise to you who supported me

361
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:28,003
that my campaign would be built on
integrity, commitment, and above all, honour.

362
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,964
Thank you.

363
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,124
Thank you.

364
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:55,923
Agent Bauer?

365
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,732
Alan Hayes, Secret Service.
I need you to come with me.

366
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:02,329
- What's the matter?
- No problem, just come with me.

367
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:09,410
Seven years ago...

368
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:12,529
Gun! Gun!

369
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:20,407
- Get him out!
- Somebody get Sherry!

370
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,611
- Looks like Palmer's being shielded.
- Yeah, but why?

371
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:28,010
Bauer! Bauer, what's happening?
Bauer, did you screw me?!

372
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:30,007
I didn't do this.

373
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:33,324
Do you understand?
Please, don't hurt my family.

374
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,892
Don't hurt my family! I'll help, I promise!

375
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:42,966
- Please! Please!
- That's it, we're done. Kill the wife and kid.

376
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,404
Get outta here!

377
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,722
I don't have time for this.

378
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,087
- Hello?
- What do you want?

379
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,733
Division wanted to pick up
Bauer at the power plant.

380
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:27,652
- They've been looking for him all night.
- Why?

381
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,088
He's been breaking protocol
since you got to him.

382
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:32,733
Dammit!

383
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:43,481
No! Oh, God!

384
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,133
No! No!

385
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:13,044
Gimme your hand.

386
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,288
Please don't!

387
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,922
- Eli?
- Yeah?

388
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,447
I still need 'em alive.

389
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,808
Both of 'em?

390
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,162
Yeah. Take 'em back.

391
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:55,811
No...

392
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,884
No...

393
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:03,486
