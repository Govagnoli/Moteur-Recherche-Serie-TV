3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,698
Without you, Sangala has no leader.

4
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:19,060
These people,
they work for Dubaku, don't they?

5
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,954
<i>Mr. Matobo, we've accessed
the air intake to your safe room.</i>

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,381
<i>We are feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.</i>

7
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:28,027
<i>If you do not open the door,
you will die.</i>

8
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,698
Alama, No!

9
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,285
Get him out of there!
Get the woman, too.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,236
- Mr. Taylor.
- Sam.

11
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,982
I can't stay long. They killed Roger
and made it look like a suicide.

12
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:43,873
Who are they?

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,879
I don't know. They just said
they would kill me if I said anything.

14
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,882
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

15
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:51,509
It's all here.

16
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:55,012
Account numbers, trading records,
everything that he knew.

17
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,807
Roger was looking into things
he shouldn't have.

18
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:01,102
You killed my son.

19
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,481
It's Tetradyzine, sir.

20
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:07,650
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

21
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,284
The situation here is in control.
Are you tracking Ms. Roth?

22
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,783
Get her back to her apartment.

23
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,995
Henry Taylor sent me.

24
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,401
Mr. Taylor's been looking
into the matter you discussed.

25
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:24,333
He believes
you're in imminent danger.

26
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,712
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

27
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:31,390
Larry, it's Renee.

28
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,968
I've got a visual on them loading Matobo
and his wife into a truck.

29
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,137
- Where is SWAT?
- Still about five minutes out.

30
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,221
Drop the gun.

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,672
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

32
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:41,517
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.

33
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,149
Nichols wants her out of the way
before we deliver Matobo.

34
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:48,816
- Kill her.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,376
Turn around.

36
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,987
If you trust me,
I'll get you through this alive.

37
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,259
I want three more teams combing
the site where Matobo was abducted.

38
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,719
Pull them in from regional.
We're going to expand the search.

39
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,154
Coordinate with Metro Police
to set up a point-by-point grid

40
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:21,015
encompassing a ten-mile radius.

41
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,189
I want NSA to back all of this up
with synchronized satellite sweeps.

42
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,687
- I'll do what I can.
- What does that mean?

43
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,274
Every time I ask for something, they
pull their cloak-and-dagger nonsense.

44
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,443
I have to get approval
for every scrap of data.

45
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,660
This isn't easy for anybody.
Just, please, make it happen.

46
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:40,392
We know that another attack
could be imminent.

47
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:43,166
The only way to stop it
is to find Almeida and Bauer

48
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,080
and take control of the CIP device.

49
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:52,366
For those of you who haven't heard,

50
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:56,217
Renee Walker was abducted
by these people.

51
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,515
We're the only chance she's got.

52
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:05,545
So, let's get to work.

53
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,704
What have you got?

54
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,282
Audio forensics
cleaned up the recording.

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,822
<i>Walker is extraneous.</i>

56
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,494
<i>Kill her before you get here.</i>

57
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,685
<i>- Okay, we'll be with you soon.
- Be quick about it.</i>

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,108
<i>Dubaku's anxious to get his hands
on the prime minister.</i>

59
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,678
Been looking for a tag
that will give up their location.

60
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,158
So far, nothing.

61
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:30,783
Is there anybody else
you can put on this?

62
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:33,485
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.
There's nothing here.

63
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,566
All right. Fine.
Help Janis coordinate with NSA.

64
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,158
I'm sorry about Renee, Larry.
She was a good agent.

65
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,947
We don't know that she's dead yet!

66
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,244
All right?

67
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,255
Are you sure this is it?

68
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,525
- She's going to run out of air.
- Tony said near the backhoe.

69
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,047
Here,

70
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,200
I got her, Chloe. I got her.

71
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:26,751
All right, here she is. Here she is.

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,609
She's not breathing.
Give me the adrenaline.

73
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:07,078
It's all right. You're okay.

74
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:08,863
You're okay.

75
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,601
Who are you?

76
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,895
We're working with Jack.

77
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:16,815
He told us where to find you.
It's gonna be okay.

78
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,887
Take deep breaths.

79
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,778
You're gonna be okay.

80
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:32,466
We're close to the rendezvous point.
What's your ETA?

81
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,005
We'll see you then.

82
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,974
It's all set.

83
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,893
Nichols is on his way
with the diamonds.

84
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:00,192
Is something bothering you, Jack?

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,534
No, I was wondering...

86
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,450
why you never told Tony
how you got him out of CTU.

87
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,373
How did you do it?

88
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,277
Christopher Henderson.

89
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,215
Christopher Henderson
tried to kill him.

90
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,092
He had no intention of killing Tony.

91
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,180
He purposely missed the artery
when he injected him.

92
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,580
Enough to slow his heart to the point
where you'd think that he was dead.

93
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:35,010
My job was to...

94
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,272
extract and revive him and...

95
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,959
use him against you.

96
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,235
And?

97
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,527
By the time I stabilized him,
you had already killed Henderson.

98
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,036
Mission had failed.

99
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,089
So, my team went dark.

100
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,913
Why did he just let Tony go?

101
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,592
Tony chose to stay with us.

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,090
He was consumed
with hatred and anger

103
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,944
over what the government
had done to Michelle.

104
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,341
Anyway...

105
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,767
I talked to him.

106
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:20,399
More importantly, I listened to him.

107
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,755
Pretty soon,
we came to realize that...

108
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,490
I was right.

109
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,324
About what?

110
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,424
That the rules had changed.

111
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,507
And there was nothing

112
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,586
such as honor left.

113
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:47,466
That we would have
to take care of each other.

114
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,138
Like brothers.

115
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,203
We're almost there.

116
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,707
How is the deal gonna go down?

117
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:04,441
Don't worry, Jack.
You're about to find out.

118
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,707
Are you ready?

119
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,505
Are you sure?

120
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,570
Go help Litvak with the door.

121
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,446
Go get the Matobos.

122
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,524
You better tell me
what the hell's going on.

123
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,554
Drop the gun.

124
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,644
You know,
I just couldn't figure out your play,

125
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,358
so I tried to give you some time
so you'd come clean,

126
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,615
'cause we are like brothers,
right, Tony?

127
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,272
Put the gun down, David.

128
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,414
You actually think that I would let you
steal those diamonds from me?

129
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,222
It's not about the diamonds.

130
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:33,620
It's about killing innocent people.
I can't let you finish this.

131
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:34,907
Take a shot.

132
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,130
Put down the weapon
or I will kill him.

133
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:39,585
- Tony, take a shot!
- Shut up, Jack!

134
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,581
- Put it down, Tony, or he's dead.
- I don't want to kill you, but I will.

135
00:09:58,021 --> 00:09:59,451
- You okay?
- Yeah.

136
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,113
You say that Bauer and Almeida
are working undercover,

137
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:16,531
but CTU has been shut down,

138
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,666
so, I mean,
if you're telling the truth,

139
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,702
- who's running this operation?
- We are.

140
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,537
We're not working with any agency.

141
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,836
We believe there's been widespread
infiltration of the government

142
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,997
by Dubaku and the Juma regime.

143
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,680
I need to contact my boss.
He needs to know that I'm okay.

144
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:33,987
You can't do that.

145
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:36,718
- Why not?
- Dubaku has informants in the FBI.

146
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,910
If they find out you're alive, they'll
know Jack is working against them.

147
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:44,145
- You don't know who you can trust.
- I can trust Agent Moss.

148
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,375
You're not listening to me.
You cannot contact the FBI.

149
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:50,436
You will jeopardize this operation,
and I won't let you do that.

150
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,165
I don't work for you; I work for Larry.
Now give me a phone.

151
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,662
Sit still, please.

152
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,364
We're nearing the endgame.

153
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,866
Dubaku is the key

154
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,549
to finding out who in the government
has been corrupted.

155
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,789
Luckily, we have something he wants.

156
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,614
Matobo.

157
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,207
He's our best chance to locate Dubaku,
reacquire the CIP module

158
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,352
and get to the bottom
of the government corruption.

159
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,302
Until all that happens,
you have to stay dead.

160
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,808
- Yeah.
<i>- Did you find Agent Walker?</i>

161
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,289
Yeah, we got her. She's fine.

162
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,059
- Where are you?
- Northwoods Airfield.

163
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,728
Litvak is dead, Emerson wounded.

164
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,266
Nichols is on road.
I need you to get over here now.

165
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,170
- Have you talked to Matobo?
- Not yet.

166
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,636
He needs to agree to this.
We can't do it without him.

167
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,363
I'll get him to agree.
Just get over here.

168
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,238
It's all right.

169
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,924
What the hell is going on?

170
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,350
I'm not going to hurt you or your wife.
I know how scared you are

171
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,259
and I know what you've been through,
but we are here to help you.

172
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,257
What in God's name
are you talking about?

173
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:02,721
- You kidnapped us.
- We had to to gain Dubaku's trust.

174
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:06,297
That's the man we're after.
We're trying to stop him.

175
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:08,495
I want to call my people.

176
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,167
I can't let you do that,
not until you hear me out.

177
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,774
We have a plan to stop Dubaku,
but we can't do it without your help.

178
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,167
We don't have much time.

179
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:17,814
Please.

180
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,488
Come with me.

181
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,556
<i>Mr. Dubaku.</i>

182
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,122
I'm heading to the meeting place.
They're bringing Matobo now.

183
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,416
- And his wife?
- Both of them.

184
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:35,185
Once you have Matobo,
you know what to do.

185
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,938
Emerson's team is now a loose end.
Tie it off.

186
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:39,740
Are you sure about this?

187
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,269
We may need their services again.

188
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,846
I would rather keep my diamonds,

189
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:49,142
and Almeida has proved
to be a liability.

190
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:51,754
So.

191
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,564
- Any response from the White House?
- Not the one we wanted.

192
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:58,052
American forces are still
in position.

193
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:00,869
President Taylor must know
we have Matobo.

194
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,906
She can't attack Sangala
without him.

195
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,146
The country will collapse.

196
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,603
Taylor may be holding out hope
that she can somehow retrieve Matobo.

197
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:13,920
Or she doesn't believe
we are willing to carry out our threats.

198
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:17,712
She will only respond
when there are dead Americans.

199
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,374
I'll call you when I have Matobo.
These gentlemen are at your command.

200
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,988
There are still
1,300 planes in the air.

201
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,894
Which region do you want targeted?

202
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,389
Washington, DC.

203
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,376
Yeah.

204
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,165
Yeah.

205
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,671
I understand, Bob.

206
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,257
All right, thanks.

207
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,384
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

208
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,032
They've detected
another firewall breach.

209
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,066
- There's been another attack?
- Not yet,

210
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,900
but they believe
the CIP device is being utilized.

211
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:17,243
We have to assume
Dubaku is initiating another attack.

212
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,153
It's safe to say
this won't be another warning shot.

213
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,444
This time Dubaku's gonna make sure
that people die.

214
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,689
I want to speak personally

215
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:30,577
with all first responders
across the country.

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
They need to know to brace for the worst
and that they have our full support.

217
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,518
Instead of preparing for it,

218
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,120
maybe we should be trying
to preempt this attack,

219
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,629
Madam President.

220
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:42,422
The deadline Dubaku gave us

221
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,695
for withdrawing our troops
from Sangala has passed,

222
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:49,554
but if we made some kind of gesture...
began an immediate pullback,

223
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,191
it might keep Dubaku
from pulling the trigger.

224
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:55,176
We've discussed this, Ethan.
It's not an option.

225
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,680
I won't be dictated to
by this madman.

226
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:01,441
Madam President,
we can't invade Sangala without Matobo,

227
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:05,028
and there's very little chance
of him being recovered.

228
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,949
- Why are we risking American lives?
- I've told you my reasons.

229
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,149
I implore you:

230
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:13,954
withdraw our forces
before it's too late.

231
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,649
You asked me to be your advisor
because you trust my opinion.

232
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,523
I'm giving it to you now.

233
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,922
- We're out of options.
- We're not, Ethan.

234
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,898
The NSA is attempting to localize

235
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:29,690
what part of the infrastructure
is being targeted,

236
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:33,819
and the FBI is still trying
to track down the CIP device.

237
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:40,272
I'll keep an open channel
with both agencies.

238
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,512
- I'll keep you apprised.
- Good.

239
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:58,128
Let me see it. Let me see it!

240
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,495
This wasn't about the diamonds,
David.

241
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,590
You crossed a line
I wasn't willing to cross.

242
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,630
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,406
You're looking for forgiveness...

244
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,975
Go to hell.

245
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:20,752
You...

246
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,248
live with it.

247
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:30,196
You're asking us to risk our lives

248
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,187
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands,

249
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,328
based on nothing
but what you have told us.

250
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,075
All I have told you is the truth.

251
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,947
Dubaku is in this country,
and we need to find him.

252
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:42,233
You have as much at stake as we do.
He's attacked both our countries.

253
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,862
Listen to him, Ule.

254
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:45,718
You told me yourself

255
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,729
President Taylor
will not commit forces to Sangala

256
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:50,892
until these attacks are stopped.

257
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,594
But how can we trust this man?

258
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,389
Because he has no reason to lie.

259
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,608
I will do what you ask,
but I will go alone.

260
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,653
Dubaku wants you and your wife.
That's the deal.

261
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,656
I will not put my wife
in the hands of that monster.

262
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,830
I will be honest with you, sir.
He wants your wife as leverage.

263
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:18,541
If I don't deliver both of you,
he will back out.

264
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,670
Leverage.

265
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:22,448
You mean he wants to torture her
to make me tell him what I know

266
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,044
- about the resistance in Sangala?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,695
And we won't let that happen.
We'll be following you.

268
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,924
Still, you can't promise me
that she won't be harmed, can you?

269
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,527
Can you?

270
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,348
I won't do it.

271
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,143
May I speak with my husband?

272
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,104
Of course, ma'am.

273
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:49,561
- I want to do this, Ule.
- What?

274
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:52,880
I am ashamed that I opened
the door to the safe room.

275
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,116
I want to do what is right
for our country.

276
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,409
Absolutely not.

277
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,147
You can't stop me, Ule.

278
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,569
Sangala is my country, too.

279
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:06,640
I have been by your side
for 22 years.

280
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:09,867
I am not going to leave it now.

281
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:21,648
Mr. Bauer.

282
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,327
We will do this together.

283
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
Thank you.

284
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,968
You are both very brave.

285
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:36,537
We'll need to go soon.
Excuse me for one moment.

286
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,041
Tony.

287
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:51,070
The Matobos are gonna work with us.
We've got to go.

288
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,283
Tony.

289
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:09,147
Let's get the bodies out of sight.

290
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,912
- We're locked onto the FAA node.
- Begin rerouting the targets.

291
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,097
RSA 471,

292
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,093
turn right, heading 274.

293
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,505
Descend
and maintain flight level 270.

294
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:36,564
Call the White House.

295
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,333
The latest report from the NSA.

296
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,755
- I can summarize it for you.
- Go ahead.

297
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,774
They've had no luck
in localizing the firewall breach.

298
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,689
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.

299
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:57,153
What about the FBI?

300
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,659
They've dedicated every available agent
to the manhunt for Matobo.

301
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:05,496
They're no closer to finding him.

302
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,621
Excuse me.

303
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,656
We're at a dead end,
Madam President.

304
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,213
You need to order the pullback,
and you need to order it now.

305
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:16,631
Can it be traced?

306
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:19,922
Hold on.

307
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:22,255
- Madam President.
- What is it, Tim?

308
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,264
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

309
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,383
It's from Colonel Dubaku.

310
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,309
He's demanding to speak with you.

311
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:34,023
I'll take it.

312
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,139
This is President Taylor.

313
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:42,559
Madam President...

314
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,202
I'm disappointed that you have not
taken my demands seriously.

315
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,706
Your forces are still in position
near my country.

316
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,701
Colonel Dubaku, I assure you,

317
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:55,031
we've had very serious discussions
regarding your demands.

318
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,154
The time for discussions is over.

319
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:02,283
<i>The deadline for your forces
to begin their withdrawal has passed.</i>

320
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:04,554
<i>Go to the window.</i>

321
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,992
<i>Look to the southwest,
Madam President.</i>

322
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:08,869
What?

323
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:10,874
<i>See what you have done.</i>

324
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,915
Colonel Dubaku, if you're endangering
one American life...

325
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:16,409
Oh, my God.

326
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,530
<i>Go, Madam President.</i>

327
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,663
You son of a bitch.

328
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,293
Comply with my demands
within the hour,

329
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:36,429
or 10,000 more Americans will die.

330
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,469
Is the Cabinet still assembled?

331
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,118
Yes, Madam President.

332
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:45,720
It was Flight 131 out of Chicago.
240 passengers, ten crew members.

333
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:49,072
They collided with a small commuter jet
carrying 21 people.

334
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:52,412
There's also a high probability
of casualties on the ground.

335
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:56,295
The aircraft went down in a residential
neighborhood near Edgeborough.

336
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,375
Thank you.

337
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:09,512
We've also just gotten word
that Congressman Brighten and his wife

338
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,950
may have been on 131.
We're waiting for confirmation.

339
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:14,062
How many planes
are still in the air?

340
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,272
Over 1,300.

341
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,729
Madam President.

342
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,720
This is a catastrophic loss of American
lives, and it's only going to get worse.

343
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,066
We have to withdraw our forces
before the next deadline.

344
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:25,194
I'm forced to agree,
Madam President.

345
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,328
Go ahead, Tim.
I want to hear what you think.

346
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:37,224
We're simply not prepared to contend

347
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,338
with the scope of damage
these people can inflict.

348
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,511
The tragedy we've just witnessed
is nothing compared to what could happen

349
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,093
if they begin targeting
more sensitive installations:

350
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,122
power grids, nuclear facilities.

351
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,760
We're talking deaths
in the hundreds of thousands.

352
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:55,333
All in support of a policy that cannot
possibly succeed without Matobo.

353
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,251
He's the only man
who can stabilize Sangala.

354
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,726
Without him,
the entire operation is pointless.

355
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,846
There's still a chance

356
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:15,995
that Prime Minister Matobo
will be recovered.

357
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,551
And while that chance exists,

358
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,418
I'm not giving in.

359
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:23,501
Admiral Smith, your strike force
will remain in position

360
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:26,074
- and at full battle readiness.
- Yes, Madam President.

361
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,975
Madam President, you're guaranteeing
another attack on our country.

362
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,677
We will not be blackmailed, Joe,
and we will not be held hostage.

363
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:34,943
This country does not negotiate
with terrorists.

364
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,185
Tell that to the families
of the dead!

365
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,270
Do you have any idea of the reaction
when word gets out that it is terrorism?

366
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,980
Brought by your reckless policy?

367
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,350
I can guarantee there will be a call
for your impeachment.

368
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,610
- That's enough.
- I won't stand by while this happens.

369
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:51,485
Then you can turn in your resignation,
because I'm not changing my mind.

370
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,298
Now sit down or leave.

371
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,666
I'm sorry, Madam President.

372
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:14,442
You people think
about what you're doing here.

373
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,306
About the price
you're willing to pay.

374
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,162
Gentlemen,

375
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,260
ladies,

376
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,164
I know that there are many of you here
who agree with Secretary Stevens.

377
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:52,927
If I can't alleviate your doubts,

378
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,763
I can at least help you to understand
my reasonings.

379
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,167
When I took the oath of office,

380
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,318
I swore to myself,
and to the American people,

381
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:09,723
that this country would continue to be
a force for good in this world.

382
00:26:11,756 --> 00:26:14,281
We're a nation founded on ideals,

383
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:18,775
and those ideals
are being challenged today.

384
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,594
Now how we respond

385
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,878
will not only define
this administration,

386
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,131
but an entire generation.

387
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,422
And not just Americans,

388
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,409
but Sangalans,

389
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,930
and anyone else who looks to us

390
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:38,117
for guidance and strength.

391
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:42,670
I won't fail them.

392
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:46,901
And neither will you.

393
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:56,436
We're in for some tough times ahead.

394
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,486
Let's make sure we're ready.

395
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,255
Thank you, everyone.

396
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:09,055
- Hey, Jack.
- They're over there.

397
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,939
I want you to put a wire on Mr. Matobo
as fast as you can. Go.

398
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:19,989
You're OK?

399
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,694
What do you think, Jack?

400
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,702
You shot me and buried me alive.

401
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:27,457
If we hadn't,
Emerson would have killed you.

402
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,292
I'm sorry we had to keep you
in the dark,

403
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,745
- but we didn't have a choice.
- Yes, you did.

404
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,669
You could have trusted me.

405
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:38,758
If I had told you everythingat the FBI,
would you have believed me?

406
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:55,730
Have a seat, please, sir.

407
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:10,031
What's that?

408
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:13,852
It's a transmitter. I'll be affixing it
to one of your teeth.

409
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:17,609
We'll know exactly
where you are at all times.

410
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,223
You won't be alone.

411
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:20,508
Are you with the FBI?

412
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,802
No, I'm a stay-at-home mom.

413
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:25,256
Open your mouth, please.

414
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:29,016
Wider. Good.

415
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,149
Chloe accessed the FBI server.

416
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:34,552
Dubaku brought down two planes
just outside the capital.

417
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:36,503
Over 270 people were killed.

418
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:40,956
He's threatened to kill 10,000 more.
We have less than an hour to stop it.

419
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:43,084
- How long before Nichols gets here?
- 10 minutes.

420
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:45,449
- Here's your com.
- Thanks.

421
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,213
- You all right?
- Yeah, just a little dizzy.

422
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,648
- You should take a seat.
- I'm fine.

423
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,427
Come on. Take a seat.

424
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,974
So it's really true?

425
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,184
Yeah.

426
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:15,513
I've devoted my life to the Bureau
and you just expect me to believe

427
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:18,204
that it's corrupted. That the entire
government's been corrupted?

428
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:19,573
Not all of them.

429
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,615
But until we find out who,
we can't trust anyone.

430
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,208
And the four of you
really think you can stop this?

431
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,513
We have to.

432
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,908
It's as simple as that.

433
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:34,714
Ethan...

434
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,625
Can we...?

435
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:44,671
The president is completely alone.
She'll get a lot of Americans killed.

436
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,911
- You must talk some sense into her.
- We're both on the same side here, Tim.

437
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:52,382
And I'm gonna need your help
if we're gonna change her mind.

438
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:54,402
How do you propose we do that?

439
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,562
There is someone she'll listen to.

440
00:30:57,284 --> 00:30:59,551
Maybe we can convince him
to help us.

441
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,246
- Go ahead.
- I just dropped her. She's on her way.

442
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:59,826
OK, stay in the car and keep watch.
I'll call you when it's done.

443
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,000
Mr. Taylor, how did you get in here?

444
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:03,713
The agent you sent just brought me by
to get a few of my things for...

445
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,482
Mr. Taylor, are you all right?

446
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,566
Mr. Taylor, are you OK?

447
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:25,294
Mr. Taylor, unless you tell me
what's wrong, I don't know what...

448
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:33,927
Help me. Help me, please.

449
00:33:58,655 --> 00:33:59,662
Yes, Mr. Kanin.

450
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:02,456
Agent Gedge,
I'm looking for Henry Taylor.

451
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,869
<i>He's not answering his phone.
Is he with you?</i>

452
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,002
You can't talk with him
right now, sir.

453
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,797
<i>Why not? Where is he?</i>

454
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,709
He's meeting with Samantha Roth
in her apartment, sir.

455
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:14,058
For what possible reason?

456
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:15,928
I don't know, sir.
He didn't tell me.

457
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:18,640
Why aren't you with him?

458
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,111
Mr. Taylor insisted
on meeting with her alone, sir.

459
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:23,848
I'm in the car.
I'm just outside the building.

460
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:27,078
I don't give a damn what he insisted.
We went through this, Agent Gedge.

461
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,121
You were supposed
to keep him away from her.

462
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:31,860
<i>- What the hell were you thinking?</i>
- I'm sorry, sir.

463
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,695
I'm not interested in your apology.
Just pull him out of there

464
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,320
and have him phone me
as soon as possible.

465
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:08,647
Don't try to speak, sir.

466
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:11,939
There's nothing left to say.

467
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,599
We will wait here.

468
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,150
All right.

469
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:56,545
They're coming.
One car from the service road.

470
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,406
- How many people?
- I can't tell. The windows are tinted.

471
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,574
Copy that.

472
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:27,100
How are you doing, Tony?

473
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,010
All right.

474
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,857
I was glad to hear
you're still with us.

475
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:35,728
Where's Emerson?

476
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,320
You'll not deal with him today.

477
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,446
- What do you mean?
- He's dead.

478
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,020
So's Litvak and Bauer.

479
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,920
I got them in a back room.
You want to say hi?

480
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,290
You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

481
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,504
I decided
I'd rather not split the cut.

482
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,195
I don't understand.
I thought you and Emerson were friends.

483
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,760
That was before
he left me to rot with the FBI.

484
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,935
- You want Matobo or not?
- Where is he?

485
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:13,188
- Close.
- I want to see him, and his wife.

486
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,482
Diamonds.

487
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,691
Matobo.

488
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
He's in the back of the truck.

489
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,124
Keep your tracks clean.
We might call on you again.

490
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Okay, then.

491
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,279
Let's put that behind us.

492
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,658
You got what you want.

493
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,310
Now, get the hell out of here.

494
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:51,745
Now!

495
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,829
Clear.

496
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:35,831
- Chloe.
- Jack, I've got him.

497
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,583
Get everyone ready to move out.

498
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:13,063
Gedge...

499
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:37,603
Gedge.

500
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,021
Don't do this.

501
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,070
Please...

502
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,243
<i>There has been no comment from the
White House, but the incident proximity</i>

503
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:58,794
<i>of the executive Mansion
as let a wide spread speculation</i>

504
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,190
<i>that the terrorists
were responsible.</i>

505
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:05,927
<i>The air collision has caused
the death of 270 passengers and crew.</i>

506
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:09,609
The White House
still has not complied.

507
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,720
American forces
are still in position.

508
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,699
I think this president is not
just stubborn;

509
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,410
- she's insane.
- <i>What do you intend to do?</i>

510
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:20,704
Exactly what we promised.

511
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,172
We're ready, sir.

512
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,450
I'll see you in a moment.

513
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,630
- Where is the target located?
- Kidron, Ohio.

514
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,882
- Population?
