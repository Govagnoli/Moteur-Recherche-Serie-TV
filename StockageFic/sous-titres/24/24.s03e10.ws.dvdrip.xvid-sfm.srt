1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,991
-Julia.
- Mr President.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,588
David is wondering
why I want him to fire Wayne.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,314
- Wayne and I became involved.
- They had an affair.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,032
I think you'll agree, David,

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,197
you wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,916
I've never asked you for anything in return,
but I'm asking you now.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,157
- Fire Wayne.
- I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,795
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,317
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,675
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,633
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,957
- Do you know how to do a frequency scan?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,071
We want to pick up
your father's transponder signal.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,794
Michelle's begun it. Coordinate with her.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,393
I have a message from Jack.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,274
The virus they're going to buy,
Jack is going to take it from them.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,949
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,513
Then help me.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,030
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,879
We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,112
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,075
Hers is 240. Nina, you win.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,357
You're of no use to us any more! You failed!

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,072
Ram Ãn, don't do this.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,557
Five hours ago you were in prison.
Now you're free because I broke you out!

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,874
We can get the virus.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,315
- How do you get the virus?
- The woman, Nina.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,635
If I fail, you get to kill me. Fine.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,311
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track. We'll all get paid!

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,557
How many more are coming, huh?

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,114
Are they Americanos or federales or both?

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,515
- So where are we on this?
- Jack's last known position is here.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,795
NSA says they can reposition a satellite.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,316
- But it'll take two orbits to get over the area.
- That'll be too late.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,880
Sporadic satellite coverage is probably
why they chose that place to meet.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,633
(cellphone rings)

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,228
- It's Hector.
- Thread it through our system.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,670
Trace this on all the networks.
You'll need an explanation.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,109
They haven't heard from you
in over two hours.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,878
We're set.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,835
Ortega.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,599
(Hector) What's going on?
I've been trying to reach you.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,188
I was at Division with the bureau chief.

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,630
- Is there a problem?
- No, I'm back at CTU now.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,273
Nobody suspects you?

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,193
If they did, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,312
All right, listen, we have a problem.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,880
The seller double-crossed us.
He brought in a second bidder.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,713
Some woman name Nina Myers.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,590
Amador held an auction. We lost.

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,870
- So you don't have the virus?
- No.

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,912
- What do you want me to do?
- Bauer knows this woman, Nina.

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,879
We're going to try to
get it through her. Hold on.

54
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,632
- Gael, it's Jack.
- Jack.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,958
I'll give you a cellphone number that
Amador's been using for the last few hours.

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,872
Ping it until you get his location.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,508
The number's 01 1-5255-3224-0135.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,271
- Got it. Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,756
Get back to me on this number
when you've got his location.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,554
One more thing.
Bauer's partner showed up.

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,910
- You have him?
- Yes, we have him.

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,834
- (Gael) Alive?
- (Hector) Yes, for now.

63
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,236
Is he working alone, or does he have backup?

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,840
Edmunds is in Field Ops.
I don't have access to their mandate.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,798
You get access, OK?
What are we paying you for?

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,873
If I try, it might blow my cover.
Best to keep Edmunds alive until we find out.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,872
All right. Track Amador.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,795
- Do you have a location on Jack?
- Here.

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,871
Four miles from our last contact point.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,475
Tell the Delta units to adjust their positions
and wait for orders.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,875
Run a passive triangulation
on Amador's phone.

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,880
Kim. We found your father.

73
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
He's undercover with the Salazars. He's fine.

74
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,469
Thank God.
What about Chase?

75
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,835
He's been captured.

76
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,880
- Captured? Is he OK?
- He's alive. They're holding him.

77
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,477
- What do you mean, holding him?
- My guess is they're interrogating him.

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,870
Once we get the virus, we'll go in for Chase.

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,872
- Thanks for not keeping this from me.
- Sure.

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,397
- Do you need anything else?
- No. Just making sure you're OK.

81
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,476
I'm fine. Thank you.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,352
- Did you tell her?
- About Chase.

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,596
- But not about Nina?
- No.

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,871
She doesn't need to know about that now.

85
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,071
Jack, how long will it take
to trace Amador's phone?

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
If everything goes right, ten minutes.

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,553
I'll call our clients, tell them there's a delay.

88
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,558
I'll see if they're getting
anywhere with his partner.

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,954
(Ram Ãn) Let's go.

90
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,391
- Hector!
- Sergio, what are you doing here?

91
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,640
My sister says we're going. She's taking
me and my father away from here.

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
- Did she say when?
- Soon.

93
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,874
- But I don't wanna leave you, Hector.
- I would never let that happen.

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,398
OK now, you go back to bed, but don't
tell your sister anything about this, OK?

95
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,478
And I'll make sure everything works out.

96
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,958
- You'll talk to her?
- Yes. I'll talk to her, OK? Come on.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,114
(Ram Ãn speaks in Spanish)

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,676
- How is Chase?
- Holding on.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,836
I'm going with Ram Ãn to pick up the virus.

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,871
If you get a chance to get out of here, take it.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,596
Get Chase, tell him to call CTU.
They can get in touch with the rescue units.

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,950
He'll get you and your family out of here.

103
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,112
- Planning on going somewhere?
- What do you mean?

104
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,232
- Don't play games with me.
- Don't play games with me.

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,509
- What are you talking about?
- Sergio was packing a bag to go away.

106
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,518
- What's so funny?
- He was being bad.

107
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,477
Something he picked up from you.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,515
I told him I was taking him away from here.
I was trying to keep him in line.

109
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,950
That's all? Just trying to keep him in line?

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,753
He said he wanted a gun like yours.

111
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,873
I said no. He got nasty,
so I scared some sense into him.

112
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,629
He's a good boy.
Don't scare him like that.

113
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,115
Don't encourage him to play with guns.

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,838
(Ram Ãn) Jack.

115
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,871
- Yeah.
- (Ram Ãn) Let's go.

116
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,156
Adam says we're back in touch with Jack.

117
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,874
- We just heard from him.
- How close are we to the virus?

118
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,236
We have the phone number
of the seller, a Michael Amador.

119
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,312
We're running a passive triangulation.

120
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,155
- Then what?
- We pass the location of Amador onto Jack

121
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,231
and let Jack call the shots.

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,792
- I'll bring Division up to speed.
- Ryan, there's one more thing.

123
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,269
We found out there's
another player in the deal.

124
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,079
- Who is it?
- Nina Myers.

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,072
I thought we had her restricted to North Africa
after the president gave her exiled immunity.

126
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,119
We did. Apparently she slipped out.

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,077
- Jack's trying to get her to help him.
- Help him?

128
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,273
- She killed his wife, that's a hard sell.
- I don't know the details.

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,878
- Does Kim know about it?
- No. I'd like to keep it that way for now.

130
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,996
All right, keep me updated.

131
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,679
- I owe you an apology.
- You don't.

132
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,750
If you thought I wasn't fit to do my job,
then you had a duty to report it.

133
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,714
But I wouldn't risk the effectiveness
of this unit to prove how tough I am.

134
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,037
- I know that. I just felt...
- I know what you felt!

135
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,236
You made that perfectly clear.

136
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,191
(phone rings)

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,314
- Yeah.
- (man) We need Michelle downstairs.

138
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,795
Yeah, all right.

139
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,872
What? What do you mean, you have to go?

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,150
Sarah, this is a crisis. I can't leave.

141
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,751
- I'm sorry. I have other responsibilities.
- Well, where are you now?

142
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,038
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, OK.

143
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,156
- He's very stubborn, Hector.
- Move.

144
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
CTU doesn't have
your travel plans in their records.

145
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,316
Did you come down here by yourself?

146
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,358
Tell me, this will be all over.

147
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,870
Did you come down here by yourself?

148
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,871
(gunshot/screams)

149
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,880
Keep at it.
If he doesn't crack soon, use gasoline.

150
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,269
Si, patron.

151
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,878
Are all agencies up to speed?

152
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,595
- They're coordinating with the military.
- And the Mexican government?

153
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,269
Full cooperation.
They've given us a free hand.

154
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Mr President, may I please have a word?

155
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,871
- Thank you, Gerry.
- Sir.

156
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,833
Thanks, Gerry.

157
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,879
I just got off the phone with Sullivan.
He's pulling his vote.

158
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,953
- How many senators have we lost?
- Three, all prot Ág Ás of Milliken's.

159
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,993
Unless Milliken calls off his dogs,
we're not gonna get Health Care passed.

160
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,880
He's sabotaging a bill
that could benefit millions.

161
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,953
He's showing you that he had the power
to help start your political career,

162
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,071
but he also has the power to end it.

163
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,348
You can't lose this debate and fail to pass

164
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,869
the most important
legislation of your presidency.

165
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,236
- We'd hand Keeler the election.
- We haven't lost the senate vote.

166
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,954
We will.

167
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,039
Unless you give in
to his demands and fire me, we will.

168
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,873
- David, you don't have a choice here.
- I told you before, that's not an option.

169
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,951
Listen, l...

170
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,880
I know you wanna do the right thing by me.

171
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,509
But I'm the one who made this mistake.

172
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,952
My affair with Milliken's wife
was stupid and wrong...

173
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,959
Yes, it was.
But what he's trying to do is worse.

174
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,198
For revenge, he'll kill a piece of legislation
that's good for this country.

175
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,392
We can't let that happen.

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,875
There has to be a way to get to him.

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
- (phone rings)
- Yes.

178
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,350
(woman) I have Senator Haynes for you, sir.

179
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,553
- Senator.
- Mr President.

180
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,875
Push them off the stacks.
I'll be back soon.

181
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,559
- The card files?
- No, just what I said.

182
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,955
Learn to follow instructions, Justin.

183
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,880
- I have every right to be angry.
- I'm sorry, but it's a family emergency.

184
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,555
There are two family emergencies
now, aren't there?

185
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,875
Hi, baby girl.

186
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,914
Of the two, yours is less important.

187
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,237
- Not to me, it's not.
- Your job is in serious jeopardy.

188
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,316
Whatever.

189
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,711
What did you learn from Edmunds?

190
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,032
He can take a bullet through the hand
without saying anything useful.

191
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,912
(phone rings)

192
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,234
- Gael?
- Yeah, we're tracking Amador.

193
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,353
He's seven miles north of Palo Verde,
moving west on a rural highway.

194
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,232
- Any idea where he's going?
- No.

195
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,715
Just get back to me as soon as he's stopped.

196
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,874
They've located Amador on a highway seven
miles north of Palo Verde, moving west.

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,072
- Highway 14. We can't let him get too far.
- OK. Get everyone ready.

198
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,636
No. You can't ambush Amador
unless you're certain he's got the virus.

199
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,389
- What are you saying we do?
- Let him lead us to Nina.

200
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,875
When we're sure
they have the virus, we go in.

201
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,997
But not with an army of men.
You have to let me go alone.

202
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,476
You're not going anywhere alone.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

203
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,994
We go together.
Hector, you're better off here.

204
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,514
And make sure that everyone's ready,
just in case. Jack, give me the phone.

205
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,596
You're driving.

206
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,909
You still not asleep?

207
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,918
It's OK, Sergio.

208
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,712
(door opens)

209
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,235
Papa.

210
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,194
- What do they want with that man?
- I don't know, but at least he's still alive.

211
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,676
Get ready, we're leaving.
Hector's resting. This is our chance.

212
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,268
- No, we can't...
- Don't argue. I need your help.

213
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,551
- What can I do?
- Make sure the trucks can't follow us.

214
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,116
Pull wires, whatever.
Then get Sergio ready and keep him quiet.

215
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,549
- Put him in the truck and wait.
- What will you do?

216
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,638
- What I have to. Now go.
- Be careful.

217
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,668
- Emilio, do you have a light?
- Sure.

218
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,878
Julia. It's been a long time.

219
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,872
Hi.

220
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,478
Thanks for meeting me.

221
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,230
My husband's trying
to force the president to fire you.

222
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,710
There's much more at stake here
than just my job, you know.

223
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,595
It's about my brother being able to run
his administration the way that he sees fit.

224
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,669
It's not fair to the people of this country
for the president to be extorted.

225
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,598
- I do love it when you get all noble.
- Julia...

226
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
What am I supposed to do?

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,634
- All of this is out of my control.
- No, it's not.

228
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,671
It's not, and I think you know that.

229
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,555
Everybody thinks Alan dominates you.

230
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,750
The truth is, he needs you.
You know that.

231
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,636
Say you'll leave him if he doesn't back off.

232
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,753
- He'd never believe me.
- Make him believe you.

233
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,919
I miss you.

234
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,556
Do you miss me?

235
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,588
- Oh, what difference would it make?
- It could make a lot of difference.

236
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,870
Julia, stop it. We can't.

237
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,672
- Do you think of me?
- Don't do this.

238
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,837
It's a simple question.
Do you think about me?

239
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,872
Yes. Yes, I think about you.

240
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,428
- But it doesn't mean anything.
- I think about you.

241
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,714
- And it does mean something.
- I didn't come here for this.

242
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,877
You came here because
you wanted something.

243
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,876
I want something, too.
I like being Mrs Alan Milliken.

244
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,874
But that does not have to have
anything to do with you and me.

245
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,510
Come back to me.

246
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,788
That's what I want in return.

247
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,994
It worked once, it can work again.

248
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,873
It never worked. Not for me.

249
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,550
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

250
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,269
Talk to me, you bastard!

251
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,878
- No! (screams)
- What you don't understand...

252
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,596
What you don't understand is if you don't talk,
Hector will take it out on me.

253
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,474
- Talk to me!
- (Claudia) Eduardo, back off!

254
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,952
Hector thinks he might talk to me.

255
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,672
(speaks Spanish)

256
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,075
Tell these men what they want to know
and your suffering will end.

257
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,871
- You won't be killed, I swear.
- Why should I believe you?

258
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,390
Because if you don't, they'll burn you alive.

259
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,351
- He's a stubborn one, isn't he?
- We can handle him.

260
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,753
Check his pockets.
He's got a phone.

261
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,950
There's a gun on the table.

262
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,873
- What are you doing?
- I've got to stop the bleeding or I could die.

263
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,516
- Come on, we have to go.
- Give me the gun.

264
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,916
- Stay down, Sergio.
- What's going on?

265
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,996
Everything's gonna be fine.

266
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,790
Come on, come on. Let's go.

267
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,869
Hurry, hurry.
Get down, get down.

268
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,872
- Where are you going?
- Hector wants me to pick up something.

269
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,633
- What?
- It's none of your business.

270
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,718
(yelling in Spanish)

271
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,875
- Papa, what's happening?
- It's OK. Stay down.

272
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,557
Claudia!

273
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,874
(engine fails to start)

274
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,239
Thank you. Thank you.

275
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,594
Chloe.

276
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,350
- Are Delta teams in position yet?
- Yes, they're in the area.

277
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,636
Soon as we say, they'll pick up Chase.

278
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,957
Make sure everyone knows this is
subordinate to obtaining the virus.

279
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,116
- It's in the brief.
- Once we have Chase,

280
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,596
Iink in Division, District
and the Attorney General's office.

281
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,075
A lot of people want answers from him.

282
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,075
(baby gurgles)

283
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,230
- What was that?
- Nothing.

284
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,917
(gurgling continues)

285
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,030
- Is this your child?
- Yes.

286
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,869
She hasn't been interfering with work.
Technically there's no rule...

287
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,713
There's no rule because it's common sense.

288
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,880
- Now get rid of it.
- If I could, I would.

289
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,997
My baby-sitter hit me with some
very unprofessional behaviour.

290
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,831
I want the baby out of here, Chloe. Now.
Or find someone else to do your job.

291
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,997
Parents are a protected group,
Mr Chappelle. This is not fair.

292
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,276
(baby gurgles)

293
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,796
Amador's stopped about 200 yards up
a dirt road that intersects with Highway 14

294
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,348
about two miles west of Rancho Guadalupe.

295
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,433
OK, good work. We'll find it.

296
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,877
- Amador stopped half a mile up the road.
- What do we do?

297
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,795
Nina is either with him now, or she will be
any minute. We need to isolate her.

298
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,119
Let me see the nightscope.

299
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,399
One... two... three.

300
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,191
- OK, I'm ready to go in.
- I told you.

301
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,869
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- Ram Ãn, I am trained to do this.

302
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,199
If I go in myself, I might succeed.
If we go in together, both of us will get killed.

303
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,958
- How long?
- As long as it takes.

304
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,878
You'll have to trust me.
I want this money as bad as you.

305
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,517
- I'll trust you when we have the virus.
- I promise, I can make her work with us.

306
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,191
Use the nightscope. As soon as I've entered
the building safely, go back to the main road.

307
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,757
If Amador mobilises his resources outside
this perimeter, we've got to be ready.

308
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,108
OK?

309
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,316
All right, go.

310
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,557
(Nina) The funds are ready to transfer.
When do I get the virus?

311
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,148
I'll call you with the location in half an hour.

312
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,317
You'll transfer
50% of the funds then, as agreed.

313
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,880
I don't like jumping through all these hoops.

314
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,396
The hoops are here to protect us, Nina.
Just wait here for my call.

315
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,356
(guard) Freeze.

316
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,074
Just take it easy.
Take it easy, I'm unarmed.

317
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,590
The Salazars wanted me to set up
a meeting with your employer.

318
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,233
Nina!

319
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,357
(gunshot)

320
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,071
Nina, don't move.

321
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,199
Drop the gun.

322
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,235
Get back in the church.

323
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,556
Take a seat.

324
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,752
Don't worry, if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

325
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,917
- Put the briefcase down.
- (clang)

326
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,749
- Tony, it's Chase. He just called in.
- All right, source the call.

327
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,631
- Where are you?
- Our truck broke down.

328
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,276
We're 15 miles east of the Salazars' camp.
You should be able to lock onto this cell.

329
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,439
We've got Delta teams in the area.
We'll send a chopper. What about Jack?

330
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,915
He went with Ram Ãn
to find Amador and the virus.

331
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,918
- How long ago?
- About half an hour.

332
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,194
Tell them I'm bringing out two people and the
body of the woman who helped me escape.

333
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,437
- Who was she?
- Claudia. Hector's girlfriend.

334
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,030
- I've got her father and her brother.
- A Delta team is ten minutes away.

335
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,038
- Can you hang tight for ten?
- I don't know, just get 'em here.

336
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,357
- Sit tight, they're on their way.
- Can you tell Kim that...

337
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,157
- Tell her I'll call her when I'm safe.
- Yeah, you got it.

338
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,594
(Oriol sobs) Claudia.

339
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,991
(speaks Spanish)

340
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,631
Jack, if you didn't come here to kill me,
why are you here?

341
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,718
- I need to talk to you alone.
- That's not gonna happen.

342
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,189
- How much is your buyer paying you?
- Two million, once I deliver the virus.

343
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,754
The Salazars will pay you a lot more.

344
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,396
- How much more?
- What is this?

345
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,114
- Shut up.
- This guy shouldn't be breathing.

346
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,710
I'm handling it.
How much more, Jack?

347
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,435
At least ten times more than
what you're getting paid now.

348
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,755
Really?

349
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,029
That's a pretty great deal.

350
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,472
What if my buyer doesn't get his virus?
He's gonna hunt me down and kill me.

351
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,036
With that kind of money you could
disappear and never be found.

352
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,879
Yeah, and what about you?

353
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,034
The Salazars are paying me enough money
to do what I want for the rest of my life.

354
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,319
I don't believe you, Jack.
I think you're still working for CTU.

355
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,877
- Well, you're wrong.
- You're not the type of guy to sell out.

356
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,359
- You'd do anything for your country.
- There was a time when that was true.

357
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,631
But what did it ever get me?
I lost everything.

358
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,753
When I went undercover with the Salazars,
I had to give them my soul.

359
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,749
When I brought Ram Ãn Salazar in,
what was waiting for me? No one, nothing!

360
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,549
What about Kim?

361
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,510
She never forgave me for
what happened to her mother.

362
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,638
I want to give her most of the money,
help get through what's happened.

363
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,230
OK, so... say you are working alone.

364
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,308
I killed your wife. What's gonna keep you
from killing me the first chance you get?

365
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,431
I don't have a choice.

366
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,149
I broke Ram Ãn Salazar out of an American
prison. I can never go back there again.

367
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,879
This is my one shot at a big score.

368
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,512
After that, I swear to you,
I just wanna disappear.

369
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,553
We've wasted enough time, Nina.
You kill him, or I'm calling in.

370
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,196
Fair enough.

371
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,393
What are you up to, Jack?

372
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,676
- I went to see Julia.
- What?

373
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,756
To see if she would help us with Alan.

374
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,869
- And?
- She said no.

375
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,238
Listen, I've been thinking, and you
don't have an alternative here, David.

376
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,875
This is my mess, I'll take the heat.
Let me resign.

377
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
I may ask you to when this is over.

378
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,476
But it won't be because
Milliken is forcing my hand.

379
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,592
Wayne, I've been doing some thinking too.
And there is an alternative.

380
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,589
If Milliken wants to play dirty,
we'll have to lower ourselves to his level.

381
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,756
By doing what?

382
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,316
Give me a moment.

383
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,871
(rings)

384
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,673
- Hello?
- Sherry?

385
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,756
David.

386
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,348
David, what's wrong?

387
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,513
- I need your help.
- All right, I'm listening.

388
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,790
I'm downtown.
I need to see you tonight.

389
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,916
- Tell me more.
- I can't say much over the phone.

390
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,792
It's about Alan Milliken.

391
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,874
- Fine.
- I'll send a car.

392
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,549
You really did break Salazar out of prison.

393
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,910
I'm not the man you knew before.

394
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,872
Well, I don't know about that.

395
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,719
But 20 million dollars...
I'm gonna keep me an open mind.

396
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,558
So, Jack, if we're gonna go forward
with this, I have to know one thing.

397
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,156
Are you gonna be able
to forgive me for killing Teri?

398
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,877
If I wanted revenge, Nina, I would have
killed you already. You know that.

399
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,830
It's like I said, all I wanna do is finish
this deal and disappear for good.

400
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,476
Convince me.

401
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,678
