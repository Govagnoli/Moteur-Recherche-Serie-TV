1
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:47,076
Colonel Dubaku, we are just
leaving the township now, sir.

2
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:49,149
- How many do you have?
- Five.

3
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,199
- Only five?
- By the time we got to the field,

4
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:55,845
- most of the boys were gone.
- I need soldiers, not excuses.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,181
I will bring some more, sir, I promise.

6
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,808
Just bring them to me.

7
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,242
You will learn to fight like men.

8
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,529
Of that, I have no doubt.

9
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,269
This...

10
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,886
will make you strong, little soldiers.

11
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,545
This will make you free.

12
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,172
Come.

13
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:37,313
Take it.

14
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,455
How does it make you feel?

15
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,239
Powerful, yes?

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Come.

17
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,782
Your mothers and your fathers...

18
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,771
they have made you weak,

19
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,895
but General Juma...

20
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:03,895
he will make you strong.

21
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,134
He will make you strong

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,793
so you can take back the country
from the government

23
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,967
and the traitors that work for them...

24
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:14,074
like this cockroach here!

25
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,185
This cockroach

26
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:28,856
who works for the government
and their white masters...

27
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,201
They have taken our land.

28
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:41,113
But soon, all that will change.

29
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:45,163
Soon, all the land
will belong to the people again.

30
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:47,939
Soldier...

31
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,401
you must buy our freedom
with the blood of this cockroach.

32
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,677
And you know what we do to cockroaches.

33
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:01,916
Kill the cockroach.

34
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,008
Kill the cockroach!

{\The following takes place
between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm}

40
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,651


41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,194
I thought I told you to turn up
the air-conditioning.

42
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,876
All right, sir, I do.

43
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,199
- But we need another player.
- Find somebody else.

44
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:27,390
Who? Tell me, Willie,
who can handle the ball better than you?

45
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,605
- That's right, no one.
- We're not supposed to go to town

46
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,856
- without Mr. Benton.
- He worries too much. So do you.

47
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,540
Hey, Desmond.
Hurry or the bus will leave. Come on.

48
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,452
- Let's go.
- You're not my father.

49
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,829
I'm your brother,
and you'll do what I say.

50
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,139
Fine, then.

51
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,991
The truck is here!

52
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,944
I wasn't stealing it. I swear.

53
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,769
I was just looking.

54
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:13,344
Forgot these.

55
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:17,750
Very pretty. For a woman, yes?

56
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,188
I was gonna give it
to my daughter one day.

57
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:22,964
You have a daughter?

58
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,376
Where did you get it?

59
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:28,324
Rajasthan.

60
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:30,891
India.

61
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:34,350
- You ask a lot of questions.
- That's what Mr. Benton says.

62
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,625
I bet.

63
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:40,525
When were you there?

64
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,611
- Last summer.
- Before you came here?

65
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:49,988
- And before that, where were you?
- Different places.

66
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,108
When are you going home?

67
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,455
I'm not going home.

68
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,945
Listen, I told the boys I'd help them
unload the truck.

69
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,297
- If you want that, you can have it.
- Really?

70
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,890
Really.

71
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,016
You're gonna have to give me back
my knife though.

72
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,261
Go on.

73
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,115
Hey, Willie.
The supply truck's here.

74
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,716
- Boys could use some help.
- Look what Jack gave me.

75
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,371
- Very nice.
- It's from India.

76
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,685
Jack, this is Frank Tramell.

77
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,414
He's the ambassador's
chief political officer.

78
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,173
I know who he is.

79
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:48,120
He left some messages for you
to come at the embassy.

80
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,570
I got his messages.

81
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,903
- What's going on, Jack?
- I'll tell you.

82
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,724
A Senate subcommittee has questions
about the illegal detention

83
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,728
and torture of certain prisoners
in Mr. Bauer's custody.

84
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:03,720
I have a subpoena requesting you
to appear, and it's way past due,

85
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,818
so consider yourself served.

86
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,119
I told the boys I'd help them
unload the truck. Excuse me.

87
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,635
Failure to comply to a subpoena
is a federal offense, Mr. Bauer.

88
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,799
- You are bound by law to respond.
- Then give them my response.

89
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,545
If they want me back in Washington,
they can come and get me.

90
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:37,571
The ambassador said that you and Bauer

91
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,777
were in Special Forces together.

92
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,188
- How long has he been here?
- A few months.

93
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:45,450
He never mentioned a subpoena?

94
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:50,512
He's been ducking it for a year,
across three different continents.

95
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:53,429
Washington is leaning
on the ambassador to deliver him.

96
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,260
And now, the ambassador's
leaning on you.

97
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,438
If Bauer doesn't come back to the States
on his own, they'll come for him.

98
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,147
That would be a mistake.

99
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,172
You're doing God's work here, Carl.
Between malaria and the wars,

100
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,697
these kids never had a chance.
Now you're giving them a decent life.

101
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:12,272
It'd be a shame if the funding dried up.

102
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,012
- Don't threaten me, Frank.
- I'm just giving you the facts.

103
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,487
You're his friend.

104
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,842
Talk some damn sense into him.

105
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:38,205
There he is,

106
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,301
the mighty warrior who traded his gun
for a wheelbarrow.

107
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:45,167
Why are you here?

108
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:48,318
To do penance for all your sins?

109
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,360
You don't want to talk about it.

110
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:53,925
I don't blame you.

111
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,234
Careful, don't drop her.

112
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,694
The government won't be able
to hold out against us for long.

113
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,735
Except we have more weapons
than soldiers who can use them.

114
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,784
We need to overrun
the main garrison from the west.

115
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,332
We have minefields here and here.

116
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,584
Then I'll bring you more little soldiers
to clear them. Do not worry.

117
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,756
Our father would be
really proud, Youssou.

118
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:35,821
Very proud.

119
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,807
You'll have your little soldiers.

120
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,676
- This is Colonel Dubaku.
- Hodges here.

121
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,759
I just heard
some troubling news, Colonel,

122
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,023
that your recruiting numbers are,
are still coming up a little short.

123
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,929
I want you to know, my offer stands.

124
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:12,391
I've got personnel standing
by right across the border.

125
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:15,506
- They can be deployed within the hour.
- That won't be necessary.

126
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:19,553
Do some thinking now.
I'm offering you

127
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,138
professional soldiers, not children
that you haven't had time to train.

128
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,887
You provided the weapons.

129
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:27,761
- We will fight our own war.
- Well,

130
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:31,509
- Well, it's your country.
- It will be soon.

131
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:35,480
Is there anything else, Mr. Hodges?

132
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:39,316
Tell General Juma to give me a call

133
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,738
- when he gets there, will you?
- I'll let him know.

134
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:42,863
Good.

135
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,179
That's one hard-nosed son of a bitch.

136
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,342
It is his country.

137
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,253
But I'm paying for it.

138
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,849
I don't want those transactions
traceable,

139
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,202
Mr. Nichols.

140
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,010
Not by the SEC, the IRS,
or any of my ex-wives.

141
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,865
You understand me, don't you?

142
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,807
John, what do you want me to tell you?

143
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:30,314
You've got to hang in there
and be patient, my friend.

144
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,400
Yes, I know, I know.
Hold on, hold on.

145
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:35,419
Stop, stop, we got caught by the margin.
It's going to turn around.

146
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:37,347
Yes, yes, it is.

147
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,596
Yes, it is.

148
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,203
Yeah, you've got to give it time

149
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,341
And just... yeah, be patient.

150
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:46,743
Yeah. Okay.

151
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,597
Yes, yes. Okay, all right.
Bye-Bye.

152
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,833
- Yeah?
- Would you come in here please?

153
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,308
- Who's that guy?
- A client.

154
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:34,200
I need you to close out
Abu Dhabi and Eritrea.

155
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:37,149
Burn the records and bury the ashes.

156
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,199
- Go.
- Yeah!

157
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,132
- Can i have a word?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,330
Willie, go on out to the truck.
Pick up another load.

159
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,074
I think you should take a look at this.

160
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,576
I don't need to.

161
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,232
I know what it says.

162
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:09,598
Don't worry, Carl.
I'll be gone by dark.

163
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,934
I'm not asking you to leave, Jack.
I'm asking you to have a conversation.

164
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,958
Tramell says this subpoena's been
chasing you for over a year now.

165
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,057
It's going to catch up
with you sometime.

166
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:23,528
I'm not going back.

167
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm not saying you should.

168
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:29,314
But a year's a long time
to spend looking over your shoulder.

169
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,876
A lifetime of that's
going to drive you out of your mind.

170
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,822
Whatever I've done,
I've paid for in full.

171
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:37,167
All I've got left is my freedom. I'm not
letting them take that away from me.

172
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,836
"Freedom."
What kind of freedom is this, Jack?

173
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,881
- You're running away.
- What do you want from me, Carl?

174
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,511
I want you to trust me, Jack.
I am your friend.

175
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,332
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:53,474
When you called me up
for the first time in what,

177
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,663
ten years,

178
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:56,393
I hoped...

179
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,661
You were maybe looking for something
more than just a place to stay...

180
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,360
Trying to find a way
to make some sense of it all.

181
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,487
It's a normal impulse.
Especially for people like us.

182
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,282
Yeah, except you found
what you were looking for.

183
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:13,870
Yeah.

184
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,049
I just meant it's different for me.

185
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,720
You know, I'm not so sure
I have found what I was looking for.

186
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,399
But I have found a
way to live with myself.

187
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:44,750
It took a long time.

188
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,948
The first thing I had to do

189
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,156
was stop running.

190
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,159
I meant what I said, Jack.

191
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,387
You can stay here.

192
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:00,941
Don't worry about Tramell.

193
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,144
The State Department's
not the only place with money.

194
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,282
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
Carl, but this is my problem.

195
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,967
I'm not gonna let it become yours.

196
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,389
What you've done with this place...

197
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,434
the school, what you've done
for the boys is worth protecting.

198
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,647
You and I both know

199
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,274
it will be better
for everyone if I leave.

200
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,644
Sorry, Jack.

201
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,155
Me, too.

202
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,831
Me, too.

203
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:45,086
Thank you, Carl.

204
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,032
Always.

205
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,141
Yeah.

206
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:59,019
You're spreading rumors.
You'll start a panic over nothing.

207
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,559
- They're not rumors. It's the truth.
- You are just a boy.

208
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,495
You do not know you are talking about.

209
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,610
Juma is killing our children.

210
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,318
The United Nations
has no evidence of that.

211
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,730
What do you know?
This isn't even your country, huh?

212
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,199
What's going on?

213
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:17,786
Thomas is talking nonsense.
He's spreading rumors about Juma.

214
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,509
"Rumors"?
They are not rumors.

215
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:24,247
Juma's soldiers have been crossing
the border and stealing our children.

216
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,455
Juma has no soldiers,
and he has no weapons.

217
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,983
- Everyone knows that.
- My cousin is missing.

218
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:32,818
He went to the market yesterday,
and he has not returned.

219
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:34,503
Then it was gun-runners who took him.

220
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,250
Or someone from the diamond mines.

221
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,394
My brother is in town with James.

222
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,758
You see that, hmm?
Now you have the boy all worried.

223
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:44,741
He should be worried.
We should all be worried.

224
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,301
Stop it! Both of you.

225
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,875
Finish up work. I'll go to town and
see if I can find out what's going on.

226
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,038
Fine.
But you are wasting your time.

227
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:55,652
I thought I told you kids not
to go into town without telling me.

228
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,936
Desmond never listens
to anyone but Desmond.

229
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,463
- Where'd he go?
- Playing football.

230
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,949
There's a field, just past the bridge.

231
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,960
- I'll be back soon.
- Benton!

232
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,863
You're not seriously worried
about all of this, are you?

233
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,021
If Juma was making trouble,
we would have heard something, no?

234
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,837
Probably. But this is Sangala.
I'm not taking any chances.

235
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,574
- What'd you think that was, huh?
- Nothing.

236
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:44,354
- What'd you say "nothing"?
- Nothing. Now, you're going to cry?

237
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,209
He's so powerful, guys.
Give him a hand.

238
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,418
You just threw the ball away...

239
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:51,653
Fire! Fire!

240
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,267
Run!

241
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,231
You are now soldiers
in the People's Freedom Army.

242
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,950
You will all have the honor of fighting

243
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,061
the imperialists until
we have taken back our land.

244
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:14,427
Samuel tells me you are from
the American school in Okavango.

245
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,942
These Americans make our people slaves.

246
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,907
But we will free you.

247
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:23,781
And we will free the other
children so they can become soldiers.

248
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,772
Take them.

249
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,390
- Tell me your name.
- Sive.

250
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,143
- Louder.
- Sive.

251
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,620
Are you a baby, Sive?

252
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,832
I asked you a question.

253
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:52,941
Are you a baby?

254
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,791
- No.
- Good.

255
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:57,262
Because we need soldiers, Sive,

256
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,265
not babies who wet themselves.

257
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:03,802
Now stop crying,
or I will stop you myself.

258
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,999
Commander!

259
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,473
Put them in the truck!

260
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,154
Lest Go.

261
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,575
What are you doing?!

262
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,335
Idiot!
They are no good to us dead!

263
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,465
With the inauguration
less than two hours away,

264
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,807
President Daniels is scheduled
to meet with his successor 

265
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,348
here at the White House

266
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:54,381
to review final details
for the transfer of power.

267
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,219
Their respective transition
teams have been working together

268
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:59,400
for several weeks to
ensure a smooth turnover.

269
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,173
Stop looking at me like that.

270
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:08,596
- Shouldn't you be getting dressed?
- We've got time.

271
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,050
I need to talk to you, Rog.

272
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,406
Chris?

273
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:30,499
- I think I might be in trouble.
- Okay.

274
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,452
- Are you using again?
- That's not what this is about.

275
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:36,194
You didn't answer my question.

276
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:37,918
I can't...

277
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:41,192
I can't really talk on the phone, okay?
I was hoping that I could...

278
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,653
I could meet up with you face-to-face.

279
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:44,953
Now?

280
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:46,900
Hang on a sec, Rog.

281
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:52,760
- Chris?
- I know, I know, it's terrible timing.

282
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,348
Believe me, I know.
But I wouldn't be asking

283
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,125
if it wasn't really important.

284
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,669
I got to leave in 45 minutes, man.

285
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:01,854
- I can be there in 20.
- Chris...

286
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:05,091
I am not gonna stay long.
I swear, Rog. Just please.

287
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:06,784
Do this for me?

288
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,644
Fine, but I'm out of here in 45 minutes.

289
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,658
Thank you. Thank you.

290
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,107
You're letting Chris
come here right now?

291
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,045
He's having some kind of relapse or
something. What am I supposed to do?

292
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,029
Exactly.
What are you supposed to do?

293
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,780
Make sure he calls his sponsor.

294
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,673
- I don't know.
- This is so Chris.

295
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:31,863
He's been a friend
for a really long time.

296
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,120
He got me my job.
Which, if he hadn't.

297
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,066
- Stop it.
- I wouldn't have met you.

298
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:37,315
Don't do this.

299
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,926
Just don't be late for
your mother's inauguration,

300
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:50,740
okay?

301
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,792
Madame President.

302
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:58,223
- Not yet.
- This way.

303
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,898
- How are you feeling?
- Excited.

304
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,245
- Nervous.
- You should be.

305
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,757
In a few hours, you're going to be
the most powerful person in the world.

306
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,323
As if you're not already
hard enough to live with.

307
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,793
- Ma'am. Mr. Taylor.
- Tom.

308
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,859
The president apologizes he could
not be here to greet you in person,

309
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,757
- but something urgent has come up.
- Something urgent?

310
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:34,430
Whatever it is, Tom, it's going
to land on my desk in about two hours.

311
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:36,996
Could I just have a moment?

312
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,728
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Go ahead.

313
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:46,192
Our embassy in Sangala just
got word of an imminent coup.

314
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,551
- How imminent?
- Very.

315
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:51,928
- Where's the president now?
- He's in the telepresence suite.

316
00:24:52,053 --> 00:24:54,742
He's on a secure line
with Prime Minister Matobo.

317
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,492
Juma is moving his forces
toward the capitol as we speak.

318
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,518
This video was taken moments ago.

319
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:08,345
Mr. Prime Minister,
this news has caught us all by surprise.

320
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:11,493
But our priority here
in Washington is to ensure

321
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,636
the safety of you and your family.

322
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:17,361
My priority is to defend
my country from this monster Juma.

323
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:20,294
And the only way that
can happen is if you accelerate

324
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,229
the military assistance your congress
has already pledged to us.

325
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:26,149
Unfortunately, I'm not in
a position to make that happen.

326
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:30,002
Certainly not today.

327
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,756
What about your successor?

328
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,371
Will she be in a better
position to help us?

329
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,375
I'm afraid I can't speak for her.

330
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,415
- Will you excuse us for a moment?
- Yes, of course.

331
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:48,616
You were right, sir. Taylor does
want to weigh in on this.

332
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:52,549
- Where is she?
- Just outside.

333
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Prime Minister,
but I have to cut this short.

334
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,020
The president-elect is waiting for me.

335
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,069
Please, sir, convey to her
my request for military assistance.

336
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:09,481
I'll do that.

337
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:24,246
Mr. President.

338
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,844
Senator Taylor.

339
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,012
Tom told me what's happening in Sangala.

340
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,138
- It is a damn tough situation.
- Yeah, I don't understand.

341
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:52,518
How could Juma raise an army
without our getting wind of it?

342
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,558
We disarmed him three years ago.
The UN's been monitoring the situation.

343
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,707
Not closely enough, apparently.

344
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,702
Then you have no idea
who's supplying him?

345
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,115
All we know is,
Juma's secured some fairly

346
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,604
advanced weapons systems, which is why

347
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:11,691
Prime Minister Matobo
is asking for our military assistance.

348
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,299
- And what did you tell him?
- The truth: It's not a viable option.

349
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:19,637
You don't agree.

350
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:23,036
We have troops in the region.

351
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,969
A show of force might make Juma blink.

352
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:28,778
And if it doesn't,

353
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,941
we get caught up in another civil
quagmire halfway around the world.

354
00:27:32,977 --> 00:27:34,614
Now, that is a hard sell.

355
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:37,936
Especially when there's nothing
in Sangala worth protecting.

356
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:41,994
No natural resources,
no substantial economic ties,

357
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,495
nothing that threatens
our national security.

358
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,659
The last time Juma made a power grab,

359
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,431
he ignited a tribal war

360
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,997
that killed tens
of thousands of civilians.

361
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,047
Our involvement could avert a genocide.

362
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:58,691
And this war will be tragic, too.

363
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,188
But it isn't our war.

364
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,268
Which is why I've ordered
the ambassador to begin evacuating

365
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,993
all non-military nationals.

366
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:12,113
I think that's a mistake.

367
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:15,943
I don't want any Americans caught in
the crossfire when Juma starts shooting.

368
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:19,923
Closing our embassy sends a signal
to the world that we are willing

369
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,719
to sell out
a democratic ally to a war criminal.

370
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:29,334
I appreciate your idealism.

371
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:35,871
I can't say the same for your cynicism.

372
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:40,782
Let's talk...

373
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:44,096
after you've been sitting
in my chair for a while.

374
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:48,543
And until then,

375
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,877
we still have
some transition business to go over.

376
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:53,231
So, I suggest we get started.

377
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:56,747
Send in Tom Lennox.

378
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:10,539
Desmond?

379
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Desmond.

380
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,389
Desmond.

381
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:28,249
Open your eyes.

382
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:29,597
Open your eyes!

383
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,589
Stay with me, Desmond.
Stay with me.

384
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,893
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

385
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,589
Do not go to sleep!
Do you understand?

386
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:39,787
Do not go to sleep.
Good lad.

387
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,553
Don't go to sleep.

388
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,578
It's not heavy.

389
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,167
I can carry it.

390
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,156
I want to go with you.

391
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,196
Me and my brother Desmond, too.

392
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,727
We can carry your
things and work for you.

393
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:15,897
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

394
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:21,546
I'm going alone.

395
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:25,633
People who like to be alone are witches,
my grandfather says.

396
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:27,571
Well, there you go.

397
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:30,704
Your grandfather wouldn't be happy if
you left here with a witch now,

398
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,174
- would he?
- He would want me to go to America.

399
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,476
His favorite was Elvis Presley.

400
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,103
I'm not going to America.

401
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,981
- Where are you going, then?
- I don't know yet.

402
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:45,330
I don't know yet is better than here.

403
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,093
You sure about that?

404
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:49,225
Here doesn't seem so bad to me.

405
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,175
Mr. Benton is very nice, but there
are too many ghosts walking around.

406
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:55,022
Ghosts?

407
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,667
My mother,
my father and my three sisters.

408
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,050
They live in the bush
and come out at night,

409
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:02,810
but you wouldn't see them
because you arepoo-mui.

410
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:05,105
- Poo-mui?
- A white person.

411
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:10,844
Willie, you and I are friends, right?

412
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,859
I want you to do me a favor as a friend.

413
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:18,185
I want you to stay here with Mr. Benton
and help take care of the other boys.

414
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,081
Will you do that?

415
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,576
- You promise?
- Promise.

416
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:26,620
Okay.

417
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:45,359
Thank you.

418
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:19,268
Benton's on Direct Connect.
He says he needs to talk to you.

419
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,175
James is dead, Desmond's been shot.

420
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,856
- What happened?
- Juma's raising an army.

421
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,039
Desmond says they're
headed for the school.

422
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:30,841
They're coming for the boys, Jack.

423
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,657
You got to get them into the shelter.

424
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:35,047
- Thomas knows where it is.
- How many guns are coming?

425
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,776
Maybe a dozen. I don't know. You have
to hold them off till I get there.

426
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:40,957
Carl, you need to call the embassy.
Get them to send some marines out here.

427
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:44,396
I've been trying. I can't get through.
Jack, go into my room.

428
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,690
You'll find what you need
in a locker under my sink.

429
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,400
The key's on top of the cupboard.

430
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,986
- How far out are you?
- Maybe five minutes.

431
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:54,696
Jack, don't let them take my kids.

432
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,078
- Don't let them take the children.
- Carl, I won't.

433
00:33:58,554 --> 00:33:59,696
Everybody!

434
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:04,008
Everybody, I want you to listen. I want
you to go to the shelter with Thomas.

435
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,173
- He's gonna take you there now.
- What's going on?

436
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:09,279
I don't have time to explain. Just go
with Thomas, and ring the bell. Now!

437
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:11,589
What about my brother?
Your brother's with Mr. Benton.

438
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,966
Everybody, follow me!

439
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,127
Juma's men are coming.
Do you have a weapon?

440
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:18,097
How do you know it's just not another
rumor? Do you have a weapon or not?

441
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,089
If they are coming, I will talk to them.

442
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:23,077
- They will listen to me.
- Save your helmet for the parade.

443
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,131
Two of our boys have already been shot!

444
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:27,898
The United Nations remains
neutral in this matter.

445
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:38,367
Still want to talk to them?
I didn't think so.

446
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,203
Why don't you go hide in
the shelter with the other children?

447
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:30,228
- Are you the last?
- Yeah.

448
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:35,007
Wait!

449
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,327
Wait for me.

450
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,557
Find the boys. Find them!

451
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:16,665
Fire!

452
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:06,269
Do not kill him yet.

453
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:09,475
Not until he tells us
where the children are hiding.

454
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,517
Stay here. Stay here.

455
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:42,307
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a bit.

456
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:36,790
- U.S. citizens only.
- I have a sister in Chicago.

457
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:39,343
- She has a job.
- She needs to sponsor you.

458
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:40,854
By then, it will be too late.

459
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:42,920
My husband died fighting Juma.

460
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:45,734
Juma will kill me.
He will kill my child.

461
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:47,162
I'm sorry.

462
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,813
Whatever you want me to do for you,

463
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:52,032
I will do.

464
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:53,771
Please,

465
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,660
just take me from here.

466
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:00,754
Anything at all.

467
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:03,460
I can't.

468
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,509
- I'm sorry.
- Sir, it's Carl Benton.

469
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:10,809
Please don't let them
kill my baby, please!

470
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,636
Please!

471
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,266
Benton? I've been trying
to get through to you.

472
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,996
- Yeah, our lines are overloaded.
- Juma's men are here.

473
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,869
- They're raising an army.
- We know.

474
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:24,034
You know?

475
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,667
We don't know how he managed
to pull it off. No one saw it coming,

476
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:29,102
but he's got soldiers
and they're moving in on the capital.

477
00:41:29,227 --> 00:41:31,406
They're here right now, Frank.
They're at my school.

478
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,127
You have to send some marines to help.

479
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:36,307
Well, I can't spare any. They're all
being deployed for the evacuation.

480
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:37,340
Evacuation?

481
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:40,493
The orders came down from the president.
We're rolling up all US nationals.

482
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:42,644
We already started ferrying
people to the border.

483
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,043
Frank, look,
I've got 14 kids hiding in a shelter,

484
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,197
and one is gonna bleed to death
if he doesn't get medical attention.

485
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:51,091
Look, if you want us to get you out,
you need to get here on your own.

486
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,884
The last chopper's leaving in an hour.

487
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:55,588
Frank, don't...
don't strand me like this, please.

488
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,106
My hands are tied, Carl.

489
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,723
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

490
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,897
Damn it!

491
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,053
I'm running out of
ways to ask the question.

492
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,239
Where are the children?

493
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:19,012
You're wasting your time.

494
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,605
They're not gonna find anything.
I already told you they're not here.

495
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,915
You're lying.

496
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,251
No, I'm not.

497
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,395
If you want to find
soldiers for your army,

498
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,342
you're gonna have
to look somewhere else.

499
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:39,393
Where...

500
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,866
are the children?

501
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,224
I told you... I don't know.

502
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:25,330
I will keep doing this
until you beg me to kill you.

503
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:28,193
But I won't kill you even then.

504
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,100
Not until you tell me...

505
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,619
what I want to know.

506
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,156
I'll show you where the kids are.

507
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:40,521
Tell me.

508
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:42,496
I need to show you.

509
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,166
They're in an underground shelter.

510
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:48,157
You will tell me where this shelter is.

511
00:43:48,282 --> 00:43:49,548
Okay, okay, okay.

512
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,980
About 200 meters up the footpath.

513
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,551
Behind the tree line

514
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,278
there's a wooden hatch
under a mound of dirt.

515
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:02,592
Get the children.

516
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:04,975
I'll stay here with him.

517
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:06,522
Don't worry.

518
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:08,953
Once I have these children,

519
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,048
I will kill you quickly.

520
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,377
- You all right, Jack?
- Yeah.

521
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:48,126
The kids are in the shelter.

522
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:49,251
How is Desmond?

523
00:44:49,623 --> 00:44:51,058
He's lost a lot of blood.

524
00:44:51,183 --> 00:44:52,728
The border's five hours from here.

525
00:44:52,868 --> 00:44:54,368
I don't think he's gonna make it.

526
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:58,111
I'll try and get him to the embassy.
They've started evacuating already.

527
00:44:58,236 --> 00:45:00,795
How are you gonna get the kids asylum?
They're not U.S. nationals.

528
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,658
I've got sponsorship papers.
Tramell's gonna let them in,

529
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,800
but I have to go now, Jack.

530
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:08,639
The last chopper leaves in an hour.

531
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:10,021
- You all right?
- Go!

532
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:13,541
Good luck.

533
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,086
Stay here.

534
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:25,840
Jack may need our help.

535
00:45:25,965 --> 00:45:28,775
And if they catch you, they
will make you tell them where we are.

536
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,683
You are endangering the rest of us.

537
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:33,514
We wouldn't have been in danger if
you'd done something about Juma

538
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,389
instead of looking the other way.

539
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:42,479
All right.
Everyone out.

540
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:44,157
Quickly.

541
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,210
Go to the bus, quickly.

542
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,177
Thomas, go get Desmond.

543
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,473
He's in the jeep by the
end of the footpath, all right?

544
00:45:50,598 --> 00:45:51,921
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

545
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:53,482
Go to the bus, go to the bus.

546
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,666
- Go to the bus.
- Where is my brother?

547
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:57,727
- Thomas is gonna get him.
- Then he's all right?

548
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,721
He will be, he will be.
Go to the bus.

549
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,299
Quickly, quickly.

550
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:09,224
Desmond.

551
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,822
It's not as bad as it looks.

552
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:14,236
On the bus. Move.
Quickly. Quickly.

553
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:17,565
Solenz?
Where are you going?

554
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:19,503
I told Mr. Bauer before.

555
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:21,991
The United Nations remains
neutral in this conflict.

556
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:24,697
A UN escort might help
us get where we need to go.

557
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,053
Solenz!

558
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,178
Let him go.

559
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:31,865
He's just trying to save his own ass

560
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,836
because he knows
the children are a target.

561
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:38,224
You're gonna need my help, Carl.

562
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:41,381
Juma's men are gonna set up roadblocks,
checkpoints all the way into the city.

563
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,761
I got one of the soldiers'walkies.
We can use it to try and avoid them.

564
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:48,054
Jack, you won't have to
go anywhere near the embassy.

565
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:51,224
Just help me get the kids to the city.
You can head to the border from there.

566
00:47:01,248 --> 00:47:03,089
Thank you, can you take it easy, please?

567
00:47:03,214 --> 00:47:06,239
- Just keep your hands where I can see.
- I thought told you he's expecting me.

568
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:10,391
Rog, can you call your
watchdog off, please?

569
00:47:10,816 --> 00:47:13,228
Agent Vossler, he's a friend of mine,
you can let him in.

570
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,023
Your friend's jacked up on something.

571
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,269
I'll take care of it.
It's all right.

572
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:22,421
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you.

573
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:27,294
Look, man, I know that my timing right
now must, you know,

574
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:29,132
suck,

575
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,264
so thank you.
It's just, I'm...

576
00:47:31,988 --> 00:47:34,037
I think I'm in a little
bit of trouble here, so...

577
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:36,098
What kind of trouble?
Coke, pills?

578
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,531
You know what, don't
get all righteous on me, Rog, okay?

579
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:41,383
I seem to remember most nights
you party me under the table.

580
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:44,527
- That was a long time ago.
- Yeah, not that long ago.

581
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:47,988
All right,
you got five minutes, so talk fast.

582
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,956
A couple months ago,
Nichols calls me into his office,

583
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,381
says he wants me to
manage a special project.

584
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:01,681
- Special project?
- Yeah. That's what he calls it.

585
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:04,958
He says that he knows that I've taken
some serious hits in the stock market,

586
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,380
and, he's gonna give me
a chance to recover my losses.

587
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:10,555
I mean, the money he paid me...

588
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:14,520
It was crazy.
All I had to do was keep my mouth shut.

589
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:16,117
What did he have you do?

590
00:48:16,242 --> 00:48:18,383
You know, open a few offshore accounts,

591
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:20,564
move a bunch of money in and out,
that type of thing.

592
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,856
So, you helped Nichols
embezzle money from his own firm?

593
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,900
Yeah, that's what I thought
I was doing at first, but, Rog,

594
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:27,411
three days ago,

595
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,589
recognized the prefix
on one of the accounts.

596
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:32,518
It's something the Justice Department
has red-flagged for traders to report,

597
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:36,232
do a little digging

598
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
and...

599
00:48:40,636 --> 00:48:44,136
... turns out that the...
the account holder

600
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,250
is on the terrorist watch list.

601
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:48,933
I know, it's crazy, and it's
all getting a little too weird for me.

602
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:51,935
This morning, there was this
creepy guy in Nichols'office who...

603
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,859
Look, I don't know what he's doing.

604
00:48:55,984 --> 00:48:57,984
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

605
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,098
I'm willing to turn state's evidence.

606
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:02,855
Good, you should go to the FBI.

607
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:07,167
Man, I was just thinking that...

608
00:49:09,036 --> 00:49:10,897
I could probably cut a much better deal

609
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:13,972
if we take this directly
to your mother, you know.

610
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:16,911
You want my mother
to clean up your mess?

611
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:20,367
Chris, what do you
expect me to say to that?

612
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:22,973
What do I... I don't know, Rog.
How about...

613
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:26,178
"I'm sorry to hear
that you're in trouble,

614
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:27,644
"but you're a friend of mine,

615
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:29,839
and I'm gonna do whatever
I can do to help you out."

616
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:38,022
Do you even have any evidence?

617
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,220
Nichols asked me
to destroy some records.

618
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:44,598
I didn't do it.

619
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:45,923
I...

620
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:48,326
I sent them to my hard
drive at home instead.

621
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:51,839
They're coded, but,
you know, they're probably traceable.

622
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:57,406
- Hello, Chris.
- Hey, Sam,

623
00:49:57,901 --> 00:49:59,510
- you look great.
- Thank you.

624
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,957
We really need to leave now.
We're already pushing it.

625
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:05,748
Agent Vossler's in the car waiting.
I'll meet you there.

626
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,796
I'm right behind you.

627
00:50:12,238 --> 00:50:13,966
- See you at work later?
- Right.

628
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,286
- I have to go.
- I know, I know, I know.

629
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:22,133
Look, if I forward you these records,

630
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:24,032
will you at least
show them to your mother?

631
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:26,438
I'm not talking to anybody
until I see them for myself.

632
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,578
Okay, all right, that's...
Look, Rog,

633
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,863
thank you. Just, can you check
your e-mail in one hour?

634
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,199
Clean yourself up, okay?

635
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:43,190
16 mortar teams supported
by 20 forward observers.

636
00:50:43,315 --> 00:50:45,375
Make sure we all have
the same encryption codes.

637
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:49,054
And have a backup in case the
government tries to jam communication.

638
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,414
Sir, General Juma is here.

639
00:51:00,162 --> 00:51:01,516
Welcome home, General.

640
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:04,468
Colonel Dubaku.

641
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:08,875
Look what you've built here.

642
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,831
Our American friends
have been very helpful.

643
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,779
- Did they send us the howitzers?
- Yes.

644
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:18,573
We have them in position about
20 kilometers from the capitol.

645
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:20,910
We can hit any target in the city.

646
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:23,445
All we need is your order
to begin the bombardment.

647
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:26,306
Sir...

648
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,930
one of our checkpoints.

649
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:29,505
Excuse me, General.

650
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,215
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Kintu,

651
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,604
checkpoint delta.

652
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:38,205
We have a man in custody,
a UN relief worker.

653
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:41,611
He was driving to his base, but
we have detained him for questioning.

654
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,248
He says he has information
about your brother.

655
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:46,602
What sort of information?

656
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,522
He says your brother is dead, sir.

657
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:54,610
Your brother and his men... they were
ambushed at the American school.

658
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:58,784
He says that he can help us
find the man who killed your brother.

659
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,273
I'll be right back.

660
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:21,133
I managed to stop the bleeding,
but Desmond's fever is spiking.

661
00:52:21,258 --> 00:52:24,190
If we don't get him to a hospital soon,
he's going to go into shock.

662
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:26,347
We're five kilometers from the city.

663
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:31,997
I'm really sorry about the school.
I know how much you put into it.

664
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,163
Just a bunch of cement and 2x4s, right?

665
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:38,571
What the hell was I thinking?

666
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:41,712
Letting myself believe that
things were finally different here,

667
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,022
that this country had turned a corner.

668
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:47,030
The bus is from the American school.

669
00:52:47,516 --> 00:52:49,439
They are heading into
the city from Okavango.

670
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:52,571
There is only one
of two roads they can go.

671
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:54,442
I am seeing patrols on both.

672
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,080
This is Patrol One, sir.

673
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:58,312
We have not seen a bus
matching that description.

674
00:52:58,437 --> 00:53:00,217
- Where is your position?
- Heading east,

675
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,205
one kilometer west of Okavango Junction.

676
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:04,868
Jack, they're right in front of us.

677
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,985
Everybody, hold on.
Hold on.

678
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:19,153
What is it?

679
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:20,863
A rebel patrol.

680
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:31,571
Carl, we can't get back on that road.

681
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:33,016
Follow the river.

682
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:35,593
If we follow the river.
It leads into the city.

683
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:37,611
Desmond will not make it that far.

684
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:40,633
Then you help him, Thomas,
but we're not getting back on that road.

685
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,693
- Where are we going?
- We're going to walk to the embassy.

686
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:46,711
Let's go, quickly, quickly.

687
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:54,224
Hurry up.

688
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:29,097
The Decision Book.

689
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:35,526
Master protocols for the command
and control of our nuclear arsenal.

690
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:39,357
I never knew how much I
didn't know till I read that book.

691
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:42,167
Are the gold codes in here?

692
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:43,667
Not yet.

693
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,335
Dan Wilcox will deliver
them to your designate.

694
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,433
All right, then.

695
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:55,328
If we're finished here,
I should get going.

696
00:54:55,453 --> 00:54:58,190
Join me for a drink.
A toast to your administration.

697
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:01,588
As much as I'd like to, it's
still a little early in the morning.

698
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:03,715
You sure?

699
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,997
To your administration.

700
00:55:13,617 --> 00:55:14,601
Thank you.

701
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:16,938
Thank you, Mr. President.

702
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,703
Thank you, Mr. President.

703
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:34,305
Please extend my gratitude

704
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,091
to your transition team
for all they've done.

705
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:45,031
You know what the
talking heads are saying?

706
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:49,674
They're saying that I lost this election

707
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:52,146
because I didn't want to win it.
They're saying that...

708
00:55:53,546 --> 00:55:55,025
my heart wasn't in it.

709
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,060
What about you?

710
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:04,163
Me?

711
00:56:05,347 --> 00:56:06,787
Her is dead, sir.

712
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:13,562
I don't believe there's
a simple answer to that question.

713
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:19,141
You are right.

714
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:23,542
Nothing about this job lends
itself to simple answers, just...

715
00:56:25,731 --> 00:56:27,556
jagged edges and moving parts.

716
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,768
Most you won't even see coming
till they've smacked you in the head.

717
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:36,653
So...

718
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:44,026
... be careful,

719
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:46,336
Madame President.

720
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:53,982
See you at the inauguration.

721
00:57:11,581 --> 00:57:13,679
- Are you all right?
- I'm not sure yet.

722
00:57:15,855 --> 00:57:18,703
We just got word of a coup in Sangala.

723
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:22,620
Daniels has ordered the embassy
to evacuate without even consulting me.

724
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:24,439
- Is it the right call?
- Right or wrong

725
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:26,651
he should
have brought me in on the decision.

726
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,859
Maybe he's still bitter
about the election.

727
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:31,472
Noah Daniels isn't that vindictive.

728
00:57:32,602 --> 00:57:36,569
You think he has a reason for pulling
out of Sangala before you take office?

729
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:39,790
Maybe.

730
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,276
I'll call Ethan from the car.

731
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:46,169
If Daniels is hiding anything about
Sangala, he'll be able to dig it up.

732
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:49,494
It's definitely the bus from Okavango.

733
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:52,319
They were here not too long ago,
at least a dozen boys.

734
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:54,518
I don't care how many boys.
How many men?

735
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,958
Just Benton, or is he with
that bastard that killed my brother?

736
00:57:58,093 --> 00:57:59,324
There were two men.

737
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:03,071
Along the river would
be their fastest route.

738
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:04,687
Good.
Colonel Dubaku.

739
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:09,161
I am sorry to hear about your brother,
but I need you here.

740
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:14,932
- Are you ordering me to stay?
- Our campaign is just beginning,

741
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,903
and you are critical to its success.

742
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:22,319
There will be time for you to avenge
your brother after we have taken power.

743
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:29,838
The man who killed my brother
is heading toward the American Embassy.

744
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,227
They are evacuating within an hour.

745
00:58:32,757 --> 00:58:34,343
That is all the time I have

746
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,379
and all the time I need.

747
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:38,833
Sir.

748
00:58:39,575 --> 00:58:41,926
Excuse me, General.
Sir, the men are ready, sir.

749
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:17,939
Is this everything, Mr. Whitley?

750
01:01:26,712 --> 01:01:29,259
You've been stealing financial
records from your office.

751
01:01:29,627 --> 01:01:32,839
Those files are private property,
and I'm here to recover them.

752
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:35,460
Is this everything?

753
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:43,288
Look I, I saw something that didn't look
right... took it home to check it out.

754
01:01:43,413 --> 01:01:47,354
- That's probably a mistake.
- Just calm down. Answer my question.

755
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:53,249
Yeah, that's everything. It's all there.

756
01:01:53,398 --> 01:01:54,692
What about your laptop?

757
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,760
It's... it's in my briefcase
if you want to check it.

758
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:00,577
Did you make any hard copies?

759
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:05,121
No, I swear. I...
I barely even looked at those files.

760
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,669
Who have you shown them to?

761
01:02:07,885 --> 01:02:09,191
No one. Nobody.

762
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:23,433
So...

763
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:28,094
just erase it and then you take
whatever you want then you leave.

764
01:02:32,474 --> 01:02:33,827
Okay? Are we cool?

765
01:02:35,381 --> 01:02:37,530
Hey, hey, do we look like fools to you?

766
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,087
Do we, do we?

767
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,876
Then don't talk to us like we are.

768
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:44,220
- Okay.
- Sit down.

769
01:02:47,168 --> 01:02:48,909
Open your shirt, Mr. Whitley.

770
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:51,283
- Why?
- Your shirt.

771
01:02:53,128 --> 01:02:55,087
- What are you doing?
- You're going to tell us

772
01:02:55,212 --> 01:02:56,509
everything you know.

773
01:02:57,597 --> 01:02:59,107
And we'll know if you're lying.

774
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:06,061
Just leave it alone, okay?
Chris asked me not to tell anyone.

775
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,878
- I... I am not anyone.
- Come on, Sam.

776
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:11,031
- I don't trust him.
- Then trust me.

777
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:17,504
- We're here, sir.
- You made great time, Edward.

778
01:03:22,778 --> 01:03:24,717
Look, I know that Chris is your friend.

779
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,378
It's just this idea of you
having some kind of secret with him?

780
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:30,102
I gave him my word
that I wouldn't tell anyone.

781
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:31,927
You need to respect that, okay?

782
01:03:35,527 --> 01:03:36,383
Okay?

783
01:03:38,668 --> 01:03:39,481
Okay.

784
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:43,852
Big turnout.

785
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:45,473
It's crazy...

786
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:48,121
having a mother who's
the hottest ticket in town.

787
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:02,172
It took some doing,
but we managed to recover the files.

788
01:04:02,956 --> 01:04:04,862
- What's our exposure?
- Unclear.

789
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:08,381
We're working on it now.
Find out and call me back.

790
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:42,511
We're clear.

791
01:04:50,197 --> 01:04:51,500
Stay close. Okay.

792
01:04:55,974 --> 01:04:59,114
There's a road through those
trees that takes us to the city.

793
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:01,084
We should be safe when we get there.

794
01:05:01,218 --> 01:05:04,203
You follow the riverbed,
that'll take you to the border.

795
01:05:04,656 --> 01:05:06,999
All right?
You'll get there before dark.

796
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:10,179
- You sure?
- Jack, we'll be fine.

797
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:12,536
Thanks for helping us get this far.

798
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:24,294
You take care of yourself, Carl.

799
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:52,936
Get the kids in the trees.
In the trees, now! Move!

800
01:06:02,744 --> 01:06:03,918
Run, run!

801
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,842
I can't see them.

802
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:29,124
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Take cover! Take cover!

803
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:48,462
Okay, put us down.
We'll follow them on foot.

804
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,376
Come on.

805
01:07:06,303 --> 01:07:07,258
Come on.

806
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,973
It's or right, let's go.

807
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:20,008
Wait, come back. Come back.

808
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,998
Willie, get back here.

809
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:28,792
Willie, stop! Stop!

810
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:40,175
Stay there. Don't move.

811
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:42,658
- Don't come near me.
- I didn't want to leave this.

812
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:44,324
I know, I know. It's all right.

813
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:51,469
Go with Thomas.

814
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:55,344
Willie, it's all right.
Come with me.

815
01:07:55,543 --> 01:07:56,690
Slowly, slowly.

816
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:59,212
Stay on the path.
Go with the other boys. Go.

817
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:02,631
Forget it, Jack.

818
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:04,749
Just go.

819
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:08,579
Take the kids and go.

820
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:14,985
Damn it, Jack.
There's nothing you can do.

821
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:22,184
Okay, it's round, in a gray casing,

822
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,662
with a Cyrillic B, and the number 291
stenciled on the side.

823
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:27,993
Spring-loaded.

824
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:31,564
Russian antipersonnel mine, five kilo.
I take my weight off and that's it.

825
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:33,783
Going to try and disassemble
the trigger mechanism.

826
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:36,469
- It's got an anti-tamper system.
- That's all right find a workaround.

827
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:39,019
Even if you had the right tools,
it'd take more an hour to disarm.

828
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:41,457
Damn it, there's got to be
a kill switch, just let me find it.

829
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:44,323
- There's no time, Jack. Stop.
- Just give me a second.

830
01:08:54,907 --> 01:08:56,300
It's all right, Jack.

831
01:08:57,715 --> 01:08:59,028
I can die like this.

832
01:08:59,974 --> 01:09:01,765
Just take the kids to the embassy.

833
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:05,384
- Make sure they're safe.
- Carl, don't do this.

834
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:08,620
Here, take, take these.

835
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:11,125
Papers, sponsorship papers.

836
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,749
Give them to Tramell.

837
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:16,185
Please, Jack, please.

838
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:24,366
Give me the rifle.

839
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,346
Let me buy you some time, Jack.

840
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:28,334
Maybe more.

841
01:10:04,195 --> 01:10:05,509
Go ahead with Jack.

842
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,134
- I'll be right behind.
- Mr. Benton!

843
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:09,912
I'll catch up.

844
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,527
We got to go.
Please, come on, let's go.

845
01:10:45,306 --> 01:10:46,400
I'll tell him.

846
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:47,807
Colonel,

847
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:49,399
sir...

848
01:10:50,261 --> 01:10:52,016
we cannot follow them into the city.

849
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:53,899
It's still under government control.

850
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:58,009
Since when do you start giving orders?

851
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,715
I spoke to Udo.

852
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:03,789
He has some men inside the city,

853
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:06,279
looking for Benton and the other man.

854
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,603
With the children,
they won't be hard to find.

855
01:11:09,783 --> 01:11:11,881
Well, I will find them
and kill them myself,

856
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,185
even if I have to go into the city.

857
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,630
Now, go.

858
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:28,092
Colonel Dubaku, look.

859
01:11:50,776 --> 01:11:51,731
Who are you?

860
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:53,482
I'm Benton.

861
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:56,851
Where's your friend?

862
01:11:57,645 --> 01:11:58,680
Which one?

863
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:09,531
Where is he?

864
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,658
I don't know what you're talking about.

865
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:25,256
All right!

866
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:28,096
He's taking them...

867
01:12:30,518 --> 01:12:32,429
- What?
- He's taking them there.

868
01:12:33,936 --> 01:12:35,309
What are you saying?

869
01:12:36,169 --> 01:12:38,733
- What are you saying?
- He's taking them to...

870
01:12:39,365 --> 01:12:40,559
Bring him to me.

871
01:12:46,555 --> 01:12:47,695
Go to hell.

872
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:02,239
- What was that?
- Just keep moving.

873
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,823
Keep going.
Come on, move.

874
01:13:40,612 --> 01:13:43,063
How far to the embassy?
Two more blocks that way.

875
01:13:43,188 --> 01:13:44,655
But we only have ten minutes.

876
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,478
Okay, as soon as we get there,
I'm gonna give you all the paperwork.

877
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:50,661
I want you give that to Mr Tramell. He's
gonna take care everything from there.

878
01:13:50,786 --> 01:13:52,625
Then you're not coming with us?

879
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,775
- Where's Mr. Benton?
- He's not coming.

880
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,388
- Why?
- He's dead.

881
01:13:59,237 --> 01:14:01,838
He was supposed to be behind us!
He said he was coming!

882
01:14:06,177 --> 01:14:08,247
- He lied! Why?!
- Stop it!

883
01:14:08,494 --> 01:14:10,239
- Stop it!
- He lied to me. Why?

884
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,695
Mr. Benton did not lie.

885
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,608
He made one promise to all of you boys,

886
01:14:13,733 --> 01:14:16,480
and that was to protect you
and to make sure that you were safe.

887
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:20,589
Mr. Benton died to make sure
that Juma's soldiers couldn't follow us.

888
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:22,919
Mr. Benton died to make
sure you could get to the embassy.

889
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:25,948
Mr. Benton died to make
sure that you would be safe.

890
01:14:35,168 --> 01:14:36,223
I'm so sorry.

891
01:14:39,571 --> 01:14:41,044
Willie, we have to go.

892
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,952
It's what Mr.
Benton would have wanted.

893
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:45,500
Okay?

894
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:47,068
You okay?

895
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:50,137
Let's go. Come on.

896
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:51,754
Willie, come on, come on.

897
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:58,561
It's okay. Come on. Let's go, let's go.

898
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:04,863
Stop.

899
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:08,084
Thomas, take the boys,
hide behind the car now. Move. Move.

900
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:10,041
Get behind the car.
Everybody, now.

901
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:11,781
Down, down.

902
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:54,214
Kill the cockroach.

903
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:56,664
Kill the cockroach.

904
01:15:57,545 --> 01:15:58,680
Put the gun down.

905
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,468
I don't want to hurt you.
Just put the gun down.

906
01:16:02,486 --> 01:16:03,422
Willie, wait!

907
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,673
I know you're scared. Just put the gun
down. I'm not gonna hurt you.

908
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:10,331
Just put the gun down now.

909
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:17,191
You see those boys?
They're just like you.

910
01:16:17,316 --> 01:16:19,559
I'm trying to get them out
of the country somewhere safe.

911
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:22,831
Somewhere where no one can
hurt them. You can come with us.

912
01:16:22,956 --> 01:16:24,489
Just put the gun down.

913
01:16:26,103 --> 01:16:28,670
Come on. Just like me. Watch. See?

914
01:16:28,996 --> 01:16:30,090
It's going down.

915
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:31,720
Like me.

916
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:34,133
Come with me,
I promise you no one will hurt you.

917
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,282
No one will hurt you.

918
01:16:39,256 --> 01:16:41,982
- Wait.
- Come on, Jack, we have to go!

919
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:43,630
We have to go now!

920
01:16:44,202 --> 01:16:45,209
Boys!

921
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:48,044
Come with me now. Come on.
Let's go.

922
01:16:48,414 --> 01:16:50,185
Everybody hold hands.
Come on!

923
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:04,128
Expecting a call?

924
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:06,599
This is about Chris, isn't it?

925
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:08,784
He was supposed to send
me something 15 min ago.

926
01:17:08,909 --> 01:17:10,680
Call him later. Your mother's here.

927
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:21,853
It's been a long journey,
Madame President.

928
01:17:21,978 --> 01:17:24,187
I'm afraid we're just getting started.

929
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:29,116
Our Africa group is preparing
a brief on Sangala.

930
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,746
You'll have it on your desk
as soon as you're done here.

931
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:34,910
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Congratulations.

932
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:36,079
Thank you.

933
01:17:36,204 --> 01:17:38,234
- Good to see you.
- Good morning.

934
01:17:38,725 --> 01:17:40,198
Thank you so much.

935
01:17:43,078 --> 01:17:45,279
You look beautiful, Madame President.

936
01:17:46,126 --> 01:17:47,539
Thank you, Samantha.

937
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:49,764
Father.

938
01:17:50,483 --> 01:17:53,209
It's nice to see you on time for once.

939
01:17:55,046 --> 01:17:58,101
- How are you holding up?
- It still doesn't feel quite real.

940
01:17:58,728 --> 01:18:00,048
It will soon enough.

941
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:08,629
Whitley need some encouragement,
but he told my man everything.

942
01:18:11,736 --> 01:18:15,022
- How much does Roger Taylor know?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

943
01:18:15,721 --> 01:18:17,532
But he knows Nichols was involved.

944
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:20,236
All he knows is that his desperate,

945
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:23,167
drug-addicted friend
told him some crazy story.

946
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,230
He's got no evidence.

947
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:27,217
If he finds Nichols, he could find me.

948
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:29,995
Not without evidence.

949
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:36,963
Sir, Whitley's no longer a problem.

950
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:38,769
We limited the damage.

951
01:18:40,093 --> 01:18:41,824
But you haven't eliminated it.

952
01:18:47,115 --> 01:18:48,767
Keep your eye on Taylor.

953
01:19:13,269 --> 01:19:16,264
Stay together! Stay together!

954
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:19,729
Sergeant!

955
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:22,094
I need to see Frank Tramell
he's expecting me!

956
01:19:22,219 --> 01:19:24,548
- Who are you?
- Jack Bauer!

957
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:28,675
Don't worry, Desmond!
We made it!

958
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,931
We're going to America!

959
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,176
Tramell!

960
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:55,724
Listen to me, I've got 14
children seeking political asylum.

961
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:57,798
All of them are R-1 status!

962
01:19:57,946 --> 01:19:59,813
One of them needs urgent medical care!

963
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:01,753
- Where's Benton?
- He's dead!

964
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:05,399
Wait! Wait!
I've got their paperwork.

965
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:08,893
- Show me.
- Keep Desmond up.

966
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:10,871
There!

967
01:20:18,076 --> 01:20:20,966
Desmond, it's all right.
Just stay with me. Come on!

968
01:20:32,904 --> 01:20:35,675
- They appear to be in order.
- Then open the gate, and let them in!

969
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:37,485
There's just one small problem.

970
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,043
They need the legal
guardianship of a US citizen.

971
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:42,396
Guardianship?!
I already told you, Benton is dead!

972
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:44,337
He died getting these children here!

973
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:47,865
Then don't let him have died in vain.
Surrender yourself to the subpoena,

974
01:20:48,021 --> 01:20:50,424
and the Ambassador will
waive the issue of guardianship.

975
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,757
Tramell, I am warning you,
leave me out of this.

976
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,222
I'm afraid I can't do that.

977
01:20:54,531 --> 01:20:56,581
We are talking about innocent children.

978
01:20:56,739 --> 01:20:58,570
Whatever happens to them is all on you.

979
01:20:58,884 --> 01:21:01,048
Would really leave these
children out here in the street,

980
01:21:01,173 --> 01:21:04,176
knowing what you do about Juma?!
Damn it, Frank!

981
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,596
They'll be used as cannon fodder!

982
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:09,293
Or slaughtered in the soccer
stadium for entertainment!

983
01:21:09,418 --> 01:21:12,482
I am giving you the chance
to make sure that doesn't happen!

984
01:21:13,374 --> 01:21:14,807
The choice is yours.

985
01:21:22,603 --> 01:21:25,462
I don't have a choice,
you son of a bitch. Open the gate.

986
01:21:29,243 --> 01:21:30,508
Hold on, boys.

987
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:32,829
Hold on. Desmond, come on!

988
01:21:34,165 --> 01:21:35,478
You in first, Bauer.

989
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:40,051
It's all right, Willie. It's all right.
It's all right.

990
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,366
All right,
take him into custody right now.

991
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,051
Let them in! Let them in!

992
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:49,355
Let them in!

993
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:52,163
They're with me! Let them in, damn it!

994
01:22:04,609 --> 01:22:06,675
No! Those two are with me, too!

995
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:08,928
All of them! All of them!

996
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:14,686
It's all right, Willie. Just go
with them. Go with the soldiers.

997
01:22:14,885 --> 01:22:16,398
Put them on the choppers.

998
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:30,142
It's all right.

999
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,274
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

1000
01:22:40,597 --> 01:22:42,816
I, Allison Taylor, do solemnly swear...

1001
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,575
I, Allison Taylor, do solemnly swear...

1002
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,156
That I will faithfully execute

1003
01:22:47,281 --> 01:22:49,601
the office of the President
of the United States.

1004
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,363
That I will faithfully execute

1005
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:53,831
the office of the President
of the United States.

1006
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:56,457
And will to the best of my ability,
preserve,

1007
01:22:56,582 --> 01:22:59,472
protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

1008
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:02,146
And will to the best of my ability,
preserve,

1009
01:23:02,271 --> 01:23:06,113
protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

1010
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:08,905
- So help me, God.
- So help me, God.

1011
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,304
- Congratulations, Madame President.
- Thank you.

1012
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,049
When the founders of our country

1013
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:35,522
boldly declared America's
independence to the world,

1014
01:23:36,798 --> 01:23:39,883
they knew that they derived
their power to govern

1015
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,668
from three basic human rights:

1016
01:23:43,438 --> 01:23:47,438
life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

1017
01:23:49,389 --> 01:23:50,424
Today,

1018
01:23:51,123 --> 01:23:52,859
we rededicate ourselves

1019
01:23:53,391 --> 01:23:57,272
to the preservation
of those inalienable rights.

1020
01:23:58,818 --> 01:24:01,595
But even as we carry forth the torch lit

1021
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:03,087
by those great men,

1022
01:24:04,077 --> 01:24:05,453
we need to rember,

1023
01:24:06,596 --> 01:24:10,517
its light doesn't always
shine as brightly as it should.

1024
01:24:12,262 --> 01:24:14,491
It flickers and grows dim

1025
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:16,869
because of apathy,

1026
01:24:18,243 --> 01:24:19,277
greed...

1027
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:21,831
and fear.

1028
01:24:25,213 --> 01:24:26,725
De Tocqueville said,

1029
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,103
"In every democracy,

1030
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,845
the people get the government
they deserve."

1031
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:36,453
Today...

1032
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:38,970
I am asking each of you

1033
01:24:39,898 --> 01:24:41,865
to help me give you

1034
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:44,546
the government you deserve.

1035
01:24:46,718 --> 01:24:49,273
We all share the responsibility

1036
01:24:49,703 --> 01:24:51,972
history has placed in our hands.

1037
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:54,940
The future.

1038
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,049
Our future.

1039
01:25:00,538 --> 01:25:01,652
Depends on it.
