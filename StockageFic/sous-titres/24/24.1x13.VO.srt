1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:18,292
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:21,524
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,685
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:31,050
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,850
- Mr Drazen.
- You found Bauer?

6
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,562
- No, but we're doing everything possible.
- I'm pulling the plug on you.

7
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:43,885
You were supposed to frame Bauer for the
assassination of Palmer, but he's still alive.

8
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:48,763
- Give me a little more time.
- I'll give you 30 minutes. Then I take over.

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,406
- We found their inside person: Jamey.
- People died because ofyou.

10
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,927
- I didn't think anyone would die.
- Well, they did.

11
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:57,567
Get her out of those!

12
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:58,608
We need medical help.

13
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,207
Jack, Jamey tried to kill herself.

14
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:03,962
That was the clinic. Jamey didn't make it.

15
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,409
I got a call from Maureen Kingsley. She's
gonna publicly accuse my son of murder.

16
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,167
- And the second source?
- George Ferragamo.

17
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,403
He was your son's therapist for four years.

18
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,565
I wanted to talk about my son.
Whatever you leaked to Kingsley,

19
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:22,486
certain people
wanna stop you from confirming it.

20
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:26,691
You've covered up one murder, and now
you're threatening me if I don't keep quiet?

21
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,445
I'm trying to protect you.

22
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:33,288
There was a fire. They say it might have been
a broken gas line. He didn't get out in time.

23
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,362
It was murder.

24
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,812
Anything goes wrong, everyone
around the car dies, starting with you.

25
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:42,966
- I'm on my way to Teri and Kim now.
- You cannot go into an armed camp.

26
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:46,966
- Kim!
- Daddy! Oh, my God! I knew you'd come.

27
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,931
- Where are you?
- I found the people behind the Palmer hit.

28
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:52,129
You're one of 'em
unless you prove otherwise.

29
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,091
- Kim?
- It's OK. He's the one who gave us the gun.

30
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:58,051
- Why are you helping them?
- Cos I got Kim into this.

31
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,646
- You trust him?
- I do.

32
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,371
Hold on!

33
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,485
On the satellite photos
you'll see an old water tower.

34
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,723
Follow the creek bed and run like hell!

35
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,722
Stay down.

36
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,963
Keep moving.

37
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,808
Neill, cut them off at the service road.

38
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:09,249
- The rest of you, come up behind him.
- Ira...

39
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,528
How could you let this happen?

40
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:17,091
We're cutting them off at the service road.
Bauer, his wife and daughter. And Rick.

41
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,926
Make sure they don't double back.

42
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,483
- I thought I could handle him. I thought...
- Stop thinking.

43
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,283
OK, we... we have to keep moving.

44
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,967
- What if Dad isn't...
- No, your dad's OK.

45
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,521
He told us to meet him
by the water tower and we will.

46
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:52,845
We just have to follow the creek.
Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Come on!

47
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:04,403
- I can't...
- Shut up. You can and you will.

48
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:08,281
- I'm slowing you down.
- Yes, you are, so you'd better speed up.

49
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,449
Sh. Get down. Get down!

50
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,924
Where are you?

51
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,324
Yeah. I got nothing.

52
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,924
Sh. We can move.

53
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:16,724
Wait. Come here. Get down.

54
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,728
What are we gonna do, Mom?

55
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:36,929
We can't go back, we can't go forward.
They're everywhere.

56
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:43,852
I think... we can catch the road further up
where it cuts through the woods.

57
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:47,926
- Dad told us to follow the creek bed.
- We don't really have a choice, do we?

58
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,163
We'll go up here. Come on.

59
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,807
The subscriberyou are trying to reach...

60
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,605
Hey. The property where
they're holding Jack's family

61
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:17,810
was leased six months ago
by a company that doesn't exist.

62
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:19,884
I have to go over the tax records.

63
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:25,481
- You all right?
- Jack's still not answering his cell.

64
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,606
Well, he could've shut it off
to keep it from ringing.

65
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,366
- Or maybe something's happened to him.
- Oh, look.

66
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:34,013
If anybody can
take care of himself, it's Jack.

67
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:38,530
Plus our tactical units should be there soon.
Bundy's heading up the operation. He's good.

68
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:42,367
Maybe you were right.
I should have brought Green in sooner.

69
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,570
You let Jack make the call
because it was his family on the line.

70
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,087
- What could you do?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:59,683
Look, I'm sorry. Since this whole thing
got started, I guess I've been a little harsh.

72
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,727
A little?

73
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,883
OK, maybe a lot.

74
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:09,932
I just... I've been afraid, and I...

75
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,208
You don't have to explain. All right?

76
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:15,490
You wanna talk about us,
we'll talk about it later, OK?

77
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:20,124
- I just want you to know that it's nothing...
- You're bringing in Jamey Farrell's mother?

78
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:22,044
Yes, to pick up Kyle, her son.

79
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:25,091
Before she sees him,
I want the two of you to question her.

80
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:28,404
If she has information that can help
protect Palmer, I need to know.

81
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:32,930
- What makes you think she has?
- $300,000 was deposited in her bank account

82
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,004
over the last four months.

83
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:42,761
They killed George Ferragamo.
That fire was no accident.

84
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:46,004
I wanna talk to Maureen Kingsley,
then go right to the DA.

85
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:49,005
Wait until you have the facts
before you go off.

86
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,005
The facts? Ferragamo was killed
so I could get elected.

87
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,084
- You don't know that.
- Then what?

88
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:00,089
I'm just saying, let's take a beat, see how
we should play this, before we do anything.

89
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,368
There's only one way to play this, Mike.

90
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:05,604
Maureen Kingsley will get
the story of her career after all.

91
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,332
- David...
- And after I talk to her I wanna see the DA.

92
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:11,962
- Shouldn't you run this by Sherry?
- Why? So she can try to talk me out of it?

93
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:16,888
She's your wife, David.
This is her life too. She deserves to know.

94
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:26,488
- Has the compound been cleared?
- Yes. There's been a change of plan.

95
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,043
- Meaning?
- Bauer showed up here like I said he would.

96
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,523
- You have him?
- Not yet, but I will.

97
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:39,762
Congratulations, Ira. You may have
bought yourself a second chance.

98
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,926
My contract included killing Palmer.
I wanna make good on it.

99
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:48,291
The way you were talking, it sounded like
you handed it off to someone else.

100
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:52,764
Bring me Bauer's body.
Then we'll talk about the senator.

101
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:56,006
You'll hear from me soon.

102
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,888
Drazen?

103
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,205
Yeah. Either we eliminate Bauer
or Drazen eliminates us.

104
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,363
- And that's the only option here?
- Basically.

105
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,967
Getting Bauer's not as easy as it sounds.

106
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,208
He phoned in some
GPS coordinates to somebody.

107
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:18,922
Whoever that is, I'm sure they're
gonna be calling the cavalry in soon.

108
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:22,323
I say we just cut our losses
and get the hell outta here.

109
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:25,485
You don't just get out with these people.
They come after you.

110
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:28,531
They keep coming until they find you,
no matter where you are.

111
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:31,047
And when they do...

112
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:35,012
Believe me, killing Bauer
is our only chance of staying alive.

113
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:14,642
They should have been here by now.
Come here. Sit down.

114
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,122
Easy, easy.

115
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,204
Here, let me take a look at it.

116
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:26,689
OK. This is gonna sting for a while,
but you're not mortally wounded.

117
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,527
The bullet passed straight through.
It didn't hit any bone or major artery.

118
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,491
- You got any loose clothing?
- Yeah, in my back pocket.

119
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,564
I got it.

120
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,283
Take a deep breath.

121
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,846
- Wait. Hold up, honey, hold up.
- Are you OK?

122
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:51,290
Yeah, no, I just...
I just wanna check where we are. We...

123
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:57,608
We... we may have veered a little south,
but we should have hit the road by now.

124
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,767
I can't see it. Do you see it up ahead?

125
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,408
You don't know where we are, do you?

126
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,724
Mom.

127
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,445
We're lost, aren't we?

128
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,683
No.

129
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,207
We should just go straight.

130
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,887
- It should be just up ahead.
- Are you sure?

131
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,452
That'll help stop the bleeding.

132
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:49,684
That's good.

133
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,933
Mike's your advisor. What's his advice?

134
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,569
He agrees with me.

135
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:13,043
He thinks you're making a mistake
by trying to take them on.

136
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:17,729
- They've already covered up one death.
- No, you don't know about Ferragamo.

137
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:24,244
But even if you're right,

138
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,888
will turning this into a media circus
bring him back to life?

139
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:35,047
- That's not the point.
- Your career. And your family.

140
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:39,850
You're... you're throwing away
everything you've built

141
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,203
without any hard evidence
of what really happened.

142
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:46,284
The police will find the evidence.

143
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:52,005
No. They won't, because
Carl and the people he works for,

144
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:56,132
they will twist the system
to get the result that they want.

145
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:59,244
That's what they do, David.

146
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,322
And you'll be left with nothing.

147
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,610
Sweetheart, to fight these people
you need power.

148
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:21,332
The kind of power you'll have
once you become president.

149
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:31,643
We knew from the start
that this was going to be an uphill race.

150
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,004
But we're almost there.

151
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,204
Look at the polls.

152
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:47,564
- Sherry, I don't know.
- No. Think, David, think.

153
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:59,886
Think of the millions of lives you can
make better once you win the candidacy.

154
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,964
How can I do the job

155
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,284
when my own house isn't in order?

156
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,564
David.

157
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:24,731
I told them to wait for us here at the water
tower. You heard me say that, right? Dammit.

158
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:28,010
- What are you gonna do?
- I gotta go back and find 'em.

159
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,485
- Green.
- It's Jack.

160
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,451
- There's been a complication.
- I'm listening.

161
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,684
Teri and Kim are not where they should be.
I've gotta find them.

162
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:42,162
I need to let the team
know where to pick you up.

163
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:45,325
Tell them to meet us at a water tower,
north area of the compound.

164
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:48,689
Check your satellite photos.
It's overlooking a reservoir.

165
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:52,891
Alberta, if I'm not back when the team
arrives, they're gonna find a kid in here.

166
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:55,806
- His name is Rick. He's wounded.
- Who is he?

167
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:57,804
Someone who helped us get out of there.

168
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:00,851
- Three tactical units are on their way.
- How much longer?

169
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,572
- 10 minutes. 15, tops.
- OK, I copy. Out.

170
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,729
- Jack.
- What?

171
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:09,883
Thanks.

172
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,567
Don't thank me. Thank my daughter.

173
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,962
This whole thing,
I had no idea what was going on.

174
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:19,329
Dan said we were just scaring
some guys who'd backed out of a deal.

175
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:23,884
Yeah, well, when you started to see what was
happening, you should have done something.

176
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:26,282
He was my friend.

177
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:31,163
Hey, you kidnapped my daughter.
You're gonna have to live with that.

178
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,970
Son, part of getting a second chance
is taking responsibility

179
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:41,807
for the mess you made in the first place,
you understand me?

180
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,882
Good. I'll be back in a few minutes.

181
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:23,411
That shack over there. Maybe we can
find it on this to see where we are.

182
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,806
See? I don't think we're as far off as I thought.

183
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,041
Mom!

184
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,804
Honey, come on. Stay down.

185
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,284
Go, go.

186
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,764
Down. Down.

187
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:13,682
It's Gaines.
Everyone circle back to section five.

188
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,045
OK. When he gets
to the back of the shed, we'll go.

189
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,328
- What if he sees us?
- We'll be all right.

190
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,724
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

191
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:42,045
- Mom, you keep saying that, but...
- It's gonna be fine, I promise, honey. It's fine.

192
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,488
- Mom!
- Teri, stay down!

193
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,243
- Jack!
- Are you both OK?

194
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,846
- Yeah.
- Come here.

195
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,731
This is Gaines. Who's shooting?

196
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,047
Whoever's shooting,
call in your position now!

197
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,443
Dammit! They're gonna swarm this place.
We gotta get outta here.

198
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,444
- Where's Rick? Is he OK?
- He's fine.

199
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,683
- Where is he?
- Waiting at the water tower.

200
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:22,322
CTU's sending a chopper.
We gotta get outta here now. Hold on.

201
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:31,243
OK, come on, it's clear. Come on,
we gotta move. We don't have much time.

202
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,401
Hello, Mrs Vasquez. Thank you for coming in.

203
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,803
- They said I could pick up my grandson.
- We'll take you to him soon.

204
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:10,283
- First we wanna ask you a few questions.
- Yes, I have a question too.

205
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:15,003
How can a woman bleed to death,
and nobody does anything about it?

206
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,722
We're sorry about Jamey, Mrs Vasquez.

207
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,802
But it wasn't like that.

208
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,286
My daughter's dead, isn't she?

209
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:33,884
Please... take me to Kyle.

210
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,282
We really do have to ask you a few questions.

211
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:39,763
- I'm not interested in your questions.
- Mrs Vasquez.

212
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:45,362
Your daughter was a traitor.

213
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,446
- What?
- She confessed before she died.

214
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:55,291
And if you withhold information,
you can be held as an accomplice.

215
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,245
If that happens,
who's gonna take care of Kyle?

216
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:12,048
What do you want to know?

217
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,762
IRS records show you earn $45,000 a year.

218
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:21,371
But an account in your name shows a series
of deposits adding up to more than $300,000.

219
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:28,330
It's... It's from Jamey.

220
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:34,851
So that Kyle would have enough money
in case something happened to her.

221
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,322
Who gave Jamey the money?

222
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,293
- She never said.
- And you never asked?

223
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:47,452
All this money in your account, and
you never once asked where it came from?

224
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,964
Kyle needs you.

225
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,202
Don't do anything to jeopardise that.

226
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:07,848
Maxton and Neill, you're the only two who
haven't checked in yet. Where are you?

227
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,163
One more time. Maxton and Neill.

228
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:16,009
- This is Maxton.
- Where are you? Why haven't you called in?

229
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:20,769
We're crossing the creek bed,
trying to cut off Bauer from the service road.

230
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:24,050
Not if you keep telling me where you are.
Give me the PalmPilot.

231
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:29,412
Neill is the only one who hasn't called in.
Maxton, what area was Neill patrolling?

232
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:33,281
Uh... the northeast side ofthe creek.
He split offon his own.

233
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,208
OK. They're coming from over there.

234
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:40,844
We can hit the road down a little farther,
avoid them completely. Come on.

235
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:51,411
Maureen? Don't make me get hotel security.
I know you're in there.

236
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:06,043
- Why are you shutting me out?
- I think we've said everything we need to say.

237
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,124
Can I at least come in?

238
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:13,808
Maureen, please. Open the door and let me in.

239
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:25,690
I know I asked you
to back off the story about my son.

240
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,564
But I've changed my mind.

241
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,923
Dr Ferragamo's dead.

242
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,487
- You already knew.
- I don't wanna hear any more.

243
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:40,643
What do you mean, you don't wanna hear it?

244
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:43,167
- I've left the network.
- What?

245
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,131
- When?
- You should leave it alone too.

246
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,651
That's my advice. As a friend.

247
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,124
They got to you.

248
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,009
Did they pay you off?

249
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:01,529
Because I wouldn't have thought
you were for sale.

250
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,612
They threatened you too.

251
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,245
- I'll see that you're protected.
- I have protected myself.

252
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,530
Maureen. You're withholding
evidence in a capital crime.

253
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:22,526
What evidence? Dr Ferragamo is dead.

254
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,604
His files have been destroyed.

255
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:28,732
- But the piece of paper with Keith's writing...
- There is no piece of paper.

256
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:33,212
Not any more.

257
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:36,285
There's still my word.
It counts for something.

258
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:39,484
It's not enough, Senator.

259
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:43,448
Not against these people.

260
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,241
I'm sorry.

261
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,169
- There's no radio.
- Bauer's been listening.

262
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:25,244
To every damn word!

263
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,090
Mrs Vasquez has received
two wire transfers since January.

264
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:35,166
Both from a holding company
called Luca Univox based in Belgrade.

265
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,483
Jack suggested a connection to Belgrade.

266
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:42,169
- He was on assignment there two years ago.
- Did you check for a connection to the hit?

267
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:45,051
These new files may give us a new angle.

268
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:49,524
So who do we know in Belgrade
who's keyed into the financial community?

269
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,124
Come on.

270
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,403
Can you call them?

271
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:12,088
Maybe. The chopper
should have been here by now.

272
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:15,802
- What about Rick? Isn't he meeting us here?
- Dammit. No signal.

273
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:21,762
Rick was wounded. He's in the water tower.
When the chopper arrives, he'll come out.

274
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,764
- So what are we waiting for?
- Kim.

275
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:27,732
- Shouldn't he at least know we're here?
- When your father says it's OK.

276
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:29,963
- There's no one even around. Dad.
- Kim, no!

277
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,404
Get back! Get back!

278
00:26:39,653 --> 00:26:42,213
- It's a sniper rifle.
- What do we do?

279
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:48,083
Stay here. Don't move for anything
but the chopper. Do you understand me?

280
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,084
- Where are you going?
- He wants me.

281
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,164
Jack!

282
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,647
He's trying to draw us away from the women.

283
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:31,805
It's fine by me.
Once he's dead, they'll be easy.

284
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:36,011
I'll keep him pinned down.
Circle around till you get a clear shot.

285
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:16,968
- Dammit.
- That's right, Jack.

286
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:19,567
You don't have a shot from that distance.

287
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:26,486
- How much longer do we have?
- Until what?

288
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,043
Until your people get here.

289
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:34,693
I wouldn't wait around
to find out if I were you.

290
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:38,891
I don't have a choice.
The people I work for made that pretty clear.

291
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,205
Agh!

292
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,412
The DA's inside. You want me to sit in?

293
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:01,453
Give me a minute.

294
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,728
- Sir?
- It's OK.

295
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,804
He's with the campaign.

296
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:14,008
The DA's down the hall, Carl.
Waiting for me to tell a story.

297
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:20,244
- It's over.
- See, and I think it's just getting started.

298
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,568
Don't get stupid on me now, David.

299
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:30,363
- It seems I've been stupid for a long time.
- Then open your eyes for once.

300
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:34,366
This... the whole thing, it's one big machine.

301
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:38,765
I'm the oil that keeps the pistons pumping,
the motor turning, the wheels spinning...

302
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,969
Not any more.

303
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:43,487
I like you, David. I really do.

304
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:47,486
And I think you would make
one hell of a commander in chief.

305
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,565
I know what you did to Ferragamo.

306
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:54,726
Every engine produces waste.
It's the physics of the situation.

307
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:59,125
- Listen to yourself.
- Consider the alternatives.

308
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:03,923
A year from now, you'll either be promoting
your agenda for the nation,

309
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:06,163
or visiting your son in prison.

310
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:12,044
- A jury will believe that it was an accident.
- I'm not talking about the rapist, David.

311
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:14,931
I'm talking about Dr Ferragamo.

312
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,524
- Keith had nothing to do with Ferragamo.
- Of course he didn't.

313
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:24,164
But if somebody were
to mention the word "arson"...

314
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:31,484
You son of a bitch!

315
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,283
You planted something?

316
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:39,889
The people we both work for, David,
they know how to get what they want.

317
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:52,328
Hi, Mike.

318
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,003
What was that all about?

319
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:10,122
The DA's waiting in there.
What do you want me to say?

320
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,204
Tell him I'm sorry.

321
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:18,129
I have nothing to say.

322
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,283
I made a mistake.

323
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,841
I don't understand.

324
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:25,003
I'm running for president, Mike.

325
00:32:26,893 --> 00:32:29,453
And I'm gonna win.

326
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,884
- Hey!
- Over here!

327
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:04,964
Hey!

328
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,404
Wait.

329
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:29,691
Federal agent! Drop your weapons!
Put your hands in the air!

330
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,172
- Mrs Bauer?
- Yes!

331
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:34,848
Put your hands down. Do you
or your daughter need medical attention?

332
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,810
- No, but my husband...
- Where is he?

333
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:39,248
- I don't know. He's somewhere up there.
- Go!

334
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:41,206
Come on.

335
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,562
Stay back.

336
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,529
Kim!

337
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,047
- Mrs Bauer, wait!
- It's all right. Kim!

338
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:57,567
Kim! Kimberly, stop. Kim!

339
00:33:58,853 --> 00:33:59,922
Kim.

340
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:07,962
- Dad said he'd be in here. Where is he?
- Wherever he is, they'll find him.

341
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:10,283
- What if Gaines found him?
- He'd be dead.

342
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:13,604
They'd be carrying him
outta here in a body bag.

343
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:17,606
- No. He's gotta be here. I gotta find him.
- Just stop it, Kimberly.

344
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:21,489
I know you care about this boy,
but I need you to be here for me now,

345
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:24,485
and your dad needs
both of us to be there for him.

346
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,404
You're losing blood.

347
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:25,371
Not enough to stop me from killing you.

348
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:29,202
Maybe neither ofus has to die.

349
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,287
Like I said, Jack, I don't have that choice.

350
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:41,123
Then maybe at least
you can tell me what's going on.

351
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:54,808
Cofell. He mentioned
something about Belgrade.

352
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:58,602
That was a military operation.
How's Palmer connected to that?

353
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:02,322
- You were there, Jack. You should know.
- Let's say I don't.

354
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:21,249
Neither do I. The less I know,
the better I can do my job.

355
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,927
That'sjust the nature ofour business.

356
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,931
Then why did you bring my family into this?

357
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:36,564
That might have been a mistake.

358
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,684
They wanted to make it personal.

359
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,524
Who's "they"?

360
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:51,363
Put down the weapon, Mr Gaines.
We can protect you.

361
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,404
No, you can't.

362
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:01,004
Put down the weapon!

363
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,482
Good luck.

364
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:26,123
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

365
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,807
Interlace your fingers behind your head.

366
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,651
Sir, we have Bauer in custody.
We also have another man down.

367
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:39,645
- Bring Bauer to the landing zone right away.
- Roger. Bringing him in.

368
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,130
- Sweetheart?
- Jack!

369
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,443
- Oh!
- Oh, thank God you're OK!

370
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:38,607
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you all right?

371
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:42,686
- Yeah. This nightmare's finally over, right?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.

372
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:44,764
OK.

373
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,887
Agent Bauer, the chopper's waiting for you.

374
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:50,931
My family's been through hell.
I want them to fly with me.

375
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,447
- That'll be fine. Come on.
- OK.

376
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,524
- Sweetheart, put this on.
- OK.

377
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:28,289
Jack and his family were rescued.
They should be here in 10 minutes.

378
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:34,924
Good news. But we need to move fast on
something else. A lead from Jamey's mom.

379
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,686
- Where was the money from?
- An offshore bank account.

380
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:40,526
- We traced the funds to Belgrade.
- Belgrade?

381
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:43,685
Before I tell you,
upgrade the threat assessment on Palmer.

382
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:47,766
- You need to give me more than that...
- The same account shows a transfer of funds

383
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:49,969
to an assassin based in Belgrade.

384
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:52,248
That's old news. The photographer.

385
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:57,043
No. Our contact over there says
this assassin left Yugoslavia this morning.

386
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,601
Which means he's probably already here.

387
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,642
- A second hitter.
- Mm-hm.

388
00:42:00,173 --> 00:42:02,971
