1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,156
The Americans know our location.

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,708
We need to launch the drone
before they close in.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,473
We'll find a way
to deliver the other two bombs.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,039
Launch the drone.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,958
- I can't find the drone.
- Use projected vectors.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,110
I am. It's not where it's supposed to be.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,590
Until you find it,
I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,274
We figured out
how the drone can stay hidden.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,115
Whoever is piloting it
can anticipate our directives.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,715
Our data is being relayed to the drone pilot
through a work station here.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,951
- We have a leak.
- Find who's subverting our system.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,271
It is Nadia.
The signature trace matches her computer.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,191
Surrender your station.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,669
- Who are you streaming data to?
- What?

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,637
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,439
- Let her go.
- What the hell are you doing?

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,557
We got the drone pilot's location.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,074
We're not through with her, Milo.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,388
What's your status?

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,074
The drone pilot is down. I'm at his controls.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,718
The target is San Francisco.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,917
I can't deactivate the bomb.
I'm fighting a stall.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,039
I'm losing control.
I need to find a place to land it.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,116
None of the first responders are reporting
a detonation. The bomb did not go off.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,192
Move out!
There's radioactive material in this area.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,872
We took control of the aircraft,
crash-landing it at the edge of the city.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,273
But the bomb's core was compromised
and radioactive material was released.

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,954
So what we're dealing with is a dirty bomb?

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,476
- Sir, it was a radiological spill.
- It was an attack on our nation.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,676
I warned the ambassador, Tom.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,718
We were led to believe
this warning shot would be fired

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,190
only in response to
the detonation of a nuclear device.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,909
They need to see with their own eyes
that I will answer this threat

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,833
with an in-kind military response.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,037
The order's given. Launch the missile...

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,236
as soon as they're in range.

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,072
- Prep two units of plasma.
- You need to keep him alive.

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,277
Gredenko's got two more bombs.
This man's our only link.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,672
Jack, I talked to CTU. There's a situation
where the drone went down.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,752
The bomb casing cracked.
It dispersed in the air.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,992
- How bad is the fallout?
- Casualties should be minimal.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,150
They're starting to evacuate.

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,155
Go through the pilot's databases.
See if you can find any link to Gredenko.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,754
Agent Bauer, he didn't make it.

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,475
Dammit.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,551
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack.

47
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,518
- What did you get from the pilot?
- Nothing, he's dead.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,592
We're running down leads.
Nothing's come up on Gredenko.

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,069
Doyle told me the fallout was containable?

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,508
It's not that simple. The incident has created
serious policy complications in Washington.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,195
Daniels has ordered a nuclear strike
against Fayed's country.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,637
What's he trying to do? Start World War III?
It'll be seen as an act of aggression.

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,032
- We have to find Fayed and Gredenko fast.
- When is it happening?

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,079
- Within the hour.
- That doesn't give us enough time.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,151
I'll get back to you.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
(ringing tone)

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,068
(TV)... how an explosive device could have
been secreted into the White House bunker.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Victor is still not answering.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,473
Because the Americans found him.

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,791
The bomb was supposed to hit San Francisco
ten minutes ago.

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,228
- But there's nothing on the news.
- Even if you're right, we are safe here.

62
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,595
Victor doesn't know our location.

63
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,235
- So we can continue our operation safely.
- What operation?

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,472
There is no operation.
It's over because of you and your people.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,630
No, Fayed, it isn't over.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,349
We have two more bombs.

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,999
I have the bombs!

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,196
But you need me to deliver them.

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,354
I'm the only one who can give you
the targets you want.

70
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,555
So come on, shoot me now!

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,108
Or put down that gun.

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,471
(phone rings)

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,668
- Yeah.
- (Gredenko) Mark Hauser?

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,035
- Who's this?
- You know who it is.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,471
- I already gave you what you asked for.
- But your employer has tightened security.

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,313
So the access I paid for is no good.

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,470
- That's not my problem.
- It is.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,838
It became your problem
the moment you took my money.

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,836
It'll take some time to download
the new security protocols.

80
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,913
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe longer. I can call you.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,390
- I'll be there in 40 minutes.
- Gredenko.

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,431
I'm hungry.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,195
- Knock yourself out.
- There's peppers in here.

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,193
- You like peppers.
- Not red ones. I don't eat red food, Mark.

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,078
- Since when?
- I don't like red food.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,468
I'll take the peppers out, OK?

87
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,752
You take care of me, Mark.
You always take care of me.

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,831
I do my best, Brady.

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,434
While I'm doing this,
I need you to do something for me.

90
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,954
OK.

91
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,919
I need you to access some files
from the mainframe in my office.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,389
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,231
Let's go.

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,029
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

95
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,112
She's being transferred
to a holding station in Temecula.

96
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,479
Sir, I don't know if I can accept that
she betrayed us, that she spied for Fayed.

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,514
I think we're wrong.

98
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,194
This is not easy for any of us.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,353
But the facts at hand indicate
she was streaming intel from her station.

100
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,396
- Mr Buchanan.
- What is it?

101
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,675
We may have caught a break.

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,872
What do you have?

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,590
I've monitored everyone who's communicated
with Gredenko, through phone or emails.

104
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,797
The filter flagged a call
that happened a few minutes ago.

105
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,077
Mark Hauser. He does security consulting
for energy companies.

106
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,913
His company has contracts
with chemical facilities.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,719
Oil fields, pipelines and nuclear power plants.

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,872
The call was scrambled,
but we do have Hauser's address.

109
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,030
Get that address to Jack.

110
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,355
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Excuse us, guys.

111
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,756
While I was stripping data
from the drone pilot's hard drive,

112
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,354
- I found this.
- What is it?

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,115
A remote access module. It's how the pilot
breached CTU's satellite grid.

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,909
No. The pilot got into our system
cos Nadia Yassir let him in.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,437
No. This guy got in through one of
the radical websites Nadia's been monitoring.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,670
Access module proves it.

117
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,558
Nadia's system was compromised
and she didn't know it?

118
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,438
That's right.

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,274
You're in a tough position -
you led the witch-hunt against her.

120
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,114
I followed standard protocols
based on information that was available.

121
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,955
Nadia might not see it that way when
she takes it up with the Justice Department.

122
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,512
Once the dust settles today,
they might wanna make you an example.

123
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,108
Relax, Mike, you took care of me in Denver
and I still owe you for that.

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,749
- We're even now.
- Copy that. I'll call when we're there.

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,671
- We got a lead on Gredenko.
- How good?

126
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,469
We'll know soon. It's a few miles from here.
Put together a TAC team.

127
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,916
I need to stay behind. We're still processing.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,592
Fine.

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,829
- Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,912
Get your men together, come with me.

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,996
- Give us a minute, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

132
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,951
Sandra, how are you holding up?

133
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,679
I can't believe this is happening.

134
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,516
It doesn't feel real.

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,716
I'm so sorry.

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,318
Sandra, unfortunately
I need to ask you for your help.

137
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,119
There's an extremely volatile situation
developing at the White House.

138
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,318
Vice President Daniels is about to launch
a nuclear strike against the Middle East.

139
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,597
- A nuclear strike?
- Yes, and the cabinet is behind him.

140
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,069
I've tried arguing, but no one's listening.

141
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,630
- Are they insane?
- No. They're just scared.

142
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,431
Before the attempted assassination, Wayne
reached out to the Middle East governments

143
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,274
to solicit their help in stopping Fayed,
and it was working.

144
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,753
This strike is a complete reversal
of everything that he was working for.

145
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,230
You want Dr Welton
to bring him out of the coma?

146
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,392
Yes. And I need your consent.

147
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,635
But the doctor said he needs to be sedated
for a few days before the swelling subsides.

148
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,109
But we don't have a few days.

149
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,194
Even if Wayne regains consciousness,
we don't know what state he'll be in.

150
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,989
But we won't know unless we try.
I wouldn't dare to ask you to risk this

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,834
if I did not think it was absolutely necessary
for the sake of our country.

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,115
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

153
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,114
- Sandra, please.
- I've already lost one brother.

154
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,509
I can't lose another one.

155
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,559
I know you did not ask for this responsibility,
but like it or not, it is yours.

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,996
Wayne Palmer is still
the president of our country.

157
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,036
He's the only one who can stop this,

158
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,309
and you are the only one who can give him
the chance to do what he believes in.

159
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,069
Give him that chance.

160
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,556
Ask yourself what Wayne
would want you to do.

161
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,031
I'll talk to Dr Welton.

162
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,994
God forgive me if I'm wrong.

163
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,433
USS Vickery has been detached
from carrier group Falcon,

164
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,556
which is on patrol in the region.

165
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,111
The Vickery will reach launch position
in 40 minutes.

166
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,351
So in less than an hour
we'll have made our point to the enemy?

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,953
Yes, Mr Vice President.

168
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,433
The B-611 short-range tactical warhead
has a blast yield of 300 kilotons.

169
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,956
The message will be loud and clear.

170
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,318
Very good, Admiral. Exemplary.

171
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,438
Tom, give us the damage and
casualty estimates you got from COMPLAN.

172
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,477
- Tom?
- I'm sorry, sir.

173
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,189
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no.

174
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,909
This projection is, of course,
based on theoretical models

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,515
generated at our nuclear facility
in Alamogordo.

176
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,515
COMPLAN estimates a high range
of general damage by zone,

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,912
as well as multiple casualty numbers
based on various climate models.

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,037
- Now, should the...
- I'm sorry, Tom.

179
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,394
I need to step out for a minute.

180
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,834
- Carry on with the briefing.
- Right.

181
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,276
Should the enemy mount a response,
the potential does exist

182
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,999
for the US to be drawn into a conflict
in which...

183
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,913
What does this mean?
They're taking him out of the coma?

184
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,949
Apparently Sandra Palmer
gave her consent a few minutes ago.

185
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,717
- This is Karen Hayes.
- I don't know, sir.

186
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,875
I only found out about this because
I have a source inside the medical bay.

187
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,358
- Put me through to Dr Welton.
- (woman) Right away.

188
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,559
I've cut the pentobarbital drip, his metabolic
rate's up. He's breathing on his own.

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,679
- What about the swelling in his brain?
- No sign of intracranial hypertension,

190
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,629
but it's still too early to know
when or even if he'll regain consciousness.

191
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,190
(man) Dr Welton, Vice President Daniels
on line one. It's urgent.

192
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,919
Dr Welton, what are you going to tell him?

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,195
The truth.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,111
Mr Vice President, this is Dr Welton.

195
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,272
I'm told you're trying to rouse the president
out of his coma?

196
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,036
- That's correct, sir.
- I thought you induced it to save his life.

197
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,192
Treating patients with head trauma
is a fluid process.

198
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,556
It sounds to me like
you're risking the life of the president.

199
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,756
With care, we can minimize that risk.

200
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,400
- Let's cut the crap, Doctor.
- Sir?

201
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,153
We know why Sandra Palmer
wants her brother conscious.

202
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,391
- She's trying to subvert my policy.
- Policy's not my concern.

203
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,836
I think you're concerned
and that you agree with what she's doing,

204
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,230
and you're willing to risk the life
of the president to get it done!

205
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,153
So if you don't stop now,
I will compel you to stop!

206
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,437
With all due respect,
the president's treatment is not...

207
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,718
- You'll do what I tell you.
- No, sir. I'm sorry, I will not.

208
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,839
I am required to follow the wishes
of Sandra Palmer.

209
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,718
You're free to take up your concerns with her.

210
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,031
If the president dies or suffers any damage
from your actions,

211
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
I will nail your ass to the wall.
Do you understand me?

212
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,391
Perfectly, sir.

213
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,074
- Chloe, I need that photo. I need it now.
- Sending now, Jack.

214
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,913
- Team B, advise when you're in position.
- (man) Copy, sir.

215
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,349
- Team B in position.
- Copy that.

216
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,477
I've got a positive ID.
Move in on the house now.

217
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,232
All teams go. Move in.

218
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,117
(barking)

219
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,029
Federal agent. Down on the floor!

220
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,550
- Mark!
- Don't move!

221
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,518
- Put him in the chair.
- Mark.

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,194
Mark. Mark. Mark.

223
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,474
- Mark!
- It's clear.

224
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,472
- Take him to the living room.
- He doesn't know anything!

225
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,551
- Shut up!
- Mark. Mark.

226
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,276
- He's bleeding. He needs to go to hospital.
- We don't have time. Stabilize him.

227
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,396
(Brady) Mark!

228
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,755
Mark!

229
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,949
- Mark!
- Let me have the room.

230
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,429
I know you're scared right now,
but everything's gonna be OK.

231
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,715
I wanna see my brother.

232
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,837
I'll let you see him,
but I need to ask you some questions.

233
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,559
- I'm not allowed.
- You're not allowed? Why?

234
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,679
- Mark says don't talk to strangers.
- I'm not a stranger. I'm a police officer.

235
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,910
You can talk to me. It's all right.

236
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,560
My name is Jack Bauer. What's yours?

237
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,995
- Brady.
- Brady.

238
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,200
When we came in, you were working on
your computer. What were you working on?

239
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,477
- Getting files.
- What kind of files?

240
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,351
I don't know. Mark asked me to get through
the IBC firewall to set up a proxy server port.

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,953
Oh.

242
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,554
Can I see him now?

243
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,079
Soon. I'm gonna talk to him first,
and then you can see him, OK?

244
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,915
You're doing great, Brady.

245
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,835
- Stay with him.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,634
You were paid to give Gredenko information.

247
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,518
You used your brother to get it,
now he's in trouble.

248
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,037
- My brother's got nothing to do with this.
- That's not what he told me.

249
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,712
He doesn't know what he's doing.

250
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,112
That's not how the Justice Department
will see it. They'll prosecute him for treason.

251
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,193
I'll help your brother, cos we both know
he didn't understand what he was doing,

252
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,874
but you're gonna have to give me Gredenko.

253
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,157
What kind of information
were you selling him?

254
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,357
- Security specs.
- What security specs?

255
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,318
The Edgemont nuclear power plant.

256
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,955
Bill, this is Connell Johnson.
He's on loan from District.

257
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,430
We swept the drone pilot's system.
Most of the files are encrypted.

258
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,718
- Our digital forensics people are waiting.
- We'll see what we can find.

259
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,076
- Got anything more from Nadia?
- She still claims she was set up.

260
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,199
- Is she in the building?
- Yes, she's being transferred. Why?

261
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,593
- Just curious.
- Sir, Jack's on line two. He's got Hauser.

262
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,389
- Jack?
- Bill.

263
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,155
Hauser sold Gredenko security specs
for Edgemont nuclear power facility.

264
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,357
- Does Gredenko have them?
- He picks them up in 20 minutes.

265
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,079
- Can your team handle the grab?
- We have a situation.

266
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,631
Hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother.
We're gonna use him for the transaction.

267
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,875
It's the best shot we've got to get
Gredenko alive. I'll get back to you soon.

268
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,512
Brady, we need to talk.

269
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,430
Are you really a policeman?

270
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,389
Yeah.

271
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,517
Then my brother did something wrong.

272
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,070
He's made some mistakes,
but he's helping us fix them.

273
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,596
Everyone makes mistakes.
I make mistakes all the time.

274
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,752
- And you try and fix them, right?
- Yeah.

275
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,435
That's what your brother's trying to do,
but he needs your help.

276
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,954
- Why don't we go talk to him?
- OK.

277
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,471
Come on, let's go.

278
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,750
- Mark. Mark.
- It's OK, Brady. It's OK.

279
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,154
It's not as bad as it looks.

280
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,918
- They're taking me to the hospital.
- I wanna go with you.

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,594
- You need to stay with them.
- Don't leave me alone.

282
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,069
Listen to me, Brady! Listen.

283
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,951
You need to do
whatever this man tells you to do.

284
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,311
You'll be fine.

285
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,192
Who takes care of you, Brady?

286
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,748
- You do, Mark.
- That's right.

287
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,398
So you need to trust me
when I tell you you'll be fine.

288
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,071
He'll take care of you.

289
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,155
OK?

290
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,196
OK.

291
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,915
Let's make the call.

292
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,791
(phone rings)

293
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,071
- Yes?
- It's Hauser.

294
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,674
I have the protocols, but there's a problem.

295
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,193
A problem?

296
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,475
My supervisor wants me to come in.

297
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,429
- I'll be there in 20 minutes.
- He wants me at the office now.

298
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,196
If I'm not there in ten minutes, the protocols
will default and need downloading again.

299
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,350
I need those protocols.

300
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,073
- I can leave them with my brother.
- Brady?

301
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,470
Unless you wanna wait
for me to get back from the office.

302
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,551
I don't have time.

303
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,554
Have your brother meet me
in the parking lot across the street.

304
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,234
He'll be there. Goodbye.

305
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,512
The parking lot across the street, 20 minutes.

306
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,798
- He needs to get to a hospital now.
- Take him.

307
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,839
- Mark. Mark.
- Brady. It's all right, it's all right.

308
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,153
We're gonna take care of him. I promise. Right
now I need you to listen to me very carefully,

309
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,152
just like your brother told you to, OK?

310
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,111
OK.

311
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,159
Milo Pressman? Connell Johnson.
I'm on loan from District. Data forensics.

312
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,789
- Yeah, we crossed paths in Denver.
- That's right, we did.

313
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,398
- What can I do for you?
- I hear you and Nadia Yassir are friends.

314
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,790
- Yeah. Why do you ask?
- I came across evidence

315
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,917
that proves Nadia's innocent.

316
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,992
- Explain.
- She wasn't streaming intel.

317
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,355
Her system was breached.

318
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,351
- Where is this evidence?
- Ask Doyle.

319
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,558
- Doyle?
- I hate to rat, but I didn't know where to go.

320
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,795
I gave him the evidence at the crime scene
and he still hasn't logged it in.

321
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,310
- What did you do?!
- Are you crazy?

322
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,311
- Milo, that's enough!
- Tell him!

323
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,039
He's got evidence that Nadia's innocent!

324
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,429
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

325
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,433
- And he buried it to save his own ass.
- He didn't bury it. Milo, he didn't.

326
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,115
It's a remote access module
that breached Nadia's computer.

327
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,796
- He gave it to me ten minutes ago.
- Why didn't you tell us about this?

328
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,192
I got it from an unreliable source. I wanted
to make sure it was real before I submitted it.

329
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,831
I ran a verification scan. It's definitely real
and Nadia is definitely innocent.

330
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,473
I'll review the evidence. If it's true, I'll release
Nadia. In the meantime, go back to work.

331
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,308
Come with me, Morris.

332
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,436
Doyle...

333
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,031
I owe you an apology.

334
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,759
- It's not your fault.
- Still.

335
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,711
Milo, forget about it.

336
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,911
Johnson.

337
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,596
You've screwed with the wrong guy
for the last time, pal.

338
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,995
Uncuff her.

339
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,151
Excuse us, please.

340
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,310
We found evidence at the switching station.

341
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,155
It proves your computer was breached
from an outside source.

342
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,470
You're cleared, Nadia.

343
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,794
I'm sorry this happened.

344
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,760
So am I.

345
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,718
Your first impulse will be to quit.

346
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,831
Take legal action.

347
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,791
I don't blame you.

348
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,871
That's what I'd do.

349
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,315
But I'm asking you to stay.

350
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,550
This crisis is far from over.
We can't afford to lose our best people.

351
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,237
We need you, Nadia.

352
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,879
I'll stay.

353
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,633
Milo's setting up your work station now.

354
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,399
I sent the assault vectors. Nadia is good to go.

355
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,118
Thank you.

356
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,192
We all thought she was guilty.
This is gonna be awkward.

357
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,759
Yeah.

358
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,229
Especially for you.

359
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,993
Why especially for me?

360
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,392
Your feelings for Nadia
aren't exactly a big secret.

361
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,631
Thank you for pointing that out.

362
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,838
Your station's all set. Comm's up.

363
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,909
- You have full security access to the subnet.
- Thanks.

364
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,231
- Listen, Nadia...
- I don't have time for a heart-to-heart.

365
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,039
I've got a lot of catching up to do.
Excuse me.

366
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,918
I understand that. Nadia, wait.

367
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,958
Dammit, you're not gonna
make this easy for me, are you?

368
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,477
You know what? I am. Whatever you thought
might happen between us, you can forget it.

369
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,996
- That's not fair.
- I don't blame you for suspecting me.

370
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,599
But you have to admit, this is not
the best place to start a relationship.

371
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,591
You're probably right.

372
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,590
But I still wanted to say I'm sorry.

373
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,791
You said it.

374
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,192
I should get to work.

375
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,235
- Here.
- Thanks.

376
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,598
We haven't heard from Dr Welton.
He's been giving us regular updates.

377
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,468
I'm sure if there was something to report,
we would've heard from him.

378
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,757
Gosh, I've never been good
at waiting for anything.

379
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,310
David had the patience of Job, but not me.

380
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,317
Wayne is always somewhere in between.

381
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,358
- We have a decision to make.
- What is it?

382
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,353
- There's an increase in intracranial swelling.
- How serious is it?

383
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,309
It's not life-threatening yet, but if it continues,
it could cause permanent brain damage.

384
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,073
I suggest we re-induce the coma.

385
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,951
No.

386
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,350
- You understand the danger?
- But there's a chance he'd be OK?

387
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,079
Yes, there is a chance.

388
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:00,349
Well, even if it's a small chance for Wayne
to stop Daniels, then it's worth the risk.

389
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,159
I know Wayne would wanna see this through.

390
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,879
Dr Welton, you need to come quickly.

391
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,989
He's crashing. Get a code team
in here right away. Wait outside.

392
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,117
Code team to one. Code team to one, stat.

393
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,668
Let's get a crash cart in here.

394
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,079
The teams are in position.
You sure he can do this?

395
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,550
He just needs to get Gredenko out of his car.

396
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,470
We don't have another option.

397
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,838
Just tell Charlie team
they've got one shot at this.

398
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,271
Dammit.

399
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,149
Brady, I need you to wear one of these.
So we can talk to each other.

400
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,073
This way you'll be able to hear me
and I can hear you.

401
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,311
- I need to put it in your ear.
- Will it hurt?

402
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,789
No. No, I promise.

403
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,314
See? Now I'm gonna talk you through this.

404
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,075
But we don't want Mr Gredenko
to know that you can hear me,

405
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,550
so we have to pretend that you can't,
you understand?

406
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,631
Yeah.

407
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,439
Good. You're gonna give him this.

408
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,153
He's gonna meet you in the parking lot.
I want you to stand on the sidewalk.

409
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,231
That's your position.

410
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,351
- OK.
- We're set.

411
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,635
We should go now.

412
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,635
You don't need to be scared, Brady.

413
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,430
I'm gonna watch you the whole time
and I'm gonna hear everything that you say.

414
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,080
Go to your position.
Remember your position?

415
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,232
- Yeah, I'll go to my position.
- OK.

416
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,590
- Teams, report in.
- Alpha team in position.

417
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,989
- Bravo team in position.
- Charlie team in position.

418
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,312
Charlie team, you are responsible for taking
out Gredenko with the tranquillizer dart.

419
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,077
Teams A and B, acquire remaining targets.
Do whatever you have to to protect this kid.

420
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,589
- Brady, it's Jack. Can you hear me?
- I hear you.

421
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,116
- You're doing great.
- When can I see my brother?

422
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,350
As soon as this is over. I promise.

423
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,954
OK, OK. Good.

424
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,555
(radio chatter)

425
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,039
I have a visual on Gredenko's SUV.
Windows are tinted. I can't see who's inside.

426
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Brady, do you see the car
coming towards you?

427
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,876
- Yeah.
- It's time to get ready.

428
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,391
I've got a visual on Gredenko. Charlie team,
take your shot as soon as you've got one.

429
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,471
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,951
Give it to me.

431
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,754
I have a negative line of sight.
Hauser's in the way.

432
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,671
You look nervous, Brady.

433
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,954
Why are you so nervous?

434
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,992
(Gredenko speaks Russian)

435
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,833
Gredenko just gave the order to shoot the kid.

436
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,957
- Do you have your shot yet?
- Negative. Hauser's in the way.

437
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,235
- Can you move position?
- Negative.

438
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,792
Brady, don't forget to pretend
like you can't hear me. You're doing great.

439
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,677
Listen to me carefully.

440
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,309
When I tell you, I want you
to go down to the ground and stay there.

441
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,391
Wait till I tell you.

442
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,589
(Gredenko speaks Russian)

443
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,996
Brady, get down on the ground.

444
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,474
Brady, get down on the ground.

445
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,519
All teams, take out your targets.

446
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,195
All teams, there is a third hostile
inside the vehicle.

447
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,560
(man) All teams hold fire.

448
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,517
Move in, move in!

449
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,673
Brady, are you OK?
It's over. It's over. You did great.

450
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,390
- I want to see my brother?
- You can see your brother, like I promised.

451
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,471
Get Gredenko in the house. Prep him.

452
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,439
Advise Buchanan we've got Gredenko
and we're prepping him for interrogation.

453
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,590
Yes, sir.

454
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,671
Watch your head.

455
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,672
Brady, this man's gonna look after you.
He's gonna take you to see your brother.

456
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,354
- I wanna see my brother.
- Yeah.

457
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,199
You did great. Thank you.

458
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,991
OK.

459
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,793
We searched Gredenko's vehicle.
No sign of the bombs.

460
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,190
- Is he conscious yet?
- Yes. You want help with him?

461
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,077
No.

462
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,350
You know who I am.

463
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,908
I know all about you, Agent Bauer.

464
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,352
Then you know what I'm gonna do to you,
unless you tell me where the bombs are.

465
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,150
And when I'm finished, I'm gonna put you
on the fastest plane we've got back to Russia.

466
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,597
I don't think President Suvarov's
gonna be too happy to see you.

467
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,672
- Fayed has the bombs.
- Where is he?

468
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,116
I don't know, but I can help you find him.

469
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,311
I'm listening.

470
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,632
I came here to get security specs
for the Edgemont nuclear power plant.

471
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,393
- That's your next target?
- Yes.

472
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,150
Fayed's waiting for my call.

473
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,193
Make the call.

474
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,191
No.

475
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,434
First, my terms.

476
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,789
Amnesty from your government
and a guarantee I won't be returned to Russia.

477
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,836
What?

478
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,070
I'm offering you Fayed.

479
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,549
What's the problem?

480
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,156
I'm not a martyr, I'm a soldier and realist.

481
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,998
If I don't call him soon,
Fayed will get suspicious.

482
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,636
Admiral, is the Vickery ready to launch?

483
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,678
- It's seconds from optimal launch position.
- Good.

484
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,230
Mr Vice President,
I just spoke to Bill Buchanan at CTU.

485
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,154
They've taken Gredenko into custody.
Jack Bauer is questioning him now.

486
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,791
- Does Bill think it could lead to something?
- He's confident Bauer's the man for it.

487
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,678
And he's hoping
they get the answers they need.

488
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,876
I hope his confidence is justified.

489
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,317
Sir, the Vickery's in position.
They're standing by.

490
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,277
Proceed with the strike.

491
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,194
Mr Vice President, if I may,
in light of the developments at CTU,

492
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,159
do we not wanna delay this launch
and see what Bauer gets out of Gredenko?

493
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,153
I'm not gonna delay our response based
on what Gredenko may or may not reveal.

494
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,437
If Gredenko gives up the bombs,
that is the desired result.

495
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,593
Then we can consider this strike
as retaliation for American lives already lost!

496
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,312
A reminder to the world there are
consequences to attacking our country.

497
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,232
- Admiral Smith, proceed with the launch.
- Yes, Mr Vice President.

498
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,548
Sir, the Vickeryjust received a message
over the COMPLAN subnet.

499
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,518
They've been ordered to stand down.

500
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,672
What the hell are you talking about?
Who gave this order?

501
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,593
President Palmer, sir.

502
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,672
- President Palmer?
- (phone rings)

503
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,193
- Conference Room, Lisa Miller.
- (man) Urgent call for the vice president.

504
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,316
One moment.

505
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,951
It's for you, sir.

506
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,150
Yes?

507
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,676
Noah, it's Wayne.

508
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,432
Mr President, it is an incredible relief
to hear your voice.

509
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,115
To be frank, it's a surprise.

510
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,671
- I've called off the strike, Noah.
- We just received word.

511
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,914
Sir, this action is a product
of careful deliberation

512
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,195
between myself and the Joint Chiefs.

513
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,673
Yeah, well, be that as it may,
the decision is mine and mine alone.

514
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,314
I'm resuming my duties
as commander in chief.

515
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:30,078
Inform Admiral Smith and the others there's
to be no action without my authorisation.

516
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,278
- Is that understood?
- Understood, Mr President.

517
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,991
Good.

518
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,235
It's apparent to me that

519
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,316
the president is still suffering the effects
from the attack on his life.

520
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,392
He's not thinking clearly

521
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,677
and, in my judgment,

522
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,315
he's not capable of discharging his duties.

523
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,591
I can't let him remain in power.

524
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,749
Get me the attorney general.

525
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,757
