1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,876
Previously on "24":

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,154
We've learned that the woman with whom
the president is involved, Dr Anne Packard,

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,195
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,995
Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,429
Once they find out that Ted was lying...

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,438
And how do they do that?
It's he-said-she-said.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,712
See, this is politics. It's not medicine.
So do me a favour and stay out of it.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,594
- I'm taking over for Tony.
- We're trying to contact the chopper.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,875
Now we have Singer
and the virus is contained,

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,476
we need to let Jack know the attempted
escape of Salazar is pointless.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,751
Salazar's terrorist connections
are a threat to this country.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,077
- Both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.
- What's going on?

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,431
Your dad got out of the chopper.
He and Salazar are on the run.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,836
All that matters is telling him
the virus has been contained.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
That way, he'll turn Salazar over.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,151
Your brother gave the FBl
contact instructions in his last call.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,874
He's got a plane circling,
waiting to pick you up.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,036
You really are the best, Jack.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,434
(yelling)

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,519
- What the hell is going on?
- You didn't think I'd let you just leave?

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,551
Ram Ãn...

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,037
Adam!

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,390
There's something seriously wrong...

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,671
I just remembered,
I forgot to close that file.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,757
The following takes place
between 7pm and 8pm.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,630
- Let me go.
- You shouldn't have walked into this.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,318
(muffled grunts)

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,591
Calm down. I have to ask you
a few questions, OK?

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,240
This room is soundproofed,
so if you scream

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,876
it won't do anything but make me mad,
and you don't wanna do that.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,638
So are we gonna be all right here?

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,831
- What are you doing to my father?
- I'll ask the questions.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,310
You came in here to bring
the logs back up to date.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,874
When do they expect you to finish?

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,871
- Don't make me ask you twice.
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,759
And after that, what are you working on?

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Just utility work.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,873
Good.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,873
What do you think you're doing?
This isn't gonna work.

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,757
- Adam?
- Yeah?

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,799
Tony's out of surgery. I'm trying
to head over there in a few minutes.

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,791
- Who's gonna be in charge?
- Gael.

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,838
Unmount and transfer
all my directories to his system.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
- Sure.
- Anything new on Jack?

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,873
Our last location on him was the
subway station, then Chase lost his trail.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,754
- Have we contacted LAPD?
- They're all over it. So is the FBl.

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,440
I think we're going about this
the wrong way.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,438
Jack broke Salazar out of jail
to stop the bio threat,

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,869
but now that we have Singer,
there is no threat.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,549
If we saturate the media,
Jack will get the message.

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,708
The president does not want the
public to know about the bio threat.

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,195
We have to find Jack and Salazar ourselves.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,594
Yeah.

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,352
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's me.

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Why aren't you
in the teleconference room?

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,874
Kim bumped into some embedded no-ops
in the log files. It'll take a few minutes.

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,872
She can handle that.
I'm heading to the hospital.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,880
I need you up to speed
so you can take over for me.

59
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,474
- On my way.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,270
I'm watching you. So don't try anything.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,313
All right?

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,678
(whimpering)

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,995
Transfer all blue-alert key codes to Gael.

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,874
- Anything else?
- That's it. Thanks.

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,639
There is no longer an outbreak threat
for the city of Los Angeles.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,718
Kyle Singer, who was being
held by Salazar's people,

67
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,957
was not carrying the Cordilla virus
and is perfectly healthy.

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,636
But we do know Salazar's
organisation has the virus,

69
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,752
which means finding Ram Ãn Salazar
is our top priority.

70
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,836
Thank you for joining us, Gael.

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,599
If you're taking over for Michelle,
be on time.

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,676
- Sorry.
- From this moment on,

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,917
we are focused on one thing only.
Finding Ram Ãn Salazar.

74
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,712
Adam, where are we on that?

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,072
After Jack and Ram Ãn ditched the chopper,
we lost their trail. They could still be in LA.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,994
Not for long.
We suspect they're heading for Mexico.

77
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,869
We've contacted the Mexican government
and the Central American allies.

78
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,316
- They're monitoring all air corridors.
- What about Chase?

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,358
- I assume he's coming here.
- Don't assume anything.

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,389
Ram Ãn, have a drink. You're a free man.

81
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,750
(lively Latin music)

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,472
Thank you.

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,149
Ram Ãn...

84
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,075
(Ram Ãn chuckles)

85
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,118
Hello, Jack.

86
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,512
The party's going well.
I wanted you to know.

87
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,555
I want you to know something else.
For some reason, Hector wants you alive.

88
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,918
Maybe he wants to kill you himself.
Or maybe he wants to watch me do it.

89
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,560
- I'm just not sure I can wait that long.
- Ram Ãn, let's get back to the party.

90
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,870
Come on. The girls. Sandra is waiting.

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,076
(phone rings)

92
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,595
- Yeah?
- This is Chappelle. What are you doing?

93
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,234
- Trying to find Jack.
- So's the rest of CTU.

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,632
- Well, I may have a thread.
- Tell me.

95
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,877
Jack and I back-pocketed
some of Hector Salazar's contacts.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,788
We'll pass any information on
to another field team. I want you here.

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,873
As soon as Jack hands Ram Ãn Salazar
to his brother, they'll kill him.

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,077
- Jack may already be dead.
- I won't stop until I know for sure.

99
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,751
- Chase, I want you back here now.
- Why?

100
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,758
Because I just found out
Jack's been using heroin.

101
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,031
And since you're his partner,
you must've known.

102
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,269
- I had no idea.
- I don't believe you.

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,880
I believe you've been covering for him.

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,270
All that matters is finding Jack,
and I can't do that from CTU.

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,880
If you even want a chance
of keeping your job,

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,838
you'll get back here now
and debrief me on Bauer.

107
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,235
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

108
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,551
Good.

109
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,872
(phone rings)

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,752
- O'Brian.
- Is Kim up there?

111
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,871
- No.
- Are your logs lagging by six hours?

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,956
Let me check.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,036
- Yep.
- Kim was taking care of that.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,596
I don't know what Kim's doing.
I don't follow her schedule.

115
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,038
Gael, are you going back
to Tech One right now?

116
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,994
- No, not right now. Why?
- I need something from Kim. I'll get her.

117
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,635
- No, she's not there.
- Yeah, she is. She's backing up logs.

118
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,880
Chappelle asked her to take a mirror drive
to Network. She'll be back soon.

119
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,998
- What do you need?
- What do I need? I need to find Jack.

120
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,999
We're dead-ending. Kim's his daughter.
Maybe she can help us.

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,629
As soon as she gets back,
I'll send her over, OK?

122
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,352
Yeah. OK.

123
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,908
Gael, I had Adam transfer
all my directories over to your system.

124
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,758
- Thanks. Great.
- Hold on.

125
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,633
I wanna go over the dispatches from Division.

126
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,320
There are 17 units in the field,
five of them downtown.

127
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,029
- They're trying to find Jack.
- And the other 12?

128
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,199
Health Services, LAX... Hold on.
Let me pull up the rest for you.

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,871
(phone ringing)

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,389
This is the matrix I use to balance resources.

131
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,749
I'll transfer it to you.

132
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,111
- Is Tony out of surgery?
- Yeah.

133
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,879
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Hope so.

134
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,073
(beep)

135
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,233
(beep)

136
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,390
- Dessler.
- Is Gael with you?

137
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,474
- Yeah. Why?
- I can't get into Tech One. It's the code.

138
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,472
Did you change the code to Tech One?

139
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,711
- No. Why?
- Adam can't get in.

140
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,870
- What does he need?
- What do you need, Adam?

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,878
- I'm looking for Kim. She was in there.
- Did you call her?

142
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,000
Something's wrong with the phone.
Can you override the door? It's tweaked.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,833
Yeah, sure.

144
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,719
- What are you doing?
- Overriding the access code.

145
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,277
OK, I'm resetting it to 1-2-3-4.
It'll take 15 seconds to sync, though.

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,069
Thanks.

147
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,792
I'm sending everything related
to the virus to volume A.

148
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,871
Where do you want the Salazar file?

149
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,155
(Kim grunting)

150
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,430
- Kim?
- (Kim grunts)

151
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,749
Oh, my God. Kim!

152
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,749
- Kim?
- Adam, it was Gael.

153
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,794
(man) Section five is clear.

154
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,553
I have a visual on the subject.
Section five.

155
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,517
Block him off on the other side!
Get down here! Come on!

156
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,229
I'm on it. I'm heading
down the stairwell now.

157
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,432
Section seven.
I'm locking down the corridor.

158
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,476
I do not have a visual on the subject.
Repeat, I do not have a visual. Please advise.

159
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,472
(guard) We need backup!
Section seven!

160
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Put it down! Put it down!
Don't do it. Put it down now.

161
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,916
(lift door opens)

162
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,999
(Michelle) Gael!

163
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,829
- Don't get in my way!
- External security is in position.

164
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,997
You're not going anywhere.

165
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,316
You take one step outside,
you know exactly what will happen.

166
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,875
Yeah, OK, I will.

167
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,274
Thanks.

168
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,513
What did they say?

169
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,916
They haven't found Jack.
They're not sure if he's in the city.

170
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,508
He's not in the city.

171
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,918
His plan was to take Ram Ãn Salazar
back to his brother to prevent the outbreak.

172
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,191
That's what he's gonna do,
even if it costs him his life.

173
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,915
That's probably true, but there's
nothing we can do about that now.

174
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,875
Our intelligence and military services
are working overtime on that front, so...

175
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,673
Iet them do their job.

176
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,917
We, unfortunately,
have other fires to put out.

177
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,074
Anne?

178
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,875
- I'm sorry about Ted and the debate.
- I don't wanna hear it. It's not your fault.

179
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,957
I told you to stand up to him,
but maybe I was wrong.

180
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,437
- Maybe you should've just paid him off.
- You were not wrong.

181
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,516
Mr President?

182
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,353
We have a lot of work to do.

183
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,039
I still can't believe Gael could be
a traitor. Has he said anything?

184
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,550
We haven't gone in yet.
We're sweating him first.

185
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,998
Listen, Ryan, Tony's out of surgery.
I wanna be there when he wakes up.

186
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
And I need you here.

187
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,429
We just uncovered a mole. We don't know
how badly we've been compromised.

188
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,718
But you're handling that. Anything
that spills over, you can give to Chloe.

189
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,318
- Chloe's a pain in the ass.
- She can do it. At least until I get back.

190
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,190
Fine. If you think you're dispensable.

191
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,959
I just wanna be with my husband.

192
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,039
All right.

193
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,151
Thank you.

194
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,516
All right, let's do this.

195
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,998
You had us, Gael.

196
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,395
Now we have you.

197
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,874
You workin' alone, or does Salazar
have other moles inside?

198
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,238
You know Johnson.
You know what Johnson does.

199
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,352
Sooner or later, you're going
to tell me what you know.

200
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,439
The only question is how hard
you wanna make this on yourself.

201
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,796
Kim says you were monitoring
the plane that had Jack Bauer on it.

202
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,429
- Is that true?
- I have nothing to say.

203
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,192
If it's the last thing you ever do, you're
going to tell me where that plane is landing.

204
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,871
(music plays)

205
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,439
What is it, Ram Ãn? Don't you like the girls?

206
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,869
Tell me again why Hector wants Bauer alive.

207
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,629
- I don't know. He didn't say. But l...
- "But"?

208
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,878
But nothing. Every time Bauer
takes a breath is an insult to me.

209
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,429
I went to prison because of his betrayal.

210
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,838
I know, Ram Ãn, and I'm sure
that Hector feels the same way.

211
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,553
- Then he won't mind.
- Ram Ãn, no!

212
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,394
Are you giving me an order, Tom Às?

213
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,516
Ram Ãn, I work for you and your brother.
I love and respect both of you.

214
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,831
Hector instructed me to keep Bauer
alive until the plane lands.

215
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,519
And I'm instructing you to sit down.

216
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,873
Honour the one wish of your brother,
who arranged for your escape today.

217
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,279
In less than an hour, I am sure that
you will get your revenge on Bauer.

218
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,756
We'll see.

219
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,391
- Pour me another drink.
- Yes, Ram Ãn.

220
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,670
- Pedro...
- I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.

221
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,349
Fine. Then listen. I risked my life
getting Ram Ãn out of prison.

222
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,869
You put him in prison.

223
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,880
I need to tell Ram Ãn
something important.

224
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,269
Before he gets wasted.
You know what he's like.

225
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,870
Yeah. Got drunk one time,
threw some guy off a plane.

226
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,880
Keeps going like this...
you might be landing before we do.

227
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,880
- For God's sakes, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

228
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,873
I'm not talking to you.
You're a dead man.

229
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,632
(Jack coughs and retches)

230
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,310
Jack...

231
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,880
Jack?

232
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,792
Quit screwing around, Jack.

233
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,878
(bones crunch)

234
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,877
We can explain the national security
issue that pulled you offstage,

235
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,835
but the allegation against Anne
will be a lot harder to handle.

236
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,714
Her ex-husband had an agenda.
It shouldn't be difficult to prove he's a liar.

237
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,880
This is dirty laundry,
and we know the public wants to hear it.

238
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,589
Unless you can offer them something
definitive, Anne will hurt you.

239
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,875
Gerry's right.

240
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,876
I'm your brother, I'm your advisor,

241
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,233
and I do have some perspective on this thing.
Now, do you wanna hear it?

242
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,874
Yes, I wanna hear it.

243
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
- Distance yourself from Anne.
- Wayne...

244
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,952
Before you shut me down, just hear me out.

245
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,434
You used up the public's goodwill
with Sherry.

246
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,553
They don't want you being involved
with someone else who's not trustworthy.

247
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,468
You have got to respect
the people who voted for you.

248
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,835
(phone rings)

249
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,871
Oh, excuse me.

250
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,839
- Hello?
- Anne, it's me. Ted. We need to talk.

251
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,351
About what? What could you
possibly have to say to me?

252
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,790
I can't believe you even
have the audacity to call.

253
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,950
- I'm sorry.
- Well, that's great.

254
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,880
- Now everything's all right.
- I called because I wanna make it right.

255
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,429
How? How can you possibly
undo the damage you've done?

256
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,790
I'm in my office.
Come up and I'll explain.

257
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,872
- I'm not coming over there.
- Anne, listen to me.

258
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,833
I have documents
that'll prove your innocence.

259
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,952
- What kind of documents?
- Letters and memos.

260
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,518
Please. I wanna give them to you personally.
I promise I won't make a scene.

261
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,870
- I'll send someone over to get them.
- No!

262
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,590
No, we will do this my way,
or I swear I'll burn 'em right now.

263
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,790
All right. But you'd
better not be wasting my time.

264
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,076
(doorbell)

265
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,631
Simon, we need to talk.

266
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,877
Chase Edmunds.
Sorry, but I'm having dinner right now.

267
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,638
- What do you want?
- lnformation.

268
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,557
- Are you crazy?
- What's going on?

269
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,195
Rita, take the kids upstairs.
Everything will be fine.

270
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,717
- What do you want?
- Ram Ãn Salazar broke out of prison today.

271
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,072
- He's gonna hook up with his brother.
- I told you, I'm a legitimate accountant!

272
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,033
I don't have any business
with the Salazars.

273
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,879
Simon, I did not come here to bust you.

274
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,788
But I am not leaving
until I know where Hector is.

275
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Do you understand me?

276
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,792
I don't know where Hector is now.

277
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,876
He left Colombia over two weeks ago.

278
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,952
- He didn't tell you where he was going?
- No.

279
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,873
- You're tied into his money flow, right?
- Yes, some of it.

280
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,036
Let's take a look.

281
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,869
Ram Ãn... Hector is meeting us.

282
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,878
Just wait a few minutes.
Ram Ãn, please. Hector said...

283
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,030
Are you ready to die, Jack?

284
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,880
Back off! Back!

285
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,873
- Get back or I'll kill him! Get back!
- Shoot him, Tom Às! Shoot him!

286
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,880
I die, he dies. Is that what you want
Hector to see when you get off this plane?

287
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,871
Drop the weapons!

288
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,594
(speaks Spanish)

289
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,756
There's no way out of this for you.

290
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,678
(Ram Ãn) He's right.
My brother has an army out there.

291
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,032
- We're not in your back yard any more.
- I'll worry about that. You take a seat.

292
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,838
Ladies, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

293
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,880
The party will continue
once we're on the ground.

294
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,871
The big American hero.

295
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,031
What do you think, Jack?
That Hector's not prepared for you?

296
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,149
Shut up.

297
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,798
Danny, OK. Hey, man, back up.
Rapido, rapido. Get in the car.

298
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,996
Why do you need so many people?

299
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,032
I want to be prepared
when the plane lands.

300
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,873
- Prepared for what?
- Whatever.

301
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
I haven't heard from Gael.
He should've checked in.

302
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,919
- So call Ram Ãn's plane.
- Too risky. The Americans are checking.

303
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,830
(shouts in Spanish)

304
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,871
Come on!

305
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,792
I have to go, OK?

306
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,871
Rapido! Come on!

307
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,069
(grunting and moaning)

308
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,910
- Who else is working with you, Gael?
- (groans)

309
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,235
Let me make something clear.

310
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,071
I would love nothing more than to hang you
as a traitor and watch you jerk till you're dead.

311
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,191
But I'm a realist.

312
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,678
If there are others, tell me now
and we might be able to cut you a deal.

313
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,353
(phone rings)

314
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,235
Is that Hector?

315
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,314
Adam, bring me a tracking node now.
Now! Hector Salazar's calling!

316
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,356
Kim, grab that laptop.

317
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,872
- Put the socket in C5, Kim.
- Got it.

318
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,871
Hurry up.

319
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,915
OK, go.

320
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,431
One wrong word, I swear to God,
I'll make you regret it.

321
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,319
- Hello?
- Where have you been?

322
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,872
Busy. I don't have a lot of time.

323
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,394
- Where is Ram Ãn?
- On his way to you.

324
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,880
- Is he safe?
- I think so.

325
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,279
What about Bauer?

326
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
- Don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

327
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,873
- What are you doing there?
- They put me on something else.

328
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,874
They're watching me.

329
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,553
- Call me when you have something.
- Yeah.

330
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,314
Did we get it?

331
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,919
No.

332
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,359
Dammit.

333
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,951
Hey.

334
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,832
Hey.

335
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,196
How you doin'?

336
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,589
You scared the hell out of me.

337
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,269
I know. I'm sorry.

338
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,918
- How is he, Doctor?
- We couldn't have had a better result.

339
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,918
He'll be on his feet in a few days.

340
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,951
- When can he come home?
- Tomorrow.

341
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,517
I just wanna keep an eye on him,
make sure he stays stable.

342
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,319
Could we have a couple of minutes, please?

343
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,556
- Of course.
- Thanks.

344
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,438
- Michelle...
- Yeah?

345
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,518
Did the president let Salazar out of prison?

346
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,957
No. No, Jack broke him out so the president
wouldn't have to make the choice.

347
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,877
- Did he get away?
- Yeah.

348
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,231
I have to talk to Gael right away.

349
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,880
Wh...

350
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,871
- Gael?
- Yeah.

351
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,199
What, something happen to him?

352
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,590
- Gael's been working for the Salazars.
- How do you know that?

353
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,519
He was using Tech One
to monitor Salazar's escape.

354
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,312
When we found out, he tried to run.

355
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,590
- Where's he now?
- He's still at CTU.

356
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,519
Chappelle and Johnson
are questioning him.

357
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
- Where are you going?
- Get me over there.

358
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,633
- No, you're not going anywhere. Doctor!
- Get the car.

359
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,872
- Doctor!
- Mr Almeida, what are you doing?

360
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,878
I have to go.
You can release me to CTU Medical.

361
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,030
- I can't do that.
- All right, look.

362
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,076
If you're worried about liability,
my wife will sign me out.

363
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,229
Look, Michelle, if I ever needed you
to trust me, it's now.

364
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,669
These are the bank transfers
that he made from his account in Bogot À.

365
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,871
They stopped two weeks ago.

366
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,195
Follow the money. Where did it go?

367
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,077
Some of it to a bank account here in LA.
A Dav Âd Gomez?

368
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,033
Yeah, we already know about that.
What else?

369
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,311
- That's interesting.
- What?

370
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,594
$720,000 deposited.
I've never seen this account.

371
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,989
Where is it?

372
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,159
Banco del Oeste.
It's in a town in Mexico. Las Nieves.

373
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,157
OK, look out.

374
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,751
- That's gotta be it.
- Good. We're done?

375
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,518
- Not quite.
- What else?

376
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,029
- You have a private plane, don't you?
- Yes.

377
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,912
Clear it for takeoff.

378
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,311
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Chloe.

379
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,238
Did he hurt you? Gael, I mean.

380
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,078
No.

381
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,636
It's crazy. He's been here two years,
and the ClA five before that.

382
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,514
- How did he end up a terrorist?
- I don't know, Chloe.

383
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,520
Listen. I wanna tell you that
I don't think your dad's a bad person.

384
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,512
If I've ever said anything
to offend you, I'm sorry.

385
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,710
It's OK. Thanks.

386
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,234
There, I said it.

387
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,396
(phone rings)

388
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,717
- Hello?
- It's me. Are you alone?

389
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,756
Hold on.

390
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,950
Where are you?
Chappelle ordered you back.

391
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,878
I'm not coming back
until I find your father.

392
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,276
- How are you gonna do that?
- I found out where Hector Salazar is.

393
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,756
Town in Mexico called Las Nieves.
Jack's taking Ram Ãn there.

394
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,190
No, Chase, it's the other way around.
Ram Ãn's taking my dad.

395
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,312
- How do you know that?
- There was a video feed.

396
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,399
And I saw it. They knocked my dad out
and dragged him onto a plane.

397
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,471
A video feed? I don't understand.

398
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,553
Gael works for the Salazars. He's been
watching through surveillance cameras.

399
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,389
- Gael?
- He was helping the Salazars the whole time.

400
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,590
- Is Gael talking?
- I don't know.

401
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,838
Chappelle's got him now. But I don't
know if they're getting anywhere.

402
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,396
CTU has been compromised.
Do not tell anyone you've talked to me.

403
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,476
- Even Chappelle?
- Especially not him.

404
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,637
You cannot go in there alone.
Hector will have an army.

405
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,595
I will call for backup. I need you to promise
me you won't tell anyone you talked to me.

406
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,599
- I don't know.
- Don't do this to us. Too much is at stake.

407
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,191
I'm not doing anything to us.
This is about your life. And my dad's.

408
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,149
I know what this is about. I have to go dark.
There's no time to argue about it. Just do this.

409
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,598
- Kim?
- Be careful, Chase.

410
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,950
Kim? Kim!

411
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,469
So tell me, tough guy. What's the plan?

412
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,595
- You'll know soon enough.
- Come on.

413
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,156
We're interested. Tell the girls. (chuckles)

414
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,592
Do you think you're going to
land the plane and arrest Hector?

415
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,714
No. Even the great Jack Bauer
can't take 50 men by himself.

416
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,237
Oh, I got it. You're gonna drop me off,
turn the plane around.

417
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,354
But wait. You are a criminal in America.
Wanted. So where will you go?

418
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,673
I don't think a third-world country
will suit you.

419
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,268
I think that's called a dilemma, Jack.

420
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,879
Shut up.

421
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,189
Adam...

422
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,629
- Where's Chappelle?
- He's with Gael.

423
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,355
- Where?
- lnterrogation 820.

424
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,436
Let's go.

425
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,315
What the hell's going on?

426
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,317
I don't know.

427
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,870
Talk to me, you son of a bitch.

428
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,119
Door.

429
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,152
- Enough.
- What are you doing?

430
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,316
- Ryan, get him out of the room.
- Why?

431
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,188
Trust me, Ryan.
Get him out of the room.

432
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,836
- You too, Ryan.
- What?

433
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,519
I gotta talk to Gael by myself.
Just trust me.

434
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,875
Michelle, what's going on?

435
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,876
I don't care what's going on
between you two.

436
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,879
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

437
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,871
Ram Ãn?

438
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,915
Ram Ãn!

439
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,916
- Where is Ram Ãn?
- Hector...

440
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,750
Where's my brother?

441
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,872
Kill him! Kill Bauer! Do you hear me?

442
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,636
- What are you doing, Jack?
- He tried to kill me on the plane!

443
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,796
Why the guns?
This is not what we talked about!

444
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,871
(shouts in Spanish)

445
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,916
I was worried. Gael wasn't
sure you were on the plane.

446
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,599
Go see your brother.

447
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,835
My brother, I'm so glad to see you.

448
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,749
- What's going on? I don't understand.
- I'll tell you in a minute. I promise.

449
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,870
Good job, Jack.

450
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,872
Come. We have a lot of work to do.

451
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,349
What are you doing, Hector?

452
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,870
Come. I'll explain everything.

453
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,796
(beeping)

454
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,554
- He's in.
- What? Who's in?

455
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,954
- Jack.
- What?

456
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,959
Gael and I have been trying to get Jack
back undercover with the Salazars.

457
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,548
- That signal means he's in.
- I don't understand.

458
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,150
I'll explain everything.
Right now we gotta call the president.
