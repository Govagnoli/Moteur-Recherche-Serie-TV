1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,236
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,876
- I hope you're not threatening me.
- I don't make threats. I just tell it like it is.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,152
He's showing you that he had the power
to help start your political career,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,311
but he also has the power to end it.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,197
There has to be a way to get to him.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,790
- David, what's wrong?
- I need your help.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,118
Hector and Ram Ãn are trying to buy a virus
to use as a weapon.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,753
Millions of people could die.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,872
I've set up this deal
so my government can destroy the virus.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,878
- You're still with CTU?
- Yes, I'm still with CTU.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,952
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,517
The virus they're going to buy,
Jack is going to take it from them.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,558
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,477
Come on. Move it.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,113
Hurry, hurry.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,078
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,760
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,434
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,880
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,317
- What? We have a deal.
- We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,590
We found out there's
another player in the deal.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,149
- Who is it?
- Nina Myers.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,238
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,874
Hers is 240. You win.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,594
- We can get the virus.
- How do you get the virus?

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,598
I told you. I know her. I can get to her.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,599
The Salazars will pay you at least
ten times more than what you're getting.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,632
Are you going to be able to forgive me
for killing your wife?

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,638
If I wanted revenge, Nina,
I would have killed you already.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,558
All I wanna do is finish this deal
and disappear for good.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,477
Convince me.

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,876
- Adam. Is Amador moving yet?
- No, he's still stopped at the location.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,709
- What do we know about the area?
- It's mostly rural, very few structures.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,116
- Do we have infrared on it?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,832
It's not high-res satellite.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,873
There are vehicles and bodies nearby.
We have no idea what they are.

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,592
Give him space. Make sure he feels
safe enough to take delivery of the virus.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,109
- Got it.
- What's the latest on Chase Edmunds?

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,472
He phoned his position into the Delta teams
and they're en route to pick him up.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,753
- Edmunds?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,792
- What's your condition?
- Shot in the hand. But I'm fine.

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,792
- What about the others?
- I got two people coming with me.

43
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,633
We spotted a vehicle heading this way.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,917
It's the Salazars. They can't know
CTU is down here. We need to leave now.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,356
Then let's get outta here.

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,471
Sergio, we're getting on the chopper.

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,880
We're going to a safe place.
Oriol, go right now.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,678
I can't leave her like this.

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,833
Hector's coming.
You need to think about your son.

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,276
- Bueno. Vamonos.
- We gotta go now.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,868
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,477
Keep them low! Keep them low!

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,315
Give him to me now!
Come on! Stay low! Stay low!

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,869
Yes?

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,275
Alan, it's Wayne Palmer.

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,554
What do you want?

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,275
I thought you had more balls
than to threaten me through my brother.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,277
What, you can't talk to me man to man?

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,914
I don't owe you an explanation.
You slept with my wife.

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,439
- That's between you and me, Alan.
- Fine. Step down and it all goes away.

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,915
- That's not your decision.
- We'll see.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,674
Wayne.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,870
Who you talking to?

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,394
Alan Milliken.

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,796
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Cleaning up my own mess.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,833
- Hello, Alan.
- Mr President.

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,553
That brother of yours
is going to be your undoing.

68
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,717
- I am not firing my brother.
- That's too bad.

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
I have no intention
of losing my healthcare bill.

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,869
I spent two years putting it together.

71
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,872
Except you're three votes short,
the last I checked.

72
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,718
You better brace yourself
for some disappointment.

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,070
I don't wanna go to war with you, Alan.

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,356
It's your choice, Mr President.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,870
The choice is unacceptable.
There has to be another way to work this out.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,992
On any other issue I'd bend over backwards
to accommodate you.

77
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,871
Not on this one.

78
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,872
You have only yourself to blame
for the consequences.

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,839
And I promise you... you won't like them.

80
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,075
- When's Sherry getting here?
- Five minutes.

81
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,880
Good.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Sure you want to bring her into this?

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,077
We're in a street fight, Wayne.
It's what she does best.

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,836
And we both have to focus
on what's happening in Mexico.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,112
I know we're hoping for success,
but we have to anticipate failure.

86
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,954
If Jack Bauer does not intercept the virus,

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,516
then we are dealing
with an international crisis.

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,512
This is Michael Amador. He's representing
the Ukrainians in the sale of the virus.

89
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,872
We have a Delta team tracking him
on the ground at a safe distance.

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,911
Why don't they just get Amador now?

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,477
He may not be carrying the virus, and
we'd blow our chance at the interception.

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,559
Once Jack confirms it is the virus,
the Delta teams will go in and secure it.

93
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,792
- Delta asked for a photo of the woman...
- Adam, wait.

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,554
Nina Myers is the broker?

95
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,870
- Didn't you read the ops brief?
- No.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,118
Kim, come with me.

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,553
- Would you finish the briefing?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,071
I'm sorry.
I was looking for the right time to tell you.

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,556
I cannot believe
Nina Myers is involved in this.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,116
Your father needed her help
to secure the virus.

101
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,668
She killed my mother.

102
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,995
My father couldn't even pretend
to work with her.

103
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,075
I'm sorry, Jack.

104
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,910
I'm sorry, Jack.

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,631
I wanted to think you'd changed,
but I can feel it.

106
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,517
You're lying.

107
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,955
You haven't forgotten anything, have you?

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,159
You despise me.

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,197
You'd do anything
to get me to go along with your plan.

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,877
- It's not true.
- It is true.

111
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,599
I know you're still with CTU.

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,912
So why would I let you set me up?

113
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,958
You know what?
You can believe whatever you want.

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,838
I need this deal to happen.
I'm a fugitive. I don't have a choice.

115
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,873
I need the Salazars to pay me for the virus
and Amador will only deal with you.

116
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,718
Do you understand me?

117
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,872
I'll honour your original deal.
You'll get your 20 million dollars.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,195
And you get to keep breathing.

119
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,880
Until my client doesn't get what he paid for.

120
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,032
Right now your client
should be the least of your worries.

121
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,871
(speaking Spanish)

122
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,869
Hector. She's dead.

123
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,871
Get away from her.

124
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,871
Claudia.

125
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,874
Claudia.

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,430
They can't be far away. Find them.

127
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,909
Find them!

128
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,994
Find them!

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,158
The Mexican authorities are pissed off
that we didn't notify them earlier.

130
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,714
(phone rings)

131
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,035
It's Hector.

132
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,392
- You set?
- Go.

133
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,030
- Yeah.
- It's me.

134
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,151
Edmunds escaped.
He killed three of my men.

135
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,794
Has he contacted CTU?

136
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,269
Not yet. But he may not call.

137
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,830
I found out Edmunds is rogue.
He's been acting on his own.

138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,950
CTU hasn't sent anyone down here
to find him?

139
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,311
They don't even know where he is.

140
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,868
- You call me the second you hear from him.
- I will.

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,311
(phone rings)

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,070
- Yeah.
- Are you still with Bauer?

143
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,829
I'm at the main road into town,
waiting for Bauer to bring the woman.

144
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,873
- We have to call this off.
- What are you taking about?

145
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,718
The CTU agent, Edmunds, he escaped.

146
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,229
- How?
- I don't know. Claudia was with him.

147
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,118
Ram Ãn... she's dead.

148
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,509
I'm sorry.
But, Hector, we still have business to do.

149
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,037
Not with Edmunds on the loose.
When he gets to a phone, he'll call CTU.

150
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,118
- Find him before that happens.
- I am trying, but it's too dark.

151
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,998
- He'll be impossible to track.
- What do you suggest we do?

152
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,872
Forget it. It's too dangerous.

153
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,871
- It always has been.
- Not like this.

154
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,916
You were the one who made this deal.

155
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,156
You promised our buyers
what we can't deliver.

156
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,269
If you don't keep your promise, my reputation
will be ruined. Do you understand?

157
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,876
I understand.

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,552
Keep some of your men looking for Edmunds
and bring the rest here so we can do the deal.

159
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,437
(phone rings)

160
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,231
- Yes.
- Ram Ãn, it's Jack.

161
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,880
- Everything clear outside?
- Yes.

162
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,110
I need you to come back to the building.

163
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,439
- Did the woman agree to work with us?
- I'll explain when you get here.

164
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,957
- (knock at door)
- Yes.

165
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
- Mr President.
- Yes, Aaron?

166
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,189
Sherry Palmer is here.

167
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,878
Show her in.

168
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,440
Thank you.

169
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,553
- Hello, Sherry.
- David.

170
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,552
Thank you, Aaron.

171
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,878
- Please, have a seat.
- No, thank you. I... I'd rather stand.

172
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,989
- So, how are things with Anne?
- They're fine.

173
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,588
Good. I'm glad.

174
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,880
You, uh...

175
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
You deserve a little bit of happiness.

176
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,438
Thank you.

177
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,314
You're looking well, but somehow different.

178
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,159
- A little older.
- No, it's not that.

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,271
- You look calm.
- Um... tired, maybe.

180
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,676
But I'm not sure exactly how calm.

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,873
I know these last three years
have been difficult.

182
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,157
Well... not as difficult
as they could have been.

183
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,676
And I have you to thank for that.

184
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,429
You kept me out of prison,
away from public humiliation.

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,949
I... I lost a lot.

186
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,352
But most of it, I discovered,
really wasn't that important to begin with.

187
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,636
Which surprised me. Imagine that.

188
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,749
- What? What's funny?
- No, nothing, really.

189
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,635
It's just that when I wanted you to pull back
and just let things be, you were a shark.

190
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,110
Now that I've asked you back,
I need you to be a shark.

191
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,671
I can still be whatever you need me to be.

192
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,191
Thank you.

193
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,032
So you say you're having
some kind of trouble with Milliken?

194
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,436
Yes. I am.

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,517
OK. Tell me all about it.

196
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,075
(door opens)

197
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,790
Handcuffs?
I thought you were going to gain her trust.

198
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,913
I will. It's just going to take
a little longer than I hoped.

199
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,198
She'll do the exchange.
That's what's important.

200
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,914
- When is it happening?
- As soon as Amador calls.

201
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,350
Amador better call soon.
We might not have much time.

202
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,835
Your partner escaped.

203
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,712
- You should have let me kill him.
- Yes, I should have.

204
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,990
For some reason Claudia was with him.
She ended up dead.

205
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,835
What are you talking about? How?

206
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,394
Hector didn't say.

207
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,834
Tell Hector I'm sorry.

208
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,918
Tell him yourself when he gets here.

209
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,952
Nina, I need you
to open up this transaction file.

210
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,198
Amador's gonna wanna verify
your client's funds.

211
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,996
Now!

212
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,152
The bottom line is,
Alan's determined to see Wayne removed.

213
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,589
Even if it means destroying my presidency.

214
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,871
- You've tried to work this out peacefully?
- Of course.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,278
Alan wouldn't budge.
In Alan's mind, it's a matter of pride.

216
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,269
So you want me to find something
you can use against Alan?

217
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,274
I've always known
you knew things about Alan

218
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,638
that you didn't tell me
because of my friendship with him.

219
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,070
And I've always known
you were too smart to ask.

220
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,435
Well, I guess we're both right.

221
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,273
Alan does have skeletons in his closet
that he would guard at any cost.

222
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,314
One in particular comes to mind.

223
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,716
But I must warn you, David. It's a big one.

224
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,748
What is it?

225
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,713
All you need to know
is that if you play this card,

226
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,231
you and Alan Milliken
will be enemies for the rest of your life.

227
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,512
As far as I'm concerned, our friendship ended
when he tried to extort me.

228
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,598
Then I can help you.

229
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,757
Our insertion points are here and here.

230
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,513
Claudia's dead. Why did she die?

231
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,077
So we could be safe.

232
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,592
Your sister was very brave, Sergio.

233
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,515
We don't have to worry
about Hector no more.

234
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,879
But I like Hector.

235
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,478
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, will do.

236
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,233
Copy that.

237
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,359
- That's good enough. Give it to me.
- I'm not finished.

238
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,759
Reiss, what's going on?

239
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
With the Salazars after us, CTU
wants me to pull back my surveillance team.

240
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,437
- We can't lose Amador.
- CTU's tracking him through his phone.

241
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,596
He can dump his phone.
We need visual.

242
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,473
Don't worry about that.
It's not your problem any more.

243
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,115
Don't tell me it's not my problem!
It's been my problem for the last year!

244
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,800
Look, Edmunds, you need medical attention.

245
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,713
We're evacuating you
with the boy and his father now.

246
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,831
I'm not going anywhere.

247
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,880
- Mr Chappelle.
- Yeah.

248
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm picking up heat signatures
moving in on Amador's position.

249
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,599
- Ground vehicles?
- From the speed it looks like it.

250
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,399
- This may be the virus.
- What protocols do you want me on?

251
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,875
- Shall I contact the Delta teams?
- Put them on alert.

252
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,875
Make sure they don't approach until Amador
meets Bauer. We want a visual on the virus.

253
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,872
OK. Got it.

254
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,871
Sherry.

255
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,912
Wayne.

256
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,879
What are you doing in here?

257
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,832
I'm waiting for them
to prepare an office for me.

258
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,589
It's good to see you, Sherry, but to be blunt,

259
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,790
I don't think your being here is a good idea.

260
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,749
Of course you don't. That's because
this is all about your indiscretion with Julia.

261
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,871
- Sherry.
- I say that with no judgment.

262
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,595
Of course. You're the last person
who's in a position to pass judgment.

263
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,598
OK, let's not play this.
We're both too good at it.

264
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
So, what do you want me to hear?

265
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,308
- I appreciate you coming to help David...
- No, no, no. Skip that part.

266
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,791
That's right. I forgot that about you.

267
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,475
Listen, Sherry, do whatever it is
that you do around here for a few hours.

268
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,679
But then tell David you were unable to find
anything that he could use on Milliken.

269
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,552
Hm. You know, if I do that,
the only way out of this is if you resign.

270
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,557
Which is what I wanna do.

271
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,558
David doesn't want that,
and frankly, neither do l.

272
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,878
- Sherry, why do you care?
- Because David needs someone like me.

273
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,554
Someone who sees things
the way they really are,

274
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,880
who's not afraid
to throw a punch every now and then.

275
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,873
It's obvious I can't play that role any more,
but you can.

276
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,874
No, Wayne, I feel good knowing David's got
you and I'm gonna make sure he keeps you.

277
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,633
So save your breath, I'm gonna fix this

278
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,753
and you are gonna make sure
your brother gets re-elected.

279
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,955
Fine.

280
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,918
But, Sherry, don't you forget
how dangerous Alan Milliken can be.

281
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,349
Oh, I won't forget.

282
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,597
I'm afraid you're the one who forgot, when
you decided to get involved with his wife.

283
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,673
We haven't heard from Jack in over an hour,
but our Delta teams are on standby.

284
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,952
We're monitoring from here. You'll
advise us of any changes. I'll let him know.

285
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,957
All right, good.

286
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,874
Do you have any more information
on Nina Myers?

287
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,956
No, not yet.

288
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,674
Look, Kim, I know it's hard,

289
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,395
but you're gonna have to
put your feelings aside till all this is over.

290
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,715
How can I put my feelings aside?

291
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,910
How can my father put his feelings aside?

292
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,198
I've spent the last three years knowing
that the woman who killed my mother

293
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,875
was pardoned by the president.

294
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,190
And that she's out there... Iiving her life.

295
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
And it's wrong.

296
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I know.

297
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,190
She's violating her pardon.
She's buying and selling the virus.

298
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,556
- Kim.
- We cannot let her get away this time.

299
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,515
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
- Please. She has to pay for what she's done.

300
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,878
Promise me when this is all over,
you'll at least help make that happen.

301
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,871
(phone rings)

302
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,031
- Yeah.
- Tony, this is Chloe.

303
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,957
- Is Kim in there?
- Yeah.

304
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,833
- I need her.
- All right, she's on her way.

305
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,871
Kim.

306
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,588
I'll do what I can.

307
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,597
Thank you.

308
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,880
- (baby gurgles)
- Shh. It's OK.

309
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,758
- (phone rings)
- Good girl. Nice and warm.

310
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,838
- Yes?
- Chloe, where are the index keys for Salazar?

311
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,110
- Who is this?
- Patrick in Com One.

312
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,993
You guys aren't authorised
to access those keys.

313
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,998
- I'll come and do it for you.
- I'm trying to save some time.

314
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,759
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Fine.

315
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,634
Chloe. You wanted me?

316
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,918
Michelle needs me to brief people in Division,
then I have to give index keys to Com One.

317
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,670
I need you to watch some things for me.
Can you do your work from my station?

318
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,756
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Good. This is Angela.

319
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,031
She's been fed, so she'll sleep.
If she gets fussy, put that in her mouth.

320
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,991
But you can't have a baby in here!

321
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,880
Chappelle thinks I had someone pick her up,
so if he comes up, just keep her hidden.

322
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,792
- Yeah, but I can't...
- I'll be back in 15 minutes.

323
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,951
Ram Ãn.

324
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,310
Jack's not who you think he is.

325
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,315
- Is that right?
- He's working with CTU. He's setting you up.

326
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,234
Do you think
that my brother and I are that stupid?

327
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,113
We made sure that he's acting alone.

328
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,913
Don't you even think
of undermining this deal.

329
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,309
(phone rings)

330
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,200
Hey, Jack. I think it's Amador.

331
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,157
Put this phone on speaker.
You say one wrong word and he will kill you.

332
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,117
You understand?

333
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,391
Go.

334
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,836
- Hello.
- I've got the product.

335
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,838
- Are you ready to show me your account?
- Yes.

336
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,880
- We agreed you'd provide audit privileges.
- Yes. Tell me your routing number.

337
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,271
77509210.

338
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,871
Account number 45508996.

339
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,276
OK.

340
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,758
The funds are in that account,
ready to be transferred?

341
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,757
Yeah.

342
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
There's an old mine east of Posta Mita.

343
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Meet me at the northernmost building
in an hour and ten minutes.

344
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,271
I'll have one man with me for security.
You may do the same.

345
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,869
Good. We'll leave as soon as Hector arrives.

346
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,835
Yuri.

347
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,077
(shouts command)

348
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,233
Amador's on the move.

349
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,032
- What direction?
- East.

350
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,880
Likely destination?

351
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,792
There's half a dozen villages.
It could be any one of them.

352
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
With all due respect, Adam was right.

353
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,792
We should order Delta Team
to move in and arrest Amador.

354
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,917
If the virus isn't under Amador's control,
we could lose it.

355
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,998
- We gotta wait for Jack's confirmation.
- How will he let us know?

356
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,509
The Salazars are watching him. He can't call.

357
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,751
I don't know. He'll find a way.

358
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,079
Shouldn't we inform the Mexican government
what it is we're doing on their soil?

359
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,272
No. I don't wanna risk
compromising the operation.

360
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,436
You should call the president yourself.

361
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,156
Once he understands what kind of threat
this virus poses, he should ease up.

362
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,878
Yes.

363
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,276
Sir, Alan Milliken
is holding for you on line five.

364
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,317
Thank you, Aaron.

365
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,112
- Yes, Alan.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

366
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,474
- What are you talking about?
- Don't screw with me, David.

367
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,880
I didn't pick this fight.

368
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,997
You think you can enlist
your psychopathic ex-wife

369
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,880
to manufacture lies to bring me down?
It's not going to happen.

370
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,476
You want it to stop, stay away
from my healthcare bill and my brother.

371
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,354
You've got it backwards. Your brother
should have stayed away from my wife.

372
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,119
- Come on, Alan, it's over.
- Really?

373
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,351
I'm looking at photographs
of her and Wayne together an hour ago.

374
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
He was trying to convince her
to talk some sense into you.

375
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:19,071
I'm warning you, David. Pull Sherry off this,
or the bill will be the least of your problems.

376
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,113
- Alan's scared.
- Alan is most dangerous when he's scared.

377
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,595
Mm-hm.

378
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,111
Tell the Mexican ambassador
that I'll be calling his president directly.

379
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,236
- She's still out of town.
- I heard you the first time. I'm not deaf.

380
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,230
I understand she's away. I want to talk to her
about Chagrin Falls and give her this number.

381
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,874
- All right.
- Thank you.

382
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,876
- Yes, David?
- I just got off the phone with Alan Milliken.

383
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,390
The blowback happened quickly, huh?
I guess he was pretty upset.

384
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,230
- What have you been up to?
- Exactly what you asked me to do.

385
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,632
I'm fighting back.

386
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,909
What's Chagrin Falls
and what happened there?

387
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,277
It's something that Alan wants to keep buried.

388
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm gonna tell you everything,
but not just now.

389
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,677
I got a lot to get done in a very short period
of time if I'm gonna pull this off for you.

390
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,076
All right.

391
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,035
Across from the opening of the mine
there's enough cover to hide your men.

392
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,879
- All right, good.
- (door opens)

393
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,433
- Did you find Edmunds?
- No. It's too dark to find him.

394
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,391
You don't need to look for Edmunds.

395
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,274
Even if he contacted CTU, they don't have
time to get here before the deal happens.

396
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,269
- What makes you so sure they're not here?
- Didn't Gael say Edmunds came down alone?

397
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,871
Why is she tied up?
Bauer said he's going to buy her cooperation.

398
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,875
Don't worry. She'll do what she's told.

399
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,193
Ram Ãn, can I speak to you in private?

400
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,989
- What is it?
- This is not the plan. I don't like it.

401
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,237
I know you are upset about Claudia,
but there's no reason to panic.

402
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,351
I'm not panicking, I'm being sensible.

403
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,597
- This was your deal in the first place.
- And you were against it.

404
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,436
You was right and I was wrong.

405
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,911
Edmunds escapes, Claudia is dead,
now this woman goes only along at gunpoint.

406
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,271
- It doesn't feel right.
- We don't have a choice.

407
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,358
The buyers are waiting for this deal to happen
because of you.

408
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,792
- Ram Ãn, things are not going as planned.
- The plans have changed.

409
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,911
(phone rings)

410
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,109
CTU, Dessler.

411
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,073
We are following through
with what you have started.

412
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,599
Hello?

413
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,994
They aren't...

414
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,716
Ram Ãn, I'm sorry to interrupt, but if you want
this deal to happen, we gotta go now.

415
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,479
Tony! Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

416
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,477
Put it on speaker.

417
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,795
(Jack) Amador will be at the mine in an hour.

418
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,390
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

419
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,634
Bauer's right. Our men need to be in place
before Amador gets there.

420
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,992
- I still haven't signed off on this.
- You do what I tell you to do.

421
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,117
Now call your men and tell them
to be at the village outside the mine.

422
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,279
Dammit! My battery.

423
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,075
- Hey, Jack, where's the other phone?
- Got it here.

424
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,953
- It's disconnected.
- They told us what we need to know.

425
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,074
Get the Delta teams in position. Set up a
quarantine zone in case the virus gets out.

426
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,198
(Gael) Bauer made it through.

427
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,869
The deal is going down near a mine
just outside of Posta Mita in 55 minutes.

428
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,795
- How long until you can mobilise?
- We've got the coordinates. Moving now.

429
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,838
- Your men are mobilising.
- They will be 3km from the strike zone.

430
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,428
- How did you find out where?
- Bauer got through.

431
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,198
It's going down in 55 minutes.

432
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,239
- You're keeping your men three clicks away?
- We're keeping them out of sight.

433
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,470
How will you know
the package contains the virus?

434
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,511
I'm sending in a forward observer.

435
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,837
- Have you picked anyone yet?
- No, not yet.

436
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,114
I'll do it.

437
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,835
- We got people trained for that, Edmunds.
- I'm trained for it too.

438
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,155
Besides, I know the Salazars, remember?

439
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,272
- Your hand.
- This isn't combat, it's observation.

440
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,032
All right.

441
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,392
Trell, gear this man up
with the surveillance package.

442
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,872
- Get over it, Hector.
- Not until you respect what I have to say.

443
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,510
- The Americans could be hiding anywhere.
- There's no more time to argue.

444
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,198
Stop talking down to me!

445
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,393
Did you already forget the only reason
you are here is because of me?

446
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,398
- Who got you out of prison?
- Bauer got me out. Not you.

447
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,353
Now that I'm out, you take orders from me,
like you always have.

448
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,199
- Ram Ãn...
- It's over, Hector. No more talking.

449
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,117
We're gonna do the deal now.

450
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,149
Bauer! Get her in the car.

451
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,200
You can't control this, Jack.

452
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,197
Just get in the car.

453
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,872
Hombres, vamonos.

454
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,151
- (baby crying)
- What's the matter?

455
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,874
Please don't cry. Shh, it's OK.

456
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,674
- Shh.
- (crying continues)

457
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,553
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything to her.

458
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,671
You must have done something.

459
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,349
Chloe, look, I promise you,
I didn't do anything to her.

460
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,519
I'm gonna redirect all my files back
down to my desk. I'm finished with this.

461
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,713
Jack and Nina are meeting Amador
in 53 minutes in a place called Posta Mita.

462
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,230
- What about Delta Force?
- They've established a perimeter of 3km.

463
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,880
- (baby screaming)
- What the hell is that?

464
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,871
Dammit. I told her.

465
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,397
Michelle, you take care of this, please.

466
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,394
- That's it, Chloe. You're out of here.
- I said I didn't have anyone to watch her.

467
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,159
You'll watch her.
I gave you a warning. You're suspended.

468
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,198
- It was a verbal warning only.
- Ryan.

469
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,391
- What?
- Jack's meeting Amador in less than an hour.

470
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,829
We have no visual satellite coverage
of that area.

471
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,189
What does that have to do with this baby?

472
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,399
We have to use digitally enhanced audio
coverage. Chloe is the best we have at that.

473
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,870
You're telling me we have to let
this woman raise her child in our office

474
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,832
because no one can do her job?

475
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,759
Maybe we should deal with
Chloe's childcare problems on another day.

476
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,715
OK, thatta girl.

477
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,915
(cries)

478
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,869
I have work to do.
Who's gonna look after my child?

479
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,599
- Give her to Kim.
- What?

480
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,872
Based on what CTU got from Jack,
the meeting will take place here,

481
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,872
by an old mine north of town.

482
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,952
My position is gonna be here.

483
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,880
I need you to put your men behind this ridge
until we know that the virus is real.

484
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,519
Good natural cover. That'll work.

485
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,633
- How long will it take your men to get there?
- 90 seconds.

486
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,876
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

487
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,513
- Where are the rest of the men?
- Felipe brought everyone.

488
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,791
- There's not enough.
- Amador is only bringing one man.

489
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,313
So he says.

490
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,352
- Stop making problems.
- I'm making sure we are covered.

491
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,880
You want to stop this
because you lost your nerve.

492
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,031
Things are moving fast.
We haven't had time to think them through.

493
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,880
- We'll be fine.
- That doesn't mean we'll be fine.

494
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,792
The situation is difficult enough.
Don't make it worse.

495
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,708
Or what?

496
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,752
Ram Ãn, if you want this deal to happen,
we have to leave now.

497
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
We have to be there
20 minutes before Amador.

498
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,474
The deal is off!

499
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,871
All right.

500
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,880
- Hector, we're not done here.
- I've said what I need to say.

501
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,110
Listen to me, Hector.
Listen to me carefully.

502
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,715
If we don't give our buyers
what you promised,

503
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,877
we won't just lose money, we'll lose respect.

504
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,830
And without that, we have nothing.

505
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,871
We'll have our lives.

506
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,076
We're leaving now.

507
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,868
Pablo, Felipe, vamonos.

508
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,711
Now!

509
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,998
Hector, don't do this.

510
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,076
Hector!

511
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,836
Hector!

512
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,436
Hector!
