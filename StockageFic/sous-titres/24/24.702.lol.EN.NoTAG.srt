3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,404
We're done debating this, Joe.

4
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,852
The UN's been issuing reprimands
and economic sanctions

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,716
while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered
over 200,000 of his own people.

6
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,483
That number will continue to grow

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,366
if we don't stop him now.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,066
- Did you find something?
<i>- I did.</i>

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,606
<i>It doesn't confirm how
your son died, but it is suspicious.</i>

10
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,060
I'm listening.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,829
His girlfriend, Samantha,
received a large lump sum deposit

12
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,238
about three days
after Roger's suicide.

13
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:44,418
You mean his alleged to suicide.
I'll talk to her myself.

14
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:48,435
Sorry for interrupting, Senator.
We have a subpoena for Jack Bauer.

15
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,222
He's being questioned
by the United States Senate.

16
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:53,284
We need Mr. Bauer immediately.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,401
The CIP firewall protects every major
infrastructure system in this country.

18
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,934
If it were breached
they would all be vulnerable.

19
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,892
The Department of Justice is about
to file criminal charges against me.

20
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:04,604
I'm not in a position to help you.

21
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:07,977
One of the men behind this
threat is someone you know.

22
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,881
You think Tony's looking for justice
by attacking this country?

23
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,279
Help me find Almeida,
and you can ask him yourself.

24
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,491
Where's Tony Almeida?

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,909
I'm not talking to you.

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,870
- This is your call.
- Do whatever it takes.

27
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,376
All right! All right!
I'll tell you what I know!

28
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:29,079
Last time I saw Almeida...

29
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,182
There's nothing you
or the FBI can do about this.

30
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>Stay away.</i>

31
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:39,974
Tony, just talk to me.

32
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,761
<i>GSA 117, this is Northeast Three.</i>

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,938
Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.

34
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:47,974
Advise passing 7,000.

35
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,505
<i>Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.</i>

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,029
- Roger that, Northeast Three.
- <i>GSA 117, enter descent for 1,500.</i>

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,537
I've lost comm with GSA 117.

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,114
Call back FBI.

39
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,436
Tell them we have a 767 on approach
no longer under our control.

40
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:16,697
Anybody get through
to Global Skies 117 yet?

41
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,778
Not yet, sir.
We're trying everything.

42
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:22,161
- Where's the plane?
- 120 miles miles southwest of JFK.

43
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:24,226
- Right here.
- All right,

44
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:27,010
we have to alert them somehow.
Analyze the projected flight path.

45
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,481
Find a way to contact them visually
from the ground.

46
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,751
Todd, access the passenger records.

47
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:34,258
Get as many cell numbers
as you can and try calling them.

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,904
Nothing on the emergency channels?

49
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:40,543
They're not trying to contact anyone,
but they just descended to 1,500.

50
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,319
- I don't know on whose directions.
- I think I've got it.

51
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:44,810
- Got what?
- Listen to this.

52
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,381
This was recorded right
after we lost comm with them.

53
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,762
<i>GSA 117, this is Northeast Three.</i>

54
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,320
<i>Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.</i>

55
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:52,879
<i>Advise passing 7,000.</i>

56
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,502
<i>Maintain 1,500.</i>

57
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,873
<i>Traffic ahead reporting
minor turbulence.</i>

58
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:59,515
<i>Should be a smoother
ride for you down there.</i>

59
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:02,514
They think they're
communicating with us.

60
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,102
<i>Bureau.</i>

61
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,710
This is Air Traffic Control,
Northeast 3. I must talk to Agent Moss.

62
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,122
- It's urgent.
- <i>I'll put you through.</i>

63
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,105
<i>Agent Moss, I'm transferring
Air Traffic Control again.</i>

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,530
What's your status, Sid?

65
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:21,699
The people that broke the firewall
are controlling one of my planes.

66
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:25,162
They're talking directly to the pilot
as if they're Air Traffic Control.

67
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:27,623
<i>As long as the pilot thinks
he's talking to one of us,</i>

68
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,433
he'll do whatever they tell him.

69
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:30,558
My God...

70
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:34,113
GSA 117,
this is Northeast Three Control...

71
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:35,965
Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.

72
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,914
<i>Standby for new runway assignment.</i>

73
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,335
<i>Turn right, heading zero-six-zero.</i>

74
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,541
Intercept radar vectors
for runway three-one-left.

75
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:48,065
Northeast Three, we're showing
JFK weather systems unchanged.

76
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,564
Yeah, we've had a change
in wind direction.

77
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,607
Locally, there's danger
of wind shear.

78
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,776
Roger that, Northeast Three.
We're turning to heading 0-6-0 now.

79
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,564
All right, they're changing course.

80
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:08,305
I got off the phone with Sid Paulson
at Northeast Three Air Traffic Control.

81
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,790
Almeida's group is definitely
in their system.

82
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,237
NSA just detected it.

83
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,086
They're trying to locate the point
of entry, but they're not optimistic.

84
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,703
Forget where they got in the system.
How do we get them out?

85
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,467
They don't know. They've never seen
anything like this before.

86
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,054
I got the alley.

87
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,265
Larry, go to channel two.

88
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:31,333
Yeah, go ahead. I hope you got
information from Schector.

89
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,704
- This thing has escalated.
- "Escalated" how?

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,003
Almeida's group has picked out
a 767 in flight.

91
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:38,298
- They're controlling it.
- What? Why, to what end?

92
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:40,445
I don't know,
but we've got to find this guy.

93
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,324
- What did Schector say?
- Not much before he was killed.

94
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,431
- What?
- <i>Sniper across the street.</i>

95
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,338
We sealed off the building immediately.
We know he's in there.

96
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:55,038
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it was surgical.

97
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm sending you SWAT teams
to search the building.

98
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,280
- SWAT teams are on their way.
- I think you got a problem.

99
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:02,653
Almeida called that office
seconds after Schector died.

100
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:05,437
- How did he knew I was there?
- I'm assuming he had him under watch.

101
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,139
I think it came from your office.

102
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,532
- What?
- Someone from FBI had to tip him off.

103
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,700
Only them knew
I was going with you.

104
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,757
- No, I can't believe that.
- I didn't believe Almeida was terrorist

105
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,090
but we have to deal with the facts,
not what we want to believe is true.

106
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,808
I read your file. I know you have
a propensity for not trusting people,

107
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,207
but my team has worked around
the clock to find Almeida,

108
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,406
they're good agents.

109
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,427
How they got a sniper
on the roof that quickly.

110
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,828
I told you
Almeida had Schector staked out.

111
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,669
We were in his office for 10 min.

112
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,958
There is no way they got
a shooter in position that fast.

113
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,445
Until you know where the leak is,
you must assume

114
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,236
that you've got a bad agent,
and you need to work around him.

115
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,832
No offense, but I brought you here
to help with Schector,

116
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,744
not to co-manage this operation.

117
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:46,512
You brought me to find Almeida.

118
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:49,311
And I am warning you,
you better be careful who you let in.

119
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,865
Mr. Bauer,
I need you to surrender the gun.

120
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,194
Agent Kilner.

121
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,478
Jack Bauer,
put him in your vehicle till I get back.

122
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,448
Yes, ma'am.
This way, sir.

123
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,795
- What's your status?
- We secured the building.

124
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,590
When SWAT gets here, we'll have
video feed and we'll sweep room by room.

125
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:26,880
- If the shooter's here, we'll find him.
- He's in there.

126
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:46,408
Janis, whatever you've got on FAA,
leave it with to Sean.

127
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,532
- Come here.
- Wait a minute. I need her here.

128
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:49,853
So do I.

129
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,392
There was sniper fire at Schector's
office. We've got three dead bodies.

130
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:57,079
Where Renee was?
Is she okay?

131
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,012
She's fine.
I need you to provide support.

132
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:01,136
She thinks she has the sniper
locked in a building.

133
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,507
There are SWAT teams on the way,
coordinate with them.

134
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,716
Anything else
on how we get through to that plane?

135
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,993
No, but we talked to a men
who worked with Latham,

136
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,144
who said that the way the firewall
was breeched,

137
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,099
he doesn't think we can contact.

138
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:21,716
- It's Agent Moss.
- Got any help for us?

139
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,089
NSA's nowhere.

140
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:25,318
- What about you?
- We're trying to contact passengers.

141
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:27,522
So far we haven't been able
to get through to anyone.

142
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,868
What about Air Force?

143
00:07:28,993 --> 00:07:32,635
They've scrambled an F-16 to intercept,
but it's still about 13 minutes out.

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,531
Look, let me get back to you.

145
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,914
Have you break
into their channel yet?

146
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:39,063
No, but I hear Almeida
talking with the pilot.

147
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:41,489
He's landing him
on runway three-one-left.

148
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:43,635
It can't be that simple.

149
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:49,136
They didn't take control of this plane
just to land it on a different runway.

150
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,358
Todd, what do you got on your radar
that's on approach?

151
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,644
Everything looks good.

152
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,277
And GSA 117?

153
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:57,935
Nothing near it.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,377
What the hell is this?!

155
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,616
What happened?

156
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,982
All the screens for
the Eastern quadrant are locked.

157
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:06,896
Try the backup systems.

158
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:09,214
They're not working.

159
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,488
- It's locked!
- Mine, too.

160
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:14,423
Okay, they're blind.

161
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:21,039
Send their Sunrise flight into
intersecting landing pattern with 117.

162
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:22,334
SRI35,

163
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,667
this is Northeast Three Control.

164
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,472
We have a new runway assignment
for you.

165
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,870
Set your vectors for final:

166
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,847
- runway four-right.
- Roger that, Northeast Three.

167
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,106
He's changing course.

168
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,155
- Paulson.
- How do your screens look over there?

169
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,157
- Who is this?
- <i>That doesn't matter.</i>

170
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,311
What matters is that I took
out your control units.

171
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,612
Call the Bureau.
Trace this call.

172
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:02,510
- What the hell do you want?
- I want you to see what we can do.

173
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,212
Why don't you pull up
the surveillance cameras at JFK Tower.

174
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,133
Give me the cameras at JFK.

175
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,304
Sid, there's another plane
landing on four-right.

176
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,307
It crosses three-one-left.

177
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,726
Oh, my God,
they're on a collision course.

178
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:22,753
Scramble emergency at JFK.

179
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,628
GSA 117, pull up.

180
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,093
<i>Safety alert, pull up.</i>

181
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:51,168
<i>Traffic on runway four-right.</i>

182
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:52,884
Pull up.

183
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,341
Sir, we have screens
and communication back.

184
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,870
Phil...

185
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,119
We're good.

186
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,364
<i>That was just a warning shot.</i>

187
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,319
Whatever we do next
will not be a demonstration.

188
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,101
It'll be the real thing.

189
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,667
What do you people want?

190
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,637
You'll find out soon enough.

191
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:18,594
It's Emerson.

192
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,247
Emerson's here.

193
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:28,762
Get the module ready.

194
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,135
Uncuff him.

195
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,951
- What happened to those planes?
- Don't worry about that.

196
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,538
Did you crash them?
How many people did you kill?

197
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,062
Get him cleaned up.

198
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,778
I take it everything
went as planned.

199
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,130
The off-site testing
the module worked perfectly.

200
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,154
Let's see it.

201
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:25,841
Good.

202
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,961
That's our genius, huh?

203
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,144
Yes, it is.

204
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:35,128
- Had to be encouraged?
- Yeah, but...

205
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,714
I've got him to a place
where he'll do whatever you want.

206
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,655
Can I talk to you a second?

207
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,981
Take the module.

208
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,566
Tell me how the FBI
managed to find Schector.

209
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,828
They used an old colleague of mine.

210
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:53,188
An agent I worked with
at CTU named Jack Bauer.

211
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,484
Yeah, I know who Bauer is.
He's not going to be a problem.

212
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,916
I took care of Schector before
he could tell the FBI anything.

213
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,935
I'll take care of Jack Bauer, too.

214
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't want you distracted
from this new job.

215
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,661
Speaking of which,
you haven't told me what that is.

216
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,347
Tanner has the specs.
He'll brief you when he gets here.

217
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,958
Why don't you just tell me now?

218
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,669
'Cause you don't need to know yet.

219
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:18,463
Tony, we've been doing this
three years.

220
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:22,008
The less information any one of us has,
the safer we all are.

221
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,879
Come on, after this next job,
we're done.

222
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,258
Cash in our chips,
do whatever we want.

223
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,019
All right.
I'll call you when Tanner gets here.

224
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:35,869
Let's go.

225
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,389
Come on, let's go.

226
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,416
I'm about to make a statement, sir.
Are there any changes I should know?

227
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,573
No, this is fine.

228
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,892
Just remember,

229
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,707
don't indicate when the go-ahead
to invade will be given,

230
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,936
- no matter how hard they push.
- But it's acceptable to mention

231
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,948
that the President is meeting
with Former Prime Minister Matobo?

232
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:58,503
And when they ask whether the President
sees him as Juma's successor?

233
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,358
No need to hide that fact.

234
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,651
President wants maximum exposure
on her support for Matobo.

235
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,396
Thank you, sir.

236
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,978
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

237
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,730
Despite global condemnation

238
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
and UN-imposed economic sanctions,

239
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,619
General Benjamin Juma
has refused to stop the genocide

240
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:27,909
that his brutal dictatorship has been
perpetrating since he took power.

241
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,189
President Taylor has made
a persuasive case to the world that

242
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,081
a full-scale military intervention
by US forces

243
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,751
and a complete overthrow
of the Juma regime

244
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:40,670
would be the only
way to stop the continued slaughter

245
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,296
of the innocent men,
women and children of Sangala.

246
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,044
Yes, you there.

247
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,224
Angela, has the President formulated
a timeframe for this intervention?

248
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:52,650
<i>Sir, the FAA just reported
a near-collision at JFK.</i>

249
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,399
- JFK?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

250
00:14:54,969 --> 00:14:56,311
How long ago did this happen?

251
00:14:56,893 --> 00:15:00,649
I can tell you that President Taylor
and former Prime Minister Ule Matobo

252
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:04,572
are meeting as we speak to
formulate a post-invasion strategy.

253
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,306
I know how hard you fought
to get the support needed

254
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,485
to launch this military operation.

255
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,679
And I want you to know my country
will be eternally grateful.

256
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:16,979
Our soldiers are the ones
truly deserving of your gratitude.

257
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,607
They're the people putting
their lives on the line.

258
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,796
Still, I know you are taking
a great political risk.

259
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,500
I have no reservations.

260
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,758
Stopping Juma
is the right thing to do.

261
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,714
But once he's been removed
from power,

262
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,304
it is critical that he be dealt with
in a court of law.

263
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:37,158
And not in a way that would
perpetuate the cycle of violence.

264
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:40,637
Juma has killed
over 200,000 of our people,

265
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,274
including two of my own brothers.

266
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:46,002
So no one knows more
about the "cycle of violence" than I do.

267
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,197
But my countrymen
will want to see Juma punished.

268
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,928
Then punish him
according to the rule of law.

269
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,265
That's the only way democracy
will work in Sangala.

270
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,469
If no one is treated
outside the law.

271
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:00,746
Not even Juma.

272
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,901
You have my word.

273
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,596
And now, I'd like for us to go over
some last-minute operational points

274
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:25,148
- with my Secretary of Defense.
- All right.

275
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:29,522
Excuse me, Mr. Matobo.

276
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:36,786
- What's the emergency, Ethan?
- Northeast Air Traffic Control reported

277
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,528
a near-miss
between two commercial flights at JFK.

278
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,603
Fortunately, no one was hurt.

279
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,835
And we think this man
Almeida was behind it?

280
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,421
It's him.
We verified his voice print.

281
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:50,648
He contacted Air Traffic Control
and told them this was a demonstration,

282
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,373
- a shot across the bow, so to speak.
- What does he want?

283
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,297
His exact words were:

284
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,309
"You'll find out soon enough."

285
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,231
This is unacceptable.

286
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,362
I mean, it's just technology.

287
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,423
We should be able
to unplug these bastards.

288
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:09,234
We're trying everything we can think of,
but it's not that simple.

289
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,049
What's being done to find Almeida?

290
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,933
The FBI believes they're closing in
on one of his associates.

291
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,708
What's their timeframe?

292
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,035
That's unclear.

293
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,930
Let's go ahead with grounding
all nonessential air traffic,

294
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:22,582
and set up a meeting with Homeland,
FBI, and DoD.

295
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,344
Yes, Madam President.

296
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,803
Who is it?
Hold on.

297
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:32,717
Tanner.

298
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:38,911
<i>Hey, Tanner, what's going on?</i>

299
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,935
I'm trapped
in the Columbia Building.

300
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,607
FBI's sweeping it right now,
floor by floor.

301
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,194
I don't know how the hell
I'll be able to get past them.

302
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,563
I understand.
Exactly where in the building are you?

303
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:50,687
<i>The basement.</i>

304
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,731
Near the west stairwell.

305
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,167
<i>We're on 12th.</i>

306
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:58,851
<i>Roger that, Alpha.</i>

307
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,982
<i>Sixth floor's clear. We're moving.
Copy that.</i>

308
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,069
<i>Charlie 2,
moving to the fifth floor.</i>

309
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:05,194
<i>Proceed.</i>

310
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,239
I just wanted to tell you.

311
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:18,545
What they're making you go through
at that Senate hearing, it's wrong.

312
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,603
No, it's not.

313
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:27,480
It's better that everything
comes out in the open.

314
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,358
We've done so many secret things
over the years

315
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:35,368
in the name of protecting this country
we've created two worlds:

316
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,883
ours and the people
we promised to protect.

317
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,433
They deserve to know the truth.

318
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,917
Then they can decide
how far they want to let us go.

319
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,042
Still,

320
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:49,836
you don't deserve
to be treated that way,

321
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,302
not after what you've done
for our country.

322
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,634
And I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

323
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,370
Thank you.

324
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,401
Entering the basement
from the west stairwell.

325
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,115
Roger that, Agent Lennert.

326
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,415
I'm here to get you out.
Tony sent me.

327
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,489
How?

328
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,635
Put this on.

329
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:08,546
A SWAT unit just cleared the stairwell.
Take it up to the lobby.

330
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,083
There's a gray Ford parked next to the
kiosk in the lot behind the building.

331
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,558
Go.

332
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:23,050
This is Lennert.

333
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:25,856
- Basement level is clear.
- Roger that.

334
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,309
Alpha team is clearing the first floor.
Hook up with them.

335
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:29,849
<i>On my way.</i>

336
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,522
Agent Walker, she's good, huh?

337
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,481
Yes, sir.

338
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,999
She understands
what it takes to get the job done.

339
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:43,700
You mind if I step out and get some air?
It's been a hell of a morning.

340
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,243
Yeah, sure thing.

341
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,786
Just stay close, sir.

342
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,627
Yeah. Thanks.

343
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,885
Just got an update from headquarters.
Your friend, Tony Almeida,

344
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,806
just used the device to orchestrate
a near-miss between two planes.

345
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,096
He's threatening
to do it for real next time.

346
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:15,398
Are all your men represented
on the deployment grid?

347
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,566
Yeah. Why?

348
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,133
I don't want you to do anything now,
but see that man walking away?

349
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:23,114
- That's your shooter.
- How can that be possible?

350
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,658
If one of your people helped him get
through the perimeter. Check the grid.

351
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:29,973
Look out.

352
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,025
You're right. He's not one of ours.

353
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,212
We'll follow him,
see if he leads us back to Almeida.

354
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,089
No, that's not the right move.

355
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,717
You can't bring
anyone else into this,

356
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,637
not until you know how badly
the Bureau's been compromised.

357
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,598
- Okay, so what are you suggesting?
- We can do this on our own.

358
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:50,593
Yes, Agent Walker?

359
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,374
Ma'am?

360
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:56,741
Put more agents on the eastern edge.
The perimeter looks light.

361
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:57,866
On it.

362
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:00,068
- You made the right call.
- We'll see.

363
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,393
I need your vehicle.

364
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,829
<i>We have some breaking news
to tell you about right now.</i>

365
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:31,486
<i>The FAA confirms a near-miss
between two planes</i>

366
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:34,443
<i>at JFK International Airport
just a short time ago.</i>

367
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:38,003
<i>As a result, outgoing flights nationwide
are now grounded.</i>

368
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,890
<i>Planes already in the air
will be grounded once they land.</i>

369
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,610
Listen to me, Latham.

370
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,030
Do as you're told, you'll stay alive.
You understand?

371
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,501
Put him in storage. Watch him.

372
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,963
An effective demonstration,
wouldn't you say, Mr. Dubaku?

373
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:01,905
Very effective.

374
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,007
General Juma will be pleased.

375
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:06,677
Is that the module?

376
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,037
As promised.

377
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,176
And I've brought the man
who constructed it here

378
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,266
in case there are
any modifications necessary.

379
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:17,228
Now that we've impressed
upon the White House what we can do,

380
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,978
perhaps now would be a good time

381
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:21,708
to make your demands known
to President Taylor.

382
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,985
Make the preparations.

383
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:28,658
Your government killed my brother
and they tried to kill me.

384
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,576
Now they are going to pay
a very steep price for...

385
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,470
interfering in our affairs.

386
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,785
FAA is landing flights,
so far without incident,

387
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,252
but these people have proven
what they can do, and at any time,

388
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,341
can sabotage air traffic or any
of the infrastructure systems

389
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,838
we have beyond the firewall.

390
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:51,732
Does NSA have a time frame on fixing it
to keep these people out permanently?

391
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:55,641
Madame President, the CIP firewall
was the result of a multi-year project.

392
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,096
Reengineering the code
could take weeks or months.

393
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:00,216
At this point,
NSA just doesn't know.

394
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,033
Exactly what systems
are vulnerable, Dr. Cornell?

395
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:06,694
At the top of the list
would be the national power grid.

396
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,990
If disabled,

397
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,928
we could end up being unable
to deliver power to millions of people.

398
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:14,702
Such a blackout would certainly result
in rioting in the major cities.

399
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,289
Even more critical

400
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,998
are the water treatment
and distribution systems.

401
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,558
By sabotaging key dams
and sewage processing plants,

402
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,961
they could contaminate drinking water
on a massive scale.

403
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:27,314
Deaths from poisoning
would be substantial up front

404
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,664
and massive casualties
would follow soon thereafter

405
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,956
as people began to die
from dehydration.

406
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,050
Is there any way
to protect these systems?

407
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:36,030
The only way would be
shutting them down,

408
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,223
and then, within a short time,
it would be impossible

409
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:41,312
to supply the population
with sufficient food and clean water.

410
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:45,274
The resulting civil unrest would
undoubtedly aggravate the situation.

411
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:48,027
Here are the latest projections.

412
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:53,809
Thank you.

413
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:06,275
- Ethan Kanin.
<i>- Mr. Kanin, this is Agent Gedge.</i>

414
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,882
I'm with the First Gentleman.

415
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,018
<i>With him where? What's he doing?</i>

416
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,412
<i>Mr. Taylor is on his way
to confront Roger's former girlfriend.</i>

417
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,225
I thought he gave up on all of this.

418
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,598
Sir, he's consumed by the idea
that his son was murdered,

419
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,993
and for the past two months,
he's been pursuing that belief

420
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,937
through a private detective he hired
without the President's knowledge.

421
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:24,939
My God.

422
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:29,026
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing anything about this?

423
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,035
I take full responsibility
for that, sir.

424
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,824
Mr. Taylor enlisted me in keeping
his activities off the official manifest

425
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,720
but it's gotten out of hand.

426
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,787
And at this point,
I'm worried about Mr. Taylor's...

427
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,080
state of mind.

428
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:44,266
I think the President needs
to know what's going on.

429
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,391
All right.

430
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,511
Thank you, Agent Gedge.

431
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:53,695
Agent Gedge?

432
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,558
- Sir?
- Everything all right?

433
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:57,367
Yes, sir. Just checking in.

434
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:02,334
A Building disaster preparedness
scenarios is not enough.

435
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,187
I want the governors

436
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,865
to put the National Guard
on a pre-deployment footing.

437
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,286
And until we find
and stop the people behind this,

438
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:12,320
I think we should talk
about raising the alert level.

439
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,964
We have the building locked down,

440
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,240
and we're searching
for the suspect as we speak.

441
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,783
It's our highest priority.

442
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,675
Understood, sir.

443
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,915
The White House is all over this.
Homeland's leaning on us.

444
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,457
We've got to find this guy now.

445
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,175
Dornan's team is almost done
with their sweep through the building,

446
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,741
but he said it's his gut feeling
that the sniper is not in there.

447
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,581
I don't care about his gut feeling.

448
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:34,551
They had that building locked down
right after the shots were fired.

449
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,010
He's got to be in there.

450
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,899
Tell them to search
every square inch.

451
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:39,347
What?

452
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,101
Dornan also wants to know
if we know where Agent Walker is.

453
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,519
She's not at the scene?

454
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,231
She left ten minutes ago
without logging her destination.

455
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,736
- What about Bauer?
- He left the scene with her.

456
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:17,623
He's coming up on heavy traffic.
Drop back a little more.

457
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:18,678
I've got him.

458
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,433
- It's Larry.
- Don't answer it.

459
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:27,505
Then he'll get worried
or suspicious.

460
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:32,817
Dornan said you left the scene.

461
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:35,361
Why? What's going on?

462
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:39,170
SWAT has the operation well in hand.
I'm following up on a lead.

463
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:41,397
- What lead?
- A weapon we found at Schector's.

464
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,911
There's a partial serial number.
I want to run it past a source.

465
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:45,325
With Bauer?

466
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:47,198
Yes, he's accompanying me.

467
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,088
Renee...

468
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:54,672
what the hell's going on?

469
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,133
What are you talking about?

470
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:00,885
Getting our hands on that shooter
is our best chance of finding Almeida

471
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,035
and finding that device. I don't think
you'd turn your back on that operation

472
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,589
for a lead you could easily have
passed off to another agent.

473
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:09,269
- I'm not sure what you're getting at.
- Neither am I.

474
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,815
Has Bauer gotten you
involved with something?

475
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:16,879
Larry, do you trust me?

476
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,865
You know the answer to that.

477
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,885
Then just accept what I'm telling you.
We're following up on a lead,

478
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,574
and I'll fill you in
if and when we find something.

479
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,169
All right.

480
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,379
Damn it.

481
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:40,946
I do not like this.
I just flat out lied to my boss.

482
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,238
Did he buy it?

483
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,828
Are we in the clear?

484
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:47,475
Yeah, I think so.

485
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,780
Good. Thanks.

486
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,741
Is Renee's comm unit active?

487
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,161
- Yeah. Her walkie's on.
- Can you do a triangulation on it?

488
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,455
That's not really
what the system is set up for.

489
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:13,167
- But I can try.
- Do more than try.

490
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,794
I want to know where she is.

491
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,985
- Can you not just call her?
- Janis...

492
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,853
- Just do it.
- Okay.

493
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:37,770
Back at Schector's office,

494
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,579
when I told you
to get Almeida's location out of him,

495
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,833
how far were you planning
to go with that?

496
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,782
You told me to do whatever it takes.

497
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:47,488
Yeah, I said that
for Schector's benefit, to scare him,

498
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,328
but you were actually
planning to do it.

499
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:52,748
How far would you have gone?

500
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,559
It doesn't matter now.

501
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,041
It does to me.

502
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,255
I just put my career on the line
because of you, and I'd like to know

503
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,799
- who I'm dealing with.
- Yeah, well, you read my file.

504
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,467
Your file doesn't tell me

505
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,678
how you justify
the things that you've done.

506
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,989
I've been answering a lot of questions
lately about my past

507
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:10,655
and, frankly, I'm done.

508
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,121
I told you I'd help
you find Tony Almeida.

509
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:14,854
I even agreed to do it your way.

510
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:17,815
Since the FBI's been compromised,
that's no longer an option.

511
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:20,374
Now, I can still help you find him,

512
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,778
but you're going to have
to let me do it my way.

513
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,989
Is that going to be a problem?

514
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:27,902
We'll see.

515
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,867
I know you think this is a mistake.

516
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:56,103
- It's not my place to say that, sir.
- And if it was?

517
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:59,021
The authorities have already
questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.

518
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:00,416
Not about this.

519
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:04,069
They assumed my son killed himself
and didn't look deeply into anything.

520
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:05,436
This way, sir.

521
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,544
Well, even though
the market's been soft,

522
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,401
you don't want to
hedge your buy on this.

523
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,999
<i>It's really all I can do today.</i>

524
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:15,414
You know 10,000 shares
isn't going to cut it.

525
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,162
Excuse me a moment.
Samantha Roth.

526
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:21,244
<i>Miss Roth, there is a Secret
Service agent here to see you.</i>

527
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:23,452
- What?
<i>- He's at Reception.</i>

528
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,342
<i>Would you like me to have someone
show him to your desk?</i>

529
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,840
No. I'll be right there.

530
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:33,974
<i>All right.</i>

531
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,230
- Let me call you back.
<i>- Sure.</i>

532
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:00,084
Mr. Taylor?

533
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,753
This is quite a surprise.

534
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,965
How are you?

535
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:06,893
I wanted to have a word with you,
Sam, in private.

536
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:08,026
Of course.

537
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:11,537
I'm really sorry,

538
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,968
we haven't spoken
since Roger's funeral.

539
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:17,560
It's just...
It's been so difficult for me.

540
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,741
I know about the money, Sam.

541
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,314
- Excuse me?
- $400,000

542
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,798
wired to an offshore account
in the Cayman Islands

543
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:27,267
three days after you
found my son's body.

544
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,489
There's no point in denying it.
I just want to know who paid you

545
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,081
- and why.
- Paid me?

546
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,744
You know something about my son,
and somebody paid you to keep quiet.

547
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,080
Mr. Taylor, that is just not true.

548
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,332
Please, just answer the question!

549
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:50,182
The money...

550
00:32:50,812 --> 00:32:51,812
It...

551
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:54,889
- It isn't mine.
- What do you mean, it's not yours?

552
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,599
It belongs to my aunt.

553
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,916
She's had financial difficulties

554
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,066
since my uncle passed
away last year.

555
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,536
It's from his divested
real estate holdings.

556
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:06,066
I suggested she move it
to an offshore account

557
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,485
- to hide it from the IRS.
- You want me to believe

558
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:11,322
you had the presence of mind
to commit tax fraud

559
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,244
three days after my son died,

560
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,319
the man you supposedly loved?

561
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,620
I did love him.

562
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:22,791
And I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

563
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:24,335
I don't.

564
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,046
You're lying.

565
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:30,667
If that's what you think,
we have nothing left to talk about.

566
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,343
You're not going anywhere.

567
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,428
- Let go of me.
- Sir!

568
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,512
- You know who murdered my son.
- No one murdered him.

569
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,643
He killed himself.

570
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,562
Mr. Taylor, we need to go.
Right now.

571
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,076
I'm going to find out
what you're hiding,

572
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,536
and when I do, God help you.

573
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,379
- Tanner.
- I'm out.

574
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,793
<i>Copy that. Emerson spoke
to his man inside the Bureau.</i>

575
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,743
- He says you're clear.
- Good.

576
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,835
Look, I need to prep on the next job
so why don't you tell me what we need.

577
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,094
I'll give you the specs
when I get there.

578
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,926
- Where are you?
- I'm just pulling in right now.

579
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:15,344
We'll be standing by.

580
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,645
When Tanner gets here,
we'll take off.

581
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,462
Why don't you start the deletion
program while we pack up?

582
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,894
Damn it. We can't go any farther.
He'll make us. Hold on.

583
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:06,920
Agent Walker, we need to go!

584
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,566
Here. You're going to need this.

585
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:13,604
Thank you.

586
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,574
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.

587
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:21,243
I can handle it.

588
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,336
Okay, let's go. Now.

589
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:02,618
Put the weapon down. Now!

590
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,124
Is Tony Almeida on the boat?

591
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,312
- Is Tony Almeida on the boat?
- I don't know.

592
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:17,456
It doesn't matter.
Almeida's not the priority.

593
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,703
The device is.
We have to go in now.

594
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,592
Surveillance camera went out.

595
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,090
Go check it out.

596
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:28,620
Cover me.

597
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:30,869
Damn it!

598
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:26,601
Stop!

599
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:38,375
Damn it.

600
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,861
The device is gone.
The locator files have been deleted.

601
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,448
Where is it?!

602
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,499
Okay.

603
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,671
What happened to you?

604
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:42,463
What the hell happened to you?
