3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,265
You want me to blow up
a couple of dozen FBI agents?

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,737
You got a problem with that?

5
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,562
Agent Walker, it's Jack. Get your men
out of the building. It's a trap.

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,198
You got the canister?

7
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:30,616
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

8
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:33,783
I want him taken to the FBI
for interrogation.

9
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,034
He's a sociopath, Mom.
He's not going to talk.

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,788
He'll want to make some kind of deal
in exchange for his cooperation.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,915
- Mom, you're not considering that.
- Olivia...

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,084
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

13
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:45,651
I've upset the cart, have I?

14
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:50,561
That bioweapon that you developed for us
was not intended for personal use.

15
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,303
There's no reason for your family
to pay for your mistakes.

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,807
This will induce a cardiac arrest
and leave no trace in your system.

17
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:07,024
We are rerouting
to West Arlington Hospital.

18
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,238
Have you heard from Almeida?

19
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,989
- I called him before I met with Hodges.
- Has he secured the canister?

20
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,324
<i>- Soon.</i>
- Your guy better not screw this up.

21
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,493
I have faith he'll come through.

22
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,640
Why don't you go back to FBI Medical
and let them treat you?

23
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:25,042
There is no treatment.
There is no cure.

24
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,879
Almost like they knew.

25
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,085
They'd have need time
to wire here with explosives.

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,788
This is the last sector
we were due to search. What?

27
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,803
- What is your involvement?
- You're not thinking straight.

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,847
The toxin's starting
to affect your judgment.

29
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,807
- Put the gun down.
- Don't you move!

30
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,981
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.
I told you to stay out of it.

31
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,484
We get some help here?
This man's having a seizure.

32
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,107
You should
be feeling better already.

33
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:22,266
I'm giving you pendopamine.
It'll de-constrict your muscles.

34
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,803
Just hang in there.

35
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,132
Don't talk.
Your vocal cords are in spasm.

36
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,187
- What the hell happened?
- Almeida found him in full seizure.

37
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,995
- What about the medication pack?
- He wasn't carrying it.

38
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,970
- Stop.
- Mr. Bauer, please don't speak.

39
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,326
Tony? I don't understand.

40
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,578
He's... second man.

41
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,816
- Jack, what...
- Put out an APB.

42
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,647
- How do you know this?
- Do it!

43
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:50,702
All patrols and perimeter teams,
this is Alpha One.

44
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:54,260
<i>I'm issuing a priority APB on Almeida.
Approach with extreme caution.</i>

45
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,736
<i>He's colluding with Galvez
and should be considered hostile.</i>

46
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,638
<i>All units who engage the suspect
should do so with extreme caution.</i>

47
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:25,281
Okay, you really need to give yourself
more time to recover.

48
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,415
Here's another med pack.
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

49
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:31,052
I need to go tend
to the other wounded.

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,297
Tell me what the hell is going on.

51
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,387
Tony was working
with Galvez all along.

52
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:46,081
He used us, all of us,
so that he could get to the canister.

53
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,156
So, wait, what are you saying,
that...

54
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,856
Tony killed Larry?

55
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,664
They must have ambushed him
as the chopper was setting down.

56
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,546
Tony stayed behind
so he could monitor our search,

57
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:04,460
set the trap and make sure Galvez
could get beyond the perimeter.

58
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,316
- Oh, God.
- I'm so sorry.

59
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,525
This is my fault.

60
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:14,128
I vouched for him to you,
to the president.

61
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,593
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

62
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:24,368
I felt that something was wrong.
Things weren't adding up. I just...

63
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,184
I just wanted to believe.

64
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:32,229
<i>- Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.</i>
- Alpha One. Go ahead.

65
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:34,899
Agent Walker,
I'm at checkpoint Delta.

66
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,152
I've got two agents dead, shot
point-blank. Their vehicle is missing.

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,904
He's made it past the perimeter.

68
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,531
Tracking on the vehicle has been
disabled. Position is unknown.

69
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,581
Widen the perimeter,
keep looking for Almeida.

70
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,368
If we lose him,
we lose the canister.

71
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,914
You're not gonna find him,
he's gone.

72
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,791
We need to phone the president.
Let's go.

73
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:35,529
You made it.

74
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,962
You sound surprised.

75
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,376
After Bauer called you out,
I wasn't sure you would.

76
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,135
You don't have to worry
about Jack Bauer.

77
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,229
He's not gonna be a problem.

78
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:51,475
So, where is the canister?

79
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:53,769
Where's the money?

80
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,817
Hey, that was our agreement.
Money first.

81
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,162
There you go.

82
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,121
It's all there,
wired into your account.

83
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,480
You can check it if you want.

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I want.

85
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:27,636
Everything okay?

86
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,723
So, where is the canister?

87
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:36,768
Right here.

88
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,416
So, what are you planning
on doing with it?

89
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,533
Not really your business, is it?

90
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,493
You gonna sell it?

91
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:05,132
- You don't want to do this.
- Hey, now who's the damn buyer?

92
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,631
Where's the canister?

93
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,799
Where is the damn canister?

94
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,888
One of the marines
that was guarding Hodges

95
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,865
noticed he was trying
to swallow something.

96
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,522
He got him to the hospital before
the poison could be completely ingested.

97
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:40,834
So, he'll survive?

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,088
Yes, ma'am, but the doctors
are surprised he pulled through.

99
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,496
That's because they never met
the son of a bitch.

100
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,050
How did Hodges get this poison?

101
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,928
We suspect from a woman
who claimed to be his attorney.

102
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:53,305
- Claimed to be?
- She was an impostor.

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,558
DC Police found the body of Hodges'
real attorney about five minutes ago.

104
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,742
We're still trying to determine
how she managed to breach security.

105
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>Madam President,
Agent Walker and Jack Bauer.</i>

106
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,249
- Put them through.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

107
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,814
This is President Taylor.
I'm here with Tim Woods.

108
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,364
<i>- Madam President...</i>
- Have you secured the canister?

109
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:13,575
I'm afraid not, ma'am. Our suspect
escaped beyond the perimeter.

110
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:17,246
I was told that the area
was locked down. What happened?

111
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,499
He had help, Madam President.
From Tony Almeida.

112
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,419
- Almeida?
- Yes, ma'am.

113
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:26,646
- He was working for us.
- It only appeared that way.

114
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,800
Apparently, he pursued his own agenda,
trying to get his hands on the canister.

115
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,280
Madam President,
I know I vouched for him.

116
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,972
All I can tell you right now
is that I was wrong and I'm sorry.

117
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,491
Now that we know he has the canister,
do we know what he intends to do?

118
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,269
- No, not yet.
- Or where he is?

119
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,021
We're all hands on deck here, sir,
regrouping to develop leads.

120
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,691
I may have one.

121
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:48,104
As Hodges was taken into custody,

122
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:52,156
he yelled at me about some larger group
that would continue on after his arrest.

123
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,253
Something
that I wouldn't be able to stop.

124
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,828
- What do you think he meant?
- Well, all I know for sure

125
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,075
is that someone
doesn't want Hodges to talk.

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,498
Shortly after he was arrested,
Hodges was visited

127
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,542
by a woman impersonating his lawyer.

128
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,687
She apparently gave him
some kind of lethal drug,

129
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,372
because ten minutes later,
he tried to commit suicide.

130
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,216
- Tried to commit suicide?
- Oh, he's still alive.

131
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,844
Jonas Hodge
was completely unrepentant.

132
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,722
Now, this suicide attempt
must have been coerced.

133
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,364
They're holding something over him,
most likely his family.

134
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,435
If that's the case,
we need to talk to him.

135
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,146
Jack, even after everything
that's happened today,

136
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,767
I will not allow any kind
of coercive interrogation.

137
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:30,228
Madam President,
that won't be necessary. He'll talk.

138
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:33,113
- How can you be sure?
- We can offer him something he needs.

139
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:35,408
- And what's that?
- Proof of death.

140
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,201
Convince the people that wanted him dead
that they succeeded.

141
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,078
The only way to protect his family.

142
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,801
Madam President, right now,
he's the only lead we've got.

143
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,480
I'll assume that was necessary.

144
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:07,105
Don't start with me.
I'm not in the mood.

145
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,477
All right.

146
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:13,357
Mr. Galvez decided
to hide the canister from me,

147
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,635
so, I had to find out where it was.

148
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,839
We've got a delivery to make.

149
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:24,665
- Shall we go?
- No, I don't think we should.

150
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:28,935
- They're expecting us.
- Yeah, well, the way I see it,

151
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,373
they're gonna take this canister
that I sweated blood for

152
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,092
and sit on it for six months.

153
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,681
Not sit on it. They're gonna use it
to make more pathogen.

154
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,055
We had 27 canisters.
Now we have one.

155
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,640
I say one's enough.

156
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:44,444
Look,

157
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,971
the government's reeling.

158
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:51,858
The FBI is stretched thin,
scrambling, making mistakes.

159
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,821
Another attack today is all we need
to push this thing right over the edge.

160
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,615
This is no time to pull back.

161
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,413
I say we take that canister,
and finish the job off today.

162
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,877
I don't disagree with you

163
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,046
but it's not our decision to make.

164
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,634
Fine.
Then run it by your group

165
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,437
or your gang
or whatever the hell they are.

166
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,055
But they'll know one thing.

167
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,435
Finish your enemy off when he's down.
Don't let him get back up and reload.

168
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,107
I guarantee you,

169
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:31,732
this thing's gonna be a lot harder
to pull off six months from now.

170
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,302
And you can say what you want
about Jonas Hodges,

171
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:38,822
the fact is, he gave us
an opportunity today.

172
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,741
Let's take it.

173
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:50,792
I'll contact the group.

174
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:52,847
Good.

175
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:11,788
What did she say exactly?

176
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:14,383
Only that she needs to see you
and that it's urgent.

177
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:16,712
I heard rumors
about the FBI operation.

178
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,338
I'm sure your mother
will fill you in, ma'am.

179
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,245
Is it true
the FBI perimeter was breached?

180
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,663
I'm afraid so.
The canister is now outside the cordon.

181
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,416
- What are we doing to get it back?
- Tim, would you excuse us for a moment?

182
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:32,959
Of course.

183
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,369
What is it?

184
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,836
I need you to call
the Attorney General

185
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:47,849
and draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

186
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,217
Witness protection?

187
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:51,978
You can't be serious.

188
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,720
Less than an hour ago,
Hodges tried to kill himself.

189
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,938
And we all believe
that he must've been coerced.

190
00:12:59,063 --> 00:12:59,861
By whom?

191
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,856
You remember his rant...

192
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,328
that he is a cog
in a larger conspiracy,

193
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,417
that there are others
who will carry on.

194
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,493
You think they're the ones
who took the canister?

195
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:12,290
We need to find out. Which is why
we need to get Hodges to talk.

196
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,638
Olivia, we feel confident that he will
if we can assure him

197
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,465
that these people will believe
his suicide attempt actually succeed.

198
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,968
We need to make him disappear.

199
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,303
Which is why
I need the protection agreement.

200
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,180
There is no other way he'll talk.

201
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:30,142
Designate him an enemy combatant,
then treat him like one.

202
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,005
We don't do that.
Not in this administration.

203
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,064
And it's not as
if he's getting a free pass.

204
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,066
He'll always be
under federal supervision.

205
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,002
On a hundred acre ranch in Colorado!

206
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,844
This man murdered your son!

207
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,372
My brother.

208
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,949
Not to mention
hundreds of innocent civilians.

209
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,043
I don't need you
to tell me what he's done.

210
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,671
- Apparently you do.
- Olivia, stop it!

211
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,289
What would Dad say?

212
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,394
- I bet you're afraid to ask.
- I said stop!

213
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:10,378
Do you think
that this is easy for me?

214
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,561
You think it doesn't tear me apart?

215
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,269
I'm Roger's mother.

216
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:26,575
But I am also
the President of the United States

217
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,284
and I placed my hand on a Bible

218
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,006
and swore to protect and defend
the Constitution.

219
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,658
You are my Chief of Staff.

220
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,633
I need you to act like one.

221
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,381
Now, Jonas Hodges is at the FBI,
and Jack Bauer will be there shortly.

222
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,341
I need an agreement drafted.

223
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,807
Do that please.

224
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:54,862
The plan is straightforward...

225
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,217
an attack today this morning
during rush hour

226
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,714
using the bioweapon that Tony Almeida
retrieved from Starkwood.

227
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,107
You should have each received a data
pack when you logged on to this call.

228
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:05,682
<i>Please open it now.</i>

229
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,198
<i>The attack will be attributed
to this man,</i>

230
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,185
Jibraan Al-Zarian...

231
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,410
whose body
will be left at the scene.

232
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,747
The evidence trail implicating him
will include fabricated e-mails,

233
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,880
phone records,

234
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,084
and a large wire transfer
to his account

235
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,080
<i>via our favorite Yemini bank.</i>

236
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:22,901
I'm looking
at the briefing materials

237
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:26,543
<i>and I'm not seeing how this man is
actually connected to a terrorist group.</i>

238
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:27,668
He isn't.

239
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,052
As previously discussed,

240
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,222
there are considerable tactical
advantages to using an innocent.

241
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,934
- But what about his unpredictability?
- Al-Zarian has no agenda of his own.

242
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,358
<i>He'll in fact be easier to control
and manipulate than a real terrorist.</i>

243
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,733
So what are the casualty estimates?

244
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:47,279
Page 3 describes the casualties
estimates as well as secondary effects.

245
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,609
<i>- As you can see, we've listed...</i>
- Hold on.

246
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,741
<i>Forget about what casualties
may or may not be.</i>

247
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,638
<i>We're talking about launching
a new operation in the next few hours.</i>

248
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:58,456
<i>Without any planning.
And with only one canister.</i>

249
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>The plan for this operation
was already in place.</i>

250
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,794
We just accelerate.

251
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,710
We were going to have
6 months to prepare.

252
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:06,798
There's no way
to pull it together in a few hours.

253
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,416
I believe there is.

254
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,427
With the support of this group.

255
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,388
<i>Support for whom?
This Tony Almeida we barely know?</i>

256
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,656
<i>And what about postattack plans?</i>

257
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,483
<i>How's this group going to end up
where we need to be?</i>

258
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,520
<i>I agree.
How we handle ourselves politically</i>

259
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,877
<i>in the aftermath of this event is just
as important as the attack itself.</i>

260
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,143
<i>It always has been.</i>

261
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,820
<i>In your opinion, is there time then</i>

262
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,510
<i>to achieve all our objectives
in the current scenario?</i>

263
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:34,200
<i>- Not with the same level of certainty.</i>
<i>- Or anonymity.</i>

264
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,410
<i>That's right.</i>

265
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,328
<i>Maybe it's definitive.</i>

266
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,367
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
<i>- There's no downside to waiting.</i>

267
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,392
<i>There's a huge downside
to going in unprepared.</i>

268
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,095
<i>Things go wrong,</i>

269
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,488
<i>we're looking at exposure...</i>

270
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:50,072
<i>- for all of us.
- No, I still don't see it that way.</i>

271
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:51,197
Gentlemen.

272
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,243
Ladies.

273
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:57,385
I've listened to your comments

274
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,899
and there's wisdom
in what I've heard.

275
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:03,521
<i>But there's also wisdom
in something I haven't heard.</i>

276
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:07,795
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,
and the group is well rid of him.

277
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,560
But, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

278
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:13,867
<i>He did half our job for us.</i>

279
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:15,836
More than half.

280
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,620
He pushed this country to the brink.

281
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,416
You don't get many gifts like that.

282
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,784
I say we take it.

283
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:31,341
We have a quorum,
I'd like to call for an immediate vote.

284
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:52,570
How'd it go?

285
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:54,614
Take a look.

286
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:03,288
We're a go.

287
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,707
- Where's Hodges?
- Down the hall.

288
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:36,230
We've set up a medical suite
in Secure Z.

289
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:38,535
- And the death certificate?
- Done.

290
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,130
As far as the world knows,
he's molding on a slab at the coroner's.

291
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:42,704
Keep it that way.

292
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,066
No one knows he's alive
unless they have to.

293
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,542
Just the ambulance driver,
the medical team and 3 security.

294
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,855
All trustworthy.

295
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,753
Wait.

296
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,338
Are you sure he's up for this?
I know what happened.

297
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,915
- Medication worked.
- I'm not talking about the seizure.

298
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,644
I'm talking
about the Tony Almeida situation.

299
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,969
What about it?

300
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:02,111
His former partner betrays him,
he tries to have you all killed...

301
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:04,309
Jack must have some feelings
about that.

302
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:08,413
Yeah, I think
it's what's keeping him going.

303
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,606
<i>Listen to me.</i>

304
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,653
<i>Is anyone listening?</i>

305
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,796
<i>I know you're watching.
I see the cameras!</i>

306
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:22,287
<i>Do you realize
what you people have done?</i>

307
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,012
<i>You didn't save me,
you killed my family!</i>

308
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,828
You killed them!

309
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,834
- How long has he been conscious?
- 10 min.

310
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,464
He's been talking about his family
ever since.

311
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,045
Biometrics are over here. Cardiac,
respiratory, plus dermal infrared.

312
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,220
Good. We'll know if he's lying.

313
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:42,347
The president is monitoring this.

314
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,849
<i>Sergeant, I'm asking you,</i>

315
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,018
soldier to soldier,
let me have your firearm.

316
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:50,188
I'll use one bullet on myself.

317
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,607
- Please.
- Relax, Mr. Hodges.

318
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,151
You're already dead.

319
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,281
Sergeant.

320
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:03,743
Who are you?

321
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,829
My name is Jack Bauer.

322
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:10,099
Right now, I'm the only chance your wife
and children have to stay alive.

323
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,252
Explain that to me.

324
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,993
The people that wanted you dead
don't know you survived.

325
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:17,507
Tell us who they are,
and we'll keep it that way.

326
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,759
<i>The President has agreed to provide you
a death certificate and protection</i>

327
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:23,384
<i>in exchange
for actionable information.</i>

328
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,418
I can't watch this anymore.

329
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:27,455
<i>If you refuse,
it'll be released to the press</i>

330
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,186
<i>that you are alive and in our custody
and that you're cooperating.</i>

331
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,313
We'll let your friends
take care of the rest.

332
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,205
My family is innocent.

333
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,470
The president would never allow that
to happen.

334
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,843
<i>She doesn't have the stomach for it.</i>

335
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,968
<i>You might be right about that.</i>

336
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,868
<i>But make no mistake about it, sir.</i>

337
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,693
I do.

338
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,141
Trust me.

339
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,833
Do your family a favor.

340
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,766
Just tell me
who you've been working with.

341
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:01,443
I am...

342
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,219
I was...

343
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,140
part of a larger group
of like minds.

344
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,533
You mean,
other companies like Starkwood.

345
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:12,594
People who can protect this country
better than any government ever could.

346
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,269
<i>There are hundreds of private
military companies in this country,</i>

347
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,344
we're talking
tens of thousands of people.

348
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:18,776
But only a handful

349
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,904
with the guts and the vision
to do what was necessary.

350
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,072
And what is that?

351
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,844
The plan was to launch
simultaneous attacks early next year.

352
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:27,952
Multiple cities.

353
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,955
So the public would finally see
that the government can't protect them.

354
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,374
They'd demand drastic measures
and we'd step in.

355
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,635
How would you justify that
to the American people?

356
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,543
Simple.

357
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,947
Offload the blame.

358
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:40,522
We were gonna supply the enemies
that want to destroy this country.

359
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,218
Muhammed this, Achmed that.

360
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,456
From sleeper cells
the apologists say don't even exist.

361
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,793
<i>You of all people should understand.</i>

362
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,088
<i>Understand what?</i>

363
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,351
<i>I watched the Senate hearing
yesterday,</i>

364
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,354
and I was disgusted
with how you were treated.

365
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,506
You should be regarded as a hero,

366
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:58,604
not a criminal.

367
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,142
I broke the law.

368
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:06,836
You were following your instinct
to protect your country, just like me.

369
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,911
Mr. Hodges, I need the names
of the people that you are working with.

370
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:13,272
I have spent my entire life
protecting this country

371
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,874
from enemies large and small.

372
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,918
I created Starkwood
from the ground up.

373
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,952
And the government used us
to great effect.

374
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:20,950
And now they think
they can just throw us away.

375
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:22,131
Are you telling me

376
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:24,675
that this has been about
protecting your contracts, about money?

377
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,473
<i>I tried to tell the politicians</i>

378
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:29,264
<i>how vulnerable we are,
they wouldn't listen.</i>

379
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,890
<i>- So we decided to show them.
- By attacking your own country</i>

380
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,555
<i>with a biological weapon?</i>

381
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,236
By killing innocent people?

382
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:37,272
Yes, a few innocent lives...

383
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,233
would be lost, but only
to save the greater number.

384
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,194
Having the courage to make those hard
choices gives us a lot in common.

385
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:45,445
Let me explain something to you.

386
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,720
You and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

387
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:51,394
All that you have done today
is create a scenario

388
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,414
by attacking your own country
that has made you valuable again.

389
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,542
Today has been nothing short
of a desperate grab for power,

390
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,829
and it has failed.
You have failed,

391
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:02,630
and unless you want me to go public
with the fact that you are still alive,

392
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,425
you are gonna give me the names
of the people that you're working with.

393
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,427
- I don't have them.
- I want the names.

394
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,702
- I want the names!
- I don't know any!

395
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,530
Fine.

396
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:25,611
Patch me through to Amy Meyer
at the Washington Post.

397
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,501
Amy, it's Jack.
I have a statement I need to make.

398
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:31,626
Wait!

399
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,161
Give me the names!

400
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,124
I swear I don't have them.

401
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,452
This whole project
was based on anonymity.

402
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:40,835
We never met in person.
Everything was handled through a woman.

403
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,249
She never told me who she was.
She never told me her name.

404
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:46,174
- I never asked her.
- The woman that gave you the poison?

405
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,564
Amy, I'm sorry. Something's come up.
I've got to call you back.

406
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:05,776
You tell yourself whatever you want.

407
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,528
You are a traitor.

408
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:10,404
Witness Protection was your promise.

409
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,372
Madam President, did you hear
everything that Hodges had to say?

410
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:20,708
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

411
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:23,920
All of it is. Biometric monitors here
indicate that he was telling the truth.

412
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,548
Whoever they are, this group went
through an awful lot of trouble

413
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,394
to get their hands
on that last canister.

414
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,913
It seems very clear to me
that their plan is still on.

415
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,887
- You mean another attack?
- Yes, ma'am.

416
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,451
You should proceed under the assumption
that they might strike immediately.

417
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,358
Hold on.
Hodges said some time next year.

418
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:40,743
No. Hodges said that was the plan.

419
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,688
Given the chaos
that he created today,

420
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,075
the smart strategic move
would be to act right now.

421
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,018
I believe the canister
is still in this area,

422
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:49,904
so we'll have to alert Homeland, have
them identifying and raiding targets.

423
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:52,715
Hodges said that the plan was
to enlist parties with terrorist ties.

424
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,807
I think that might be
our most solid lead.

425
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:56,702
Madam President, I agree with her.

426
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,873
We need to make a threat assessment
with all known terrorist activity.

427
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,834
The fastest way
to get that information

428
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,799
is to gain access to the CTU servers

429
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:08,383
that have been sealed as a result
of Senator Mayer's investigation.

430
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,384
I'll have them
recommissioned immediately.

431
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,132
And consider the resources
of this government at your disposal.

432
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:17,693
Thank you.

433
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:21,181
- I need those servers right away.
- They're in DOJ evidence lockers.

434
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:23,526
- I'll have I.T. break them out.
- OK, good.

435
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:27,274
We have a shift of analysts coming in.
Tell them what you're looking for.

436
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,875
We don't have time. We need someone
who already knows the protocols.

437
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,347
I'll take care of it.
Just get me those servers.

438
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:52,889
- Who is it?
<i>- Hey, it's me Jack.</i>

439
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,033
Jack, where are you?

440
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:57,555
The FBI headquarters.

441
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,650
I've been trying to reach you all night.
No one will tell me anything.

442
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:02,375
Is it true about Bill?

443
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:06,606
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

444
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:15,198
What happened?

445
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,866
He was killed
during the White House siege.

446
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,685
Chloe, you should know,

447
00:26:20,261 --> 00:26:22,788
Bill sacrificed his life
to save the president.

448
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,875
<i>This threat is not over.</i>

449
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,538
We believe that there's gonna be
a biological attack

450
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,445
somewhere in the area.
Soon.

451
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,174
- <i>I need your help to stop it.</i>
- How?

452
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,717
I need you to reconstitute
the CTU servers.

453
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,943
They were seized
when the CTU was decommissioned.

454
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,973
- I don't have access to them.
- You will by the time you get here.

455
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,517
Who's doing this?

456
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,500
We don't have all the players.

457
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:48,731
I'll fill you in with as much
as I know when you get here.

458
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,221
<i>I'm sending a car over
to your hotel.</i>

459
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,610
Send a car.

460
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:04,493
Thank you.

461
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,816
- Morris, wake up.
- What?

462
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,118
- Are you speaking to me again now?
- I have to go.

463
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,615
I need you to take Prescott
and get out of the city.

464
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,330
- Why?
- I just spoke with Jack.

465
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,833
There's going to be another attack.
This time, it's biological.

466
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,252
OK, then we'll all get out
of here together.

467
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,090
I can't. FBI needs me.

468
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,612
But the last time
you worked for these people,

469
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,843
- they arrested you.
- I know.

470
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,705
But I'm the only one that can get
the servers back online.

471
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:04,184
Well, I'm not gonna leave you here.

472
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,703
Not with the possibility
of a biological attack.

473
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:15,869
Please.

474
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,789
I'm the only one that can do this.

475
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,045
And Jack needs me.

476
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,276
And I just need for you
and Prescott to be safe.

477
00:28:26,794 --> 00:28:28,205
I'll see you back at home.

478
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:30,467
Just...

479
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:31,978
be careful.

480
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,325
I will.

481
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:15,723
All right, before we begin,
everyone make sure

482
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:19,351
you have your updated briefing packets,
and the latest CDC abstract.

483
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,102
- Jack, whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.

484
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:27,973
I know many of you have lost friends
and colleagues today.

485
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:30,646
I have, too.

486
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,851
Unfortunately, the time to mourn these
brave people is going to have to wait.

487
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:36,678
'Cause, as many of you
are already aware,

488
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:39,819
we are facing the threat of a terrorist
event somewhere on the Eastern seaboard.

489
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,613
We don't have specific intel
as to the time table of this attack,

490
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,198
but we have reason to believe
that the people that are behind this

491
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:47,621
- will want to strike immediately.
- Excuse me.

492
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,578
Tim Moran, field ops.

493
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:51,288
Who are the people behind this?

494
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,044
Right now, we only have
two confirmed suspects.

495
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,477
Tony Almeida

496
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:59,338
and the woman he's been working with.
We're trying to identify her.

497
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,091
The assumption is, the two of them
are part of a broader conspiracy

498
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,008
as outlined
in your briefing material.

499
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,178
And the nature of the attack?
All it says here is biological.

500
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,127
The actual pathogen
is a prion variant,

501
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:12,059
designed to attack the central nervous
system and ultimately destroy it.

502
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,411
- Do we know what the target is?
- No, not yet.

503
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,106
We're also unclear on the specifics
of the delivery device.

504
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,461
- What leads do we have?
- Right now,

505
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,569
we are solely
working off an operational theory

506
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,613
that the people that are behind this
will need to manufacture evidence

507
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,227
in an effort to offload the blame
for this attack to another group

508
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:29,243
or an individual
with terrorist sympathies.

509
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,705
During the ensuing panic, these people
will move in and seize power

510
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,666
under the guise of creating
and maintaing stability.

511
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,754
So, our job here is to look for traces
of that manufactured evidence.

512
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,783
How exactly?

513
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,579
Pattern searches of suspicious
financial transactions.

514
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:46,833
Keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps,
websites and e-mails.

515
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:50,386
And data-ming all NSA and CIA
intelligence on jihadist activities

516
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,391
- over the past six months.
- Excuse me.

517
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,811
Not only is that type
of blanket surveillance illegal.

518
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,787
We don't have the capacity
to pull it off.

519
00:30:57,912 --> 00:30:59,614
The search algorithms
simply don't exist.

520
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,276
Yes, they do. At CTU.

521
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,885
Those servers were decommissioned.

522
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,654
Not anymore. They're here. We're in
the process of installing them now.

523
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,617
What does that make us, CTU-lite?

524
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,871
Last I heard,
the Bureau was a federal entity

525
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,497
bound by federal statute.

526
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,674
Do this or I'll find
someone else who will.

527
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,251
- I don't have time to argue.
- I'm not arguing. I'm asking.

528
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,427
Moving on.

529
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,182
I've got her from here. Thanks.

530
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,180
- Thanks for coming.
- You look like hell. Are you all right?

531
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:38,931
- I'm fine.
- You don't look fine.

532
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:41,303
Maybe a little tired.
Did you get the report I sent you?

533
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,867
I read it on the way over.

534
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:45,742
- It's terrifying. How real is this?
- Real.

535
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,897
We get access
to the CTU servers, right?

536
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:51,304
- They're coming online now.
- Shouldn't I be supervising this?

537
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,828
There's something I need to talk
to you about before we get started.

538
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,193
There's no easy way
for me to say this.

539
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:00,501
But Tony's been responsible
for these attacks.

540
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,195
- That's not possible.
- He was using you and Bill all along.

541
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,676
He's been working for
a group of private military firms

542
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,130
trying to destabilize this country
in an effort to seize power.

543
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,386
So far today, his actions have cost
the lives of hundreds of people.

544
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,434
But he's threatening thousands more.

545
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:19,951
It doesn't make any sense.

546
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,189
He was devastated over Michelle...

547
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,829
Chloe, he's not your friend.

548
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:27,319
The Tony that you knew,
he doesn't exist anymore.

549
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:30,364
- There has to be a reason.
- A reason for what?

550
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,458
Bringing down two passenger planes?

551
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,833
Trying to ambush 25 federal agents?

552
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,289
He tried to kill me.

553
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,961
He betrayed us all, you, me,

554
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,129
and Bill,

555
00:32:45,678 --> 00:32:47,339
and right now our responsibility

556
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,012
is to stop him.

557
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,116
I need to know that you can treat him
as an enemy combatant,

558
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:53,596
that you are with me on this.

559
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:56,765
I'll do whatever you say.

560
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,728
I need to know that you,

561
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:01,645
are with me on this.

562
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:07,708
I'm with you.

563
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,709
Let's go.

564
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:25,461
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

565
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,142
27 years old.

566
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:30,211
He's a day laborer at
Cabrera Granite Construction.

567
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,426
- Immigration status?
- Illegal.

568
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,644
His visa expired as of January.

569
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:36,525
Ties to any extremist groups?

570
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,308
No, none, but there's definitely
anger there.

571
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,491
Both parents were killed in a U.S.
air strike by the Pakistani border.

572
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:44,188
He was eleven at the time.

573
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:46,689
Fits the psych profile.

574
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,641
Bit of a loner,
a mystery to his co-workers,

575
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:51,320
and we build the rest.

576
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,113
And the family?

577
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:56,579
One younger brother, who he's pretty
much raised on his own.

578
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,429
It's perfect.

579
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,539
<i>Though it is doubtful
that anyone sleeps very well in D.C.</i>

580
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,445
<i>tonight a certain calm has now settled
over the streets of Capitol Hill</i>

581
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,616
<i>after an unprecedented series
of terror attacks left people</i>

582
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,758
<i>all over the country shaken
and demanding answers.</i>

583
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:15,270
<i>In her speech,
President Taylor went a long way...</i>

584
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,449
Morning.

585
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:19,674
Pour yourself some orange juice.

586
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:23,518
I'm not really very hungry.

587
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,043
Sit down,
eat some breakfast for once.

588
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,398
It's unhealthy not to.

589
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:29,331
What are you doing up anyway?

590
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,834
I couldn't sleep.

591
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:37,584
Listen, I want you to come home
straight after work today.

592
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:40,245
No dillydallying.

593
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,620
Why?

594
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:43,645
Just in case.

595
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,498
In case of what?

596
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,664
These attacks, this terrorism,

597
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,503
it's all over the news.

598
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:53,644
It's not a good day to be a Muslim.

599
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:56,093
Muslims had nothing to do with it.

600
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,970
Doesn't matter.

601
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,347
Nobody cares, believe me.

602
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,475
Most of the guys at my work think
I'm Puerto Rican anyway.

603
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,600
It's about time.

604
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,928
Come in.

605
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,027
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

606
00:35:42,152 --> 00:35:43,208
What is it?

607
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,893
The attorney general asked me
to check in with you.

608
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,947
He is waiting to sign off
on a document

609
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:49,980
I was told you were reviewing.

610
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:53,837
Anyone happen to mention to you
what this document is about?

611
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,901
No, I imagine they wouldn't.

612
00:35:57,715 --> 00:35:58,696
It's a secret,

613
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:00,578
highly classified.

614
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,263
Not that I give a damn.

615
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,297
It's a get-out-of-jail-free card
for Jonas Hodges,

616
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:11,095
the bastard responsible
for my brother's death,

617
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,962
and so many others.

618
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:16,325
I don't understand, ma'am.

619
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:19,259
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital.

620
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:22,187
I wish that were the case, but no,

621
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:26,183
and once the A.G. signs
this witness protection agreement,

622
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,365
Hodges is going to live out his days

623
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,775
in comfort and anonymity

624
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:35,024
while my brother lies in his grave
in Arlington Cemetery.

625
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,655
Does that sound like justice to you?

626
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:42,607
No, ma'am, it does not.

627
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:47,537
And yet my mother saw fit to reward
this monster for his cooperation.

628
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:51,717
I'm sure it was a difficult decision
for the president to make.

629
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,043
Not difficult enough.

630
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,461
My mother may be able to live with it,
but I'm not sure I can.

631
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,928
I have seen the guilty walk free

632
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:04,470
many times.

633
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:06,866
I understand
your anger and frustration,

634
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,111
and I am genuinely sorry.

635
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,999
Tell the A.G.
I've reviewed the agreement

636
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:20,786
and we can move ahead.

637
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:22,579
Thank you, ma'am.

638
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:28,519
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

639
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:31,114
Other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.

640
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,243
I'm sorry, Aaron.

641
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:41,519
I didn't mean that.

642
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,093
I was just venting.

643
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,341
- Hello?
<i>- Martin?</i>

644
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,551
It's Olivia Taylor. Did I wake you?

645
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:28,013
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
What time is it?

646
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,431
Almost 4:00.

647
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,443
Actually I didn't expect
to catch you at home.

648
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:34,582
I thought you were in Florida doing
opposition for the Gainor campaign.

649
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:36,672
No, that didn't really work out.

650
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,857
Why not?

651
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,757
Let's just say
my methods were a little hardball

652
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:43,619
for the governor's taste.

653
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,826
What can I do for you, Olivia?

654
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:52,287
You heard about the attack?

655
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,500
Yeah, I watched your mother's address
to the nation. Really impressive.

656
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,234
She continues to surprise,
doesn't she?

657
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:00,834
Listen, I need your help.

658
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,878
- Can we meet?
- Now?

659
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,253
What's this about, Olivia?

660
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,233
I can't talk about
it over the phone.

661
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:11,807
It's the middle of the night, you know?
You got to do better than that.

662
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,540
We were in a dive
hotel bar in Atlanta,

663
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:20,732
right after we picked Hayworth
to be the running mate on the ticket.

664
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,861
There was an issue regarding his abuse
of a certain prescription drug,

665
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,365
and a local reporter who couldn't
be persuaded to shut up about it.

666
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,217
I remember,

667
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:32,513
you turned to me and said

668
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,957
there was no problem
that couldn't be handled or eliminated.

669
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,504
I was drunk.

670
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,946
You were serious.

671
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:48,802
You're right. We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

672
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,499
How soon can you be
at the White House?

673
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,806
How's 15 minutes sound?

674
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:54,162
Good.

675
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,567
- You done with that?
- I'm not familiar with these commands.

676
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:06,945
You don't want to boot
the subnet with server 2.

677
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,005
It has a faulty bus that we weren't able
to fix before you guys impounded it.

678
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,800
Maybe you'd like to take over.

679
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,760
Only if you want it to work right.

680
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:17,511
I don't like this either.

681
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:19,124
- Is there a problem?
- There is.

682
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,925
I'm not comfortable doing this.
I agreed to it, but I don't like it.

683
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,755
What exactly aren't you
comfortable with?

684
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,590
The Bill of Rights being violated,
for one,

685
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:30,096
so if you're gonna be doing
anything grossly illegal, please...

686
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,596
We'll make sure we notify you
so you can leave the building.

687
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,212
Hello, Big Brother.

688
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:53,075
If you think your need to complain
is more important than the lives

689
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,410
of the people who count on us,
go whine somewhere else!

690
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,371
- Jack, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

691
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,456
President David Palmer
recommissioned these servers

692
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,709
because he felt it was vital
to national security.

693
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:04,938
President Palmer made the call.

694
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,671
Is that gonna be
good enough for you?

695
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,174
- Answer me!
- Yes.

696
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:35,700
There's something wrong.

697
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,784
He said President Palmer.

698
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,037
He meant Taylor.

699
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,123
He said it twice.

700
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,787
What is this now?

701
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:12,158
Probably a fuse.

702
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:15,503
Here, you do what
you can to finish up.

703
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:18,718
I'm gonna go check the box.

704
00:42:47,658 --> 00:42:49,441
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

705
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,232
Who are you? What do you want?

706
00:42:51,357 --> 00:42:53,469
- Shut up!
- What did you do to my brother?

707
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:56,915
One more word,
I put a bullet in your brain.

708
00:42:57,093 --> 00:42:58,235
Understand?

709
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,951
- You understand?
- Yes!
