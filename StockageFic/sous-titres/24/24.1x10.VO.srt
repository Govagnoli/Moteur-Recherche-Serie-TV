1
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:18,249
There are terrorists planning
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,245
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,292
And the people that I work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,603
I'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,366
This is the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,290
Gun! Gun!

7
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:41,525
- Where's Palmer? Get him out.
- Somebody get Sherry.

8
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,604
Senator, we're clear.

9
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,002
I didn't do this.

10
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:52,653
The CTU agent who created the disturbance
at the power plant was named Jack Bauer.

11
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:57,409
Listen to me. I've been tracking
this assassin. I know what he looks like.

12
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:01,168
I can help bring him down, butyou gotta
let me get in touch with my people.

13
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:04,922
Where are you now?

14
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,447
Secret Service had me in custody,
but I got away.

15
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,642
No! Get away! No!

16
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:13,768
I won't fight you.

17
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:16,731
You and me and Dad
are gonna have our lives back.

18
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:20,847
Where did you get that?

19
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:23,529
- CTU. Myers.
- Nina, listen. It's Teri.

20
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,605
Teri, where are you?

21
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,922
- Their inside person is Jamey.
- No, that's not possible.

22
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:35,803
I'm not saying anything until
I get immunity, signed by Chapelle.

23
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:42,205
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Get her out of those!

24
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:45,330
We need medical help. Yes. We're in ITS.

25
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,125
- Hurry.
- Come on.

26
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,602
This is Dave Thompson.

27
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:05,491
It's 9 o'clock on primary day
in Southern California

28
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,007
and the freeways are looking pretty good.

29
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:12,564
Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass
southbound, but it loosens up at Culver.

30
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:15,963
We'll have a complete report
in six minutes. Back to you, Bill.

31
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:20,046
Thanks, Dave. In the news, we haven't
learned any more about the incident

32
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:24,570
at the San Clarita power plant where
Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning,

33
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,769
but we're told the senator was unharmed.

34
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:30,687
But Secret Service and the FBl
haven't released any new information.

35
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:33,765
- Get the drip.
- I'm on it.

36
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,367
Find me a pulse.

37
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,610
I've got a pulse. 140 over 30.

38
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,930
Pupils not reactive.

39
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:48,322
Respiration shallow. 48.

40
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,051
Let's start two large-bore IVs, bilateral.

41
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,532
She's lost a lot of blood.

42
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:02,243
- We should start the other line.
- All right.

43
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:05,964
Is it in?

44
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,723
Ready? One, two, three.

45
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,563
Ready?

46
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,564
Lift.

47
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:42,204
Excuse me.

48
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,647
I've got the door.

49
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:59,204
Everyone, I'm sorry to tell you Jamey Farrell
tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago.

50
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:01,409
Fortunately, she's still alive,

51
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:05,645
and they're doing everything they can
to keep her that way.

52
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:10,361
I know it won't be easy to put this out
of our minds, but we don't have a choice.

53
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,887
We still believe that Palmer's life is in danger,

54
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,771
which means we all have
to get back to work now.

55
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,406
- You wanna look at this?
- Not now. Call Jamey's mom.

56
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:25,530
Explain what happened.
Have her pick up Kyle.

57
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,281
- CTU, Myers.
- Hey, it's me. Hold on.

58
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,569
- OK.
- Didyou get the car?

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,042
Yes, and I got the care package too. Thanks.

60
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,851
- Jack, Teri called.
- What?

61
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,766
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Where is she? What did she say?

62
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:57,129
I don't know. She barely said her name
before she got disconnected.

63
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,248
What happened?

64
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,246
She didn't call back, and when I tried
to redial, the number was blocked.

65
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,769
- She sounded all right.
- The police have thrown a net over this area.

66
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,492
There's no way I can help Teri
until I get through it.

67
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,202
Maybe you should turn yourself in,
tell your side of the story.

68
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:16,172
No. Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive
as long as he thinks I can be useful to him.

69
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:18,767
In custody I won't be.
Scan the police frequencies.

70
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:22,323
- See ifyou can locate any ofthe roadblocks.
- All right.

71
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,084
Just a minute.

72
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,687
- OK.
- Jamey give you anything else?

73
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:32,126
Jack...

74
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,522
Jamey tried to kill herself.

75
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:38,371
Jack? Didyou hear me?

76
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:44,088
- Jack?
- Yeah. You said she tried?

77
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,370
We sent her to County,
but it doesn't look good.

78
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:51,571
- Are you sure it was a suicide attempt?
- Yeah. She slit her wrists.

79
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:55,246
- Where is her son Kyle?
- He didn't see anything.

80
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,643
We've already called Jamey's mom.
She's on her way to pick him up.

81
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,282
OK. Send someone down to County
to question Jamey in case she makes it.

82
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,570
- She's still our best source ofinformation.
- OK.

83
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,409
- Dammit.
- What? What's wrong?

84
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:15,372
They set up a roadblock at Montana.
Nina, I could have used a heads-up here.

85
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:19,571
I'm sorry. They must have set it up
before I started scanning.

86
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,892
- Find me another route.
- Give me a second to pull up LA traffic.

87
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,603
OK. You go to the window.
You let me know if somebody comes.

88
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,531
- Tony. Line three. Can you get it?
- Almeida.

89
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:53,682
OK. It looks like roadblocks
aren't your only problem.

90
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:58,412
They sent a description ofyou
to all the units in the area.

91
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,053
Nina. It's Teri Bauer.

92
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:04,407
Jack, hold on a minute.

93
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,765
- Teri.
- Nina. Thank God.

94
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,572
- Where are you?
- I don't know, but I got a hold of a phone.

95
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:13,087
OK. Is Kim with you? Are you all right?

96
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,733
I'm fine. Kimberly's fine.
You know where Jack is?

97
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,532
Listen, I'm gonna connect you
with him right now.

98
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:22,003
Leave the line open as long as you can
so we can do a trace. Understand?

99
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:25,085
- Yeah.
- Have Milo set up the trace on line three.

100
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,887
- Jack, I've got Teri.
- Patch her through.

101
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,164
Mom, someone's coming.

102
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:35,690
- He's here.
- Teri? Teri?

103
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,446
What do you want from us?

104
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,645
I think I left my phone in here.
Have you seen it?

105
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,803
No, I haven't.

106
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:52,009
Jack, I've muted our conversation.

107
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:55,324
- Have you set up a trace?
- Yeah. I told Teri to leave the line open.

108
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:58,689
Good. Keep our side muted.
I don't wanna give away this phone.

109
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,371
You better not be lyin', bitch.

110
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,569
Bitch.

111
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:44,250
They moved everything around in here!
Dammit! Rick, you seen it anywheres?

112
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,484
No. No.

113
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,204
Got anything on that trace?

114
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:04,332
Latitude is north of the 10. I should have
a rough longitude in a couple of minutes,

115
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:08,292
though triangulating
the longitude is gonna be trickier.

116
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,563
This is Dave Thompson.

117
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:16,363
We're seeing congestion in North Hollywood
around the Grant Street Elementary School.

118
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:19,047
Senator Palmer is due
to make an appearance there

119
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:24,161
and quite a few supporters and media are
hoping to catch a glimpse ofthe candidate

120
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:28,292
who is not letting this morning's incident
interfere with his schedule today.

121
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:33,083
I don't understand the rationale
behind it. No, listen to me. Why?

122
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,085
Why defend something
that you don't need to defend?

123
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,368
Maureen won't come out with the story today.

124
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,603
- She will.
- We don't know that.

125
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,366
Look, if not now, tomorrow.

126
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,968
If not her, someone else.
Our son is accused of murder.

127
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,283
- The story's too big to hide.
- Mike.

128
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:53,491
He's right, Sherry. We need to control
when and how this story comes out.

129
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:57,088
One hour ago someone tried
to kill my husband.

130
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,767
That bought us time and we should use it.

131
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:05,246
The assassination attempt might even work
for us if we break the story about Keith.

132
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,962
It might put the public
in a more forgiving frame of mind.

133
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,089
- You're making a mistake.
- It's mine to make.

134
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:14,688
No, it isn't, David,
because you didn't get here by yourself.

135
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:17,492
Do not go against me on this, Sherry.

136
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,087
Promise me.

137
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:22,243
I can't promise you anything.

138
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:52,443
Jack, we've got a preliminary read
on the trace. It's a pretty big area.

139
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:56,003
- I'm listening.
- It's north of the 10, east of the 405.

140
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,887
Didyou hear me?

141
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,208
Jack?

142
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:08,808
Well, that's a start.
Now get me through these cops.

143
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:14,929
Your best bet is east on Thurston.
But I don't think you should be moving yet.

144
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:21,009
I'll get through the net somehow. Just stay on
that trace and help me find my family, please.

145
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:30,090
Tony, open an extra socket for me on one.

146
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,889
- Did you hear me?
- Come here. You gotta check this out.

147
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,410
- What is it?
- I checked Jamey's disk for recent emails.

148
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:54,281
She was pretty careful, but she must
not have had time to get rid of this one.

149
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:57,888
- That's from this morning.
- Mm-hm. To an anonymous recipient.

150
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:02,683
- What about the encryption?
- I'll get Milo on it. You can see the subject.

151
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:05,571
Ted Cofell? Coffell? Find out who he is.

152
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:13,608
I'm busy.

153
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:21,489
Yeah.

154
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,485
- I need you to do something.
- I'm working on this trace.

155
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:28,964
You're gonna have to do two things at once.
I need this email decrypted.

156
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,724
CTU, Almeida.

157
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,804
OK.

158
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,524
Thanks.

159
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,363
Nina.

160
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,923
That was the clinic. Jamey didn't make it.

161
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:36,202
- Mom, it's clear. They're gone.
- Hello, Jack? Are you there?

162
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,568
- Teri? It's Nina. Are you OK to talk?
- Uh-huh.

163
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:42,487
I'll put you through to Jack.
Jack, I've got Teri.

164
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,848
- Teri?
- Jack. Can you talk? Where are you?

165
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,925
- I'm on my way to get you out. Are you OK?
- I'm hangin' in there.

166
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:51,847
Good. Thank God. Nina's tracing
the cellular signal to your location.

167
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:54,891
- How long will that take to find it?
- Nina?

168
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,810
20 minutes. Milo's narrowed
the signal to four antennas,

169
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:02,249
which is still about 500 square miles.

170
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,370
- God.
- Don't worry. We're closing in on it.

171
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,363
Will you please pull over to the kerb?

172
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:13,842
- Jack?
- No, I'm still here, honey.

173
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,845
Is there anything you can tell us
that might help us find you?

174
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,970
I know we're at least
a few miles out of the city.

175
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:24,012
Look, this is gonna take me
about a minute, OK? Hold on.

176
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:55,688
11-8-19. Code 6 North.

177
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,924
11-8-9. I'm Code 6 South, heading your way.

178
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:01,004
Copy.

179
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:17,803
11-8-19. North sector. Nothing so far.

180
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,487
Jack, are you all right?

181
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,602
Jack?

182
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,082
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:36,451
Honey, it'd really help if you could tell us
everything you know about where you are.

184
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,286
I don't know. They blindfolded me
when they picked me up.

185
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,251
- Where was that?
- Mulholland, near Coldwater.

186
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,291
How long did it take to get from there
to where you are now?

187
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,807
I'm not sure. Halfan hour?

188
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,168
- Streets or freeways?
- Freeways, I think.

189
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,323
- Milo.
- Already on it.

190
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,291
Anything else? Any sounds or smells?

191
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:59,491
- Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything?
- No, it's pretty quiet.

192
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,883
There's hills and, um, some eucalyptus trees.

193
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:07,805
It may be in the north valley,
somewhere inland. It's pretty remote.

194
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:13,684
That helps. All right, I got it narrowed down
to three sectors, but check it out.

195
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:17,083
OK, the closer we get,
the longer each iteration's gonna take.

196
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:19,528
What does that mean?

197
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,683
It's just techno talk, Teri.

198
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,526
Don't worry. We're making good progress.

199
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,643
Jack? Are you there?

200
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,487
Yeah, baby. I'm still here.

201
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,291
Teri, I'm gonna find you. I promise.

202
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,329
I know you will.

203
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:50,843
Nina's tracing the call right now. We'll have
your location in just a couple of minutes,

204
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:56,246
but it's really important you don't hang up,
OK? Even if you can't talk, don't hang up.

205
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,251
Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right?

206
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,486
They didn't hurt you, did they?

207
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,292
I'm fine. So's Kim.

208
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,365
- Is she there with you?
- Yeah, she's right here.

209
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,963
Put her on the phone so both of you can hear.

210
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,044
OK.

211
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,123
- Dad?
- Hey, sweetheart.

212
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,652
Are you OK?

213
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,169
Yeah. Who are these guys?
Why are they doing this?

214
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,483
I don't know, honey, but I'm gonna find out.

215
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:40,169
But right now I just wanna make sure
that you and Mommy get home safely, OK?

216
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,006
Honey...

217
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:47,962
Look, uh... I know I haven't always been there
for you when you've needed me and...

218
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:52,171
- Jack, you don't have to do this.
- I want both of you to know that...

219
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:56,766
I'm here for you now. I love you more
than anything in the whole world,

220
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,289
and I promise you I am gonna
getyou both out ofthere. OK?

221
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:05,006
So no matter what happens, don't give up.

222
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:09,211
We're a family. We're gonna
get through this like a family.

223
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:11,047
OK?

224
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:15,525
So don't forget I'm coming to get you.

225
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:23,488
Sweetheart?

226
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:26,371
Stay on the phone. I'm gonna be right back.

227
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:57,489
- You still there?
- Mom, he's coming back.

228
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:02,408
- Jack, I have to go. He's coming back.
- Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open.

229
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,202
It's just a phone!

230
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,887
It's how Gaines gets ahold of me
when he needs me.

231
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,567
You already looked here!

232
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:15,411
- Where is it?
- I told you. I don't know.

233
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:21,490
- Where's my phone?
- She doesn't know either.

234
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:26,212
- Can'tyou speak foryourself?
- Stay away from her! Don't touch her.

235
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:29,524
- Can't you speak?
- I don't know where you left your phone.

236
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:33,686
Don't hurt her, man! Come on. Take it easy!

237
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,244
- Nina, what's going on?
- I don't know.

238
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,803
The signal's dying.

239
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,610
Who'd you call?

240
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,810
Who is this?

241
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:20,206
I'm the last thing that you will ever see if
anything happens to my wife or my daughter.

242
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,324
- Where you going?
- To tell Gaines.

243
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,962
What do you think he's gonna do
when he finds out they used your phone?

244
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,250
Jack, get us out of here, please! Hurry!

245
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:33,248
Teri, I'm gonna find you, I promise. Teri...

246
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:39,046
Think about it. They called on your phone.

247
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,364
Nina?

248
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:55,133
Tell me you got that trace.

249
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:59,204
We didn't get it.

250
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:14,210
- We've located Bauer's car.
- The number matches?

251
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,284
That's right.

252
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:08,646
- Nina, it's Jack. You still there?
- What's happening?

253
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:12,806
I got a car. How close
did Milo get with the trace?

254
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,292
25-mile radius.

255
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,409
- Dammit. That's not good enough.
- Sorry.

256
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:21,169
I've gotta do something. Come on, anything.
Please, help me out. What about Jamey?

257
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:24,928
- She didn't make it, Jack.
- I don't believe this. Nina, please.

258
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:27,527
- I've got to find them.
- Hold on.

259
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:30,525
- Anything yet with that email address?
- It's coming now.

260
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:33,411
Patch into line two.

261
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:38,202
It's Tony. I found something
on Jamey's computer that might be a lead.

262
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,285
- What?
- It's a name. Ted Cofell.

263
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:46,731
I did a search of LA and found him as a CEO
of an investment banking firm in Burbank.

264
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:47,802
That's it?

265
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,882
- So...
- There's...

266
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,726
Hold on. Speak one at a time.
Tony, you go first.

267
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:56,329
So far that's it, but we got Milo decoding the
email right now. We should have more soon.

268
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:00,326
OK, fine. I'm gonna head over
to Cofell's office. What's the address?

269
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:04,372
- It's 21500, Riverside Drive.
- 21500, Riverside Drive. Fine.

270
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:07,763
Tony, Gaines'll try and contact Jamey.
He doesn't know she's dead.

271
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,003
You make sure you keep it that way.

272
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:13,369
- Nina, you help me navigate through traffic.
- All right.

273
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:32,044
- Gaines.
- Hello, Ira.

274
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:39,729
- Mr Drazen. Where are you?
- Flying into Los Angeles.

275
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:44,204
I'd like to know why the David Palmer
situation hasn't been taken care of.

276
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:47,365
I don't have to tell you
my brother and I are very disappointed.

277
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:52,129
- We had some bad luck, that's all.
- Bad luck or bad management?

278
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:55,967
- We have every reason to void the contract.
- There's no need for that.

279
00:24:56,053 --> 00:25:00,126
To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer
in the same city on the same day

280
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:04,172
and let them slip through
our fingers would be intolerable.

281
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,962
Don't worry. Palmer will be dead
by the end of the day, just as we agreed.

282
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,566
How?

283
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:12,770
We still have Bauer's family as leverage.

284
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:16,084
We'll find Bauer and use him
just like we did before.

285
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:21,611
If plan A doesn't work, you should
have a plan B, not plan A recycled.

286
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,765
Like I said, we still have his family.

287
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:28,163
If we sit tight, there's
a good chance Bauer will find us.

288
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:31,404
Then we'll make him the scapegoat
just as before.

289
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:34,644
My brother wants me
to assess the situation personally.

290
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,167
I land in half an hour.

291
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:40,006
- I'll join you by 10.30.
- Suit yourself.

292
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:44,052
If I don't see a substantial improvement
in things in the next hour,

293
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:47,409
I'm going to ask Mr Cofell
to empty the accounts.

294
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,609
You will get zero.

295
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:52,253
- Mr Drazen...
- Ira...

296
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:56,121
you may be in this for the money,
but for my family it's personal.

297
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:59,327
- I realise that.
- Then realise this.

298
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:05,207
If things continue to go wrong, the money
isn't all you'll lose. Do you understand?

299
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,250
- This is Sherry Palmer.
- Hello.

300
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:14,325
I'm sure you're as surprised
as I am that I'm calling you.

301
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:19,487
I'm surprised you waited this long. I assume
you're calling because David still plans

302
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,929
to make the announcement about Keith
and you can't stop him,

303
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:25,652
so nowyou want me to stop him?

304
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:28,406
You've lost whatever influence
you once had with David,

305
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:33,362
so I'm sure that's gonna be a problem, but
you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley.

306
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:35,011
- How?
- I don't know.

307
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,210
I'm sure she has a weakness somewhere.

308
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,568
Look, Carl, you don't need to ask me
for any advice on stufflike this.

309
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:47,602
As a matter of fact, I'm already taking care
of the evidence against Keith.

310
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:52,449
Taking care of it? How?

311
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,922
That's allyou really need to know.

312
00:26:56,693 --> 00:27:00,606
- I'm not sure I'm understanding you.
- You don't have to.

313
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:04,925
But, Sherry, if we give David
a way out of this, make sure he takes it.

314
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:16,926
- Got it.
- Send it to me.

315
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:20,403
There was a wire transfer to Ira Gaines
at 2.10am from a Swiss account.

316
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:24,327
- One million dollars.
- What does Cofell have to do with this?

317
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:29,168
- I don't know. Maybe it was his money.
- Makes sense. Cofell's in finance.

318
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:34,763
- Yeah, it's Jack.
- Looks like we have the right Cofell.

319
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,083
Good. What have you got on him?

320
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:40,446
He was born in Philadelphia, went to Colgate,

321
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,445
MBA from UCLA in '88,
worked in investment banking,

322
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:46,047
started his own firm about five years ago.

323
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,249
His net worth is in excess of35 million.

324
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,245
- OK. Good. Patch me through to his office.
- OK.

325
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,928
- Cofell Enterprises.
- Hi. Is Ted there?

326
00:27:57,013 --> 00:27:59,049
He's in a meeting. May I take a message?

327
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:02,967
I'm a friend from business school.
I'm in town. I hoped we could get together.

328
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:05,851
As soon as he's out of the meeting
he's going out of town.

329
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,766
That's too bad. How much longer
will he be in his office?

330
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,731
He plans to leave by ten.
Wouldyou like to leave your name?

331
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,326
Hello?

332
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:28,886
Tell Milo to be ready
in case Teri calls back.

333
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,771
Look, Nina, Division gave me a heads-up.

334
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:36,488
They're sending in
a provisional replacement for Jack.

335
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:40,650
They didn't waste any time, did they?

336
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,803
Who is it?

337
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:47,171
Alberta Green. Didn't she work for you
when you were over at Division?

338
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:51,371
- Yes, she did. When's she coming?
- Scheduled to arrive at 9.45.

339
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,204
OK.

340
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:00,930
- CTU. Myers.
- Cofell's there, but he's gonna leave at ten.

341
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:03,732
I'm passing Culver.
How's the traffic moving east?

342
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:04,802
I'll check.

343
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:10,092
Jack, there's another thing.

344
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:13,210
They're bringing in
Alberta Green to run things.

345
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,888
- She's gonna be here in a few minutes.
- Dammit.

346
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:21,041
Whatever. We'll deal with it.
Now, tell me how to get out of this traffic.

347
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,284
- You'll hit gridlock in about two miles.
- How's Riverside?

348
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:28,002
It's a little better. You might wanna get off.

349
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:30,812
OK, look. I'll get off
at the next exit and cut over.

350
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:37,850
Mom, tell me what happened
between you and Dad.

351
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,967
Why'd he move out?

352
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,762
- Kim, let's not talk about this now.
- Why not?

353
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,526
I mean, we both know
there might not be a later.

354
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,604
- Kim...
- Please, Mom.

355
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,648
I wanna know.

356
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:08,329
I think your father is
the best man that I've ever known.

357
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:13,202
But he can be... difficult.

358
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:17,567
And his job doesn't help.

359
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:24,166
You remember a couple of years ago
when he went away for a few weeks?

360
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,845
Uh...

361
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:28,401
for some training thing.

362
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:32,802
That's what he told us,
but I'm sure it was a mission.

363
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:36,565
He wouldn't say
and maybe he probably couldn't.

364
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:43,046
Anyway, when he came back,
he was... different.

365
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:47,570
He was distant and... preoccupied

366
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,611
and other times he was just angry.

367
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:56,366
He did everything he could
to keep it from you.

368
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,569
But things between us weren't so great.

369
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,721
I suppose I could have been more patient.

370
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,927
So we decided to try being apart.

371
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,283
But it didn't work.

372
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,885
No.

373
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,404
Good.

374
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:32,087
I just want us to be together again.

375
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:50,969
Cofell's taking a private plane and we got
a copy of his flight plan from the FAA.

376
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:54,329
- He's going to Denver.
- What does that tell us?

377
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,450
We're not sure. We're checking
people in the Denver area

378
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,649
who have known terrorist connections.

379
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:01,883
So far we haven't got much.

380
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,403
- Hello, Nina.
- Hello, Alberta.

381
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:22,963
- Nice to see you. You know why I'm here.
- Yes.

382
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,533
Gather everyone around, will you?

383
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:33,409
OK. Could everyone stop what they're doing
for a moment? I have something to tell you.

384
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,212
I'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green.

385
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:40,127
Jack Bauer's been relieved
of his duties here indefinitely.

386
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:44,331
In the meantime, Alberta's been
appointed Acting Director of CTU.

387
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,925
Good morning.

388
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:53,645
Things have been out of control here today.
Starting now, they're back in control.

389
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:58,090
Most of you know that an attempt was made
on Senator Palmer at about 8am.

390
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:02,849
You may not know that Jack Bauer
was apparently involved in that attempt.

391
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:05,527
The nature of his involvement isn't clear,

392
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:08,844
but he has escaped custody
and is considered a fugitive.

393
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:12,562
We therefore have two objectives:
Find Jack Bauer,

394
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:18,364
and make a quick and accurate assessment
of the threat, if any, facing Senator Palmer.

395
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:21,684
I know most of you have been up
more than 24 hours.

396
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:26,688
Too bad. Nobody so much as yawns
until we accomplish our objective.

397
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:31,483
If anybody has a problem with that,
now would be a good time to resign.

398
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,366
Good. Let's get back to work.

399
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:43,651
Specific assignments will be confirmed
or revised within the hour.

400
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:55,571
Obviously this is awkward,
but we'll get through this. We're pros.

401
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:58,565
- Of course.
- We'll talk later.

402
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,406
Hold on a minute.

403
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:20,532
- Is it really true you played basketball?
- I sure did. Georgetown.

404
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:26,085
- My daddy says Georgetown sucks.
- I need to have a little talk with your daddy.

405
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:31,008
My daddy also says there will never be
a black president in this country, ever.

406
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:35,851
Would you give your daddy
a message for me?

407
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:42,684
Tell him I understand where he's coming
from, but he's wrong, and I'm gonna prove it.

408
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:47,321
- Tell him that, OK?
- OK.

409
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:51,131
- I have Frank Ames on the phone.
- What does he want?

410
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,727
- He wouldn't tell me.
- I'll call him back.

411
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:56,532
He said it was urgent.

412
00:34:57,453 --> 00:35:01,162
He's your biggest contributor.
You can't just blow him off.

413
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:10,042
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?

414
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,124
OK.

415
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,163
Frank. This is kind of a bad time.

416
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:24,404
- Well, it's about to get worse.
- What do you mean?

417
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:27,929
I just got out of a meeting with Carl,
Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen.

418
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:31,892
- About what?
- George Ferragamo, your son's therapist.

419
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:35,409
"The freshman and the transfers
from school are... "

420
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:38,371
The three of you have given
a lot of money to my campaign,

421
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,921
but my son's therapist
is none ofyour business.

422
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,686
He is when he's accusing
your son of murder.

423
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:47,652
He's a problem, and Tuttle
and Jorgensen don't like problems.

424
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:50,930
They told Carl to get rid ofit, permanently.

425
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:55,925
- I've played hardball all my life, but this...
- What are you saying? They told Carl to...

426
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:59,892
Listen, I'm washing my hands of this
and your whole campaign.

427
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:02,533
- Frank...
- I am out of it, David.

428
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:10,247
What was that about?

429
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:15,049
I need to talk to Carl, now.

430
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:43,447
You wanted to see me?

431
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:49,162
- Give us five minutes.
- Certainly.

432
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:55,245
I don't know where Jack is.
We haven't talked since this morning.

433
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,767
- Since he escaped with a hostage?
- That's right.

434
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:00,606
I'm not sure I believe you.

435
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:07,923
If you tell me where he is, I'll do what I can
to make sure nothing heavy falls on you.

436
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:10,732
I told you. I don't know.

437
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:16,288
From what I've heard, there are
very few secrets between you and Jack.

438
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:19,763
Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me.

439
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:23,732
Getting involved with Jack was one
of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.

440
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:28,933
Not that I'm judging you, Nina, but
there's a right way to do these things.

441
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,130
Let 'em screw you.
Don't let 'em screw you over.

442
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:36,092
Look, if you don't have any more pearls
of wisdom, I'd like to get back to work.

443
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,004
By all means.

444
00:37:42,013 --> 00:37:45,289
- Cofell Enterprises.
- It's Ted's friend from business school.

445
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:49,446
I'm sorry, but I'm in the building. I hoped
I could come up and say a quick hello.

446
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:54,209
- Will Ted be there for a few more minutes?
- I'm sorry, sir. He's on his way out.

447
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:56,966
- What floor is Cofell Enterprises on?
- 14.

448
00:37:58,013 --> 00:38:00,004
Thank you.

449
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:09,651
- Nancy, could you call my car, please?
- OK.

450
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:13,931
Better head to the airport a little early today.
The radio said the traffic was slow.

451
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:19,770
Of course. Mr Cofell, a friend of yours from
business school is on the way up to see you.

452
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:20,888
On his way now?

453
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:23,692
- I tried to stop him.
- Did he say who it was?

454
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:26,845
He didn't give his name.
He's probably selling something.

455
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:29,447
- Don't give him my cell number.
- Have a good trip.

456
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,809
- Thank you.
- Don't forget your phone.

457
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,681
Hey, Lewis, just wanted to let you know
that Mr Cofell is on his way down.

458
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,048
Excuse me. Where's Mr Cofell?

459
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:42,330
Oh, I'm so sorry.
He just stepped into the elevator.

460
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:48,724
Where was he going? Down to
the parking garage? It's all right, never mind.

461
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:05,884
Nothing to worry about. There's a 30-second
reset, then we continue down automatically.

462
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,170
It's probably a false alarm anyhow.

463
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:54,329
- Excuse me. Are you Mr Cofell's driver?
- Yeah, that's right.

464
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:58,008
I'm a federal agent.
Where are you going today?

465
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:00,926
- To the airport.
- On what business?

466
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,686
Look, I'm just his driver.
Is there a problem here?

467
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,764
Come with me a second.

468
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:21,245
Thank you.

469
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,131
- Have a nice day, Mr Cofell.
- Thank you.

470
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:27,284
Valet.

471
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,170
Mark, could you turn the air on
back here, please?

472
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:03,126
"Then they began to laugh. "

473
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,728
"They began to say things like
'Oh, you remember him, don't you?"'

474
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:09,486
"'Doesn't he live with you? Sure he does. "'

475
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,571
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's nothing.

476
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:25,170
- He hurt you, didn't he?
- No, no, honey. I'm fine.

477
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:03,206
