1
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:14,801
Have you got it yet?

2
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,834
Told you I'd call you
as soon as I have everything.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,434
I'm paying you a lot of money,
Collette.

4
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,067
And if you could've gotten

5
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,200
the detailed specs of a facility
this secure

6
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:25,134
from someone else, you would've.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,134
CTU is no longer
an obstacle.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,567
MAN:
This facility
has been contaminated

9
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:31,967
with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

10
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,167
Repeat: this facility
has been contaminated.

11
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,868
Everybody, leave
the situation room.
Move! Now!

12
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,401
Seal it.

13
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:39,967
Lynn, it's Jack.

14
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,567
We found a computer interrupt

15
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,134
in the AC control unit.
Now if we can

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,501
shut that down in the next few
minutes, we can stop the gas

17
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,033
from permeating the safe zones.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,401
The problem is
you're the only person

19
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,634
close enough to get to it.

20
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,634
Lynn, the truth is
if I could get there,

21
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,334
I would do this myself,
but I'm not close enough.

22
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,634
And I'm going to have
to ask you to do it

23
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,801
without any protection.

24
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:02,467
He did it.

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,768
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,067
( groans )

27
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:11,134
CTU is protecting
this city.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,567
Are you saying
they're no longer

29
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:13,967
capable of doing that?

30
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,601
I'm saying they've been
seriously compromised here.

31
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,401
We've got terrorists with nerve
gas canisters out there.

32
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,367
Who is going to stop them?

33
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:21,900
Mr. President, I suggest

34
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,534
an emergency restructuring.

35
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,100
CTU is no longer
an operational entity.

36
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,933
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,567
I can see
no other option right now

38
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,000
but to impose marshal law
on the city of Los Angeles.

39
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,900
What I will not do

40
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,634
is stand by and watch
Hal Gardner use you

41
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,501
to promote his own agenda.

42
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,601
You killed my wife

43
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,134
Michelle Dessler this morning.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,634
She was my life.

45
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:48,367
And you took her.

46
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,300
My God, he's got a gun.

47
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:50,434
You can't do this.

48
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,000
We have to get him talking.

49
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,200
He's our only lead to Bierko
and the Sentox gas canisters.

50
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,434
You've had your chance.

51
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,567
He's mine now.

52
00:01:58,634 --> 00:01:59,534
Tony!

53
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,334
Oh, my God!

54
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:35,701
Jack, I am so sorry.

55
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,601
Security find Henderson yet?
No, he got

56
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,467
out of the building
before the lockdown.

57
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,434
An external cam got a shot
of him as he was leaving.

58
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,300
And the car that he was using
was found a block away.

59
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,401
But I think that we might've
got what we needed from him.

60
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,868
What are you talking about?

61
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,200
Chloe was able to decrypt
a file from his computer.

62
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,534
She got a name of someone
connected to Bierko.

63
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,067
Who's Collette Stenger?

64
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,467
She's an international
intelligence broker.

65
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,367
State secrets,
intellectual property.

66
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,367
What's her connection
to Bierko?

67
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,734
Interpol claims
that she and Bierko

68
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,234
met at least twice over
the last eight months.

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,701
And we think she helped
broker the deal.

70
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,933
Is she still in Los Angeles?

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,834
She gave a name of
a hotel to customs.

72
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,501
But nothing's to say
that she's actually there.

73
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,967
Curtis is prepping
a tactical team

74
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,234
to try to bring her in.
Okay.
Good work.

75
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,900
( cell phone rings )

76
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,067
Manning.

77
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:19,067
Curtis, it's Jack.

78
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,100
When is the tac team
leaving?

79
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,334
Right now.
I'm going with you.

80
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,434
All right.

81
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,667
I have no intention...

82
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,167
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,534
member of the press corps...

84
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,667
Just so you're aware,
there will be no Q&A

85
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,634
following
the president's statement.

86
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,933
But you can submit questions
to my office...

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,167
You're having
second thoughts?

88
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,267
Putting soldiers
on the streets of L.A.,

89
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,801
this will not be
a popular announcement.

90
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:44,933
Maybe not.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
But it's the right move.

92
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,701
Hal, would you
excuse us, please?

93
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:50,401
Mrs. Logan, the president's
about to go on the air.

94
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,401
I'll be brief.

95
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,701
I would like a moment
alone with my husband.

96
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,868
BROWN:
Now, before we begin,

97
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:00,734
I want to take a second to
address an issue of security.

98
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,234
I understand that many of you
have been here since early...

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,567
I've made up
my mind, Martha.

100
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,567
I'm not debating
this anymore.

101
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,634
Just listen, listen please.

102
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,134
Mike Novick spoke
to someone at CTU.

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
They think they have
a lead on this man,

104
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:11,701
this man Bierko.

105
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:12,967
They think they may

106
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,134
find him before he launches
another attack.

107
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,768
CTU was just hit.
40% of their people

108
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,734
are either dead
or unable to work.

109
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,200
To think that they
would be able

110
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,900
to stop this attack, that's
just wishful thinking.

111
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,234
Maybe not.

112
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,768
( sighs )

113
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,167
Bringing the military in

114
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,234
is the best way
to maintain order.

115
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,701
The Vice President's
right about that.

116
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:31,933
Of course he is.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,100
What's that mean?

118
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,534
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

119
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,234
that he proposed this whole
thing to set you up for a fall?

120
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,701
So he gets the nomination
next year.

121
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,100
That's insane.

122
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,567
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

123
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:50,134
There's going to be fallout.

124
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,434
Hal knows it.

125
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,467
And you know it.

126
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,234
I have to go.

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,601
Charles...

128
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

129
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,334
the President of
the United States.

130
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:15,234
As you all know,
America has been hit today

131
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,567
by a series
of terrorist strikes,

132
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:22,300
beginning with the assassination
of former President David Palmer

133
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,501
and the murder of innocent
Americans at Ontario Airport,

134
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,434
followed by
the attempted assassination

135
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,601
of Russian President
Yuri Suvarov.

136
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,834
These events
are being orchestrated

137
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,501
by terrorists
operating within our borders.

138
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,167
Our most recent intelligence
suggests

139
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:41,200
that they will strike again
and soon.

140
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,933
I can and will
do my sworn duty

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,200
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

142
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:51,501
Therefore I am issuing
an executive order

143
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,267
imposing a curfew
on all civilians

144
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,567
in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.

145
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,367
This curfew will be effective
immediately and will be

146
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:03,501
enforced by the military.

147
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:07,334
As disruptive and distasteful as
I know this is for many of you,

148
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,900
I would ask that you remember
that we are at war.

149
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,134
Bracing ourselves
against future attacks...

150
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,601
D.O.D. is asking for a list
of our casualties.

151
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,401
I don't want any
names released

152
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,067
until the next of kin
have been notified.

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,501
Let me know when that happens.

154
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,033
This place is
a sinking ship.

155
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,933
We should be
taking over now,

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,734
not going through the
charade of an assessment.

157
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,900
Until we're ready to transition,

158
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,634
we need everyone here
functioning.

159
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,701
Once the remaining canisters
of nerve gas have been found

160
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,900
and the terrorists captured,

161
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,567
then we'll assume full control.

162
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,567
Karen.

163
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:46,900
Hello, Bill.

164
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,067
Bill Buchanan,
Miles Papazian from my office.

165
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,434
I appreciate your coming,
but that wasn't necessary.

166
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,067
We just need to replace
some key personnel.

167
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,134
We're all sorry
about the loss of lives here,

168
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,834
but the White House feels
you may need more than that.

169
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
They want an assessment

170
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,434
of how Homeland
may best assist CTU.

171
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,234
I'll brief you in my office.

172
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,434
Fine.

173
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,768
Miles, familiarize yourself

174
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,401
with the networks,
and then start the survey.

175
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,100
Let's go.

176
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,601
Upstairs.

177
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:20,667
Chloe O'Brian?

178
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,701
Who are you?

179
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,067
Homeland Security.

180
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:24,567
I asked your name,
not who you work for.

181
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,834
I need a vacant station set up.

182
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,401
I'm kind of busy right now.

183
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,234
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles
listed on my report

184
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,801
as a casualty.

185
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,933
Is that right?

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,801
Yeah.

187
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,701
Then his station
should be available.

188
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:42,033
I'll set up over there.

189
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,134
I'll be reinstalling
operating protocols

190
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,167
for everyone in your group,

191
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,300
so I'll need your keycard.

192
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,434
No.

193
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm sorry?

194
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,200
You can't have my keycard.

195
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,933
We're here with a priority
admin directive.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,634
You can confirm that with your
supervisor on your own time.

197
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,134
REPORTER:
We're live in Los Angeles,
where just a few minutes ago,

198
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,634
Army units
stationed in L.A. County

199
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,601
began moving in force
across city limits.

200
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:29,000
This is the first time a
military presence of this scale

201
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,634
has been activated
in a major metropolitan area.

202
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,100
While White House officials
have stopped short

203
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,601
of officially declaring
full-scale martial law...

204
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,567
Where are you going?

205
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,367
I just need some fresh air.

206
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,067
These mobile Army divisions
were activated

207
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,334
shortly after
the President's press conference

208
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:47,033
in which he declared
an enforced curfew.

209
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,467
Officials are hoping
the curfew will prevent

210
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,868
further acts of terror.

211
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,667
I do not trust him.

212
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,000
Ma'am?

213
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,634
The Vice President.

214
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:05,200
( cell phone ringing )

215
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,834
This is Aaron Pierce.

216
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,667
Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,734
Sir, I am so sorry

218
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:18,567
about President Palmer,
more sorry than I can describe.

219
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,634
Aaron, I know how close
you were to my brother.

220
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,900
You must have known
he felt the same way about you.

221
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,067
Thank you for saying that.

222
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:27,601
Actually, Aaron,
he's the reason I'm calling.

223
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,834
There's something
from my brother

224
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,234
I need to give you
personally.

225
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,834
I should be there
within the hour.

226
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,200
You're coming here?

227
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,534
Yeah, I know
it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

228
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,000
But I'd rather see you
sooner than later.

229
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,868
There's a curfew in effect, sir.

230
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,933
I know, I know.
I left before it was declared.

231
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,534
If I may say so, this
is an odd request.

232
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,868
Aaron, my brother
trusted you with his life.

233
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,033
I am asking you to trust me.

234
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,601
All right.

235
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,067
I'd also appreciate it if
you would keep this between us.

236
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:57,768
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

237
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,300
I'll find a place.

238
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,300
Thank you, Aaron.

239
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,300
I'll call you when I'm close.

240
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,534
REPORTER:
The effects of this action
will no doubt

241
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,601
ripple across the country, as
other cities begin to take note.

242
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,267
So while legislators debate

243
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,334
the legality
of President Logan's action,

244
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,134
martial law is already a fact...

245
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,401
Mike, turn it off.

246
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,567
...on the ground,
here in Los Angeles.

247
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,501
( TV turns off )

248
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,601
"Debate the legality
of President Logan's action."

249
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,701
Did you hear that?

250
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,134
They're talking about this

251
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,234
like it's
an illegal action.

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,900
Don't worry, Mr. President.

253
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm in control of the situation.

254
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,033
Our legal people are
working on it right now.

255
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:49,134
Do we have
anything more from CTU?

256
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,401
They're still following
up on this Bierko lead.

257
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,868
As soon as they have
something to report,

258
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,000
we'll be the first to hear.

259
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:04,534
Give me details of the current
threat assessment.

260
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,567
There's a high probability

261
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,900
that Bierko is
planning an attack

262
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,000
on a much larger scale
than anything we've seen today.

263
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,067
That's why he
targeted CTU--

264
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:12,801
to cripple our ability
to stop him.

265
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:15,534
And the question is:
Was he successful?

266
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,367
When you look
at the numbers,

267
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,434
you were harder hit
than you thought, Bill.

268
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,734
We're still functioning.

269
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,167
Maybe not at a 100%,

270
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,401
but when you install
the people I've asked for...

271
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,634
we'll be back
to fighting strength.

272
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,768
Have you made any progress
finding Bierko?

273
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,000
We've identified a woman
we believe might lead us to him.

274
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,634
Collette Stenger.

275
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,801
We've just sent a tac team
to bring her in.

276
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,100
Good.

277
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,334
I enjoy watching
you get dressed

278
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,834
almost as much as I enjoy
watching you get undressed.

279
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,601
You should get dressed yourself

280
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,801
and send
the bags down.

281
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,200
This deal you're working on,

282
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,267
I hope you're getting
a lot of money for it.

283
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,033
I never talk about my business,
you know that.

284
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
I know...

285
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,701
but Maria called about
this villa in Positano.

286
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,033
She said when you see it,
you'll love it.

287
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,134
We'll call her later.

288
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,033
I'll see you at
the airport, okay?

289
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,734
In 45 minutes.

290
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,801
I'll be there.

291
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
( cell phone ringing )

292
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,100
Yes.

293
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,701
I'm on my way.

294
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:31,768
And you have
everything I asked for?

295
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,601
Of course.

296
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,801
Good.

297
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:34,834
Do you have
the money?

298
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,868
As soon as I verify

299
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,067
the merchandise,

300
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:39,234
I'll have it transferred
to your account.

301
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,801
I'll be there soon.

302
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,701
Does she have the schematics
and the access codes?

303
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

304
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,467
Everything we need.

305
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,267
The Distribution Center is
a difficult target.

306
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,033
It would be much easier
to hit a less secure location.

307
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,467
No, Mikhail, this is the place.

308
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,634
Release
the Sentox here...

309
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:05,167
and 200,000 people die.

310
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,334
And we need a second satellite

311
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,867
repositioned as
soon as possible.

312
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,134
Good. Thank you.

313
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,601
I saw a request

314
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,034
for proficiency evaluations
for all CTU personnel

315
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,434
on my secondary
screen.

316
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:29,701
That's a formality.

317
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,301
The fact is, we don't have time
for evaluations

318
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,067
right now.
Then why was it put
in the pipeline?

319
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:34,634
Like I said, it's a formality.

320
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:37,167
You're here to shut
this place down, aren't you?

321
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,634
And the evaluations
will be filled in later

322
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,701
as a matter of protocol.

323
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:40,867
I told you before,
the White House...

324
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,668
I know what you told me before.

325
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,200
Now tell me the truth.

326
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,401
The truth is, CTU is being
absorbed by Homeland.

327
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,701
Which means,
from now on,

328
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,833
every operational decision
needs to go through me.

329
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,200
Bill, what
did you expect?

330
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,200
You've been infiltrated.

331
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,200
56 of your people

332
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,267
have been killed.

333
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,234
The others are
demoralized...

334
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,601
They're not demoralized,

335
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:07,567
they're angry!

336
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:08,734
They want to fight back.

337
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,701
They're willing
to lay down their lives.

338
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,034
Some already
have...

339
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,134
It's done, Bill.

340
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,534
The decision's been made.

341
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,567
And I know
neither one of us

342
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:17,701
wants this transition
to interfere

343
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:18,701
with ongoing protocol,

344
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,933
so let's just
keep it between us.

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,501
At least until
this crisis plays out.

346
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,967
There.

347
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,434
Bill?

348
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,701
Homeland is being overly
aggressive with their survey.

349
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:44,701
What is going on?

350
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,067
Nothing.

351
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,000
It's just a formality.

352
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,933
They'll be gone as soon as
they finish their evaluation.

353
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,467
Where are we on
the military mobilization?

354
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:57,800
Martial law is in effect

355
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,367
in nine of the
15 L.A. districts.

356
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,833
I'm setting up checkpoints for
the rest of the county now.

357
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,668
I hope the president's
doing the right thing.

358
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,534
CURTIS:
Alpha Team,

359
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,067
we're approaching
Collette Stenger's
apartment

360
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:22,100
and we're ready to move.

361
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,367
Are you in position?

362
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,301
AGENT ( over radio ):
Affirmative.

363
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,900
We've got the lobby covered.

364
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:26,967
CURTIS:
Copy.

365
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,100
I think she went for the roof.

366
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,301
Cover the stairs.

367
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,401
Let's go.

368
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,900
We're going up top.

369
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,867
JACK:
Drop the gun!

370
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,567
Stand down or he dies!

371
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,701
I said stand down!

372
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,234
Our people are all around you.

373
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:33,301
They will drop you before
you could pull that trigger.

374
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,067
Put the gun down!

375
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:36,601
What do you mean
your "people?"

376
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,833
Who are you?

377
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,967
Counter Terrorist Unit,
Los Angeles.

378
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:45,234
Show me identification.

379
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,933
I'm with the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

380
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:01,967
My name's Theo Stoller.

381
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,501
What are you doing
in this country?

382
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,301
I'm here on
special assignment...

383
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,334
by agreement between
our governments.

384
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:11,234
Now you can get
the hell out of here

385
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,800
before you
destroy my cover.

386
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,000
That's not going to happen.

387
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,567
CHLOE ( over phone ):
O'Brian.

388
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,601
Chloe, it's Jack.

389
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,000
I want you to check

390
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,634
on a foreign agent
on the SA list.

391
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,100
"Theo Stoller."

392
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:29,167
Okay.

393
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,601
Got it:
"Theo Stoller,

394
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:36,301
height, 5'll",
brown hair, brown eyes."

395
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,334
He's a German operative,

396
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,301
but trained in England
at MI-6.

397
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,534
There's even contact
information: cell phone...

398
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:42,567
That's all right,
Chloe.

399
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,567
That's enough,
thanks.

400
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,800
I told you,

401
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,067
you have to get
out of here now.

402
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,200
We can't do that.

403
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:49,534
You were with
Collette Stenger.

404
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,601
We need her to help us
find Vladimir Bierko.

405
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:52,601
I don't know him.

406
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:53,601
Bierko's responsible

407
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,833
for the terrorist attacks

408
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,134
that took place
in the city earlier today.

409
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,367
He's preparing to mount
another one as we speak.

410
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,367
Collette Stenger is the only way
we can find him.

411
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:01,434
Where is she?

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,668
I can't help you.
Why not?

413
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:07,967
Giving you Collette
jeopardizes my operation.

414
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,067
What operation?

415
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:12,000
I've been undercover
for the last six months

416
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,833
gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

417
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,701
We've identified cells
in three countries,

418
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,734
but she's connected
to a dozen more.

419
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
She's too valuable to give up.

420
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,567
If we don't find Bierko,

421
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,200
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people

422
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:24,734
will die here today.

423
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,967
That is more important than
your preemptive operation.

424
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,867
It's not a question
of importance,

425
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,701
it's a question
of different agendas.

426
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,134
Your job is to save
American lives.

427
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,768
Mine to save German lives.

428
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,267
You're asking me
to betray

429
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,401
my duty to my country.

430
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,167
Ask yourself what you
would do in my position.

431
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:43,467
You better start
asking yourself

432
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:44,768
what you would do
in mine.

433
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,067
Now, let's go.

434
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,534
I'm here by permission
of your government--

435
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,567
you can't touch me.

436
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:49,567
Right.

437
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:50,668
We'll see about that.

438
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,900
Well, make sure that
your superior understands

439
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,568
that if this attack happens,

440
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:50,833
my government will hold
your country accountable.

441
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,833
Jack, it's Buchanan.

442
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,334
Audrey will be joining us
momentarily.

443
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,034
You're also on the line
with Karen Hayes

444
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,700
from Homeland Security.

445
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,833
She's been providing support
to CTU, and she's also

446
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,467
been in contact
with the White House.

447
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,668
Did President Logan get in touch
with the German Chancellor?

448
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:05,967
He's tried;

449
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,301
the chancellor's
unreachable for
another hour.

450
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,867
We don't have
another hour.

451
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,067
They're stalling, there's
nothing we can do about that.

452
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,434
Jack, this is Audrey.

453
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,733
I was just speaking
with German Intelligence.

454
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,568
They're refusing
to order their agent

455
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,134
to cooperate with us.

456
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,534
Maybe you can get
a deal with him.

457
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,100
Okay, I'll talk
to Stoller again.

458
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,134
Good. Call me
if you get him
to change his mind.

459
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,833
Yeah.

460
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,967
Curtis?

461
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:30,201
Let me have a moment
with him alone.

462
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,501
Jack, what are you doing?

463
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:33,434
It's all right.

464
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:35,401
All right.

465
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,367
Your intelligence service

466
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:47,568
denied our request
for cooperation.

467
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:48,867
So has your government.

468
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,601
I'm not surprised.

469
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,767
Collette Stenger
is a golden goose.

470
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,067
There's no upside
in giving her up.

471
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:58,733
Maybe I could provide you
with one.

472
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:03,367
Meaning?

473
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:05,800
I will give you something

474
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,301
that is more valuable
than Collette Stenger.

475
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,668
It's hard to know
what that might be.

476
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,000
Our roster of all known
terror suspects

477
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:18,434
working around the world,
our WET list.

478
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,934
As allies, we've requested
this WET list

479
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,934
many times before.

480
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,367
But the NSA has always said,

481
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:29,267
giving us the
list would

482
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,034
jeopardize their operations.

483
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,733
It will.

484
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,134
I don't work for the NSA,
I don't work for CTU.

485
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,134
This is personal.

486
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,967
And right now, you're not
giving me another choice.

487
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,401
All right.

488
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,601
I'll give you Collette

489
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:45,601
in exchange for the WET list.

490
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,833
Okay.

491
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Let's see what we can do.

492
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:53,167
Agent Bauer.

493
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:56,634
I'm aware of several names
that should be on that list.

494
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,668
Don't try and pass me a fake.

495
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:00,967
( phone ringing )

496
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:01,967
O'Brian.

497
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,201
Chloe, it's Jack.

498
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:04,934
Do we still have a back door
into NSA's

499
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,067
secured mainframe?

500
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,401
I can't really talk
right now, Jack.

501
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,501
Okay, fine. Then, listen.

502
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,267
I need you to log on to their
server, download the WET list,

503
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,668
and send it to my
PDA immediately.

504
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,000
Why?

505
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,800
The WET list is what
we're gonna have to pay

506
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,000
to get Collette Stenger.

507
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,934
Jack, that list is
as top secret as it gets.

508
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,334
Homeland Security
sent a team over here.

509
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,034
You're gonna have
to clear it with them.

510
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,401
We can't afford
to take the chance
of them saying no.

511
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,733
I'm not saying I won't do it
without their approval.

512
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,934
I'm saying I can't.

513
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,167
They took my keycard.

514
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:33,234
I can't get into the NSA
mainframe without it.

515
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:34,401
Just do what you have to.

516
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,900
It's our only way
to get Bierko.

517
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,234
Fine. I'll call you back.

518
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,201
Excuse me, Miles.

519
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,733
Oh!
( gasps ):
My God!

520
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,234
What is the
matter with you?

521
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,534
Sorry.

522
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:08,900
What's wrong with you?

523
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:12,534
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

524
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:36,367
JACK:
Yeah?

525
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,067
Jack, I got on the NSA server.

526
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:39,234
Did you get the file?

527
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,601
Not yet. They put
an extra layer

528
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:41,668
of authentication
in place.

529
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,767
Can you get around it?

530
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,934
Hold on.

531
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,467
Okay, I got it.

532
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,100
I hope you know
what you're doing.

533
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm uploading it now.

534
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,000
Thanks.

535
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,767
I got it.

536
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,568
Well, that appears legitimate.

537
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:42,301
It is.

538
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:45,034
Give me back the memory card.

539
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,067
You can't upload the WET list
to your people

540
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:49,467
until I have Collette Stenger
in custody.

541
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,668
Well, fair enough.

542
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,201
We have to go now.

543
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,501
I'm supposed to meet her
at the Van Nuys airport

544
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:58,967
in less than 20 minutes.

545
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,568
What kind of a car
is she driving?

546
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,167
I don't know.

547
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:04,634
I'm supposed to
park in car Lot C
and wait for her.

548
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
She'll probably
recon the area before
she makes contact.

549
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,100
She's, uh, cautious by habit.

550
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,234
Curtis, we're on the move--
Van Nuys Airport.

551
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,800
We'll give you the details
when we're on the way.

552
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,601
When you receive the funds,
transfer them immediately

553
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:20,900
into the Caymans account.

554
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,700
In Euros.

555
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:28,100
My bank is ready
to accept the transfer.

556
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,434
The file is encrypted.

557
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,201
What is the decryption key?

558
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,733
Transfer the funds.

559
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:54,301
It's been sent.

560
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:57,900
Thank you.

561
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,700
E-mail me confirmation
of the transfer.

562
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:16,700
The decryption key is
Charlie alpha three nine

563
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:17,833
alpha.

564
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:23,100
It worked.

565
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,467
This is what you wanted.

566
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,767
Of course it is.

567
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,833
Until next time, gentlemen.

568
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:39,867
Are the men ready?

569
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:41,034
Yes.

570
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,334
Torch this place.

571
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,467
We're moving out.

572
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:59,167
Governor, I'm not trying
to co-opt your authority,

573
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:01,867
but we are in the middle
of a crisis here.

574
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:05,001
Now, you can either transmit
my orders word for word

575
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,268
to the National Guard,
or I can federalize them,

576
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:08,334
and give them
my orders

577
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,034
directly, your choice.

578
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:11,667
Excellent.

579
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,067
Thank you, Governor.

580
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:14,767
I look forward
to your cooperation.

581
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,800
Sir, we have a situation
at one of the roadblocks

582
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,800
that the region three commander
needs your call on.

583
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,634
Tell me.
Wayne Palmer is insisting

584
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,734
he be let through one
of our roadblocks.

585
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,834
He claims he still has
his clearance and that he's on

586
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,600
official business.
And where exactly is that?

587
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,467
He was stopped trying
to get on the access road

588
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:30,567
coming towards
the retreat.

589
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,400
He's on his way here?
To do what?

590
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,268
He wouldn't give
the officer in charge

591
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:36,767
of the roadblock
any information.

592
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:39,767
What should I tell
the roadblock, sir?

593
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,433
Captain, all I'm asking you
to do is call and confirm

594
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,368
I have a grade two clearance,
that's it.

595
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,634
Sir, regardless
of your clearance,

596
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,467
authorization to let you through

597
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,067
must come down through the
appropriate chain of command.

598
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:56,433
And just who would that be,
huh, Captain?

599
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,134
Who's in charge
of the military's role in this?

600
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,334
( phone ringing )

601
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:05,101
Riggs.

602
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:07,934
Understood.

603
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:11,634
Thank you, sir.

604
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,533
You can go on through
now, sir.

605
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,934
Let him through.

606
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,101
Thank you, Captain.

607
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,834
CURTIS:
All teams are in position, Jack.

608
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,467
No one moves in

609
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,234
until I confirm that it's her.

610
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,767
Copy that.

611
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,667
Collette won't show herself
if she senses anything's wrong.

612
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,600
Make sure he stays hidden.

613
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,767
Don't worry. He will.

614
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,634
What will happen to her?

615
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,467
To Collette.

616
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,901
I don't know yet. Why?

617
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,234
Uh, just curious.

618
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,167
You've been in
my situation?

619
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:58,567
I've been undercover for long
stretches of time, yeah.

620
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,001
And been involved with a woman
during that time?

621
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,368
There's no question we are doing
what has to be done

622
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:10,533
for our countries,
but sometimes it's
harder than others.

623
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:16,167
Chloe, could you join us in
the Situation Room, please?

624
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,268
Sure.

625
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,467
What's going on?

626
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,034
Why don't you tell us,
Ms. O'Brian?

627
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,901
I don't know.

628
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:41,268
We've got you hacking
into a top secret NSA archive.

629
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,967
I don't know what
you're talking about.

630
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:44,234
MILES:
I pulled a mirrored archive

631
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,400
of your web traffic.

632
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:46,634
Whatever you took from NSA

633
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,034
was uploaded to Jack Bauer's

634
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:50,201
remote node.

635
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,234
Ms. O'Brian, tell us exactly
what document

636
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,934
you passed to Jack Bauer.

637
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:57,600
BUCHANAN:
Chloe,

638
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,834
this is going to get much worse
if you force me

639
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,234
to have NSA run a back trace.

640
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:03,334
What is it?

641
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,400
Jack needed the WET List.

642
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,101
What?!

643
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,368
Why on earth
would you give him that?

644
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,001
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us
to Collette Stenger without it.

645
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,667
Chloe, giving that list

646
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,700
to another intelligence
agency could be disastrous.

647
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:19,001
Years of work could
be rendered useless,

648
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,667
our own agents could be exposed.

649
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:21,934
Jack needed it, okay?

650
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,368
No! No, it's not okay.

651
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,533
And you expected us
to give your agents a chance?

652
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,934
Get me Bauer.

653
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,400
( phone ringing )

654
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:40,268
Put it on speaker phone, or
I'm getting out of this car.

655
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,334
Fine.

656
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,334
This is Bauer.

657
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,934
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.

658
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,368
Karen Hayes is here, as well.

659
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,533
If you're with
Theo Stoller,

660
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,400
get some place you
can talk privately.

661
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:56,334
I can't. We're in the middle
of an operation.

662
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,967
If I move,
I'll jeopardize our position.

663
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,234
Then you'll have to have this
conversation in front of him.

664
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,067
Have you given him
the WET List yet?

665
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,301
Yes.

666
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:04,967
Has he given it
to German Intelligence?

667
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,368
No.
Then get it back. Now.

668
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:07,767
I can't.

669
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:10,400
If I do that,
Stoller won't cooperate.

670
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,867
And then
we'll lose Collette Stenger.

671
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,634
Bill, will you explain this
to her?

672
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,134
It's not his decision.

673
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,433
Retrieve the WET list now,

674
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,201
or I will order Agent Manning
and his team to do it.

675
00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:22,268
Right now, Collette Stenger is
our only connection to Bierko.

676
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,301
If you blow this operation,
you will be responsible

677
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:26,268
for every life lost
in his next attack.

678
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,533
I don't like to be threatened,
Mr. Bauer.

679
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,634
Ms. Hayes, that's not a threat,
that's a fact.

680
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,934
HAYES:
German Intelligence
will move preemptively

681
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:34,433
on people
that we have been

682
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,734
watching for years.

683
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,467
Our ability to prevent
terrorist attacks

684
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:38,934
will be severely threatened.

685
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,467
Then that's a risk
we'll have to take.

686
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,467
Right now, we have to deal
with this situation.

687
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,467
It's not your call.

688
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:44,767
It's not mine, either.

689
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,634
We need authorization
from the President.

690
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,800
Then get it.

691
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,167
CURTIS:
Jack, one of our forward teams

692
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,767
I.D.'d a woman fitting
Stenger's description

693
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:54,334
driving a red Lexus making its
second circuit around the lot.

694
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,634
This could be her.

695
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,301
We have a possible suspect
approaching.

696
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,533
Ms. Hayes, are you

697
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,901
telling me that I have
to abort this operation?

698
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:02,934
Yes or no?

699
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,667
Ms. Hayes, this is your call.

700
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,934
You don't know for certain
that this woman

701
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,268
will lead us to Bierko.

702
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,400
No, not for certain.

703
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,667
But, right now,
she's our only lead.

704
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,800
Are you willing
to take this chance?

705
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,700
You've left me no choice.

706
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,101
Proceed.

707
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,467
But you have severely
compromised this situation

708
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:23,667
and I promise you there
will be repercussions.

709
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:24,767
Fine.

710
00:33:26,934 --> 00:33:28,800
Are we all right?

711
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:31,834
We're fine.

712
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,634
CURTIS:
Red Lexus turning the corner.

713
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,800
A hundred yards away
and approaching.

714
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,567
No one move until I give a go.

715
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,901
The red Lexus is parked.

716
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:56,533
Move the center mirror,
so that I can see the car.

717
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,433
There.

718
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,301
Now get her out of the car.

719
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:23,700
Hi.

720
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:24,901
Hello.

721
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,600
JACK:
I have a positive I.D.

722
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,867
All teams move in.

723
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,467
All teams move, move, move!
Let's go!

724
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,201
Put your hands
where I can see them!

725
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:35,334
Theo, get in the car, now.

726
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,767
Let me see your hands!
What are you doing?

727
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,433
Now!
Let me go.

728
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,767
Theo, get out of there.

729
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:41,301
I'm sorry.

730
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:43,034
Theo, who are you?

731
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:43,867
Move!

732
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,368
Letting him go.

733
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,234
He's given us
what we want!

734
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,134
Put your hands up!

735
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,201
Turn and face the car!

736
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:53,268
Put your hands on the roof!

737
00:34:58,134 --> 00:34:59,334
Do it!

738
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,034
Where is Bierko?

739
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,634
We know you're
working with Bierko.

740
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,567
Where is he?

741
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:27,967
Fine.

742
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,500
Take her back to staging.

743
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,268
I want a team
searching this car.

744
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,500
Take everything back
to the staging area.

745
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,067
Now!

746
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,034
It's Theo.

747
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:53,001
I'm en route to the hotel.

748
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,934
Tell Heinrich
I'm uploading something

749
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,800
he's been wanting
for a long time.

750
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,967
( phone rings )

751
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,834
Stoller.

752
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,134
Theo, it's Jack.

753
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,167
I'm sorry.

754
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:32,368
I thought we had a deal.

755
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,834
When this is over,
I promise you,

756
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,901
I will help you rebuild
your investigation.

757
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:36,901
I give you my word.

758
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,634
I had your word.

759
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:58,701
What have you got?

760
00:36:58,768 --> 00:36:59,734
Nothing.

761
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:00,867
She's covered
her tracks.

762
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:01,867
There's no sign

763
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,768
of what she sold to Bierko.

764
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,200
Come with me.

765
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:12,167
Collette Stenger,
my name is Jack Bauer.

766
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,000
Who is Theo really?

767
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:15,501
German Intelligence.

768
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,234
Then he sold me for a price.

769
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,967
German and American Intelligence
don't work together often.

770
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:22,167
Where is Bierko?

771
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:27,167
The fact is, I actually
had feelings for Theo.

772
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,534
I never once suspected.

773
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:31,267
He was very good.

774
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,434
I always thought that there

775
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,100
were some things
that you cannot fake.

776
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,833
Bierko.

777
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:43,501
Tell them to leave.

778
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,200
Jack?

779
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,867
It's all right.

780
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:48,900
Curtis, have your men
move back.

781
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,867
Just give us a second.

782
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:53,234
Let's go.

783
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,567
Theo had a price.

784
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:02,401
What's yours?
I'm not for sale.

785
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:03,833
Everyone is for sale.

786
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,833
This isn't a game, lady.

787
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,967
We're running out of time.

788
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,301
You better tell me
what you want.

789
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,267
All right.

790
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:13,067
Full immunity.
No holdbacks.

791
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:15,768
Signed by your president
and transmitted to lawyers

792
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,534
in Zurich and Tripoli.

793
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:18,534
But I can't tell you
where Bierko is.

794
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,100
Why not?

795
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,267
Because he's already gone.

796
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,800
I met him at a safehouse,

797
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,933
but he was already on his way
to carry out the attack.

798
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,434
What were you selling him?
I don't know.

799
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:27,668
What do you mean,
you don't know?

800
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:28,933
I mean I don't know.

801
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,200
It was a schematic.

802
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,768
What kind of
a schematic?

803
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,668
I'm paid to broker
the information,

804
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,000
not dwell on the details.

805
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,434
I make it my firm policy.

806
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,501
You expect me to believe
that you acquired information

807
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,800
for a terrorist group and you
didn't know the specifics?

808
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,467
You can believe
whatever you want.

809
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,833
The fact is, I got the
schematics from a source

810
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,534
and they were
digitally encrypted.

811
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,200
That source can tell you
what they mean.

812
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:52,000
Give me immunity and
I'll give you my source.

813
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,867
Those are my terms.

814
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,167
You haven't offered us
very much.

815
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,401
I'll see what I can do.

816
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,967
( phone rings )
Buchanan.

817
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,200
Yeah, it's Jack.

818
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,900
She wants full immunity
signed by the president.

819
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,601
She claims that she doesn't know
where Bierko is.

820
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:19,267
That she just brokered a deal
for a set of schematics,

821
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,501
and then delivered them.

822
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,100
She doesn't know
what building they're for,

823
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,334
but she can provide us with
the source of the schematics.

824
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,734
She doesn't know
what she sold him?

825
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,467
She said it was
digitally encrypted.

826
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:29,134
Do you believe her?

827
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,234
She's an independent contractor.

828
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,367
In her line of work,
sometimes

829
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:33,800
what you don't know
will save your life.

830
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,200
Either way,

831
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,933
if she's telling the truth,
we don't have a lot of time.

832
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,933
She said Bierko already left
to set off his next attack.

833
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,634
Miles, call Mike Novick,
let's get this started.

834
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:43,933
Jack, this better work.

835
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And for the record,
I don't like it.

836
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,501
We've paid a steep price.

837
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,634
There'll be fallout
on the WET List.

838
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:50,833
No, there won't be.

839
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,334
The fallout will be from
German Intelligence.

840
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:54,701
I programmed the memory card
to self-destruct.

841
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,267
Why didn't you tell us this
before?

842
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,167
I told you, I was in the car
with Stoller.

843
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:02,833
Get back to me as soon as this
is done, we need to move fast.

844
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,634
I think it's clear.

845
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:09,367
CTU was hit,

846
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:11,134
but we're still doing our job.

847
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,601
I believe
that's an argument

848
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:14,267
to maintain our autonomy.

849
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,134
Well, I'll withhold
judgment on that.

850
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,833
We're giving a free pass
to a terrorist collaborator,

851
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,434
and I have yet to see
what we're getting from it.

852
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,867
( tires screeching )

853
00:41:28,134 --> 00:41:30,167
( panting )

854
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,401
Has the document been received
in Tripoli as well?

855
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:14,601
And it meets with
your approval?

856
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:15,900
So, there's no way

857
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,634
that they can fail
to live up to the terms?

858
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:22,768
Merci, Herve. Au revoir.

859
00:42:24,434 --> 00:42:25,900
The safehouse

860
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:30,334
is a manufacturing facility
at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.

861
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:32,067
As for the data
I sold to Bierko,

862
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,501
it's something that I
received from a contact

863
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:35,833
at the Department
of Defense.

864
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,800
What's his name?

865
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,267
Her name.

866
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:39,867
Audrey Raines.

867
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,634
You are lying to me.

868
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:48,000
She sold me the information, Mr.
Bauer.

869
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,534
Apparently she had a price.

870
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:54,668
Put her in the car.

1500
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
