1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,515
Just hear me out. You used up
the public's goodwill with Sherry.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,076
They don't want you involved
with someone else who's not trustworthy.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,839
You have got to respect
the people who voted for you.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,714
Her ex-husband had his own agenda.
It won't be hard to prove he's a liar.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,992
Anne, it's me, Ted. I'm up in my office.
Come up and I'll explain everything.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,078
I have some documents
that'll prove your innocence.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,510
- Kim, it's me. Are you alone?
- Chappelle ordered you back here.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,269
I'm not coming back until I find your father.
I found out where Salazar is.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,716
A town in northern Mexico, Las Nieves.
Jack's taking Ram Ãn there.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,037
You cannot go in there alone.
Hector's gonna have an army.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,958
Promise me you're not gonna
tell anyone you talked to me.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,832
Be careful.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,350
- What are you doing?
- Your brother tried to kill me on the plane.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,233
That is not what we talked about.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,752
- My brother, I'm so glad to see you.
- What's going on? I don't understand.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,678
I'll tell you in a minute. I promise.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,474
Good job, Jack.
Come, we have a lot of work to do.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,871
- Where's Chappelle?
- lnterrogation 820.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,189
Let's go.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,039
Talk to me.
Almeida, what are you doing here?

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,394
Get him out of the room.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,873
(beeps)

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,230
(beeping)

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,749
- He's in.
- What are you talking about? Who's in?

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,676
Jack.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,395
Gael and I have been working with Jack
to get him undercover with Salazar.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,080
- That signal means he's in.
- I don't understand.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,637
I'll explain everything.
Right now we gotta call the president.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,239
So you're telling me Bauer's been playing
a game with us all this time?

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,713
It's no game, Ryan.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,877
He's back under with the Salazars?
They trust him again?

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,036
- That's what we're counting on, yeah.
- I'm your boss. You should've come to me.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,874
You'll understand everything
once I've explained it to the president.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,874
After that, if you feel I've acted
inappropriately, do what you gotta do.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,117
I will. Count on it.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,389
- The president is coming on the line.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,640
- (woman) Go ahead.
- This is Tony Almeida, director of CTU.

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,070
- Mr Almeida.
- Thank you for taking my call, Mr President.

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,715
You're also on with my
chief of staff, Wayne Palmer.

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,796
I was told this is an urgent matter.

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,352
Yes, sir, it is. It's also fairly complex.
I'll try to keep it as clear and concise as I can.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,151
Go on.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,831
Everything that's happened today, from
the infected body to Salazar's prison break,

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,713
has been part of an elaborate sting operation.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,432
Sting operation?

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,838
Planned and executed by Jack Bauer,
Agent Gael Ortega and myself.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,472
Elaborate, Mr Almeida.

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,876
Jack Bauer wanted to fill you in
on the situation himself, sir.

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,390
Jack Bauer is a fugitive from the law.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,478
If you'll indulge me, there's a video file you
should see. It's on a designated CTU server.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,720
You can access the file with the pass code:
Delta-3-Delta-5-9.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,637
Mr President, the fact that
you are viewing this now

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,594
means that I have completed
the first phase of a secret operation.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,920
Contrary to what you've been told, the
Salazars are not in possession of the virus.

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,912
The idea that they are
is a lie which I promoted,

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,708
in order to achieve a more important goal.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,832
Please, sir, let me explain.

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,880
A month ago, I learned that
some Ukrainian scientists

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,792
were trying to sell a weaponised virus.

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
They were looking for a buyer
with cash and credibility.

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,555
I got their interest by suggesting
the Salazars as potential buyers.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,913
If I could get the Salazars to agree, CTU
would seize the virus as the sale took place.

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,676
Our goal was to remove
the virus stockpile from the marketplace,

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,238
because it is, without a doubt,
the most lethal threat that we have ever faced.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,598
But all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,599
The only way to gain their trust
was to break Ram Ãn Salazar out of prison.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,273
Mr President, I'm sorry for deceiving you,
but I assure you it was a benign deception,

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,359
and I assume complete responsibility
for my actions.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,439
If things went wrong, you would have been
exposed personally and politically.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,438
This was the only way
I could see to avoid that risk.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,880
But now it's time for you to know the truth.

72
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,396
I'm asking you to allow Almeida
to coordinate an interdiction with the military,

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,880
so we can take possession of this virus
and keep it from our enemies.

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,235
Thank you, Mr President.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,870
(Tony) Mr President.

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,476
Keeping me in the dark on
a matter of national security is inexcusable.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,880
- We were trying to protect you, sir.
- I know what you were trying to do.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,591
It was a mistake, and you and your colleagues
will take responsibility when this is over.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,280
- Yes, sir. I understand.
- Where's Bauer now?

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,475
In northern Mexico. He's setting up a meeting
between the Salazars and the Ukrainians.

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,670
When is this meeting to take place?

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,872
In the next few hours, sir. Mr President,

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,788
I'm requesting your permission
to activate the interdiction plan.

84
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,350
Under the circumstances,
I don't have a choice but to say yes.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,871
But even if this plan works flawlessly,
you haven't heard the last of it.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I don't like decisions
being taken out of my hands.

87
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,872
Some decisions you wanna
keep as far away from as you can.

88
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,795
Not this decision. It's too important.
Bauer had no right to keep me out of the loop.

89
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,555
I disagree.
Bauer protected you as he should have.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,638
When this is over,
you'll probably have to punish him,

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,356
but while you're punishing him, know this:
he did do the right thing.

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,675
Michelle.

93
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,475
We need an extended network
using protocol four. All right?

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,556
Thanks, hon.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,359
I'm not so sure this is gonna
work out well for you, Almeida.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,998
Maybe not, but right now I gotta help Jack.
I don't need you looking over my shoulder.

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,795
You work for me.
You don't give orders, you take them.

98
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,873
Yeah. Except the president put me
in charge of this particular operation.

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,878
Now, if you object, give him a call.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,792
I may be wrong, but I got the impression he's
not in the mood for any squabbling today.

101
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Ryan,

102
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,872
just let me do my job, all right?

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,116
I'll be watching.

104
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,633
Are you ready to listen, Ram Ãn?

105
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,198
All right.

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,479
Tell me how the man
who betrayed us is now our friend.

107
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,875
Bauer came to me with an opportunity.

108
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
- An opportunity?
- (Hector) Yes.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,510
To make more money
than we have ever dreamed of.

110
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,438
Bauer found out about
a virus coming on the market.

111
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,757
These men who have it,
they're from the Ukraine, scientists.

112
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,998
All they want to do
is to make their money and disappear.

113
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,594
How much are they asking?

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,551
A hundred million.

115
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,549
Al-Qaeda will pay us ten times as much.
North Koreans too. The buyers are lined up.

116
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,632
That's a billion dollars.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,719
- How do you know this virus is real?
- The Ukrainians gave us a demonstration.

118
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,035
Bauer delivered a body to Health Services.

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,994
He used it to scare the Americans
into letting you go.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,193
- The scientists, where are they now?
- They're not far from here.

121
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,277
I'm supposed to call their representative,
a man named Michael Amador, in the hour.

122
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,756
What's in it for you, Jack?

123
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,713
15 million dollars.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,038
We don't like each other, but it doesn't mean
we can't do business together.

125
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,511
I need your capital,
and you need my access to the virus.

126
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,077
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,668
And I am not that sure now.

128
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,994
My wife was killed because of my job.
My daughter's never been the same since.

129
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,995
This last year... Well, you know
what I went through to bring you in.

130
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,195
What did I get for it? A pat on the back.
In the end, a demotion. And a heroin habit.

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,678
I'm tired of putting my ass
on the line for nothing.

132
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,076
I'm done putting my ass
on the line for nothing.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,078
If you don't want to go through with it,

134
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,873
blow him away.

135
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,759
But just remember,
you're blowing away a billion dollars.

136
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,716
Ram Ãn, no!

137
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,631
- Are you crazy?
- You are crazy for trusting him.

138
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,716
- Give me the gun.
- No.

139
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,269
Who are you to refuse me?
I run our business, not you.

140
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,154
If not for me, me, you wouldn't even be here.

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,196
Like I said...

142
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,236
I have to call him within an hour.

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,069
These men are not gonna wait around.
There's too much at stake.

144
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,718
You can either shoot me or let me make
the call. But you better decide quickly.

145
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,399
Jack's transponder pinpoints him somewhere
east of Las Nieves, just south of the border.

146
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,193
Satellite photos show
that it's some sort of ranch or farm.

147
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,153
Our units will hold a perimeter of ten miles.

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,880
Communication is on a designated frequency.
Nobody moves unless they go through me.

149
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Chloe, I want you and Chase
to provide tactical assistance. Where is he?

150
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,031
We're not sure. Chappelle ordered
him back over an hour ago.

151
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,869
Let me know when he gets back here.
Let me make this perfectly clear.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,836
For the next few hours, all of our resources
are dedicated to helping Jack get this virus.

153
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,711
Any questions?

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,877
All right, let's get back to work.

155
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,236
Tony.

156
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,880
- I spoke to Chase.
- When?

157
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,190
About an hour ago.
He's not coming back to CTU.

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,392
- Chappelle gave him a direct order.
- He ignored it.

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,880
He still doesn't know what's going on.
None of us did.

160
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,749
- Chase still thinks my father was captured.
- And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.

161
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,873
Yes. He knows about Las Nieves. He's on
his way there now. Probably by plane.

162
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,469
- How did he find out about Las Nieves?
- He said he followed a lead.

163
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,880
Dammit, he'll blow Jack's cover
and we'll lose this virus.

164
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
- I know.
- Maybe I can get ahold of him.

165
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,075
Tony, you won't be able to reach him.

166
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,754
- Why not?
- He's gone dark.

167
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,879
(panting)

168
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,992
(keys in door)

169
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,476
Hector thought you might be hungry.

170
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,553
Look at you. You're pathetic.

171
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,155
You're still a junkie, aren't you?

172
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,073
It's the only real thing about you.

173
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,550
It makes me sick to think
that I ever believed you.

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,954
You said you'd take me away from here.
Remember?

175
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,878
Do you remember, Jack?

176
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,956
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

177
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,471
There was one small thing you forgot
to mention - you were a cop.

178
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,831
Even that wouldn't matter
if you'd meant what you said to me.

179
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,953
- I meant everything I ever said to you.
- Do you think I am stupid?

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,993
You were doing a job.
My compliments, you did it very well.

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,590
But you know the saddest thing, Jack?
You couldn't even be true to that.

182
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,876
You betrayed Hector and Ram Ãn, betrayed
me. And now you betray your own people.

183
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
There are times when I despise Hector,
but at least he's true to himself.

184
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,510
He knows who he is.
You? You're a man without a soul.

185
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,350
Does Hector know about us?

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,189
Do you think I'd be alive if he did?

187
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,880
You know where he is right now?

188
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,477
He's with Ram Ãn,
deciding whether you should live or die.

189
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,070
While you sit here shaking like a leaf.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,676
You need a fix, don't you?
There's plenty here, Jack.

191
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,873
Want me to get you a fix?
Is that what you want?

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,638
No.

193
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,518
Jack,

194
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,234
you were a man once.

195
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,035
What happened to you?

196
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,598
(groans)

197
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,880
- (Tony) I'm sending his photo to you now.
- (man) OK.

198
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,908
Miguel, he's acting on his own authority.
Tell Gutierrez that he's armed and dangerous.

199
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,158
- OK. Then I'll confirm with you.
- All right, good.

200
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,997
My contact in Mexican lntelligence says
he can get a man to Las Nieves in 20 minutes.

201
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,237
- Agent Raphael Gutierrez.
- Won't local police be quicker?

202
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,433
No. If we bring them in, we might as well
tell the Salazars that Chase is on his way.

203
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,597
- What about our Delta teams?
- lt'll take them over an hour.

204
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,395
We're analysing the map of Las Nieves.
There's only one landing strip.

205
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,715
He won't use it. A landing strip's too exposed,
especially if it's the only one.

206
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:17,234
Run a topographical overlay. Find the most
likely landing area besides the airfield.

207
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,316
Yes, David?

208
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,830
- Have you seen or heard from Anne?
- Not for some time. Why?

209
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,110
- I can't reach her.
- Is it your health?

210
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,552
No. I'm concerned about her.
She was pretty ripped up after the debate.

211
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
We're all pretty ripped up here, David.

212
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,199
This allegation by Anne's ex-husband
is no small bump in the road.

213
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,836
There may be no way to defend ourselves
against Keeler's accusation

214
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,309
that Anne was involved in something illegal.

215
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
You have to do better than that, Wayne.

216
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,196
You like to deal with things head-on,

217
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,517
but I think the best course of action
now is to be evasive.

218
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,519
If the press brings this up, make it clear
you won't answer any questions.

219
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,679
That you're gonna wait for all the facts
to come in, as should they.

220
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,473
You may be right, but I need you to find Anne.

221
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,354
The reporters are gonna be chasing her
and she's not up to this.

222
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,517
- I'll put Perry on it.
- Thank you.

223
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,551
Hello, Anne.

224
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,955
Thanks for coming.

225
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,198
I just wanted to have a chance
to apologise face to face for what I did.

226
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,470
I don't know what I was thinking.

227
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,319
Where are the letters, Ted?

228
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,796
Right here.

229
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,316
For God's sakes, Anne. It's not meant for you.

230
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,039
- For whom, then?
- Just take the letters and go.

231
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,833
Ted, you're not thinking about killing yours...

232
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,668
- No. It's for self-defence.
- Don't lie to me.

233
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,395
You got what you came for. So go.
You don't need to be here for this.

234
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,590
Ted.

235
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,190
At least talk to someone.
I know some good doctors.

236
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,393
Phoneys who are gonna talk me out of doing
what I should've done five years ago?

237
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,272
No, thank you.

238
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,469
I'm a failure, Anne.

239
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,639
Everything I touch goes bad.
That's just the way it is.

240
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,880
Don't shed any tears for me,
because I don't deserve it. Just go.

241
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,719
Don't come any closer.

242
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
- Let me call someone.
- No!

243
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,796
You're a great woman, Anne.
Much better than I ever deserved.

244
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,396
I'm sorry I let you down,
but just get the hell outta here.

245
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,358
I said go!

246
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,869
Ted.

247
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,396
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- No? How can it be?

248
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,636
Can we be 25 again?

249
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,314
What you did was wrong,

250
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,874
but you made it right.

251
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,678
And that means something.
That means you can start again.

252
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,880
People do it all the time, Ted.

253
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,871
Why not you?

254
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,750
You're really something.

255
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,592
If I gave you a few more minutes, you might
actually be able to talk me out of doing it.

256
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,271
Ted.

257
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,836
- (gunshot)
- No!

258
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,880
- The president can expect updates.
- (Wayne) When will you call?

259
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,519
- Every 15 minutes.
- I'll let him know.

260
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,637
All right. We'll be in touch.

261
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,876
(gasps)

262
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,748
You should be in the hospital.

263
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,948
I'm fine. What have you got?

264
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,270
Briefing package on Las Nieves.

265
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,349
Alternate landing sites
that Chase might use instead of the airstrip.

266
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,436
Thanks.

267
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,880
- Is there something wrong?
- I'm just worried about you, that's all.

268
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,394
Uh-huh.

269
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,436
What is it?

270
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,870
- It's not the time.
- Michelle.

271
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,675
What is it?

272
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,552
This whole thing that
you've been planning with Jack.

273
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,272
Look,

274
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,916
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. Jack planned it.
He wanted absolute secrecy and I agreed.

275
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,875
- You don't have to explain.
- No, I want to explain. Listen to me.

276
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,599
I trust you with my life.

277
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,710
But this job is what it is.

278
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,317
Jack said he came up with the plan
a month ago. Is that how long you've known?

279
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,789
Something like that. Yeah.

280
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,950
I just...

281
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,631
I had no idea that you were
hiding something from me.

282
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,875
But that's my problem.

283
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,030
I just got off the phone with CTU.

284
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,514
Bauer's near a place called Las Nieves.
Delta teams are scrambling now.

285
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,598
When does CTU expect to intercept the virus?

286
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,880
When Bauer gives them the signal. Almeida
says he'll update us every 15 minutes.

287
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,798
- Good.
- Wayne Palmer.

288
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,074
Yeah.

289
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,595
Yeah, hang on.

290
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,076
David, it's Anne. She says it's important.

291
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,995
- Hello, Anne.
- David.

292
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,351
It's Ted. He just committed suicide.

293
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,870
Oh, Anne. I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

294
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,880
Not really, no. I was, uh...

295
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,880
- I was with him when he did it.
- What were you doing there?

296
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,759
He asked to see me. He said he was sorry
and wanted to make things right.

297
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Did you call the police?

298
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,599
- Yes. They're here now.
- What can I do to help?

299
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,070
There's something
Ted wanted me to give you.

300
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,833
What's that?

301
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Letters exonerating me from any
connection to the falsified research data.

302
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,158
That's why I was here in the first place,
because he wanted to give them to me.

303
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,880
- And you have these letters?
- Yes, I do.

304
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,432
I'll be in the clear, and hopefully it puts
an end to the negative fallout for you as well.

305
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,676
That's secondary to your wellbeing.

306
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,875
I'll be OK. I'll come over
as soon as I'm done here.

307
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,911
Good. I'll see you then.

308
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,792
OK.

309
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,110
Is everything all right?

310
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,958
Ted Packard just committed suicide.
And he did it in front of Anne.

311
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,958
Oh, my God, David. I'm so sorry.

312
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,997
Listen, I don't mean to sound callous,
but what was she doing with him?

313
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,190
He wanted to give her letters
which apparently prove she's innocent.

314
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,873
- Are you serious?
- She's gonna bring them over in a little while.

315
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,158
I guess that's some sort of silver lining.

316
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,598
Listen, David, I know
I've been somewhat hard on Anne,

317
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,759
but she cleaned up her own mess,
and I respect that.

318
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,113
Maybe she's learning what it takes
to be in this game after all.

319
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,509
- (Ram Ãn) Why do we need Bauer?
- He made contact with the Ukrainians.

320
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,959
They trust him.

321
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,749
You trust him, too.
The man who put me in prison.

322
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,872
- And got you out again.
- He has an angle. Count on it.

323
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,232
Of course he does.
15 million dollars, it's a big angle.

324
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,632
You saw him. He's a shell.
There's nothing left.

325
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,833
No future, no family.
And a habit he can't beat.

326
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,314
He's not the same man who fooled us before.

327
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,880
So sure of that, huh?

328
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,714
We have people in the American agencies.
In their military, too.

329
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,593
Every one of them confirmed
the prison break was real.

330
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,757
Bauer is a fugitive from his own country.

331
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,873
If they hadn't wanted you alive,
they would have killed him. That's a fact.

332
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
So, if we go through with this,
what happens afterwards?

333
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,917
We just forget what Bauer did to us
and let him walk away?

334
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,759
Do you think I could forget what he did to us?

335
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,714
As soon as we have the virus, we kill him.

336
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,276
Now, that's the first thing
you've said that I like.

337
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,955
Bauer is clever, he'll expect it.

338
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,830
- What can he do? Alone, surrounded.
- Don't underestimate him.

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,872
It's me who's been underestimated, Ram Ãn.

340
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,996
But I will earn your respect,

341
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,033
when we make more money in one day
than we've made in both of our lifetimes.

342
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,110
But you don't have all night to decide.
This man Amador is waiting for Bauer's call.

343
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,039
- Bring Bauer in.
- (man over radio) Right away, Ram Ãn.

344
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,112
What have you decided, Ram Ãn?

345
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,879
I'm not sure yet.

346
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,150
I don't trust you, and I never will.

347
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:26,196
All I want right now is to spill your blood.
But I won't. Not yet, anyway.

348
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,196
Out of respect for my little brother,
I am willing to play this out a little longer.

349
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,198
So make your call.

350
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,869
Amador won't be at the number
he gave me for another 15 minutes.

351
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,911
We'll wait.

352
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,996
And you won't be sorry.

353
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,837
- Tony. It's Rafael from Las Nieves.
- Patch it over here.

354
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,189
- (Tony) Rafael?
- I'm at the landing area now.

355
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,757
- There's no sign of any incoming craft.
- What size team do you have?

356
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,031
- What team? It's just me.
- You gotta be kidding me.

357
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,876
This is a corrupt area. Salazar's got a lot
of influence. We don't know how far it goes.

358
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,394
Miguel wanted me to do this on my own.

359
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,035
You'll have your hands full.
Chase is one of our more capable agents.

360
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,390
All right. How do you want me to approach?

361
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,957
Don't surprise him. Make sure
he knows you're working with CTU.

362
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,480
Hang on, I hear something.

363
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,959
Yeah, this must be him.

364
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,833
It's a twin-engine prop on approach.

365
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,552
He's landing now.

366
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,876
- You have the photo?
- Yeah.

367
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,873
Make sure it's him. Be careful.
We'll keep this line open.

368
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,876
Good.

369
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,876
All right. I'm moving in.

370
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,230
Be careful. He's not expecting company.

371
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,276
Edmunds.

372
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,868
Edmunds. I'm here to help.

373
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,399
Edmunds.

374
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,238
Edmunds!

375
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,992
Edmunds.

376
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,431
Gutierrez, talk to me.

377
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,870
He's not here. The plane's empty.

378
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,956
He must have spotted you.

379
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,878
Stand by. I'll call you back.

380
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,235
Yeah, all right.

381
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,675
Edmunds.

382
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,908
Edmunds.

383
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,673
Edmunds.

384
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,678
Wait. Wait, wait! Take it easy.

385
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,474
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Rafael Gutierrez.

386
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,956
Mexican lntelligence.
Check my pocket, my left pocket.

387
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,074
Get on your knees. Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

388
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,880
- How do you know my name?
- Your boss sent me. Tony Almeida, CTU.

389
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,429
His access code is 3-Tango-6-6-4.

390
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,871
Get up.

391
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,558
- What does he want?
- He wants you to call him.

392
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,949
I've got a phone right here. He says it's
a matter of life or death about Jack Bauer.

393
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,435
Gimme the phone.

394
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,757
Thank you.

395
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,598
(phone rings)

396
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,675
Almeida.

397
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,108
- Edmunds.
- Chase...

398
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,199
- If you're trying to get me to come back...
- (gunshot)

399
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,992
Chase!

400
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,516
(gunshots)

401
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,678
Chase, what's going on?
Chase, can you hear me?

402
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,635
- Tony, are you there?
- What's going on?

403
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,036
The guy you sent is dead.
A sniper took him out.

404
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,035
I'm being pursued.

405
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,518
Chase!

406
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,874
(Tony over radio) Chase!

407
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,835
(Tony) Chase, can you hear me? Chase!

408
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,435
- Doctor Packard.
- I'm here to see the president.

409
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,835
Follow me, ma'am.

410
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,670
Come.

411
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,794
Anne.

412
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,039
- How are you holding up?
- I'm OK.

413
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,960
Are those the letters?

414
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,716
This is good, David. This is very good.
This clears up everything.

415
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,478
Yes. Yes, it does.

416
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,474
Once authenticated,
we'll take 'em to the press.

417
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,637
You'll be off the hook and
Keeler should be hoisted up on it.

418
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,149
Yeah. I thought you'd be pleased.

419
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,476
Anne, listen.

420
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,990
I'm sorry about Ted. I really am.

421
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:39,596
And if there's anything that I can do,
anything at all, please just... Iet me know.

422
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,110
Thank you.

423
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,116
Excuse me.

424
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,709
Anne?

425
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,791
I'm all right, David. I'm gonna be all right,
but... something came out of this,

426
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
and it was suddenly so clear to me.

427
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,711
What was clear?

428
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,673
I don't know how to say this,
except to just say it.

429
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,360
I think we need to end things.

430
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,154
After what's just happened,
after what's been happening all day,

431
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,870
- I can understand why you'd want time apart.
- David, it's not about time apart.

432
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,277
- Anne, don't...
- It's true, this day has been awful,

433
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,474
but it just confirmed something
that I've been feeling for a while.

434
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,474
I can't live in your world.

435
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,870
The things that people do to each other,
the things they have to do in order to survive,

436
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,355
I just... I can't...

437
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,311
That's exactly why I need you.

438
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,319
You need someone
who can stand beside you.

439
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,830
Not someone who stands back and watches,

440
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,716
and maybe passes judgement
on things she doesn't really understand.

441
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,675
I'm sorry.

442
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,351
You are the finest man I have ever known.

443
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,711
And Wayne, God bless him, he's just
what you need and I'm so glad you have him,

444
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,798
but it's not for me.

445
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,396
Goodbye, David.

446
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,471
Anne.

447
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,236
(ringing tone)

448
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,199
- Hello?
- Michael. Jack Bauer. Can you hear me?

449
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,392
I can hear you, Jack.
I'm glad you arrived safely.

450
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,511
Where are you?

451
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,315
- You know I can't tell you that.
- OK. Then where do you wanna meet?

452
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,880
I'll call you back.
Give me the number you're calling from.

453
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,714
OK. I'm on a satellite phone. One second.

454
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,316
The number's 34221.

455
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,476
- You'll hear from me soon.
- OK. Good.

456
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,597
- Have your money prepared.
- Don't worry about that.

457
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,472
(door opens)

458
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,509
He came in by plane, just south of the town.
He was with a federal that they killed.

459
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,880
- I know this man. He's Bauer's partner.
- (Hector) Was he with anyone else?

460
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,838
- No, just the federal.
- What are you doing here?

461
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,635
Shut up! If he is here, others will
be here soon. We gotta get outta here.

462
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,952
Tom Às, make sure everything is ready.
We're moving out of here now.

463
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,880
- Bauer has been lying to us all along.
- I had no idea he was coming.

464
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,429
- You've been playing us for fools.
- You're making a mistake.

465
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,953
Hector, please. We can still do this deal. Don't
let your brother piss away a billion dollars.

466
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,955
- What if he's telling the truth?
- You keep hearing what you want to hear.

467
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,477
- This is an act. It's all been an act.
- How do you know?

468
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,955
Ram Ãn, I swear to you, I'm not lying.

469
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,555
Please, let's do this deal.

470
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,312
- (Chase) What the hell's going on, Jack?
- Shut up. You shouldn't have followed me.

471
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,910
- You're with them?
- Yes, I'm with them.

472
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,989
- You say he's not with you?
- Yes, that's right.

473
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,078
Then kill him. Kill your partner.

474
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,360
You want me to kill him? Fine, I'll kill him.

475
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,591
But we would be smarter to use him
for information or as a hostage.

476
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,713
No more clever talk.
You keep saying you are on our side.

477
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,070
Now prove it, once and for all.

478
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,554
Fine.

479
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,670
You should never have come down here,
Chase. You should have listened to me.

480
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,873
Very good, Jack.

481
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,675
We'll take him with us. Bauer is right.

482
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,750
Let's find out what he knows. Break him
down, see if anyone came here with him.

483
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,789
We'll go to a safe house
and we'll wait for Amador's call.

484
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,880
- Jack?
- Shut up, Chase.

485
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,872
You wanna get through this, just shut up!

486
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,876
Dammit.
