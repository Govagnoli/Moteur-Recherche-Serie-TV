1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,556
Everything that's happened today, from
the infected body to Salazar's prison break,

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,910
has been part of an elaborate sting operation.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,716
Some Ukrainian scientists were trying to sell
a weaponised virus on the open market.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,070
I suggested the Salazars as potential buyers.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,112
Our goal was to remove
the virus stockpile from the marketplace.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,074
But all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,634
T ell me how the man who betrayed us
is now our friend.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,073
Bauer came to me with an opportunity to
make more money than we ever dreamed of.

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,311
- What's in it for you, Jack?
- 15 million dollars.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,238
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,509
You said you'd take me away from here.
Do you remember, Jack?

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,675
Yes, I remember.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,351
There was one small thing
you forgot to mention - you were a cop.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,074
Even that wouldn't matter
if you'd meant what you said to me.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,760
I meant everything I ever said to you.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,836
For the next few hours, all of our resources
are dedicated to helping Jack get this virus.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,997
Tony, I spoke to Chase.
He's not coming back to CTU.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,830
- He still thinks my father was captured.
- And he thinks he's going in to rescue Jack.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,190
Dammit, he'll blow Jack's cover
and we'll lose this virus.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,874
I know this man. He's Bauer's partner.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,709
- What the hell's going on, Jack?
- Shut up. You shouldn't have followed me.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,115
- You're with them?
- Yes, I'm with them.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,599
- Jack?
- Shut up, Chase.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,518
You wanna get through this, just shut up!

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,432
- The transponder on Jack's watch went dead.
- Dammit!

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,189
By the time the assault teams are in position,
we'll have no idea where he is.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,674
The president will make a brief statement.
There will be no questions at this time.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,754
My fellow Americans, good evening.

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,190
A few hours ago
I had to terminate a presidential debate

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,552
in order to handle what was at the time
a national security threat.

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,593
I can't reveal to you at this time
the details surrounding the situation.

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,837
Those will be forthcoming
in the next few hours.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,112
Let me assure you that the danger
that existed a few hours ago has passed.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,631
America is safe.

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,194
The American people are safe.

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,275
I apologise to my opponent, Senator Keeler,

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,349
and to the millions of you expecting
to see the two of us engage in the issues.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,311
The debate will be rescheduled.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,353
I'd like to thank you all for your patience
and understanding. Good night.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,390
Mr President...

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,880
There are rumours that this crisis was
manufactured to protect Dr Anne Packard.

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
How do you respond to that, sir?

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,553
Those allegations were false.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,592
Senator Keeler's charges were unfounded
and we have proof.

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,871
Proof that comes directly
from Anne Packard's ex-husband.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,233
In fact, in the next few weeks, Senator Keeler
will have his own explaining to do.

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Anne Packard
is an individual of the utmost integrity.

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,190
- She didn't deserve this.
- Mr President...

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,757
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That's it. No more questions.

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,192
Bauer's with the Salazar brothers in Mexico.
His transponder signal stopped working.

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,669
We're doing all we can to re-establish contact.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,519
Tell the Delta units to hold their position.

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,517
All right, thanks.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,877
- Let's try an amplification module.
- I cycled through it three times.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,799
- It's not a weak signal, there's no signal.
- What do we think happened here?

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,189
Jack's cover might have been blown.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,756
There's no indication his transponder's
been found or his cover blown.

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,316
Maybe he can't get a signal
or the transponder's broken.

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Damage might have knocked it
to another frequency.

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,598
- Let's run a scan.
- I am.

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,632
I'm a third of the way through the spectrum,
but so far no luck.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,320
All right, I'll get you some help.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,279
- Kim?
- Yes, Tony?

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,516
- Do you know how to do a frequency scan?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,915
We want to pick up
your father's transponder signal.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,390
Michelle's begun it. Coordinate with her.

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,880
- What's the signature?
- I already told you, 30 over five.

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
You didn't tell me.

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Look, Kim, I know this is hard on you,
your father's life being at stake.

70
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,316
- But I need you to focus, OK?
- Sorry.

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,395
All right, good. Call me if anything changes.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,474
Why are we stopping?

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,880
Tom Às says there's no sign
of anyone following.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,032
Until we know more,
we're better off staying here.

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,949
Could he have come here on his own,
without backup?

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,999
Maybe he came by himself to rescue you.

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,554
How sad.

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
Does it bother you that your partner's
going to die trying to save you?

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,871
It breaks me up.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
This man Amador should have called
to set up the meeting.

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
He's gonna call.
Make sure you've got your money ready.

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,792
- The money's ready.
- (phone rings)

83
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,835
- Yeah?
- It's Amador.

84
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,711
- We're ready.
- Where?

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,877
Put Bauer on the phone.
I only deal with him.

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,871
- This is Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,708
Five kilometres north of town,
a trail splits off the road into the woods.

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,719
- Take it for two kilometres, 15 minutes.
- Got it.

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,559
The meeting's north of here. 15 minutes.

90
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,878
Hey, wait. The phone.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,637
- What if he calls back?
- I'll take a message.

92
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
Look at you, Jack. You are a mess.

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,115
- We gotta get you straight.
- I'm not gonna fix.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,516
Take them. You'll feel better.

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,072
I need to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,871
They're in the back.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,880
- I want you to get some sleep.
- I'm not tired.

98
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,996
I'll wake you when it's time to leave.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,872
- Where's Hector?
- He's busy.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,880
You'll see him tomorrow morning.

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,678
Go to sleep.

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,637
I love you.

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,637
(door opens)

104
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,711
Claudia, stay down, stay down.

105
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,832
I need you to listen to me.

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,997
Hector and Ram Ãn are trying to buy a virus
to use as a weapon.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,838
Millions of people could die.

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,431
I've set up this deal so my government
can destroy the virus. Do you understand?

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,233
- You're still with CTU?
- Yes, I'm still with CTU.

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,073
But you broke Ram Ãn out of prison.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,873
So I could gain his trust,
to make the deal happen.

112
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,793
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

113
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
You betrayed us once.
Now you'll betray us again?

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,793
- No, them, not you.
- I was a fool to believe any of it.

115
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,190
"I'm going to protect you,
get your family somewhere safe." All lies.

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,590
I wanted to come back for you earlier.

117
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,870
When I heard about this virus,
I had to deal with it.

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,829
Millions of lives are at stake.
You have to understand that.

119
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,589
But I can get you out now.
You, Sergio and your father.

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,873
- How?
- American soldiers are not far from here.

121
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,198
They're waiting for my signal. I can't reach
them because my transmitter's destroyed.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,513
Claudia, I have nothing to gain
from telling you this if it's not the truth.

123
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,870
One word from you and I'm a dead man.

124
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,272
What do you want me to do?

125
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,880
First I need a cellphone.
I need to let CTU know where I am.

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,635
Then I need you to do whatever you can
to help my partner Chase. Keep him alive.

127
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,230
- When Hector realises, he's gonna kill me.
- You'll be gone by then.

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,869
Chase can help you get out. I promise.

129
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,991
But if I can't contact CTU, this is all
for nothing. You've gotta get me that phone.

130
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,715
- Please.
- I'll do what I can.

131
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,713
I have to go.
They're waiting for me.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,315
If you're lying to me again, I'll kill you myself.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,070
Help Chase.

134
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,838
Jack Bauer broke Ram Ãn out of prison.

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,997
Your people are sending forces
to bring them back.

136
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,997
When are they coming?

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,951
When?

138
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,868
And where?

139
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,189
Get Ram Ãn.

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,311
Aargh!

141
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,873
He was your partner.
You must be feeling something.

142
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,353
I got a 15-million-dollar payday
when this deal goes down. He's on his own.

143
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,836
Is he as tough as you?

144
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,677
He still believes in the lie.

145
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,880
- What lie?
- That what he's doing has purpose.

146
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,029
(phone rings)

147
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,116
Belief is a beautiful thing.

148
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
Hello.

149
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,711
(speaks Spanish)

150
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,955
- Where are you going?
- Please.

151
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,878
- No, don't leave.
- No.

152
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,073
- Mi amor.
- Sit down for a minute.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,230
Ram Ãn is waiting, OK?

154
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,351
All right. All right.

155
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,348
(Ram Ãn speaking Spanish)

156
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,475
Claudia.

157
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,439
- I left my phone inside.
- I'll get it.

158
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,879
(Hector) Let's go.

159
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,874
(coughs)

160
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,395
(shouting)

161
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,868
- Chloe, have you heard from Chase?
- No.

162
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,880
Are there alternate frequencies
he might use to contact you?

163
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Yeah, and they're on autoscan.
He hasn't checked in.

164
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,348
I know you're busy.
Maybe we can reach him by satellite.

165
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,358
Satellite. I didn't think of that(!)
I'll get right on that.

166
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,189
You don't have to be sarcastic with me.
This is someone I care about.

167
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,108
Get a grip.

168
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,071
I have to update the president.

169
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,998
I don't wanna tell him
we're still in the same place - nowhere.

170
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,398
I don't want excuses.
Just get me the answer, all right?

171
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,353
- I need to finalise the com file.
- It should have been done.

172
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,953
I need the format code.
You said you'd download it.

173
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,358
- Delta-733-Golf.
- That's the code from the previous file.

174
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,953
Delta-723-Bravo.

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,030
- Thank you.
- All right.

176
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,632
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

177
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,390
Eight minutes shot to hell on an invalid code.

178
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,438
Access granted.

179
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:48,511
That could have been a disaster. Without
those files, we can't track the rescue teams.

180
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,072
- (knock at door)
- Come.

181
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,871
Bad news. CTU lost track of Jack Bauer.

182
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,876
- Is he in trouble?
- We don't know.

183
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,912
- Does he have the virus yet?
- We don't know that either.

184
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,156
- (knock at door)
- Come.

185
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,428
Mr President,
I have Alan Milliken on the line for you.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,991
I'll take it.

187
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,628
- Alan?
- David.

188
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,917
- You angry with me?
- Of course I'm not angry with you.

189
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,476
Your first time in LA in three years
and you don't even call.

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,878
- It's been a bad day, Alan.
- I know. I've been watching the news.

191
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,236
I don't want to add to your burdens,
but I'd like to come by and see you.

192
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,718
- See me?
- David, I wouldn't ask if it weren't important.

193
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,556
I know you're busy. After all,
you are the President of the United States.

194
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,875
In large part, thanks to you.

195
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,872
I'll come to you, Alan.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

196
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,309
Thank you, David. And one more thing.

197
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,349
As a personal favour to me,

198
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,436
I'm asking you not to bring Wayne.

199
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,398
- May I ask why?
- It's something I'd rather explain in person.

200
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,157
All right.

201
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,716
(sighs)

202
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,510
Where are we?

203
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,236
So far we've been unable to pick up Jack
on any of our imagery.

204
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,118
How long we been out of contact?

205
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,313
His tracking beacon went dead
27 minutes ago.

206
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,477
- Last known location?
- Here.

207
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
He can't be much farther
than 30 miles in any direction.

208
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,155
- Unless he was choppered out.
- No way. Air Tactical's watching the skies.

209
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,235
Where's Bauer?

210
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,869
We don't know yet.

211
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,558
That's great.

212
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,595
This entire operation, which hinges on Jack
being on site when they deliver the virus,

213
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,757
is going down the tubes
because we don't know where he is.

214
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,953
- How does that happen?
- Ryan, you want to chew us out, do it later.

215
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,197
- We're trying to get this back on track.
- I will.

216
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
You better find Bauer
and make this thing work.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,912
Otherwise, the two of you and Jack,
assuming he's still alive,

218
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,349
are gonna take the fall for everything today.

219
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,998
From the prison riot to Salazar's escape
and every dead body in between.

220
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,995
So what happens
if Jack goes to this meeting without backup?

221
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,150
The Salazars get the virus.

222
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,351
What happens from there?

223
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,319
I don't know.

224
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,316
Feeling better?

225
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,158
I'm fine.

226
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,388
Amador.

227
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,475
Hello, Jack. So these must be the buyers
you're representing.

228
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,353
This is Hector and Ram Ãn Salazar.

229
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,671
There's 100 million dollars in escrow
accounts in Geneva and Hong Kong.

230
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,394
We'll give instructions
to have the money transferred

231
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,353
when we have confirmation
that the virus has been delivered.

232
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,995
There's been a complication.
Another buyer's interested in the virus.

233
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,554
- What? We have a deal.
- What's going on, Jack?

234
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,352
I had nothing to do with it.

235
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,836
This is a new development
that's surfaced in the last few hours.

236
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,075
We'll auction the virus to the highest bidder.

237
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,077
- You son of a bitch!
- No!

238
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,149
Mr Salazar,
I merely represent the wishes of my client.

239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,358
- May we have a moment?
- Of course.

240
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,998
Hector, this does not need to be a problem.

241
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,270
- It's a huge problem.
- Think it through.

242
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,311
Add 50 million dollars to this price tag

243
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,432
and you're still looking
at over an 800-million-dollar profit.

244
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,597
You said you could move the virus
for a billion dollars, right?

245
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,598
- Something like that.
- You've come this far. Don't stop.

246
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,278
Let it play out.

247
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,717
The other buyer's here.

248
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,474
You know her?

249
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,593
What the hell is he doing here?

250
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,314
- That man is a federal agent.
- I know who he is, Nina.

251
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,795
- Everything's fine.
- It's not. He's setting us up.

252
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,075
You have to kill him. Kill him!

253
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,879
The first man who fires gets cut down.
That's a promise.

254
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,196
- Why is he here?
- He represents a buyer, Nina, just like you.

255
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,880
No, he doesn't. Believe me, I know him.

256
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,394
Whatever's he's told you, he's lying.

257
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,672
I don't work for CTU any more, Nina.
I work for myself.

258
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,872
- I'm out of here.
- Nina, please.

259
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,350
Let her go and honour the original agreement.

260
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,313
Nina, I don't think
your client's gonna be too happy

261
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,432
if you walk out
and let the virus go to another buyer.

262
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,790
We gotta close this deal.

263
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,156
We have a wide perimeter
and we're monitoring every frequency.

264
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,550
There's no law or military
within 25 kilometres.

265
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,237
You know how I work.

266
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,237
This area's completely secure.

267
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,872
If I had the slightest doubt, I wouldn't be here.

268
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,880
I suggest we all take a few minutes
to calm ourselves.

269
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,317
And I'll explain the ground rules
and we'll proceed with the bids.

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,317
Agreed?

271
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,357
Agreed.

272
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,470
- (Nina) Fine.
- Good.

273
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,352
- David.
- Alan, it's good to see you.

274
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,473
- Thanks for finding the time to fit me in.
- You've always made time for me, Alan.

275
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,875
Even when there was
no obvious reason to do so.

276
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,912
Your potential was always obvious, David.

277
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,476
- How are you doing?
- I could use a few new body parts.

278
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,558
- But besides that...
- You look well.

279
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,714
I know you're wondering what could be
so important that I'd ask you here.

280
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,434
So I'll be brief and I'll be blunt.

281
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,397
I want your brother off the team.

282
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,829
I don't understand.
You were supportive of Wayne.

283
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,758
I was. I'm not any more.

284
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,638
What's this all about, Alan?

285
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,755
- Yes, sir?
- Tell my wife to come in here.

286
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,757
Right away, sir.

287
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,557
- Julia.
- Mr President.

288
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,949
David is wondering
why I want him to fire Wayne.

289
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
And I thought you should explain.

290
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,354
As you know,
I've known Wayne for some time.

291
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,876
Three years ago,
when he was president of Alan's company,

292
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,356
we began to spend
quite a bit of time together.

293
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,391
Get to it, Julia.

294
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,438
Wayne and I became involved.

295
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,075
They had an affair
while I was recuperating from the stroke.

296
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,871
That's how your brother thanked me.

297
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,600
Go on.

298
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,556
We saw each other for a year, before
you asked him to join your administration.

299
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,074
- Then we broke it off.
- Hold on.

300
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,117
- If you knew, why didn't you say something?
- I didn't.

301
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,874
I just found out recently.

302
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,791
Did you know, David?
Did you keep it from me too?

303
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Of course not.

304
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,394
- I can hardly even believe it's true.
- It's true.

305
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,911
- I've told you how sorry I am.
- You can go.

306
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,750
I waited for you to come to Los Angeles
so I could do this face to face.

307
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,714
I gave your brother my company
and he took my wife.

308
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,919
Now I'm taking away his job.

309
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,031
Wayne is my chief of staff, my closest friend.

310
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,598
- I trust him.
- I don't. Neither should you. He's dishonest.

311
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,996
I think you'll agree, David,

312
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,513
that you wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

313
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,839
I've never asked you for anything in return,
but I'm asking you now.

314
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,836
Fire Wayne.

315
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,118
I'm sorry, Alan, I can't do that.

316
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,838
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.

317
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,478
You know me well enough
not to be surprised by repercussions.

318
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,955
I hope you're not threatening me.

319
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,079
I don't make threats, David.
I just tell it like it is.

320
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,038
You let me know if you change your mind.

321
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,878
Have them open up the field search
to these coordinates. Tell them it's priority.

322
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,992
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,
but can I see you for a minute?

323
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,838
Do you have enough to go on?

324
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,599
I'll let you know
if the satellite guys give me trouble.

325
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,555
- What is it?
- It's actually about Tony.

326
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,878
Look, I don't know if he's...

327
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,071
You don't know if he's what?

328
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,189
I don't know if he's well enough to do his job.

329
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,949
He was shot a few hours ago.
He's not gonna be working at full capacity.

330
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,878
I know,
but what if he misses something important?

331
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,639
- I mean, he's running things.
- What happened?

332
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,118
He asked me to finalise the com files,
but he forgot to give me the format codes.

333
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,074
And he chewed me out for forgetting
something he thought he told me,

334
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
except he never told me.

335
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,831
He's under a lot of stress. We all are.

336
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,836
That's my point.

337
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,831
Michelle, you're his wife,
but you're also second in command.

338
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,713
If Tony can't do the job,
somebody has to tell Chappelle,

339
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,752
and I think that someone should be you.

340
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,997
- What are you doing?
- Taking a rest.

341
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,868
There's oil under Hector's truck.
It needs to be fixed before Hector gets back.

342
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,757
Now!

343
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,635
OK, I'll check it out.

344
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,796
(grunts)

345
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,879
Here. I have a message from Jack.
Can you hear me?

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,913
Things aren't what they seem.
Jack isn't really with Ram Ãn and Hector.

347
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,197
Everything he's done
has been to earn their trust.

348
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,880
The virus they're going to buy, Jack is going
to take it from them. Do you understand?

349
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,110
There are soldiers from your country nearby.

350
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,793
- They'll come when Jack calls for them.
- Claudia?

351
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,872
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

352
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,880
- Then help me.
- I can't now. There are too many men around.

353
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,873
Don't give up. I'll figure out a way, all right?

354
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,474
Each party will make one final bid in writing.

355
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,990
Amador wants to start
in the next ten minutes.

356
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,998
You have to come up with a number.

357
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,880
We are offering 100. She must have
made him an offer to make this worthwhile.

358
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,395
- Say another 50.
- So we go 175.

359
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,870
More. If we do this, we do it to win.

360
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,998
At least 200.

361
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,071
Make the calls.

362
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,876
Who is she?

363
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,880
- I told you, she worked for me at CTU.
- No.

364
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,917
There's more between you and this woman.

365
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,869
She killed my wife.

366
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,993
Is this going to be a problem, Jack?

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,877
No.

368
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,877
No problem.

369
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,791
- Where are we going?
- We'll be together.

370
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
We're together now.
Is Hector coming?

371
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,553
- Sergio, just be ready to leave.
- What about Hector...

372
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,237
Sergio, forget about Hector!
Just do what I'm telling you!

373
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,270
What are you going to do?

374
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,949
Jack said if I help his partner
he'll get us out of here, Papa.

375
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,993
These people - Ram Ãn, Hector, Jack Bauer -
you can't trust any of them.

376
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,351
Jack's not like Ram Ãn and Hector.

377
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,638
Papa, please,
this is our chance to get out of here.

378
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,509
Then go.

379
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,872
No.

380
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,877
No, we're all going.

381
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,309
No, I'm not going without you.

382
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,918
What about Landsat Alpha-39?

383
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,156
Yeah. That's about it, right? Thanks.

384
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,149
I checked the NSA logs. There's no satellites
in the area we think Jack's in.

385
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,317
I'll check the flight paths just in case.

386
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,159
Just in case what? I just checked it.

387
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,516
There have been other mistakes today, Tony.

388
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,876
Mistakes? That you think I made?

389
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,514
Sweetheart,
you should still be in the hospital.

390
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,074
- You should step down.
- I'm fine.

391
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,998
- After what you've been through...
- I just said I'm fine.

392
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,509
End of discussion, please.

393
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,990
Tony, I've got something. NSA has
a satellite we may be able to reposition.

394
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,350
We just have to ask for access.

395
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,990
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

396
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,349
(man)..also I'd like to redo that email

397
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,029
and determine how best to use
these resources for this compressed divert.

398
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,277
As for the information packets,
they have online synoptic...

399
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,153
- Y es?
- I need to talk to you, Ryan.

400
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,032
- I think it's best...
- Hold on.

401
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,911
I don 't think T ony should be here.

402
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,315
My understanding is
he's not in imminent danger.

403
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,271
No, it's not that.

404
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,870
I've had reports he's been forgetful.
Missing things.

405
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,233
- Like what?
- Key information. Format codes.

406
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,351
Things that are causing delays.

407
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,715
On any other day I wouldn't be worried about
this, but I'm not sure if he's up to it today.

408
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,192
If I pull him now, that sets us back too.
No one can replace what he does.

409
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,232
He, Gael and Jack
have been working this from the beginning.

410
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,716
- If you think his mistakes are significant...
- I do.

411
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,639
Or else I wouldn't be bringing this to you.

412
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,271
All right. Just let me wrap up this call
and I'll get into it.

413
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,277
Thank you.

414
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,112
- You need to make it happen.
- We're working on it, sir.

415
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,832
All right. Thanks.

416
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,235
I just got back from seeing Alan.

417
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,555
- What did he want?
- I think you know.

418
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,273
- Know what, David?
- He wants me to fire you.

419
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,552
What the hell were you thinking,
carrying on an affair with a married woman?

420
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,275
- The wife of my biggest supporter.
- Listen, I am sorry.

421
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,790
- But it was a mistake and I corrected it.
- Not in Alan's mind.

422
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,753
For him, this is fresh.

423
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,316
He just found out
and he wants to make you pay.

424
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,515
We both know you can't afford
to make an enemy out of Alan.

425
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,428
He wields too much power, so I'll resign.

426
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,519
You'll leave only if I decide
it's the right thing to do, not Alan Milliken.

427
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,830
David, Alan is a very dirty fighter, trust me.

428
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,076
Sure you want to get down
in the gutter with him?

429
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,668
You haven't left me much choice, have you?

430
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,834
- You want to see me, Ryan?
- Yeah.

431
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,589
What's going on?

432
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,236
I asked you here because your competency
has been brought into question.

433
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,396
By whom?

434
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,551
By me.

435
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,353
- An employee had some concerns...
- An employee?

436
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,357
Kim Bauer.

437
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,118
I felt I needed to address them.

438
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,073
With Ryan? You didn't come to me first?

439
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,236
- I tried to talk to you.
- That's enough.

440
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,239
The point is, Ryan, that they're wrong.
I am fit for duty, completely.

441
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,116
All right. When you entered the room,
the monitor was on.

442
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,117
Tell me what it showed.

443
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,990
On the left side
was a C-TAN schematic of the country,

444
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,591
indicating an ongoing investigation
in Florida, New York and Montana.

445
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,349
On the right side was an all-clear report
from the Austin branch.

446
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,877
That's correct. But it still doesn't ease
my mind considering the slips you made.

447
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,875
- What slips?
- Michelle?

448
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,638
You thought you gave Kim the signature
on the frequency scans. You didn't.

449
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,791
Not verbally, no.

450
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,872
I put them on her in-screen
15 minutes before I talked to her.

451
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,712
Anything else?

452
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,312
She said you didn't load the format codes
onto the grid in time.

453
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,631
No, I didn't load the format codes
onto her grid.

454
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,875
I put them in the shared volume, on time.
Check it.

455
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,311
It's there.

456
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,555
All right. I'm sorry, Tony.

457
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,756
- We're done here.
- Good.

458
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,160
You've wasted time we don't have.

459
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,631
Are you ready with your bids?

460
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,478
- Yes.
- Yes.

461
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,397
Let me see them.

462
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,273
The banks will verify
the presence of these funds?

463
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,714
Yes, that is correct.

464
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,234
The bank will verify those as well.

465
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,473
Your bid is 225 million dollars.

466
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,993
Hers is 240.

467
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,475
Nina, you win.

468
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,834
You are a dead man.

469
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,997
My people will escort you out.

470
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,270
The transfer will take place in two hours.

471
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,519
You said would deliver the virus
and you didn't.

472
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,511
Not now, Hector. Come on.

473
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,871
I'll be contacting you with the details.

474
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,880
Excellent. We'll be waiting for your call.

475
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,871
Let's go.

476
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,880
You can't let Nina Myers just walk away.
Put a man on her.

477
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,314
- Shut up.
- Ram Ãn, listen to me.

478
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,512
If Nina gets away she'll disappear.
You'll never find her again.

479
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,313
You had your chance, Jack.

480
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,792
All right. This is good enough.

481
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,519
- Ram Ãn, please. You're making a mistake.
- Get out.

482
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,679
- Look, I can explain. I didn't know that...
- Get out!

483
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,996
You're of no use to us any more! You failed!

484
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,951
Hector, don't do this!

485
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,876
Ram Ãn, think this through.

486
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,430
What about your buyers around the world
that you promised the virus to?

487
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,111
They'll know you were double-crossed and
did nothing about it. What will you tell them?

488
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,908
"I'm sorry,
we'll try and get it right next time?"

489
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,158
The Salazar name will be a joke.
You can't let that happen.

490
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,880
Come on!

491
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,829
Five hours ago you were in prison.
Now you're free because I broke you out!

492
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,916
Then I brought you the deal of a lifetime.

493
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,474
What do I have to do
to prove to you I'm on your side?

494
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,038
This deal can still happen.
We can get the virus.

495
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,879
- How do you get the virus?
- I told you.

496
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,514
- The woman, Nina.
- The woman? She's the problem.

497
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,428
- She outbid us.
- I know her. I trained her. I can get to her.

498
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,869
- You don't even know how to find her!
- I'll find her!

499
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,434
Please, Ram Ãn. You can't lose here.

500
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,831
If I fail, you get to kill me. Fine.

501
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,716
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track. We'll all get paid!

502
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,879
Please.

503
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,471
Hector, let's play this out a little longer.

504
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,110
The man has more lives than a cat.
