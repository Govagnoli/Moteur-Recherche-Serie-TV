3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,598
Mr. Kanin, Ken Dellao, CNB.

4
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:18,164
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information.

5
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:20,102
I'm gonna be reporting

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,642
in this evening's broadcast

7
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,773
that a rogue ex-federal agent
named Jack Bauer

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,317
is the prime suspect
in the murder of Ryan Burnett.

9
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:30,488
You leaked the story of Burnett's murder
and my involvement to the press.

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,283
So another one of your errors
in judgment bites you on the ass.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,826
You've gone too far this time.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,245
<i>It's Jack.
Don't hang up the phone, please.</i>

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,675
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

14
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:44,627
I sent you a photo of the man who did.
All I want you to do is make an ID.

15
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,254
John Quinn, Black Ops combat vet.

16
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:48,839
He works for Starkwood.

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,550
- Starkwood work with Juma?
- If they did, it wasn't on the books.

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,427
If anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer.

19
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:56,931
Renee, where's Bauer?

20
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,891
- I don't know.
- Don't you lie to me.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,560
We know you accessed a classified
government database and sent

22
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,654
someone's name and address to Bauer.

23
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,606
- Tell me where he is.
- I can't.

24
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:08,321
Put her in holding.
Mirandize her.

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,654
If Bauer connects us to Juma, it could
seriously impede this operation.

26
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,947
Yes, it could.

27
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,744
- Is the shipment on time?
- Yes. Due into port in the next hour.

28
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,539
Once the weapons are deployed,

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,332
then it doesn't matter
what Mr. Bauer or anyone else knows.

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,335
I didn't kill Burnett.
This man did.

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,277
His name is John Quinn.
He works for Starkwood.

32
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,256
What does Starkwood
have to do with this?

33
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,939
Your informant claims that Starkwood
was trying to acquire a bioweapon,

34
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,387
it's the connection to Juma.

35
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,390
You've been trying to dismantle
Starkwood for the last six months.

36
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,476
If they have a weapon like this, you
better believe they intend to use it.

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,776
Where are the weapons coming in?

38
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:53,026
You're too late.

39
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,448
They're already here.

40
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:37,490
Sir? Preliminary sweep
of the immediate area's done.

41
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,674
There's no sign of Bauer.

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,026
All right, widen the grid.

43
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,139
And run down security cameras
around the perimeter.

44
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,580
- Somebody must have seen him.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,535
<i>Mr. Kanin,</i>

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>Larry Moss is on the line.</i>

47
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:07,520
Agent Moss,

48
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,446
<i>please tell me
you have Jack Bauer in custody.</i>

49
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:14,026
I wish that were the case,
Mr. Kanin, but the truth is...

50
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,225
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

51
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,449
He's dead.

52
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,326
What?

53
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,599
He was murdered at his house.

54
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,481
We only found out that Bauer was
on his way over here a short time ago.

55
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,949
- Unfortunately, we got here too late.
- Wait a minute.

56
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,961
Are you telling me

57
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,199
that Jack Bauer just killed
a United States Senator?

58
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:37,424
That's the assumption
that we're working under, yes.

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,096
How could you have let this happen,
Agent Moss?

60
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,729
He had us all fooled, sir.

61
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:47,254
I released Jack Bauer
into your custody.

62
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,436
I ordered you
to keep him on a short leash!

63
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,982
No, no. Mr. Kanin, you are not
gonna lay this one at my feet.

64
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,164
<i>It was your decision
to give Bauer access to Burnett.</i>

65
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,952
<i>I advised you against it.</i>

66
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,549
Mr. Kanin?

67
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:06,871
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,067
What did you say?

69
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,352
I said, I advised you against it.

70
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,088
Yes, you did.

71
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,843
Sir, I have teams sweeping the area.

72
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,513
- Just find him, Agent Moss.
- Yeah, I will.

73
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,613
Starkwood was involved
with what happened today.

74
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,179
They helped Juma bring down those planes
and attack the White House.

75
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,613
In exchange, they were allowed
to develop and manufacture

76
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,377
a WMD in Sangala.

77
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,623
<i>It's a bioweapon.
Apparently, it's already here in the US.</i>

78
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,123
- Who else knows about this?
- No one. Senator Mayer and I

79
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,878
were piecing together the information
right before he was killed.

80
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,638
You said the weapon's already here.

81
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,931
- Are they in possession of it?
- I don't think so.

82
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:10,303
The text message I got
off their agent's cell phone said:

83
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,728
"Port of Alexandria,
Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

84
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,939
Why don't we call the FBI
and lock the place down?

85
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,530
Because we're fugitives.
No one's going to believe us.

86
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:20,694
We need to know where that weapon is
before we call anyone else in.

87
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,197
Tony, I need to know
if you're with me on this.

88
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,369
- Yeah, I'm with you.
- Meet me at the north end of the port.

89
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,453
There's an access road
before the main entrance.

90
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,795
All right, I'll be there.

91
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:37,684
It's over.

92
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,797
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

93
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:44,043
<i>Everyone responsible
for the terrorist attacks...</i>

94
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,471
responsible for Roger.

95
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:50,478
Thank God for that.

96
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,338
And there's something else,

97
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:57,149
something good,
that's come out of all of this.

98
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:01,187
Olivia is here at the White House.

99
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,365
She's come home, Henry.

100
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,655
This crisis...
It brought us together.

101
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:14,373
I've asked her to stay on
as Special Advisor,

102
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,987
<i>and she's agreed.</i>

103
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:17,112
Ally...

104
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:19,712
I can't begin to tell you

105
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:23,447
- how happy that makes me.
- Me, too.

106
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:28,798
Sweetheart, I know that you're tired.
You should get some rest.

107
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,891
Olivia and I will come to the hospital
just as soon as we can.

108
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,451
When you can.

109
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,997
I'm not going anywhere.

110
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,578
Give Olivia my love.

111
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,083
<i>Love you.</i>

112
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,904
We love you too.

113
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,086
The doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,794
Henry's a lot tougher
than anyone thought.

115
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,091
Maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe,

116
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,998
this day will end
on a positive note.

117
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,144
What is it, Ethan? What's wrong?

118
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:22,622
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Madam President, but

119
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,401
Senator Mayer is dead.

120
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,408
What happened?

121
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:30,949
All evidence points to the fact
that he was murdered

122
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,646
by Jack Bauer.

123
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:34,620
Bauer?

124
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,955
It's hard to believe, I know.

125
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,596
It doesn't make any sense.

126
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:43,754
After everything he has done today,
why on earth would he do this?

127
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,897
We'll know more when we find him.

128
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,209
My God.

129
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:55,879
Madam President,

130
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:59,883
in light of what's happened,
and for the sake of your administration,

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,765
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to resign as your Chief of Staff.

132
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,860
Madam President, please,
you need to hear this.

133
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,774
Inevitably, it'll come to light
that I sanctioned

134
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,943
Bauer's release from custody.

135
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:18,952
Unless I step down immediately,

136
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,763
the damage to your office,
and you personally,

137
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,134
will be extensive.

138
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,398
Ethan, Olivia has already killed
this story once today.

139
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,822
- We can control the damage.
- No.

140
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,858
No, not even Olivia
can control it now.

141
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,867
Not after the senator's murder.

142
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:45,239
The truth is, Madam President,

143
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,248
I didn't do enough to protect you.

144
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,447
The truth is, I failed you.

145
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:55,500
And I should shoulder the blame
for what's happened.

146
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,744
Ethan, really, you're...

147
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,179
- you're taking this too far.
- Am I?

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,628
I'm not so sure.

149
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:06,086
As your daughter
has made abundantly clear,

150
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,364
I have a lot to answer for.

151
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,932
You have done nothing
but be an invaluable advisor to me

152
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,742
and an even better friend.

153
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:19,122
I appreciate you saying that,
Madam President, but

154
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,476
Olivia's right.

155
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,032
The political knives will be out.

156
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,825
Every decision I've made
will be scrutinized.

157
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,472
There will be calls
for a special prosecutor.

158
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,826
You're a great woman, Allison.

159
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,178
You have great work yet to do.

160
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,862
I'm a liability to you now.

161
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,975
Don't let me compromise
your next three years in office.

162
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,171
Don't let me sink your agenda.

163
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:57,337
Our agenda, Ethan.

164
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,448
Yes.

165
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,487
Our agenda.

166
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,099
Trust me, Madam President,

167
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,763
it's the right thing to do.

168
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,576
Accept my resignation.

169
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,895
I'll have a letter on your desk
in the morning.

170
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:55,118
They're gonna be here any minute.
We need to narrow down the search.

171
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,246
If they offloaded it today,
it should still be on the storage dock.

172
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:02,375
It's still a needle in a haystack, Jack.
There must be 1,000 containers in there.

173
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,021
We need to access the yard's manifest.
What's the security?

174
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:08,472
I've spotted
one Port Authority officer.

175
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,306
- That's it?
- That's it.

176
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,496
There's got to be more.
Come on, let's go.

177
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,300
Honey, it'll be fine.

178
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,010
I get relieved in a few hours.

179
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,470
Carl, you know I don't like
you working double shifts.

180
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,724
Well, it was my choice.
And we could use the overtime.

181
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,564
- How are the girls?
- Kicking like a chorus line tonight.

182
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,181
<i>They miss their daddy.</i>

183
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,890
What'd the doctor say?

184
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:33,134
That I'm lucky it's not triplets.

185
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,637
Honey, let me call you back.

186
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,781
Don't even think
about going for your weapon.

187
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,610
I need the port's manifest.
Where is it?

188
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,323
I'm just a PA cop.

189
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:19,714
Where is it?

190
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:21,988
Customs House.

191
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,546
That way.

192
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:25,584
Let's go.

193
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,112
We on schedule?

194
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:42,469
We're at the staging area near the port,
sir, but we're still waiting on Quinn.

195
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:45,256
He should have been there by now.
Have you heard from him?

196
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,100
We've tried his cell,
but he's not answering.

197
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,375
If Bauer took out Quinn,

198
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,854
he might have
knowledge of the operation.

199
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:54,431
Mightn't he?

200
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,866
Should we stand down, sir?

201
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:59,076
No.

202
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,801
Give Quinn five more minutes,
then go in.

203
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,367
Do so with... extreme caution

204
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,525
then contact me the minute
that you've secured the container.

205
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,650
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,146
Everybody on the board is here, sir.

207
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:16,628
- You have a worried look, Greg.
- It's very tense in there, sir.

208
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,866
They're six-year-olds, Greg.

209
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:22,527
And they need to eat their carrots.

210
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:32,351
Rough day.

211
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,230
It's been a rough day
for the United States of America.

212
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:38,900
The White House under siege...
The President taken hostage...

213
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:42,946
It's especially painful
because we know this didn't have to be.

214
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,114
Fact:

215
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:47,159
the United States military
is strained to the breaking point.

216
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,327
Fact:

217
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,490
reinstatement of the draft
is off the table for political reasons.

218
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,577
Fact:
the people in this room, you all,

219
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,706
control the largest private army
in the Western hemisphere.

220
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,882
Now,
could we have been of help today?

221
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,700
You bet your ass
we could've been of help!

222
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,870
But they didn't call us, did they?

223
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:07,995
No.

224
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,476
Instead, we sit here,

225
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:12,695
our contracts are canceled,
our soldiers vilified,

226
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,937
our corporate sovereignty is threatened
by congressional fiat.

227
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:18,722
Doug, you brokered the deal
with this government.

228
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,769
You were short-sighted
and they don't understand

229
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,744
that the global war on terror
can only be won by forces like ours.

230
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,198
So as of this minute,

231
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:29,999
we sit for no more depositions.
We volunteer no more documents.

232
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,095
I don't even want us
to take any phone calls.

233
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,881
- Is that what this is about?
- With the security of our country,

234
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:38,756
- Is that what this is about?
- ... we cannot let them take us down.

235
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:40,698
You came here

236
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,798
to ask the board
to risk a federal indictment?

237
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,259
It won't work, Jonas.

238
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,241
We got a deal.

239
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,826
It's a good deal
and we're lucky to have it.

240
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:53,393
With an administration
that wants to destroy us.

241
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,575
Wants to take us out of business.
No, it's all different now.

242
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,771
- Today was a game-changer.
- No, institutionally,

243
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:02,038
we are in compliance
with the subpoena.

244
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,797
Documents have been filed,

245
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:05,946
- depositions taken.
- Not anymore.

246
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,828
Jonas, we have to stay engaged
with this administration.

247
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,403
No, we don't, Doug.

248
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:12,829
You and I can talk this out.

249
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,243
If you guys have any questions,
any further questions,

250
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:18,458
Greg, you will stick around
and you'll answer them. Thank you.

251
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,626
Thank you.

252
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,494
Your way was a mistake, Doug.

253
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,324
- You have to acknowledge that.
- Maybe.

254
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,979
But you and I both know

255
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,912
that Starkwood cannot survive
an all-out war against the subcommittee.

256
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,626
- Let me worry about that.
- You should worry about Senator Mayer.

257
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,483
He's not going to let go of this.
He's got his teeth in it.

258
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,071
Senator Mayer's dead.

259
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:54,137
He was killed by a rogue federal agent
not one hour ago, tragically.

260
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,340
Tell me
you had nothing to do with this.

261
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:13,422
Are you accusing me of complicity
in the murder of Senator Mayer?

262
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,433
I want a personal assurance.

263
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,814
Starkwood is not in the business
of political assassination, Doug.

264
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,480
Maybe we should look into it.

265
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,505
I hear it's a growth market.

266
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,796
- Jack, you finding anything?
- 12 ships were unloaded here today.

267
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:44,362
Any from Sangala?

268
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,030
There's no deepwater port
in that area of West Africa.

269
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:49,141
If the weapon originated from there,

270
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:52,116
it would've had
to overland into Pointe-Noire.

271
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,637
Where...

272
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,642
2 of the 12 ships acquired cargo
from that port within the last 4 weeks.

273
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,567
Come on.

274
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,231
Come on.

275
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,593
- Damn it!
- What is it?

276
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:10,313
I can't access their manifests,
their database is password protected.

277
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,760
- What's your name, officer?
- Gadsen.

278
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:20,383
Carl Gadsen. I don't have
any information about a password.

279
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,712
Carl, I want you
to listen to me very carefully.

280
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:25,890
The same terrorists who took down
2 planes and attacked the White House

281
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,337
are trying to acquire
a weapon of mass destruction.

282
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,276
They're coming here
to pick up that weapon.

283
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,968
It's somewhere out there in your yard
in one of those canisters.

284
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,016
I understand
this might be hard to believe.

285
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,791
No, actually, it's not.

286
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,974
- You don't have a lot of time.
- What do you mean?

287
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,584
They are coming.

288
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:45,169
- In fact, they should be here already.
- Keep talking, Carl.

289
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:48,550
They told me they were smuggling
in electronics from South Korea.

290
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,547
I swear.

291
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,737
- I had no idea they were terrorists.
- What'd you agree to do for them?

292
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,184
Open the front gate.
Look the other way.

293
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,992
- Is that it?
- Disable the security cameras.

294
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,908
A yard this size should have
more police officers. Where are they?

295
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,483
I'm the supervisor.

296
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:06,134
I do the shift schedules.
I made sure I'd be the only one here.

297
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,011
That's enough confirmation for me.
I'm making the call. Untie him.

298
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,780
- Who's he calling?
- The FBI.

299
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:15,909
Now that we're confident the weapon's
here, we're calling in the authorities.

300
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:23,226
My cell is down, so is the landline.
Someone's jamming communications.

301
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:32,572
It's them.

302
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:35,447
They gave me that radio,
told me they'd be contacting me.

303
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,722
Answer the call. Just play along.

304
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:41,536
Answer the call.

305
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,783
- Hello?
- Where are you?

306
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,987
<i>I didn't think you were coming.
You're late.</i>

307
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,612
Well, we're here now
and we're waiting.

308
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:53,647
Okay.

309
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:57,292
- They're at the front gate.
- Put your belt back on.

310
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:00,266
I want you to resume your post.
Pretend like everything's normal.

311
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:01,990
- Just let them in.
- And then what?

312
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,420
We're going to follow them
after they pick up their container,

313
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,393
once we're past the grid,
we'll make our call.

314
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:09,594
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

315
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,275
You're a part of this, Carl,
whether you want to be or not.

316
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:15,503
You became a part of it this the second
you said "yes" to these people.

317
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,883
- What do you got?
- I got three vehicles.

318
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,890
Eight hostiles, heavily armed,
there's probably more inside the trucks.

319
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,157
Carl, if you don't open that gate,

320
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:28,281
they're going to come in here
looking for you, you understand me?

321
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,364
Let me put it to you this way.

322
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,130
These men have killed
over 300 people today.

323
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:38,566
If they get that weapon, they'll make
that look like child's play.

324
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,514
You've only got one choice here.

325
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:48,495
- I just open the gate and let them in.
- That's all you've got to do.

326
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,522
- And you guys got my back, right?
- Yeah.

327
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:52,565
Promise me.

328
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,488
I promise you.

329
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Okay.

330
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,104
Tony, get the surveillance package.

331
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,748
Don't worry. It's just so
we can hear what's going on.

332
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,768
Turn around.
I need to put this on your back.

333
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,615
Listen,

334
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,515
the money, it wasn't
about greed or anything.

335
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,427
It's my wife, Linda.
She's having twins.

336
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,836
They say it's the most natural thing
in the world, right? Getting pregnant?

337
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:27,901
Well, it took us three years,
cost an arm and a leg.

338
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,220
No excuses, but insurance
doesn't cover a dime.

339
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,417
I just always wanted
to have a family.

340
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,824
You know what I mean?

341
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,720
Put this in your pocket.

342
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,531
- You got him?
- Yeah.

343
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,639
Remember,
it's just another day at the office.

344
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,635
You're going to be fine.

345
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,199
Let's go.

346
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,441
What took you so long?

347
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,181
- You got the routing documents?
- Sure.

348
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,466
I need to see them
to locate the container.

349
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,691
Relax, Carl.

350
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:24,491
They're right here.

351
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:31,034
Center section.

352
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,029
Row 36... Q-block.

353
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:36,461
It's that fourth stack on your left.

354
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,201
I know where the container is, Carl.

355
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,467
Did you disable
the security cameras?

356
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,033
They've been off since 10:00,
just like you said.

357
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,807
How's your wife?

358
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:52,513
She's fine.

359
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,980
- You didn't tell her about this?
- No, of course not.

360
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:01,402
- Did you tell anybody else?
- No, why would I?

361
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,404
You tell me, Carl.

362
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,499
Why are you so nervous?

363
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,954
Okay, you want to know
the truth, Mr. Stokes?

364
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,197
I was expecting
a simple pickup, but...

365
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,707
you show up
with a small army here, and...

366
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:19,721
- And what?
- It's just...

367
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:21,733
not what I was expecting,
that's all.

368
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,318
I just don't want to get caught.

369
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:27,386
Nobody's gonna get caught, Carl.

370
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:30,263
Let's go, we're moving.

371
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,069
- You too, Carl, take a ride.
- I told you,

372
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,956
it's the fourth stack on your left.
Q- block, row 36.

373
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,803
- I'd feel better if you showed us.
- I really should stay here, Mr. Stokes.

374
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,777
I got to finish my patrol.

375
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,485
Why, Carl?
You expecting somebody?

376
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,757
- No.
- Then get in.

377
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,499
Damn it.

378
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:59,205
Forget about him, Jack.

379
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:02,963
He was dead the minute he stepped out
that door. You and I both know that.

380
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,944
Ethan, I just came
to say how sorry I am.

381
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,924
Well, I appreciate the courtesy

382
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,782
if not the sincerity.

383
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,537
As much as I may feel
this is what's best for my mother,

384
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,666
on a personal level I'm sorry
you have to go through this,

385
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,101
and for some of the harsher things
I said to you in anger.

386
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,674
Well, I suppose I owe you
an apology, too,

387
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,402
for accusing you

388
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:53,130
of leaking my role
in this Bauer fiasco to the press.

389
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,074
I really believed
you were trying to blindside me.

390
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:00,478
Considering the impression I gave you,
I'm not surprised.

391
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:05,897
As someone who's known you
most of your life,

392
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:08,893
I'd like to offer some advice.

393
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:10,962
Of course.

394
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:17,371
Ambition can be a valuable quality

395
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:21,127
here in Washington
as well as in life,

396
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,578
but unchecked,

397
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,434
it can be unhealthy,
if not dangerous.

398
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:29,300
What I'm trying to say is...

399
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:33,137
you got yourself a seat
at the President's table.

400
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:35,578
She listens to you.

401
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:40,749
But running a country
is not like running a campaign.

402
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:44,541
It's not about doing
whatever it takes to win.

403
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:48,436
It's about doing what's right
for the American people.

404
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:53,860
Sometimes those things
aren't mutually exclusive.

405
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,712
- Good-bye, Olivia.
- Good-bye.

406
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,389
It's Olivia.

407
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,609
You can go with that story now, Ken,

408
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,860
<i>- and it just got better.</i>
- Tell me.

409
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:30,898
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

410
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:34,111
What happened? I thought the plan was to
let him twist in the wind for a while.

411
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,658
His hand was forced.

412
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,457
It seems Jack Bauer
just murdered Senator Mayer.

413
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:40,842
What?

414
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,392
You're kidding me.

415
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:44,709
Anybody else have this yet?

416
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,403
Not yet,
it's all yours in time for the 11:00.

417
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:49,935
Told you
I'd take care of you, didn't I?

418
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:53,308
- You are too good to me, Olivia.
- You just hold up your end.

419
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,261
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.

420
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,138
My mother is nowhere near this, OK?

421
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:58,601
No problem.

422
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,133
She really doesn't have any idea
that you're the leak?

423
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,555
No, and it'd better stay that way.

424
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,480
She won't hear it from me.

425
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:09,018
When are we having
that dinner you promised?

426
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:11,291
Maybe next week.

427
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,070
Always next week.

428
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:16,506
You'd better get to work
if you're going to make that broadcast.

429
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,451
Preliminary ballistics.

430
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,457
So these files on the computer

431
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:39,071
presumably Senator Mayer was looking
at 'em before he was killed?

432
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:40,380
Someone was, Sir.

433
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:42,475
They were opened and viewed
within the last hour.

434
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:45,783
So if the Sen...

435
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,343
if the Senator was killed
point-blank in the entry hall,

436
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:52,276
how are we explaing the slugs
in the door frame and the railing?

437
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,653
I don't know.

438
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,542
- Get the crime lab guys on it.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,473
Agent Walker,
it's Larry Moss for you.

440
00:27:16,423 --> 00:27:18,219
- Hello.
<i>- Senator Mayer is dead.</i>

441
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:21,834
- Where's Jack?
- Don't know.

442
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,153
We don't have him.

443
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,800
OK, but what,
you think that he did this, Larry?

444
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:30,165
- First Burnett and now Mayer?
- Well...

445
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:31,983
it looks that way.

446
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,411
- What do you mean "looks that way"?
- Well, that's why I'm calling.

447
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:38,879
Senator Mayer was killed
with a UMP 40 submachine gun.

448
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:42,034
If Bauer was on the run, where'd he
get ahold of a weapon like that?

449
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,417
Also, there's evidence
to suggest that the...

450
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,874
there was a 3rd party in the house
when the Senator was killed.

451
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,886
- What kind of evidence?
- Unexplained slugs,

452
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,796
a broken set of French doors,
a chair where it doesn't belong.

453
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,109
OK, so are you saying
that this third party killed Mayer?

454
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,551
Well, I might be saying that
if I knew what the hell

455
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,745
<i>Bauer was doing here
in the first place.</i>

456
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:02,972
<i>All right, listen.</i>

457
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,100
I want to meet you halfway,
but if you expect me to even entertain

458
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,254
<i>Bauer's innocence,
you have got to help me here.</i>

459
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:10,479
I can't, Larry.
If Jack is still underground,

460
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,553
<i>he is underground for a reason.</i>

461
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:14,775
There were files open
on Mayer's computer,

462
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,132
documents relating
to his investigation into Starkwood.

463
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:20,015
So just tell me that.

464
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,301
Did Starkwood ever come up
in your conversation with Bauer?

465
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:35,013
Look, maybe I should have
trusted you before, okay,

466
00:28:35,735 --> 00:28:37,885
but you have got to trust me now.

467
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:42,022
What role does Starkwood
play in all this?

468
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,294
The man who framed Jack
for Burnett's murder was John Quinn,

469
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:54,859
a Starkwood contractor.

470
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:58,921
Jack believes that they were behind Juma
and all of the terrorist attacks today.

471
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:01,357
He went to Mayer
to get the evidence to prove it.

472
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:04,107
I have to assume
that Quinn followed him there.

473
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:08,107
- That's all that I know, I swear.
- Okay, I believe you.

474
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,955
Thank you.

475
00:29:10,608 --> 00:29:13,008
<i>Just sit tight,
I'll be in touch soon.</i>

476
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,985
Well, let me help.
Jack could still be out there.

477
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,206
- <i>He may be in trouble.</i>
- No, no, I can't release you, not yet.

478
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,814
Reese, what's the status?

479
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,045
Just getting the chassis on.
I'll be a minute.

480
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,234
Hurry it up.

481
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:44,573
Hold up, hold up, I don't have my truck.
Put it down there, I want it there.

482
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:02,210
Get up there.
Let's run a diagnostic now.

483
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,983
I want to be ready to roll as soon as
Reese gets here with that flatbed.

484
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:06,108
Yes, sir.

485
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,951
All right, there's the package.
We should get back to the car.

486
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,654
We want to be in position to follow
that container once they move out.

487
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,930
Just give me one second.

488
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,788
Cooper.

489
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,795
Now's as good a time as any
to settle up with Carl.

490
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Yes, sir.

491
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,523
Thanks, Carl.

492
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:40,794
Good luck.

493
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,231
- Let's go.
- Where we going?

494
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:47,094
Your money's in my truck,
just one aisle over.

495
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,778
Jack, we should get going.

496
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,031
What are you doing? I thought you said
the money was in the truck.

497
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:13,721
- What the hell's going on?
- Just keep moving.

498
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:18,532
Listen, I don't know what Stokes
told you, but I didn't tell a soul.

499
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,406
Damn it, Jack,
what the hell are you doing?

500
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,771
Don't do it. You're gonna turn
a surveillance job into a firefight.

501
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:30,522
- It'll be two against ten.
- Two against nine.

502
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:34,047
Right, and we lose our best chance
at getting this weapon.

503
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,765
Don't break your own rules.
You may save one man,

504
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,085
but what about the thousands of people
who could die in a biological attack?

505
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,521
Is this about you, Jack,
or about them?

506
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:45,938
You want to prevent another disaster
or ensure that it's going to happen?

507
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,080
That's far enough.

508
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:56,557
Turn around.

509
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:00,511
You're going to kill me,

510
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:03,087
you're going to have
to look me in the eye.

511
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,208
Damn it.

512
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,195
Thank you, thank you.

513
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,459
We've got about 30 seconds
before they figure out what happened.

514
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,833
- Okay, what's our fallback?
- Steal the truck.

515
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:20,770
Strong?

516
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,081
I'll make the direct assault,
you cover the east flank.

517
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,852
All we need is a big enough firefight
to get one of us behind the wheel.

518
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,200
- You ready?
- Yeah.

519
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:34,598
How do we look?

520
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,625
Diagnostics check out, sir.

521
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,081
- The package is stable.
- Good.

522
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:44,898
All right,
let's get her on the chassis!

523
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:05,671
Cooper, come on. Let's roll.

524
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,152
Cooper, do you copy?

525
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,870
Dolen. Check the next aisle over.
Find Cooper.

526
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,036
Hold your position.

527
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,858
Wait for my signal.

528
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:35,888
- Cooper's down.
- Go red, go red!

529
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,349
- Let's move out... Greer.
- Engage.

530
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,989
Reese,
get the truck out of here now!

531
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,745
The truck, I'm going after it.
Cover me now!

532
00:35:12,331 --> 00:35:14,731
Two shooters: fan out and find them.

533
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,304
Tony, this is Jack, do you copy?

534
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,412
Drop it.

535
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,022
I know you.

536
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:16,395
You're on Emerson's crew.

537
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,121
<i>You're Almeida, right?</i>

538
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,475
I know Bauer's with you.
Now, where is he?

539
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:57,422
- Larry, it's Jack.
- Where the hell have you been?

540
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,948
I need you to scramble multiple teams to
a weigh station on Highway 236, exit 29.

541
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,637
- I'm in a big rig about 10 miles south.
- What's going on?

542
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:06,849
You also need to send
a CDC recovery unit.

543
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:07,741
Why?

544
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:11,019
I'm in possession of a biological weapon
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

545
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,188
A biological weapon?

546
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:16,441
Just listen to me. I don't care
if you arrest me or shoot me.

547
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:20,737
Just get your teams out here. I
fully expect to be pursued by hostiles.

548
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,407
- Starkwood?
- How do you know?

549
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,118
I talked to Renee. And I saw
what was on Mayer's computer.

550
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:28,912
Larry, they're coming after this weapon.
You can count on it.

551
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,708
<i>Now, be advised, I believe that
Tony Almeida is being held hostage.</i>

552
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,793
I'll call out an interagency alert.

553
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,972
- <i>We'll secure both locations.</i>
- Larry, hurry.

554
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,495
- <i>Hodges.</i>
- Sir, this is Stokes.

555
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,998
- What's your status?
- The package is secure, we're inbound.

556
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:03,043
- What about Bauer?
- <i>He's at the scene,</i>

557
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,586
but he sought cover nearby.

558
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:08,131
Well, we have to assume
that he contacted the authorities,

559
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:11,341
so we better be
on an accelerated timetable.

560
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:14,201
- Get over here.
- It will be there in ten minutes.

561
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:16,139
- We're right behind.
- Good.

562
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,822
I've got teams on the ground
prepping for your arrival.

563
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,028
I'm still on Route 236,

564
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,406
but I had to stop approximately
seven miles before the weigh station.

565
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,138
- I got 2 units moving to you right now.
- You're gonna have to redirect them.

566
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:40,138
- Why?
- Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.

567
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,668
They managed to access
one of the dock's freight helicopters.

568
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:46,391
While they had me pinned down, they
airlifted the freight right out of here.

569
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:48,703
<i>They were headed due west
from my current position.</i>

570
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:51,452
West... they got
a large military facility in that area.

571
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,260
Okay, good.
Redirect the teams there.

572
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:57,265
I can't assault a private compound
unless I have proof that weapon exists.

573
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,014
- Okay, where's the CDC?
- <i>They're scrambling a team right now.</i>

574
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:03,289
Send them to me.
You'll have all the proof you need.

575
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:04,549
What happened?

576
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,233
One of the canisters
was breached during the interdiction.

577
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:11,387
Some of the bio-agent was released.

578
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,531
I was exposed.

579
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:19,460
Okay. Jack, just sit tight.

580
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,525
CDC's on the way.
They're going to be there soon.
