00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,697
www.sub-way.fr

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,682
What the hell is this? All our screens
for the eastern quadrant are locked.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,665
I took out your control units.

5
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:23,481
I want you to see what we can do.
Get ready to make the course change.

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,165
GSA 1-7,
this is Northeast Three Control.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,403
- Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
- We have a new runway for you.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,530
Sid, there's another plane
landing on four-right.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,201
It crosses three-one-left.

10
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,700
GSA 1-7, pull up.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,951
<i>Four-right, pull up.</i>

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>That was just a warning shot.</i>

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,292
Whatever we do next,
it'll be the real thing.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,794
Get the module ready.

15
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:46,295
As promised.

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,650
General Juma will be pleased.

17
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:53,609
Perhaps now would be a good time
to make your demands

18
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,846
- known to President Taylor.
- Make the preparations.

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,057
Your government is about to pay
a very steep price for...

20
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:01,060
interfering in our affairs.

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,597
They assumed my son killed himself.

22
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,981
They didn't look
deeply enough at anything.

23
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,651
The authorities have already questioned
your son's girlfriend, sir.

24
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,195
You're not going anywhere
till I get the truth.

25
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,155
You know who murdered my son.

26
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,907
He killed himself.

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,842
I'm going to find out
what you're hiding,

28
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,995
and when I do, God help you.

29
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,600
You're right, he's not one of ours.
We'll follow him,

30
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:25,801
- see if it leads us to Almeida.
- That's not the right move.

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,504
You can't bring
anyone else into this.

32
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,871
- What the hell's going on?
- We're following up on a lead

33
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:33,217
<i>and I will fill you in
if and when we find something.</i>

34
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,387
I don't like this. I just...
flat out lied to my boss.

35
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,765
I will help you find Tony Almeida,
but you'll have to let me do it my way.

36
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,658
Tony!
Stop!

37
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,571
The device is gone.
The locater files have been deleted.

38
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,780
Where is it?

39
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,686
What the hell happened to you?

40
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,050
- Where's Almeida now?
- He's in transit to FBI headquarters.

41
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,760
- He'll be formally interrogated there.
- I don't understand.

42
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,743
Almeida was orchestrating
these attacks.

43
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,823
If he doesn't have the CIP device,
who does?

44
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,475
The FBI has learned that Almeida
handed off the device to someone else.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,816
They don't know who.

46
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,285
I may have an answer to that question,
Madame President.

47
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,524
I'm listening.

48
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,199
Almeida's working
for the Juma regime.

49
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:34,490
Five minutes ago,

50
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:37,281
an audio message was routed
to the State Department's subnet.

51
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,534
It's from Colonel Ike Dubaku.
He's Juma's right-hand man.

52
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,970
He's known as the "Butcher of Sangala."
Over 300,000 people were murdered...

53
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,164
I know who he is.

54
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:48,125
What did the message say?

55
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,339
I think you should hear it yourself.

56
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,949
<i>President Taylor,</i>

57
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,816
<i>this is Colonel Ike Dubaku.</i>

58
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,067
<i>As you have no doubt confirmed,</i>

59
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:03,000
<i>the near-collision at JFK International
was no accident.</i>

60
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,050
<i>We have the CIP device.</i>

61
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:11,649
<i>We have the capability to kill
tens of thousands of Americans,</i>

62
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,060
<i>and we are prepared to do so.</i>

63
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,247
<i>We demand</i>

64
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,883
<i>the complete
and immediate withdrawal</i>

65
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,922
<i>of the U.S. Naval Strike Force</i>

66
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,471
<i>to a position
west of the 23rd meridian,</i>

67
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:26,060
<i>by this time tomorrow.</i>

68
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,333
<i>In order to meet this timeline,</i>

69
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,817
<i>we require satellite confirmation
within three hours</i>

70
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:37,483
<i>that the Carrier Air Wing
is in full retreat.</i>

71
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:42,990
<i>Don't sacrifice
your fellow countrymen,</i>

72
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,431
<i>Madame President.</i>

73
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,559
<i>Allow the people of Sangala</i>

74
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,155
<i>to determine their own destiny.</i>

75
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:53,007
<i>Stand your forces down.</i>

76
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,670
Voice print's an 89% match.

77
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,708
It's Dubaku.
There's little doubt.

78
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,115
It looks like your suspicions
were correct, Madame President.

79
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,882
This is about Africa.

80
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,005
My God.

81
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,462
Dubaku should have been tried
for war crimes years ago.

82
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,165
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

83
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,221
We cannot let this monster
hold our country hostage.

84
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:16,425
- Where do we stand on the planes?
- Still 2,500 planes in the air.

85
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,340
We have got
to shore up the firewall,

86
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,769
so that the CIP device
will be rendered useless.

87
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,429
We now think we can re-engineer
the code in six days.

88
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,353
Six days?
We don't have the luxury of six hours.

89
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,144
I'm sorry, but there's no way
we can rebuild the firewall

90
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,602
in that time frame.

91
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:38,608
I want you to instigate
a series of restricted alerts,

92
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,712
keep it to first responders only.

93
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:43,118
We want people to be ready
in case we're attacked again,

94
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,576
- but we don't want to start a panic.
- Yes, Madame President.

95
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,877
And, gentlemen,
Almeida is our only lead.

96
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,709
Make sure the FBI
is aware of the demands:

97
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,338
to work Almeida from the Africa side,
we don't have a lot of time.

98
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,506
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:26,085
Come on!

100
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,119
Put your head down.

101
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,581
Get him ready for questioning.

102
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,946
I want an explanation.

103
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,248
You went after that shooter
without backup or authorization,

104
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,566
and then refused to tell me why.
Now I want to know.

105
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,900
We didn't know
who might be listening.

106
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,534
Someone in this office
is helping Almeida.

107
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,730
The FBI has been compromised, Larry.
There's a leak.

108
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,161
Based on what?
Excuse me! This is private.

109
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,383
Tony knew we were going to Schector's
office before we even got there.

110
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,826
That's how he managed
to get a sniper in position.

111
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,336
The tip had to come from your office,
and whoever it was

112
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,335
helped the assassin
get out of the building.

113
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,931
He's right, Larry.
That's why we couldn't tell you.

114
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,606
You had a full perimeter, right?
Covered every exit?

115
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,116
How else do you think
he got out of there?

116
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:34,633
Assuming this is true,
you got any idea who it could be?

117
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,687
We didn't see him,
but we know that it went down.

118
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,802
It could be anyone in the Bureau.

119
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:41,358
You need to tighten
your circle around Tony.

120
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,196
You can't let any information get back
to the people he's working with.

121
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,880
Otherwise, you'll never get
that CIP device.

122
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:52,827
All right.

123
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,623
We'll limit access
to level four clearance and above.

124
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:01,253
Have Janis run the security protocols.
See if she can track down this leak.

125
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:02,737
This is Moss.

126
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,050
Yeah, I'll take it in my office.

127
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,600
It's the White House.

128
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:15,015
From now on,

129
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:17,455
keep me in the loop.

130
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:21,106
And he doesn't do a damn thing
without telling me.

131
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,114
We had to tell him,
we had no choice.

132
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,237
Do you trust him?

133
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:34,036
No question.
There's no one I trust more.

134
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:38,193
Where they going to hall Tony?

135
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,996
I am going
to have to lift up your shirt.

136
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,728
Is that comfortable for you?

137
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,526
I'll take that as a yes.

138
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,368
- Is he hooked up?
- Yeah, we're ready to go.

139
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,582
I'll run the session.
I want you to handle something else.

140
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,751
- What else?
- Plugging a security leak.

141
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,372
What?

142
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:29,258
We think someone in this office
has been helping Almeida.

143
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,010
We've kicked this up
to level four clearance.

144
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,094
I want you to vet all communication
and information flow.

145
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,765
Red-tag every data point
that has to do with Almeida.

146
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,144
- Do we have any idea who it is?
- No,

147
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,873
we don't.
I'm hoping you can help us find out.

148
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:49,069
Okay, there's a point-two deviation
on the blood pressure monitor,

149
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,149
- you'll have to compensate for that.
- Thanks, Janis.

150
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,337
I'm sorry about your friend, Jack.

151
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:14,570
I know you were hoping he wasn't capable
of doing something like this.

152
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,902
What's going on?
Why are we in level four lock-down?

153
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:39,661
- Don't worry, just do your job.
- How am I supposed to do my job,

154
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,644
I can't get through
to half the server nodes?

155
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,213
You're sifting through the evidence
gathered at the arrest site,

156
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,877
that does not require
level four clearance.

157
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,913
You have everything you need
to do your work. Please.

158
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,212
It's confirmed, the FBI has Almeida.

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,557
Then we should move on.
There's nothing we can do.

160
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,394
We have assets inside the Bureau.
We use them to help get him out.

161
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,761
No, it's too risky.

162
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,527
We'd be jeopardizing the entire mission.
He's not that important.

163
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,415
What about the next operation?
He's prepped

164
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,395
- he's ready to go.
- We just have to find someone else.

165
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,410
I realize you and Tony are friends.

166
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,812
I don't like throwing him to the wolves
anymore than you do,

167
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:35,103
but he knew
what he was getting into.

168
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,561
I just spoke with Juma.

169
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:41,170
The American troops are still
in position near our country.

170
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,934
Tell Juma to be patient.

171
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,694
President Taylor
just received your demands.

172
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,897
Then perhaps it is time
for a more forceful demonstration.

173
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,794
If it comes to that, we'll be ready.

174
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,400
For now, let's give the White House
a little more time to respond.

175
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:00,162
For now.

176
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,068
Agent Walker.

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,490
- Almeida's working for the Juma regime.
- What are you talking about?

178
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:23,807
The President just received
a set of demands from Colonel Dubaku.

179
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,610
Looks like he contracted Almeida
to build the CIP module.

180
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,450
Now, he's using it
to blackmail the White House.

181
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:32,482
How?

182
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,152
Excuse me?

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,977
How is he going to blackmail
the White House?

184
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,482
By insisting we stand down
the invasion force

185
00:11:40,607 --> 00:11:42,034
off the coast of Sangala.

186
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,995
If the President doesn't comply
with his demands,

187
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,623
Dubaku's going to start
killing Americans.

188
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,850
I can get you your CIP device.

189
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,342
Just let me talk to him.

190
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,359
I know him, I know how he thinks.

191
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,183
We have a history.
I can use it against him.

192
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,180
He's gotten us this far, Larry.
It makes sense.

193
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,055
You're running out of time.

194
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,039
You don't have a better option.

195
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,324
Give us the room.

196
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,150
I watched you die in my arms.

197
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,732
You want to explain to me
how you're still alive?

198
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,009
Didn't think so.

199
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,282
Why don't I tell you what I know.

200
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,703
<i>I know that you're working
for the Juma regime.</i>

201
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,735
The White House
just got their demands.

202
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,060
And you have to know
that I will never let that happen.

203
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,589
So why don't you
save yourself some time...

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,140
and some pain.

205
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,665
And tell me where the CIP device is.

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,478
- I can't tell you that, Jack.
- Damn it, Tony,

207
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,195
you are not just facing charges
for domestic terrorism.

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,827
You'll face international charges
for aiding and abetting a genocide.

209
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:40,074
They will give you
the death penalty.

210
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,875
Come on, just work with me on this.
I can help you cut a deal.

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,033
- I can maybe even get you immunity.
- You're wasting your breath, Jack.

212
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:51,011
If I were you, I'd tell the President
to withdraw those troops

213
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:52,497
because Dubaku's serious.

214
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:55,009
He's ready to take out
thousands of American lives

215
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,065
- unless his demands are met.
- Why the hell are you doing this?

216
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:02,640
<i>Juma wanted the CIP module
and he was willing to pay for it.</i>

217
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,930
I don't believe you.

218
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,325
Come on, Jack.

219
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,651
Don't act so surprised.

220
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:18,148
Money's the only reason I have left
for doing anything.

221
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,010
- The government took care of that.
- The government did not kill Michelle.

222
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,490
Charles Logan did.

223
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:26,132
Charles Logan
is a product of his environment.

224
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,227
The government poisons
everything in its path.

225
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,328
But you know that better than me.

226
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,827
- Look what they did to you.
- Damn it. We are not talking about me.

227
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,334
<i>We're not?</i>

228
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,685
You're asking me why I'm doing this.

229
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,685
I could ask you the same question.

230
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,943
Here you are working for the same people
that want to put you in prison.

231
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,970
The same people
who killed everything you love

232
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,695
<i>and left you with nothing.</i>

233
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,724
<i>Your daughter wants nothing to do
with you,</i>

234
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,601
Teri's dead. Audrey Raines might...

235
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,010
- I said shut up!
- Jack, no! You need to hear this!

236
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,690
You need to start living
in the real world!

237
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,707
Because every second
you help the government,

238
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,736
you're spitting on Teri's grave!

239
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:07,715
Get up!

240
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,992
- He's losing it.
- Hold on.

241
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,133
Tell me where the device is!

242
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,472
So help me God, I will kill you.
And you will stay dead this time.

243
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,251
Where is the device?

244
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,159
This is your last chance.

245
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,924
Where is it?
Where is it?!

246
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,185
- Deep Sky, Jack.
- What did you just say?

247
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:40,313
- Give him a few more seconds.
- A few more seconds, he'll be dead.

248
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,649
Deep Sky.

249
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,067
Jack, let him go!

250
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,004
Get him out of here!

251
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,093
Get him out of here now!

252
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,746
I need a medic in here
to check him out.

253
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:09,263
Keep an eye on him.

254
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,181
Deep Sky.

255
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>Hello.</i>

256
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:28,250
- This is Jack Bauer.
<i>- Yes.</i>

257
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,769
- I was told to call you.
<i>- By whom?</i>

258
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:32,964
Tony Almeida.

259
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,841
He gave me
this old CTU emergency phone code.

260
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,271
Deep Sky.

261
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,333
It's Bill, Jack.

262
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,903
Bill, what the hell's going on?

263
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,760
- Where is Tony?
- FBI headquarters, he's been arrested.

264
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:53,498
Arrested?

265
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:56,587
He orchestrated a terrorist attack
on the United States today.

266
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:58,264
<i>I was interrogating him.</i>

267
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:03,229
<i>- How'd you get involved in this?</i>
- The FBI wants me to track him down.

268
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:05,649
We need to talk.

269
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,673
<i>I'll call you back
on a secure VPN line.</i>

270
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,762
- Bill, what the hell is going on?
<i>- I need ten minutes to set up the VPN.</i>

271
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,536
- I don't have ten minutes.
- Ten minutes, Jack.

272
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,541
I can't believe this.
If Tony's been arrested, it's over.

273
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,762
Are you going
to tell Jack everything?

274
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,610
If we want to get Tony back undercover,
we'll need his help.

275
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:33,802
I don't think
Jack's in a very helpful frame of mind.

276
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,183
He's our only hope.

277
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:52,802
- Hello, Henry.
- Ethan.

278
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,573
I got your message about Sangala.
Where's Allison?

279
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,323
She's in her office.

280
00:17:58,009 --> 00:17:59,009
Henry.

281
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:06,116
The President is
in an impossible situation right now.

282
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,420
She needs your support.

283
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,112
But you can't give it to her

284
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:12,997
if you keep going off
on these paranoid fantasies

285
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,259
about Roger.

286
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,397
I know about Samantha Roth.
I know you accosted her in her office.

287
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,140
She's hiding something
about my son's murder.

288
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,347
Roger wasn't murdered.

289
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,853
He committed suicide.

290
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:27,476
The coroner's office
made that determination,

291
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,007
- and then the FBI confirmed it.
- They didn't look hard enough.

292
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,922
Ethan, I know my son.

293
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:34,863
He did not kill himself.

294
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:37,296
He wasn't depressed.
He had no reason...

295
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:40,170
- What if he did have a reason?
- I would have known.

296
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:42,036
Not if he didn't tell you.

297
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,195
Not if he was too ashamed
to tell you or the President.

298
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:46,916
What are you talking about?

299
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,921
Roger was about to be investigated
by the SEC for insider trading.

300
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,753
He'd used information

301
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,154
he could only have gotten
through his access to the President.

302
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:01,694
Before the SEC
opened the investigation,

303
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,108
he killed himself.

304
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:05,435
I don't believe it.

305
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:07,451
It's all in here.

306
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,937
In the SEC case file.

307
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,171
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

308
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:17,645
Frank Boylan agreed to bury the case

309
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,977
as a political favor
to the President.

310
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,535
My wife knew about this
and she didn't tell me?

311
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,041
She wanted to.

312
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:27,642
But she also wanted
to protect your memory of your son.

313
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,628
- You were in so much pain.
- He was my son. I deserved the truth.

314
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,957
Then keeping it from you
was a terrible mistake.

315
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,415
I realize that now.

316
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:40,100
But the President and I both thought
you were moving on with your life.

317
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,557
Mr. Kanin,
the President wants to see you.

318
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,340
Does she know
you're telling me this now?

319
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:53,038
No.

320
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,784
And I think it best
we keep it that way.

321
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:56,909
At least

322
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,051
till this crisis is resolved.

323
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,461
I felt I had to tell him, sir.
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:23,786
All right, thank you.

325
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,227
Madame President,
you wanted to see me?

326
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:32,419
Admiral Smith laid out the timeline
for withdrawing our forces.

327
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:35,024
He's saying
to meet Dubaku's demands,

328
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,319
we need to order the pullback
by 1:00 p.m.

329
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,020
That's not much time.

330
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,215
No, it isn't.

331
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,931
Maybe this man, Almeida, will tell us
where to find the CIP device.

332
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,182
Tim Woods just heard from the Bureau.
So far, Almeida's refusing to cooperate.

333
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:55,420
- Maybe he's positioning for a deal.
- Tim doesn't think so.

334
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,566
He said we shouldn't count
on Almeida to talk.

335
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:00,091
I see.

336
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,961
So,

337
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,140
Unless I order our forces
to stand down,

338
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,900
I'll be condemning
innocent Americans to death.

339
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,681
And if we capitulate,

340
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:18,777
thousands of Sangalans
will be slaughtered.

341
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:27,911
How did this happen?

342
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,857
How could we have been
so caught off guard?

343
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:37,511
And now to have to decide
between two impossible choices.

344
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,011
Well, at least one of those choices

345
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,567
does stands a good chance
of preserving American lives.

346
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,896
You mean withdrawal.

347
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:51,021
We are nearing the time
when we may have to consider it.

348
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,769
We're not there yet, Ethan.

349
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:55,939
I can't discuss this.

350
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:59,484
Not until we have explored
every possible option.

351
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,322
Tell the FBI to keep working
on Almeida.

352
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,179
Yes, Madame President.

353
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:19,342
Mr. Buchan,
I've got the secure line.

354
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,765
All right, dial the number.

355
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:29,069
Bill, stop screwing around,
tell me what the hell is going on.

356
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,174
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.

357
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,276
He's working deep cover.
He's working with me.

358
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:35,994
We have proof that he tried
to bring down two commercial airliners.

359
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,701
You don't know the whole story.
That's part of an ongoing operation...

360
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:39,818
Operation?

361
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,164
What kind of an operation puts hundreds,
if not thousands, of lives in danger?

362
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:44,450
Jack, please.

363
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,365
<i>You need to listen.
Our government is corrupted.</i>

364
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,909
There are people on the inside
who are actively aiding

365
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,761
<i>Dubaku and the Juma regime.</i>

366
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,893
The point is, Tony was supposed to be
near the CIP module the whole time.

367
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,659
With him in custody,
we've lost our ability

368
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,744
to control it
and to attack this conspiracy.

369
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,757
Who's a part of the conspiracy?
Give me names.

370
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:07,409
We don't know the extent of it.
But we have reason to believe

371
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:09,860
that members of the President's inner
council are on payroll.

372
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,848
Which agency's shepherding
the investigation?

373
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,683
That's just it. There's no shepherd.

374
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:15,497
<i>There's no agency.</i>

375
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:17,629
<i>This corruption runs deep and wide.</i>

376
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:19,584
We're working outside the government

377
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:22,280
that's why we have
to get Tony back undercover.

378
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:25,929
- He's at FBI headquarters, Bill.
<i>- I never said it was going to be easy.</i>

379
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:27,676
But we have to try.

380
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:33,077
- Chloe's already into their system.
- Chloe's working on this?

381
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,657
Hi, Jack.
It's good to hear your voice.

382
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:38,179
- Yeah, you, too.
- I saw the hearings on C-SPAN.

383
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,986
I can't believe
what the senator said to you.

384
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,741
You looked good though.

385
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:45,850
Jack, we need your help
to get Tony out of there.

386
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,564
There's an agent at the FBI,
Renee Walker. She could help.

387
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:50,481
No, the FBI's been compromised.

388
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:52,870
Somebody in the Bureau
is aiding Dubaku.

389
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:54,812
You don't understand, Bill,
I trust her.

390
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,105
If you think you need to use her
to get Tony out of FBI headquarters,

391
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,131
then do it.
But you'll be making her a target.

392
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:04,692
No, you're right.

393
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,871
We'll do it your way. I can get to Tony,
but Chloe's gonna have to get us out.

394
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,212
We're already on it.

395
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:12,637
Get back to me
as soon as you're ready.

396
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:13,951
I'm on my way.

397
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,725
Hey, Sean,

398
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,443
you know those data-ming plug-ins
we downloaded last week?

399
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,248
Where did we file those?

400
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:44,157
Where did we file those?

401
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:46,773
Yeah, file folder A-76.

402
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,918
- Do you need help with something?
- No. Why?

403
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,757
You seem confused.

404
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:55,874
I just don't like having to dance
around this level four lock-down.

405
00:24:56,915 --> 00:25:00,039
I thought you'd welcome the opportunity
to complain about something.

406
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,198
- Hello?
- Mr. Taylor, it's Samantha.

407
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,933
I was going to call you.

408
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,724
I owe you an apology, Sam.

409
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,115
<i>I was wrong
to confront you like that.</i>

410
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,129
No.

411
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:46,747
You weren't.

412
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:51,424
<i>- I wasn't completely honest with you.</i>
- What do you mean?

413
00:25:54,293 --> 00:25:56,833
Roger didn't commit suicide,
Mr. Taylor.

414
00:25:57,316 --> 00:25:58,594
He was murdered.

415
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,873
I need to see you.
Alone.

416
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:07,105
<i>Will you meet me?</i>

417
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,499
Of course.

418
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,206
<i>Where's the CIP device, Tony?</i>

419
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,081
<i>Who'd you give it to?</i>

420
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:22,872
People you're taking money from.

421
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,129
I thought you'd might like to see
some of their handiwork.

422
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:32,111
You know how many people
they've killed

423
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:34,604
since they went back into Sangala?

424
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:38,579
200,000

425
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,809
and counting.

426
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:43,657
Most of them women and children.

427
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:49,353
You really want this
on your conscience?

428
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,120
My conscience...

429
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:57,284
is clear.

430
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,989
And nothing you can say
or do will change that.

431
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:04,485
So why don't you do the smart thing
and tell President Taylor

432
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,732
to stand down the Strike Force,
because unless she does,

433
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,628
planes will be falling from the sky.

434
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,674
And then you'll have
a whole new batch of photos to look at.

435
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,303
Only this time,

436
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,677
they'll be of dead Americans.

437
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,854
Larry, we need to talk.

438
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:42,931
- Almeida's not going to break.
- We don't know that.

439
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,778
He's a trained CTU agent.

440
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:47,248
He's conducted
interrogations just like this one.

441
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,324
There's nothing you can say to him
that he hasn't said a hundred times.

442
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,336
So, what are you suggesting?
We give up?

443
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,157
I'm suggesting we might need
a more forceful approach.

444
00:27:57,228 --> 00:27:59,922
- You mean torture.
- No, there are methods of coercion

445
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,921
that we haven't considered.
Pharmaceuticals...

446
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,782
I can't believe
you want to have his conversation.

447
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:07,685
- You're not hearing the argument.
- The argument is crazy.

448
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,578
It's illegal.

449
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,523
And it's over. As a matter of fact,
I want Bauer out of here.

450
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,026
He's a wildcard and dangerous.
I want him out of the building.

451
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,918
Go process him out.
I will continue here.

452
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,817
Go! Go! Now!

453
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:39,759
Renee, I was just about to call you.
I may have found the leak.

454
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,837
Someone did a runaround
on the level four lockdown.

455
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:46,340
They circumvented the security fence
and they hacked into the FAA database.

456
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:47,529
Are you sure?

457
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:49,920
I don't know what they were doing,
but they had to navigate

458
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,533
- some very sophisticated software.
- When was this?

459
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,483
- A few minutes ago.
- Any idea who it was?

460
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,039
I might be able to pull a user I.D.
directly out of the terminal.

461
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:59,407
- Which one?
- Mainframe room. Terminal three.

462
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,739
Check it out.
Let me know what you find.

463
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,871
Agent Teller, I need you to prepare
a debriefing packet for Jack Bauer,

464
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,337
- and bring me his personal effects.
- I'll bring 'em.

465
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:11,083
I'll be in my office.

466
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:01,737
What are you doing?

467
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:04,885
What's the matter?

468
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,708
You just stay where you are.

469
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,457
Janis, stop it.

470
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,354
Would you just talk to me.

471
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,566
I know you've been helping
Tony Almeida.

472
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:21,546
- What? Are you crazy?
- No.

473
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:24,655
You broke into the FAA database.
That's your server I.D.

474
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:28,492
Yeah, It's my server I.D.,
but I'm not helping the terrorist.

475
00:30:28,682 --> 00:30:30,702
You want to know why,
I'll tell you. I was worried.

476
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,974
My wife is on one
of those planes up there.

477
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,184
I had to see
if her flight had been grounded yet.

478
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,722
You expect me to believe that?
Why are you sneaking around?

479
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:40,860
Because of the level four lockdown,
it cut me out of the FAA database.

480
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,977
I couldn't monitor her flight.

481
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:46,288
Look.

482
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:47,846
See for yourself.

483
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:55,208
Flight 112 out of Las Vegas.

484
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,295
- Christina Hillinger.
- You just stay there.

485
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:03,631
God, Sean!

486
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,981
You scared the hell out of me!
Why wouldn't you just tell me that?

487
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:10,254
'Cause that was borderline illegal.
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

488
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,223
You looked like
you had enough on your plate.

489
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:15,026
Damn it. I told Renee
I'd found a security leak.

490
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,932
Is that what's going on around here?
There's a security leak?

491
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:20,105
Don't worry about it.
Go back to your station,

492
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,838
keep this to yourself,
and I will clean up your mess.

493
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:24,706
Go.

494
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:30,991
Idiot.

495
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,708
Go ahead.

496
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:40,117
Walker is on her way. She's heading
down the corridor towards your room.

497
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:41,242
Copy that.

498
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,406
- How are you doing with the loops?
- I'm dropping the first one in now.

499
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,821
I have a series of loops,
I'm going to drop them as you go.

500
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:49,263
<i>Security won't see a thing.</i>

501
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,732
Understand.

502
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:52,869
Standing by.

503
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,714
I'm sorry, Jack.
We're proceeding without you.

504
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,008
Wasn't my decision.

505
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,055
We wouldn't have Almeida without you.
We owe you a lot.

506
00:32:14,249 --> 00:32:15,249
Thanks.

507
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:20,354
- That paperwork for me?
- Yeah. You need to fill this out.

508
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:29,676
I'm going to put in a good word
with the Justice Department for you.

509
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,990
Maybe it'll help.

510
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Thanks.

511
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,237
Don't fight it.

512
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:42,612
Don't fight it!

513
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,841
<i>Jack just took out Agent Walker.
He has her keycard and her weapon.</i>

514
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,818
<i>He's going to get Tony.
What's your location?</i>

515
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:23,250
- About ten minutes out.
- Did you get my rendez-vous point?

516
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,296
Just showed up on my GPS.

517
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,583
OK, great.

518
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,348
I've got to go, it's Jack.

519
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:34,407
I'm ready.
I've got access to interrogation one.

520
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:36,877
- What's Bill's ETA?
- About ten minutes.

521
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,123
- How's the corridor?
- Clear.

522
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:42,040
Wait for my call.

523
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,609
Put your weapon down. Now!

524
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:57,159
- What do you think you're doing?
- I said do it now!

525
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,778
- Do it or I will kill him.
- OK, all right.

526
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,908
Put it down. It's all right, do it.

527
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:05,709
Slowly. Slowly!

528
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,574
- Now you. Do it!
- All right.

529
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:20,443
Kick your weapon over to me.

530
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,196
- Come on!
- OK, all right.

531
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:25,368
Uncuff him.

532
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:28,717
Where's Walker?
What did you do to her?

533
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,651
- Shut up.
- You'll not make it out of here.

534
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,027
I said shut up!

535
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:36,896
- I talked to Bill.
- What did he tell you?

536
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,799
Enough.
We're going to get you out of here.

537
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,767
Chloe's tapped into their security.

538
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:43,644
She'll walk us out of this building.
All you need to do is follow my lead.

539
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,309
- Chloe, it's Jack. Do you copy?
- Copy.

540
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:49,166
I got Tony at interrogation one
leading out to the hallway.

541
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,880
OK, I see you. I'm going to direct you
to the southwest exit.

542
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,231
You're in the least populated area
of the building,

543
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,760
but you're going to run into
more resistance before you get out.

544
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,922
- Copy that. You're ready?
- Clear to move.

545
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,519
Hold up, there's two people
coming out of the elevator.

546
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,188
Copy that. Come on.

547
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,406
Listen, Jack, I'm sorry about the stuff
I said back there. I just...

548
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,785
needed to get you close enough
to give you Bill's code name.

549
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:24,371
I'm just glad
I didn't break your neck.

550
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:26,957
Well... You came close.

551
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,961
Yeah, sorry about that.

552
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:33,835
- OK, clear.
- We're clear.

553
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,588
I cleaned up your trail,

554
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:54,594
so we'll just keep
this little transgression between us,

555
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,174
although I don't know
what I'm going to tell Renee.

556
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,558
- Have you heard what I've just said?
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

557
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:02,412
- Take a look at this.
- What?

558
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:05,784
There's a performance hit
on one of our signal routers.

559
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,687
It's down 0.7%.

560
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,861
You're right.
Somebody is riding our bandwidth.

561
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,647
Hacking in? Is that possible?
With all the safeguards?

562
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:22,179
Anything is possible
if you know what you're doing.

563
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,390
They're inside our security sub-net.

564
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,921
They've accessed
the surveillance system.

565
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:31,607
- What are you going to do?
- Lock them out.

566
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:44,993
Jack, you're going to make a left
down the next hallway.

567
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,628
There's an emergency stairwell.

568
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,720
That stairwell'll get us
to the ground level?

569
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,331
Copy that.

570
00:36:57,491 --> 00:36:58,499
Hold on.

571
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,093
- What's wrong?
- I lost my feed.

572
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,428
Chloe's feed just went down.

573
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:07,916
- What'd you do?
- I pinged the line

574
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,569
and it automatically reset.
Someone was hacking in.

575
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:12,819
They were taking out
our surveillance cameras.

576
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,941
- Janis, take a look at this.
- Send it to me.

577
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:26,493
Security, this is Janis Gold.

578
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,371
We have a Code 12 in progress,
we need a team to interrogation one.

579
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,080
<i>All agents,
security breach, Code 12.</i>

580
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,762
We've got to keep moving.
Let's go.

581
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,317
Security team is between us
and the southwest exit.

582
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:00,690
What have you got?
We're boxed in.

583
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:02,698
Someone at FBI is blocking
my every move.

584
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,447
It's really starting to piss me off.

585
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,420
You need to get back into their system.
We're not gonna make it out of here.

586
00:38:07,545 --> 00:38:09,238
Jack, I'm sorry, I'm trying.

587
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:30,140
- We've got to make a move, Jack.
- I know.

588
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,297
Let's go. Now.

589
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:48,273
Come on, Chloe, talk to me.

590
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:50,160
Still locked out.
I'm tring to work around.

591
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,121
- We're sitting ducks if we stay here.
- I know.

592
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,000
Chloe, we have to take the stairwell.
We don't have a choice.

593
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,168
Quietly.

594
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:04,479
Where are they?

595
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,973
- We're looking.
- Find them!

596
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:19,273
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Are you OK?

597
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,803
They're still in the building.
We're trying to locate them.

598
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,699
I can't believe this.
What is Jack doing?

599
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,320
He's helping his friend escape.

600
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,734
- That's what he's doing.
- I'm sorry, Larry.

601
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,650
- I shouldn't have trusted him.
- All right.

602
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:31,410
- I got him!
- Southwest stairwell.

603
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:35,132
Security, this is Agent Moss.
Suspects are in the southwest stairwell,

604
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,225
descending past the fifth floor.

605
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:39,742
Lockdown the building perimeter,
and deploy two teams

606
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:42,878
in the first floor service corridor.
Be aware, the suspects are armed.

607
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:44,047
We need them alive.

608
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:48,772
- OK, I'm back up, Jack.
- Copy that.

609
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,889
What was that?

610
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:55,855
Hacker's back in.
Whoever this is, they're very good.

611
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,102
- Well, lock them out.
- I'm trying!

612
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,213
- Hold up.
- What is it?

613
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:04,803
You're heading into an ambush.
It's a six-men team.

614
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,823
They're heading up toward you
in the stairwell.

615
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:09,487
Understand. We'll evade.
They're coming up the stairs.

616
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,583
Pass me that fire extinguisher.

617
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:29,426
- We're on the roof of the parking lot.
- I see you. Good work.

618
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:31,928
Go to the north end, Jack.
Bill's almost there.

619
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,067
- He's in a blue van.
- Copy that.

620
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,518
They're outside. They went through
the third floor window. Let's go!

621
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,539
Perimeter team,
they're in the parking garage.

622
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:43,690
Notify Metro police. I want them
to cordon off a five block perimeter.

623
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,570
On the right! Get down!

624
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,107
We've got to get you
back undercover.

625
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,014
I'll be right behind you. Go!

626
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,288
This is going to hurt.

627
00:41:58,424 --> 00:41:59,581
Tony, let's go!

628
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,982
Stay low, stay low!

629
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,221
Come on, Jack.

630
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:13,905
Go, Bill.

631
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,085
Agent Moss,

632
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,770
<i>they're gone.
They get outside the perimeter.</i>

633
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,291
Damn it.

634
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:43,528
All right, Chloe, I've got them.
Any sign of pursuit?

635
00:42:43,653 --> 00:42:45,762
Not so far.
They must still be mobilizing.

636
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,772
- We caught them off guard.
- Traffic cams?

637
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:50,493
I'm cycling frequencies
to clear a path now.

638
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:51,618
Good.

639
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,955
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Where are we going?

640
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,474
- It's not far.
- Bill, I did what you wanted,

641
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:59,394
I got Tony out of there.
Tell me what the hell is going on.

642
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,369
When we get there,
I'll tell you everything.
