1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
-Wayne said you wanted to see me.
- Keeler.

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,154
He's bringing your ex-husband
into this debate.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,520
The SEC's investigation into his company.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,875
Ted served his sentence.
You know that.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,920
All Ted Packard wants is money.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,354
If we pay him off,
he'll recant before this debate.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,469
- It's blackmail.
- We can have the money within the hour.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,593
- I thought you were with my dad.
- Your dad's sidelining me. Making me sit out.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,439
Look, I know my dad can be hard.
But he will come around.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,472
We shouldn't have told him.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,956
The only other option
is for us to stop seeing each other.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,476
- Chase, what do you want?
- I wanna be able to do my job.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,317
Linda! I need your help. These guys...
they'll kill me if I don't get 'em something.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,120
- Where are you?
- I'm at the mall.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,873
CTU knows the powder's not real.
They're going after Singer.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,588
- What do you want me to do?
- Take him to containment.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,916
Done.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,520
We believe your son was infected
with the virus in Mexico early this morning.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,478
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,398
Got him. He's at Los Feliz Mall
between Vermont and Sunset.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,909
- I can land a team there in ten minutes.
- OK, fine.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,192
- Kyle.
- Who are you?

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
My name's Tony Almeida.
I'm a federal agent. I'm here to help you.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,469
- I don't believe you.
- Come with me, I'll prove it to you.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,198
We have an officer down.
Kyle Singer is not in custody.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,275
Clear the way here, please.

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,198
Jack isn't picking up. Isn't Tony there?

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,629
I can't get through to him.
I'm trying Micah.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,675
What's going on?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,036
- There's been gunshots at the mall.
- When?

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,720
Two minutes ago. I can't get in touch
with my dad or Tony.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,438
- Micah said someone's down.
- Who?

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,513
It's either Tony or Jack, he's not sure.
He's about to find out.

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,836
Hold on.

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,475
It's Jack. He wants to talk to you.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,920
What's going on? Where's Tony?

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,592
- He's been shot.
- How bad?

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,190
He was hit in the neck. He's alive.
They're getting him to the hospital.

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,909
Oh, God.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,398
I know how difficult this must be for you.
But you need to make a decision.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,309
- What?
- With Tony down, you're in command.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,710
If you wanna be by his side,
you have to hand CTU over to someone else.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,320
No one will fault what you choose to do.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,118
But if you choose to stay,
we need you at full capacity.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,912
- I understand.
- Michelle, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,875
Is Tony all right?

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,795
They don't know yet. He was shot in the neck.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,720
We're overloading the network.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,871
When the virus threat came in
we stole cycles from the main CPU.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
- Chloe, now is not a good time.
- What? Are you out of your mind?

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,595
- Just deal with it, OK?
- Michelle?

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,596
Send the archives to Division.
That should free up the network.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
Fine. That's all I needed to know.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,270
I have to get to the hospital.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,520
The second call from
Hector Salazar's people just came in.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,272
I can't deal with this now.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,120
Who else is there?

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,918
You're the ranking agent on site.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,320
Find out what hospital they took Tony to.

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,713
The second anyone knows anything
you have them patched through to me.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,960
(distorted) Deliver Ram Ãn Salazar to the
Van Nuys dam, adjacent to the 101 freeway.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,160
Provide him with a full-spectrum bandwidth
radio adjusted to frequency XQ2137.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,799
Do not attempt aerial or ground surveillance.

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
You have two hours from receipt
of this message to comply.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,394
If you violate any one of these conditions
we will release the virus.

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,752
- Does the encoding match the first message?
- Y eah.

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,911
- Can you find out where it came from?
- I can scan the frequency.

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
Maybe we'll get lucky.

69
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,150
Whoever sent this message
is controlling Kyle Singer's movements.

70
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,352
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,878
(phone rings)

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,315
- Kyle?
- Linda, where are you?

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm trying to park but they're putting up
barricades. Something's going on.

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,030
No, don't go to the garage.
Meet me outside the east entrance.

75
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,038
- On Vermont?
- Yeah, go there now. I'll be there in a second.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,196
(man) I've found him!

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
Move over. Go!

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,473
- Get over!
- What's going on?

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,113
I don't know.

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,075
- Where are we going?
- We just gotta get outta here.

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,837
(car horn)

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,078
This is our contact frequency. If he shows up,
please let me know as soon as possible.

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,437
- Got it.
- Excuse me.

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,757
What's up?

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,318
Just heard about Tony. How's he doing?

86
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,920
He's on his way to the hospital.

87
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,392
- Why isn't Michelle with him?
- lt'll set us back if they're both gone.

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
- Tell Michelle I'm heading over to Downey.
- To see Salazar?

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
- Yeah.
- Dad said questioning him is a waste of time.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,310
Sitting around here is a waste of time.

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,870
Don't you think you should
clear it with Michelle first?

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,755
We lost the kid who's infected. If anyone
knows where he's going, it's Salazar.

93
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,309
- At least run it by her before you go.
- I'll call her from Downey.

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,351
Chase.

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,273
(phone rings)

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,360
- Dessler.
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife.

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,960
- Yes, this is Michelle.
- Michelle, this is Dr Linzer.

98
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,633
- How is he?
- The wound to your husband's neck

99
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,988
is going to require some vascular repair.
We're just about to go into surgery.

100
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,590
- Can I talk to him?
- No, we 've medicated him.

101
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
That's why I'm calling you.
We need your consent to operate.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,436
- Yes, of course. Whatever you have to do.
- Great. Thanks.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,960
- Are you sure he's gonna be OK?
- We can't be 100% certain till we get in there.

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,635
- But he'll be in good hands.
- Please let me know the second you finish.

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I'll find you in the waiting room
when we're out of surgery.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Doctor Linzer,
I will do my best to be there, but...

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,233
- you may have to reach me at this number.
- OK. We'll find you.

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,437
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

109
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,394
I just spoke with Anne's ex-husband.
I'm meeting him in half an hour.

110
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,273
Unless you're changing your mind.

111
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,675
I've never given in to blackmail in my life.

112
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,917
Considering everything
you're up against, we decided...

113
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,311
I decided, Wayne.

114
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,430
- It's my choice.
- And, David, you're making the right one.

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,555
Give this guy some money, he crawls back
under his rock and life will be a lot simpler.

116
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,197
For Anne too.

117
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,597
(phone rings)

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,312
I hope so.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,112
- Yes?
- (woman) I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.

120
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,874
- Put him through.
- The president's on the line, Mr Bauer.

121
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,720
- Mr President? This is Jack Bauer.
- Hello, Jack.

122
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,396
I was told Hector Salazar has given your
office instructions on delivering his brother.

123
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,033
I've also been told you might be able
to pre-empt that demand.

125
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,120
We identified the person carrying the virus.
It was a young man named Kyle Singer.

126
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,113
- Then you know where he is.
- No, sir. Unfortunately we lost him.

127
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,595
Can you find him?

128
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,712
Not in the time frame
that Hector Salazar has given us.

129
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,078
So either I hand over Ram Ãn Salazar,
or risk that his brother will release the virus.

130
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,875
Mr President, I understand
that this is an impossible choice.

131
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,829
It's not a choice, Jack. Not really.

132
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,948
This nation's policy of non-negotiation
with terrorists has been a proven deterrent.

133
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,312
Capitulating to Salazar
would destroy that policy.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Hundreds of thousands of innocent people
may die within the week.

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,914
More would die in the long run
ifl release Salazar.

136
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I would be declaring open season
on the American people.

137
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,075
- This is your final answer, sir?
- I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack.

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,118
I won't negotiate with terrorists.

139
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,392
I understand, Mr President. Thank you.

140
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Conference in CDC and Health Services.

141
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,920
I want a full briefing on quarantine
and evacuation procedures.

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,876
Yes, Mr President.

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,117
Can you tell me where we're going?

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
I just gotta get outta town for a second,
figure this whole thing out.

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,520
- I thought you had to meet with those guys.
- Things have changed, all right?

146
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,320
What are you into, Kyle?

147
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,520
You ask me to steal money so these guys
won't hurt you over losing their drugs.

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,556
I don't think it was drugs.

149
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,195
What do you mean? What is it about?

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,920
These cops came to my apartment today
and they were saying something about...

151
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,037
using me to bring some
weird disease into the country.

152
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,320
A disease?

153
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,199
This cop, he was saying
that it was inside of me.

154
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,758
In your body?

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,071
I know. It sounds ridiculous, right?

156
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,311
Right?

157
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,153
Man, this whole thing is so surreal, Linda.

158
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,911
- Pull over.
- What?

159
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,035
- I said pull over!
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

160
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,237
Take the car, take the money.
I don't want any part of it.

161
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
Hey, Linda, chill out, OK?

162
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,559
Stay away. If you've got some disease, I don't
want it. You shouldn't have done any of this.

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
- Don't you think I know that?
- Kyle, please.

164
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,520
All right, fine. Fine, baby. You're right.
I'll stay away, OK?

165
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,909
The money's under the front seat.

166
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
Come on, Linda. Please.

167
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
Kyle, I really don't want anything
to happen to you, but I can't do this.

168
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,911
God, how stupid am l? Come on!

169
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,918
Go! Run! Run, Linda!

171
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,155
Go!

172
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,198
No, I have it, OK?
I have it!

173
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,594
Kyle!

174
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,116
We have a monitoring plan for everyone
inside the quarantine zone.

175
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,273
- Define the quarantine zone.
- Everyone within two miles of ground zero.

176
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,160
Ground zero being the shopping centre
where Kyle Singer was last seen.

177
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,360
This is Dr Nicole Duncan with
Health Services. Medical teams are in place

178
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,560
and ready to start screening and releasing
people from quarantine over a 72-hour period.

179
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,394
If we move quickly, we believe we can lower
the prior casualty estimate.

180
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,513
- Lower it to what?
- Between 60 and 90 thousand.

181
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,760
All right, thank you. Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan.

182
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,637
Mr President.

183
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,231
We're about to set in motion a chain of events
that will create panic throughout the country

184
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,360
that will take some time to control.

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,037
If anyone here sees an option that
I'm overlooking, now's the time to offer it up.

186
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
It's Jack Bauer.

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,470
He needs to talk to you in private.
He says it's urgent.

188
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,555
Would you all excuse me for a moment?

189
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,360
In the meantime, I want everyone
to contact their key personnel.

190
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,954
Make sure they're ready to go.

191
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
- What is it, Jack?
- Mr President, is this line secure?

192
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,638
Yes. What do you need to tell me, Jack?

193
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,160
For what it's worth, sir, I agree with
your policy to not negotiate with terrorists.

194
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You didn't call me to express your approval.

195
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,833
- I have another option for you.
- Another option?

196
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,153
Yes. One that I believe will protect
the integrity of this nation's policy.

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
- And stop this outbreak.
- And how would I do this?

198
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,749
- By simply doing nothing, sir.
- Nothing?

199
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,749
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,599
Hector Salazar will view that
as noncompliance.

201
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,679
- Not if he gets his brother back.
- How?

202
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,838
Ram Ãn Salazar would be broken out
and delivered to him.

203
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,560
The public, and other terrorist groups,
would view this as a prison break

204
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
as opposed to a capitulation
to terrorist demands.

205
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,678
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
Who'll break Salazar out?

206
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,749
I will, sir.

207
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
- By yourself?
- I know the prison and the prisoner.

208
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,475
Because of the nature of my involvement
I could break him out and deliver him.

209
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,031
CTU would believe that I switched sides.
The cover story would stay clean.

210
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,593
- This doesn't sound like a one-man job.
- In order to protect you, it has to be.

211
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,957
I don't know, Jack.
There has to be some other way.

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Not in the time that we've got. The Salazars
are gonna release the virus within two hours.

213
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,358
Regardless of how you contain
the initial outbreak,

214
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,872
the resulting civil unrest would far outreach
any quarantine zones established.

215
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,989
The damage to this country, sir,
would be catastrophic.

216
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,312
Mr President, I need your OK on this.

217
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,392
Even if you succeed, I won't be able to correct
your legal status. You'll be a fugitive.

218
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,960
I understand.

219
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,078
- This would be my last assignment.
- I don't know what to say.

220
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,190
If you don't say anything, Mr President,
I will accept that as a go for this mission.

221
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,520
Good luck, Mr President.

222
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,440
I want the information from Dr Duncan
sent directly to my office. My eyes only.

223
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,039
- Wayne? Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,030
- Wait.
- I have an appointment and I'm running late.

225
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
An appointment? The debate starts
in 30 minutes. Who are you meeting?

226
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,713
I'm sorry, but that's confidential.
It's government business.

227
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,515
Does this have anything
to do with my ex-husband?

228
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,599
Like I said, it's government business.

229
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,078
(woman) Surgery. Nurses' station.

230
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
This is Tony Almeida's wife.
I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery.

231
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
Yes, he has.

232
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,157
I wanted Dr Linzer to know
that he's allergic to penicillin.

233
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,075
He's aware. The allergy card was in his wallet.

234
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
Is there any way to know how he's doing?

235
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,037
No, but the doctor will contact you
as soon as he's out of surgery.

236
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,158
OK.

237
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,197
Thank you.

238
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
- Y eah?
- The site profiles are done.

239
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,479
- You've sent these to my system.
- I know. I wanted to come down here anyway.

240
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,518
- Why?
- Because of earlier.

241
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
What is it, Chloe?

242
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,036
I want you to know that I didn't know Tony
had been shot when I was insensitive earlier.

243
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,359
And had I known that I would have been
more careful about my choice of words, OK?

244
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
That's fine, Chloe.

245
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,759
- I do try to be aware of other people.
- I said it's fine.

246
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,672
OK.

247
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,596
- Gael?
- What?

248
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,515
We should be careful with Michelle today.
She's really sensitive.

249
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,512
- About Tony being shot. In the neck.
- Of course.

250
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,159
So make sure everyone
in your department knows.

251
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,192
- (phone rings)
- I've gotta take this.

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,710
A personal cell? Those are prohibited.
They can't be monitored.

253
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm using it for inner agency.
They'll monitor at the other end.

254
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,159
I've really gotta take this call.

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,677
Hello.

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,598
- When did you make the second call?
- 20 minutes ago.

257
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,871
- Are they letting Ram Ãn go or not?
- They're still deciding.

258
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,633
- What are they waiting for?
- I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

259
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,675
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,757
It's not good to touch what's not yours.

261
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,312
- Does your sister know you're here?
- No.

262
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,156
Did you know it was loaded?

263
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,429
It is a nice gun, huh?

264
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,198
Take it, Sergio. It's OK.

265
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,034
You like the way it feels?

266
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,750
Want to pull the trigger?
Hear the noise it makes?

267
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,114
That is what power feels like, Sergio.
It feels like a gun.

268
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,276
Can l?

269
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,150
Sure.

270
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,311
Sure. Come on.

271
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Do you see that vase down there?
OK, now, I want you to aim.

272
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,675
And squeeze the trigger very slowly.

273
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,515
Bueno.

274
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,508
What are you doing?
Get out of here! Go, now!

275
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,953
How many times do I have to tell you?
He's just a boy.

276
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,430
- Your boy needs to become a man.
- No, you're not his father.

277
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,514
What you gonna do, huh?

278
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,150
You gonna shoot me?

279
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,678
Come on. Pull the trigger.

280
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,915
Right here. Come on.

281
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,277
Get in there!

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,150
Hey, what is this?

283
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,034
What are you gonna do to us?

284
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,390
What is this? What are you gonna do to us?

285
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,677
Come.

286
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,879
We never really finished our conversation.
I was wondering what you had decided.

287
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,397
- Decided about what?
- The debate.

288
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,314
What to do about my ex-husband.

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,798
I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago.

290
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,400
I know he's never liked me, but this was
different. He was avoiding me, and...

291
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,392
I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake.

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,152
- What kind of feeling?
- That you're paying Ted to keep quiet.

293
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,560
Is that what you're doing, David?

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,470
Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing
for the right reason.

295
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,149
How can you reward someone
for threatening you with a lie? It's wrong.

296
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
There are political realities I have to consider
if I want to stay in office.

297
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,000
- Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better.
- It doesn't make me feel better.

298
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,833
It just happens to be the truth.

299
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,549
Anne, I have been in this job
for nearly four years,

300
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,071
and I have learned the hard way
that there are no absolutes.

301
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
- Sometimes you have to make compromises.
- Politically, yes.

302
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,949
But when it comes to morality...
David, you have to draw the line.

303
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,037
I have drawn the line.
We're just standing on different sides.

304
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
You're running scared.

305
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,275
I'm fighting to stay in office
and serve the people that put me here.

306
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,200
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and
trust that the people can tell the difference.

307
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,476
- It's not that easy.
- You've never been about what's easy.

308
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,952
You've been about what's right.
That's who you are.

309
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,470
That's who the people elected to lead them.

310
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,355
For what it's worth...

311
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,833
that's who I fell in love with.

312
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,353
I was...

313
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,712
- I was trying to protect you.
- Protect me?

314
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,000
This won't end with Keeler's allegation.
You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs.

315
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,673
- I'm used to public scrutiny.
- Not like this.

316
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,200
This will be different.
And much uglier than you can imagine.

317
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,873
I can defend myself.

318
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,356
(phone rings)

319
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,475
- David.
- Have you made contact with Packard?

320
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,353
- He just got here.
- Are you with him now?

321
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,353
He's coming over now. Why?

322
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,000
Walk away.

323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,116
- What?
- You heard me.

324
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,278
We've been through this.
You decided to bury this, remember?

325
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,000
- I've changed my mind.
- Anne talked to you, didn't she?

326
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,989
Wayne.

327
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,960
Walk away.

328
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,510
- You wanted to see me?
- I've spoken to Chloe and Adam.

329
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,200
We'll cover for you
if you want to be with Tony.

330
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
- Cover for me?
- We know you've got a lot on your mind.

331
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm fine, Gael.

332
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,155
I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load since the
biothreat. I can handle half of Comms as well.

333
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,276
We'll just need a route user password so
we won't be slowed down by authorisations.

334
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,600
It's Joe Tomasello's area. He put a 24-hour
delay on user mods for security.

335
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,195
- What if I called Joe?
- I tried that. He's unreachable.

336
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,555
Is there any other way to do this?

337
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,400
More bodies. We need at least four more
system-ready analysts to take on the work.

338
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
- I can make some calls, get the next shift in.
- I've already tried that.

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,472
By the time they got here it would be too late.
I appreciate this, but it's not gonna happen.

340
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,434
So let's get back to work.

341
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,277
Michelle.

342
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Listen, I agree. We can't run this place
by committee. Let me step in for you.

343
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
- Adam and Chloe stay at their posts.
- What about yours?

344
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,000
At Langley I filled in for my bureau chief
a couple of times.

345
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,278
Was there a biothreat?
President in town? All in one day?

346
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,950
Thank you anyway, Gael.

347
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,672
(phone rings)

348
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,275
- CTU. Bauer.
- Kim, what are you doing right now?

349
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Trying to locate the origin of
that phone call from Salazar's people.

350
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,310
- I need you to do something for me first.
- What?

351
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,672
I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

352
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Look in File Form under the heading
"Federal Transit Authorisation".

353
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,952
What's this about?

354
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
- I need to move Ram Ãn Salazar.
- Why are you gonna move him?

355
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,034
Kim, this has priority clearance.
No one at CTU's supposed to know.

356
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,000
That's why you're the only person I can trust
to do this for me. So please, help.

357
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,275
OK. It's asking for a clearance code.

358
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,391
Hit *99.

359
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,152
Now it wants a password.

360
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,360
Lincoln65fga.

361
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,151
- OK, it's cycling. It's gonna take a minute.
- OK, good.

362
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,158
Look, Kim.

363
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,200
I know you came up to my office earlier
to talk about something important to you.

364
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,351
- I wasn't very supportive. I wanted to...
- You don't have to do this.

365
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,236
Sweetheart, I do. I need to tell you I'm sorry.

366
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,239
I know that I'm overly protective of you.

367
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
I've watched so many things
happen to you, l...

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,992
I don't want you to get hurt any more.

369
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,639
But the fact is, I trust you.
I trust your judgment.

370
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,200
I need you to know that anything you ever
chose to do, I would support you in. OK?

371
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,509
Thanks. That means a lot to me.

372
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,279
Good.

373
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
I love you so much, Kim.

374
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,555
I love you too, Dad.

375
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,439
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right. Is the document up yet?

376
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,512
- Yeah.
- Send it to Warden Mitchell, over at Downey.

377
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,629
- Done.
- OK, good. Let me speak to Chase.

378
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,359
- He's not here.
- What are you talking about? Where is he?

379
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Where is Chase?

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,200
- He went to interrogate Salazar.
- Chase is at the prison now?

381
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,829
He left about 15 minutes ago.
He's gonna be there soon.

382
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

383
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,519
Son of a bitch!

384
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,477
(phone rings)

385
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,160
- Yeah?
- Chase, what are you doing?

386
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,398
- I'm going to talk to Salazar.
- Get back to CTU now!

387
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,400
- And do what? Filing? Maybe some dusting?
- No, work with Michelle and find Kyle Singer.

388
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,550
She's got a dozen lT people on that right now.

389
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
- Listen to me.
- No, listen to me, Jack.

390
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,239
I know you're angry about me and Kim, but
I won't let you stop me from doing my job.

391
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,994
Your job is to follow my orders!

392
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,800
You're in no condition to give me orders.

393
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,634
Chase, I'm warning you. Don't go against me.

394
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,600
Jack, look. You know I respect you,
but you also know I've been covering for you.

395
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,388
I've been keeping the fact that you're a junkie
from Kim and everybody else.

396
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm not doing it any more.
I'm done.

397
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,156
Chase! Chase!

398
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,919
Dammit!

399
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,073
Get this guy processed
and get him outta here.

400
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,400
Agent Edmunds.

401
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,030
- Warden. I need to see Salazar.
- I've got a lot going on right now.

402
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,317
I'll follow up with authorisation,
but I need to see Salazar now.

403
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Salazar's been behind two murders today.
No one gets close.

404
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,713
You don't know what's happening today.
Salazar has information that I need.

405
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,592
- What information?
- Classified.

406
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,473
This is my facility. I need to know.

407
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,073
We're dealing with a major terrorist threat.
Salazar's brother is behind it.

408
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
Confirm it with Division if you want to.

409
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,434
But hundreds of thousands
of lives are at stake.

410
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Jack and I have been here twice a week
for the last three months.

411
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,152
Salazar has prevented us from doing our job
with his lawyers and his due process.

412
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
We don't have time for that.

413
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,192
I need to go one-on-one with him. Right now.

414
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,751
He's in an isolation cell in B block.
Come on, I'll take you.

415
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,400
- Cameras?
- There are three.

416
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,119
- Need 'em turned off.
- It's against regulations.

417
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,439
- There won't be any marks. I promise.
- You've got 30 minutes.

418
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,515
This is Warden Mitchell.
I need you to go black on lsolation B.

419
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,275
- (man) For how long, sir?
- Until further notice.

420
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,795
You are a tough guy, huh?

421
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,557
You are not worried what may happen
if you lay a finger on me?

422
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,672
OK.

423
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,155
If you're not worried, neither am l.

424
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,436
Let me know when you start to worry.

425
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
- Where's Kyle Singer?
- I told you, I don't know.

426
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,839
You're gonna tell me who does.

427
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,791
(Jack) Chase!

428
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,430
Put him in his cell.

429
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,355
- What are you doing here?
- We ran out of options.

430
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,597
We can't find Singer.
Salazar's our only hope. You were right.

431
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
He's tougher than I thought.
Maybe two of us can...

432
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,392
Look, Jack. About what I said before...

433
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,318
- Forget about it.
- So we're OK? You and me?

434
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,789
Yeah, we're OK.

435
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,190
- Tell me about the security cameras.
- They're disabled.

436
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,868
Good. Get him out of his cell.

437
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,873
Are you gonna kill me now, Jack?

438
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,755
I'd love to. But I can't.

439
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,153
If you play this cool,
you're walking out of here now.

440
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,633
You'll be with your brother in the next
couple of hours. Now grab his feet.

441
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,075
Turn and face the wall.

442
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,919
How are you gonna feel, Anne,
if David loses this election because of you?

443
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,959
I don't think that's very likely.

444
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,718
Then you really don't know
what you're talking about.

445
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,120
This allegation may cost him this debate.
David needs this debate to win this election.

446
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,793
- It was blackmail.
- And David made a decision to pay.

447
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,793
It wasn't up to you to change his mind.

448
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,320
If he believed the decision was right,
he wouldn't have changed his mind.

449
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,155
The problem is you can't stand the fact
that your brother wants me in his life.

450
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,554
Because you're a distraction, Anne.
And you're a liability.

451
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,036
Compared to whom? Sherry?

452
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,471
I'm not gonna defend Sherry. She went off the
rails. But at least she understood the game.

453
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,120
She understood David.
She was with him over 20 years.

454
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,920
- I know the kind of man he is.
- You don't know anything about him.

455
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,913
Or what it takes to survive
in the world he lives in.

456
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
We disagree, Wayne. We always have.

457
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,272
Anne, I will not stand by and watch you
jeopardise everything he's worked for.

458
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,197
I won't do it.

459
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,554
I don't scare easily.

460
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,120
After all you went through to put me here,
I can't believe you'd let me out.

461
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,109
Shut up.

462
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,553
I don't believe you sold out. It's not your
nature. But then, why knock out the kid?

463
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,589
Did your government cave, but can't admit it?
Is that what happened?

464
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
You don't look so good, Jack. That's a bitch.

465
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,397
You wanna get outta here? You keep your
mouth shut and do what I say, understand?

466
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,672
We've been cleared to pass.

467
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
The warden wants to see you first.
He'll be here in a minute.

468
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,517
OK.

469
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,959
Don't you move.

470
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,276
Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.

471
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,120
- What's the problem?
- The codes on this transfer order.

472
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,520
They don't correspond to the ones assigned.

473
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,910
Division superseded those access codes.
CTU has a mandated prefix.

474
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,320
- This is yesterday's prefix.
- Son of a bitch.

475
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,871
Someone in my office screwed up.
We'll get you the proper prefix retroactively.

476
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,918
Look, I know about the terrorist threat.
Agent Edmunds told me.

477
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,320
That's why we need to move
the prisoner now.

478
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
It's classified. Priority one.
I couldn't tell you.

479
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
But I can't afford to lose time
over some technical detail.

480
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,276
- Come on, Kevin, help me out.
- Where's Agent Edmunds?

481
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,990
He's searching the prisoner's cell,
trying to find information.

482
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,511
He'll be right behind me.
He can help you out with the paperwork.

483
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,320
