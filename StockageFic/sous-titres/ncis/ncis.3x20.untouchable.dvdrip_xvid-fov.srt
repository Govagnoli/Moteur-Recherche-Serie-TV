1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,865
Lieutenant Lara Hill.

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,066
Stop number 46
on the Boredom Express.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,948
Cheer up. This could be fun.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,819
lf l wanted to knock on doors all day,
l would have joined UPS.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,629
Trust me, brown
is not your most flattering colour.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,308
You're actually enjoying this,
aren't you?

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,461
We're looking for a mole
in the Pentagon, Tony.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,349
Espionage just so happens
to be one of my specialities.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,662
We're interviewing code geeks.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,549
- They're not sure there is a mole.
- Don't you find it a bit coincidental

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,940
that every time the Navy breaks
a Venezuelan code,

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,509
it changes almost instantly?

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,781
All right. l'm trying the back door.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,309
Relax, Ziva David.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,308
We're dealing with a Naval officer.
Not Dr. Evil.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,064
Well, she didn't show up
for work or her interview with us.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,788
No one's been able
to reach her by phone.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,942
- She probably overslept.
- l believe in being prepared.

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,543
So do Boy Scouts.

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,826
Why didn't you bring
Webelos McGee with you?

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,218
l tried.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,460
He was busy.

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,621
l've got an idea.

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,258
How about if l shove you
right through here, huh?

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,498
Don't tell me you're afraid
of a little pussy cat, Tony?

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,506
Looks like blood.

27
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,144
l knew something was wrong
when l got out of the car, probie.

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,108
lnstinct. Pure and simple.

29
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,580
- You either you got it or you don't.
- Yeah, well l heard you squealed

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,059
like a little squirrel
when the cat jumped out at you.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,179
l was saving this for Ziva,
but since you volunteered.

32
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,707
Find the little beast.
Got blood on his paws. lt's evidence.

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,068
- l'm allergic to cats.
- Oh, l'm sorry. l had no idea.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,865
Try holding your breath.

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,498
Our lieutenant suffered
from a single gunshot wound,

36
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,581
Jethro, to the right temple.

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,188
- Through and through.
- Yeah.

38
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,825
lmpacted here.

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,503
Round's still in the book, Duck.

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,504
- Sadly, one less reader in the world.
- Who committed suicide.

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,865
Or maybe she was just cleaning
her gun too close to her head.

42
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,739
- DiNozzo.
- NClS investigates all suicides

43
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,141
- as homicides until proven otherwise.
- Got it.

44
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,984
- TOD, Duck?
- Nine, 9:30 this morning.

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,186
What time was her interview
scheduled for today?

46
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,224
- 1 000.
- Gibbs.

47
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,265
Found it
taped underneath the bureau.

48
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,659
Hundreds and fifties.

49
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,223
Nonsequential.
Maybe 50, 60 grand.

50
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,301
Looks like we found our mole, boss.

51
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,030
Knew she was cornered,
no way out.

52
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,068
- NClS closing in.
- She could have run, Tony.

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,824
Suicide is only for when you know
you're going to be captured.

54
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,663
For you, maybe. This doesn't
exactly look like the bedroom

55
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,309
of a hard-core
super-secret agent chick.

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,183
l have stuffed animals.

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,387
- Okay, l was 1 2. But still, l mean--
- She could have been coerced.

58
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,347
- To be a mole?
- He means to kill herself.

59
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,341
l mean both, DiNozzo.

60
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,866
How many suicides you know make
their beds before they off themselves?

61
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,146
Want me to inform Hill's
command about her death, boss?

62
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,789
- Nope.
- He wants to tell them himself.

63
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,827
- That way he can gauge the response.
- DiNozzo.

64
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,309
On your six, boss.

65
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,301
Get the couch, bookcase
and carpets to Abby.

66
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,109
Oh, on it.

67
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,181
- McGee.
- Yeah, boss.

68
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,904
He's really quick, boss.

69
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,264
All right, l'll hold. McGee,
you go that way. l'll go this way.

70
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,308
We'll corner the guy. You've gotta be
very careful with animals.

71
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,301
They're tricky.

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,302
Hey.

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,939
Or you could just do that.

74
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,509
With me.
We're going to the Pentagon.

75
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,020
- Cryptology unit?
- l need you to translate.

76
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,987
He needs you to speak
the geek for him, McGee.

77
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,708
DiNozzo, find a home for that thing.

78
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,339
Sir.

79
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,348
Agent Gibbs. l understand
you've got an investigation to run,

80
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,989
but l'd appreciate a courtesy call

81
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,539
before you show up here
to interview any more of my people.

82
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,144
We're not here to interview
your people today, Captain Dorn.

83
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,344
- What happened?
- Lieutenant Hill.

84
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,304
Well, what? She didn't show up
for her interview at NClS today?

85
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,863
- Nope.
- lf she's running late,

86
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,102
- l can tell you there's a good reason.
- We know the reason.

87
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,668
She's dead.

88
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,823
- How?
- Appears to be suicide.

89
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,381
Let's continue this conversation
in my office.

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,025
These cryptographers,
they're not like us.

91
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,505
Their lives are about patterns
and numbers.

92
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,059
Tell you the truth,
l don't understand half of it.

93
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,460
But they're tightly wound,
and Lt. Hill was no different.

94
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,100
- You're saying she was suicidal?
- l'm saying that she was withdrawn.

95
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,704
She was socially awkward,
had obsessive-compulsive traits.

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,781
Well, none of that
was in her medical record.

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,019
No, and it wouldn't be.

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,181
These people are recruited
based on their abilities

99
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,705
and sometimes it's a thin line
between genius and--

100
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,303
lnsanity.

101
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,984
Look, a lot of these people
tend to be naturally paranoid

102
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,381
and this mole hunt hasn't helped.
My entire section's on edge.

103
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,983
They should be.

104
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,902
lf there's a leak,
l am telling you right now,

105
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,344
it is not coming from my people.

106
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,538
We found $60,000 hidden
in Lieutenant Hill's home.

107
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,702
She ended up dead instead of
attending the interview she had today.

108
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,905
What does that tell you?

109
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,229
- Lieutenant Hall?
- <i>Sir?</i>

110
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,858
We are now in lockdown.
l want all the work secured

111
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,703
and the section restricted
to quarters until further notice.

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,789
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,510
<i>Attention! lnitiate emergency</i>
<i>plan Alpha.</i>

114
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,826
<i>Shut down your systems</i>
<i>and secure classified material.</i>

115
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,509
<i>When complete,</i>
<i>report to your quarters</i>

116
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,228
<i>until further notice.</i>

117
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,581
Okay.

118
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,219
What now?

119
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,943
Hey, buddy.

120
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,025
Look what l got.

121
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,146
Who found your favourite
little carrot toy?

122
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,505
Come here. Come here. Okay.

123
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,945
Here's a carrot. Yeah.

124
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,419
Good kitty.

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,381
You think that's funny,
probies? Huh?

126
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,900
Getting a chuckle back here
in the peanut gallery? ls that it?

127
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,507
Wanna know how that blood
got there?

128
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,299
You think that's funny?
l'll tell you how it got there.

129
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,744
Garfield, over there.

130
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,829
We found that animal
feasting on this woman's face.

131
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,349
Dr. Mallard
thinks that this kitty-cat is rabid.

132
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,898
Me?

133
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,028
l'm of the opinion
that it's a man-eater.

134
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,546
lt likes the taste of human flesh.
lt starts with the cheeks.

135
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,424
Then it moves to the lips.
The soft bits.

136
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,582
Then it works on the tongue
a little bit until it's just a little nub.

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,627
A lot of blood in the tongue.
A geyser of blood

138
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,746
spewing from this
poor woman's maw.

139
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,470
Get a kick out of this now?
You think this is funny, chucklehead?

140
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,541
That's what it was feasting on
when we found it.

141
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,099
- lt took four tranquilizers--
- That's very dramatic, Tony.

142
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,544
Can we get back to work now?

143
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,780
You heard the lady, probies.

144
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,180
And careful with that,
because it is evidence.

145
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,379
l never get tired of it.

146
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,188
- What'd you find?
- Neighbours were at work.

147
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,183
The woman next door, she was there
but she didn't hear anything.

148
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,261
Wish l had a neighbour like that.

149
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,945
Old bat that lives next to me
complains every time l bring a date.

150
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,544
- Wanna know why?
- Shouting of, ''No means no!''?

151
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,860
That's a good one,
but not even close.

152
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,224
l was actually kidding.

153
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,060
l have the same problem
at my place, Tony.

154
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,585
Really? You have
a surround-sound system too?

155
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,624
No. l'm what you Americans
like to call a ''screamer,'' yes?

156
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,900
- Answer it.
- Well, what do you want me to say?

157
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,389
l don't know. Scream something.

158
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,461
<i>This is Lara. Leave a message.</i>

159
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,588
<i>Hi, Miss Hill. This is Bob calling</i>
<i>with a special offer.</i>

160
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,501
Hello, this is Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

161
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,900
You've called a crime scene.
We're wiretapping this phone,

162
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,061
so please be advised
that we will be contacting you

163
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,549
- at your home.
- <i>My home?</i>

164
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,462
Any time, day or night.
Probably the weekend,

165
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,586
- early in the morning.
- <i>Oh, hello</i>--

166
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,980
That was fun. Telemarketers.

167
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,983
You can't escape them
even when you're dead.

168
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,386
Speaking about escape.

169
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,062
Nobody move.

170
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,870
To assume is to make an enemy
of exactitude, Mr. Palmer.

171
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,100
Because it makes an
ass out of you and me.

172
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,103
ls this the best time
for an attempt at humour?

173
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,589
No.

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,423
We must strive for excellence,
Mr. Palmer.

175
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,698
- Go the extra mile.
- l understand.

176
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,826
Do you, now? Well, that's good.

177
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,458
What exactly was
your assumption?

178
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,861
Well, the instant gunshot
residue test came back positive.

179
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,425
- Yeah.
- She had a pistol in her hand.

180
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,984
She has a hole in her head.

181
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,624
lt would seem reasonable
to conclude suicide, sir.

182
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,429
There's nothing reasonable
about a lovely young girl like this

183
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,787
taking her life
in such a grotesque fashion.

184
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,865
lt's true firearms are the most common
instrument of suicide.

185
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,420
However, women tend to avoid
the proximity of the face

186
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,387
when pulling the trigger.

187
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,381
Vanity, Mr. Palmer.

188
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,705
Simple vanity.

189
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,821
We're not finished
with the external exam, are we, sir?

190
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,309
Well, you're not.

191
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,985
You're so sure
that the cause of death was suicide.

192
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,460
Why don't you work out
how you would prove it?

193
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,949
You want me to--?

194
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,341
Finish the external exam.
Clean, measure, you know, the usual.

195
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,222
You think you can do that?

196
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,939
Absolutely, doctor.

197
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,182
Then work through the procedure,
item by item.

198
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,069
- Make whatever notes you can.
- Right.

199
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,186
- Thank you, doctor.
- Have her ready for autopsy.

200
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,307
- Two o'clock, tomorrow.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,823
- That's why l never had pets.
- You've never had any pets?

202
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,784
- Well, l had Sea-Monkeys once.
- What's a Sea-Monkey?

203
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,229
Basically, brine shrimp
swimming around in green water.

204
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,068
- l know, l thought the same thing.
- What happened to them?

205
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,302
My mother got their sea castles
confused with her mint julep.

206
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,145
- Your mother drank your monkeys?
- lt was the '70s.

207
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,063
- Explains a lot, DiNozzo.
- Went through Lt. Hill's background.

208
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,222
Her phone records, credit card bills,
personal habits.

209
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,427
- No discernible patterns.
- Yet. She's a cryptographer, Ziva.

210
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,546
We could be dealing
with a real pro here, boss.

211
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,986
Well, DiNozzo, if she was a pro,
she wouldn't have killed herself.

212
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,703
<i>You should have heard</i>
<i>this guy, Abby.</i>

213
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,828
Just because someone has
an aptitude for math and science,

214
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,346
it does not make them
some kind of suicidal freak.

215
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,421
A little higher, McGee.

216
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,982
- ls that what people think about us?
- Ask me later, McGee.

217
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,180
- Oh, this better be work-related.
- Oh, it is.

218
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,944
And you're just in time
for the show-and-tell portion.

219
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,589
McGee, if you will.

220
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,989
So Lieutenant Hill sits down
on the couch,

221
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,710
puts the gun to her head and:

222
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,019
l said, ''bang,'' McGee.

223
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,624
l matched the bullet found
in the book

224
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,702
to the Kahr 9 mm in the victim's hand.
Looks like a suicide, right?

225
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,384
- Except?
- When a weapon is used at this range

226
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,666
there's extensive blood splatter
from the exit wound.

227
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,459
But blowback also creates
a fine mist of blood which lands here.

228
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,348
lmperceptible to the human eye,

229
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,546
but not to the magic
of modern science.

230
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,621
You're still dead, McGee.

231
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,781
- And?
- Two steps away.

232
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,863
Voila.

233
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,544
- Footprints.
- Exactly. Which means?

234
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,905
Somebody else was in the room.

235
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,063
No evidence of forced entry.

236
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,861
No bruises or marks to show
that she was forced to pull the trigger

237
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,702
or unconscious when she died.

238
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,426
All we have is this.

239
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,581
Rorschach test from hell.

240
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,945
You believe Abby may be mistaken?

241
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,426
Well, l believe it's gonna be tough
to prove the suicide was faked

242
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,546
when all you got
is two partial footprints.

243
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,383
She could have been drugged.
The killer could have placed the pistol

244
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,701
- in her hand and pulled the trigger.
- The initial tox screens were negative.

245
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,507
Some narcotics are hard to trace.

246
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,861
And as for no evidence of forced entry,
we could be dealing with an assassin.

247
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,590
Or she knew her killer, Ziva.
Probie, it's about time.

248
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,018
l'm starving like Lee Marvin.

249
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,503
Well, then you shouldn't have sent me
for the world's greatest barbecue.

250
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,228
Because l had to wait in line
for an hour.

251
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,505
But it will be worth it.

252
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,268
Welcome.

253
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,626
Hey, boss.

254
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,949
Did you want something too,
because, well,

255
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,624
it's just that you never order.
l can go back. l'll go back.

256
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,463
Sit down.

257
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,180
No one has earned dinner yet.

258
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,705
l agree, though l doubt
this qualifies as dinner.

259
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,906
ln fact, l'm not even sure
what this is.

260
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,221
- A Sea-Monkey?
- Goat. l'm pretty sure it's kosher.

261
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,542
Maybe, but still disgusting.

262
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,822
There is a mole in the Pentagon
and our only lead lies dead

263
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,424
on a slab in Autopsy.
l want answers.

264
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,945
Boss, ran the serial number
on the murder weapon

265
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,459
found in Hill's apartment.
Just got a match.

266
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,349
Purchased six months ago
by this woman.

267
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,984
Lieutenant Keira Napleton?
We just--

268
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,539
lnterviewed her last week.
She's in the same crypto unit as Hill.

269
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,940
Looks like we didn't do
such a good job.

270
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,981
- We'll bring her in.
- DiNozzo.

271
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,542
We'll bring her in now.
We'll eat dinner later.

272
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,822
Good goat.

273
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,749
l'm Special Agent Gibbs.

274
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,785
Keira Nap-- l mean,
Lieutenant Keira Napleton, sir.

275
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,065
Middle name, lngBall.

276
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,619
Family name on my father's side.
Most people would find it--

277
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,749
You're not here
because of a middle name, lieutenant.

278
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,423
This woman is a total turd.

279
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,665
- A geek, yes?
- The term is ''nerd.''

280
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,025
Whatever. l'm saying,
it's hard to picture her as a killer.

281
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,780
Remember the time that we Super
Glued McGeek's face to his desk?

282
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,703
Yeah, that's a good point.

283
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,903
Am l to assume
l'm in some form of legal trouble?

284
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,061
l only ask because
no one has informed me

285
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,347
of my Article 31 rights yet, sir.

286
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,708
Want me to read them to you?

287
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,749
- Actually, l have them memorized.
- Good. That'll save time.

288
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,466
l was interviewed by NClS, sir.

289
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,145
l am not a traitor to my country.

290
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,668
How about her?

291
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,106
You think Lara was the mole?

292
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,458
- Tell me about her.
- Well,

293
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,019
she was Catholic,
liked to play softball.

294
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,908
Her left leg was longer
than her right.

295
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,504
l'm more interested
in her being dead, lieutenant.

296
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,866
l don't know, sir.

297
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,420
Perhaps she was depressed?

298
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,985
Enough to blow her head off?

299
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,900
She shot herself?

300
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,503
With this.
A Kahr 9 mm. Yours.

301
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,662
<i>What was that doing in her house?</i>

302
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,385
<i>The real estate market,</i>
<i>being what it is</i>--

303
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,268
And the forecasted projections
over the next--

304
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,863
Lieutenant!

305
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,268
l have orders for Norfolk, sir.

306
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,829
So l sold my townhouse.

307
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,426
Lara let me stay with her
until l shipped out.

308
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,381
- Convenient.
- Most people would think so,

309
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,824
but the commute wasn't better--

310
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,824
Meaning, she wasn't alone
when the trigger was pulled.

311
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,502
You think l was there with her?

312
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,147
Sir, if l was,
l would have stopped her.

313
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,749
Where were you?

314
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,300
l was at Alphonse's last night.

315
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,699
My boyfriend.

316
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,663
<i>l went straight to work</i>
<i>from his house.</i>

317
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,263
- l don't believe it.
- She appears to be telling the truth.

318
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,341
No, l mean the part
about her having a boyfriend.

319
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,739
Come on.

320
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,502
l need his number and address.

321
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:26,061
l'd appreciate it
if you kept this quiet, Agent Gibbs.

322
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,066
My parents--

323
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,628
They still think l'm a virgin.

324
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,899
How much longer
is this gonna take, Agent McGee?

325
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,708
Hard to say, captain.

326
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,430
Agent Gibbs doesn't like
to be interrupted during interrogation.

327
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,739
lt's almost 0200 in the morning.

328
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,980
We're just getting started
here, skipper.

329
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,222
Agent Gibbs, do you think
Lieutenant Napleton's the mole?

330
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,507
She's staying here
until we check her alibi.

331
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,145
Alibi? For what?

332
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,023
lt's too soon to say.

333
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,306
Well, we have
another problem now.

334
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,949
Security may have been
compromised.

335
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,069
- May have?
- After you left today,

336
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,266
l conducted a thorough inventory
of our section.

337
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,341
Every piece of technology
was scrutinized.

338
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,909
Do you know what this is?

339
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,429
Yeah. lt's one of those memory
doodah things for a computer.

340
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,627
Yeah, basically we use it
to transfer data between terminals.

341
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,428
At night they're checked in,
kept in a vault.

342
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,866
They never leave the section.
l found this today in its proper place.

343
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,509
The only problem is...

344
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,579
...someone took
the memory cartridge out.

345
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,310
- Who has access to the vault?
- Two people:

346
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,142
Lieutenant Hill
and Lieutenant Napleton.

347
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,504
What was on it?

348
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,865
Could be anything.
lt holds over two gigs of information.

349
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,305
McGee, bag it. Get ahold
of Ziva and Tony,

350
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,145
- tell them we're heading out.
- l got it. Where to, boss?

351
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,619
To look for the other doodah that goes
inside that one.

352
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,668
- On it.
- Agent Gibbs, this is my fault.

353
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,905
l've already offered my resignation
to the admiral.

354
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,140
Don't fall on your sword yet,
captain. Like l said,

355
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,584
we're just getting started here.

356
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,746
That flash card could be anywhere.

357
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,265
lf you find it, though,
try not to touch the contacts.

358
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,269
Mossad training does not
include food service.

359
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,149
This thing hasn't been cleaned
in years.

360
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,709
lt's a heating duct, McGee.

361
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,909
Nobody cleans heating ducts.
Except for you, that is.

362
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,822
God, it smells like
it's been here for a month.

363
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,140
That's exactly why
l don't have a roommate.

364
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,062
Roommates are never a good idea.

365
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,188
- Did you ever have one, boss?
- Three, McGee.

366
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,749
They're called wives.

367
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,345
Pack up. l found it.

368
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,103
Looks like they're putting decoder rings
in cereal boxes again.

369
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,828
What?

370
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,739
A little before our time, boss.

371
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,099
Find anything, Abby?

372
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,023
l pulled a partial print
off the flash card. l'm running it now.

373
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,784
Rough night?

374
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,349
ls there any other kind with Gibbs?

375
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,546
lt could be worse.
lt could be Saturday.

376
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,661
lt is Saturday, Abby.

377
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,627
See? lt just got worse. Thanks.

378
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,939
Do you have any Super Glue, Abs?

379
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,708
What did l tell you
about that, DiNozzo?

380
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,700
The skin might not grow back.

381
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,622
- What do we have?
- The partial print didn't match

382
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,258
anyone at the crypto unit
so l'm running it through AFlS

383
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,261
- and other databases.
- McGee.

384
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,346
Dumped the contents
of the flash card.

385
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,229
lt's encrypted so we're gonna need
someone from the crypto section

386
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,028
to have access to their codes.

387
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,704
- Captain Dorn is coming in later.
- Whoa, not so fast, Gibbs.

388
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,223
l got a hit.

389
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,540
lt's from the
Office of Foreign Missions.

390
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,348
Name's Simon Roca.

391
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,502
He's the protocol officer
at the embassy of Venezuela.

392
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,189
He's got an apartment
in the Watergate.

393
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,703
Been on station since last June.

394
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,385
lf Hill was selling code, Roca could
be the source of the money we found.

395
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,064
He killed her because she wouldn't
hold under questioning.

396
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,381
- We bringing him in?
- We can't.

397
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,706
Can't? He murdered a Naval officer,
boss.

398
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,508
He has a licence to kill, McGee.

399
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,548
He's got full diplomatic immunity.

400
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,865
<i>What can the State Department do</i>
<i>for NClS</i>

401
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,066
<i>at 7:30 on a Saturday, Agent Gibbs?</i>

402
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,141
l've got a dead Naval officer
who might be a mole.

403
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,540
Evidence connects her
to a foreign diplomat.

404
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,462
- <i>What country?</i>
- Venezuela.

405
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,068
His name is Simon Roca.

406
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,788
<i>Bad choice. Pick another.</i>

407
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,139
l wanna question him.

408
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,949
<i>You're aware of our current</i>
<i>relations with Venezuela?</i>

409
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,509
They're about to get worse.

410
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,662
<i>They've already accused us</i>
<i>of meddling in their internal affairs.</i>

411
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,627
<i>The Venezuelan</i>
<i>petroleum minister has threatened</i>

412
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,987
<i>to cut off future oil shipments and</i>
<i>to close their refineries in the U.S.</i>

413
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,664
Sounds like a real headache.
What time can l question him?

414
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,106
<i>The man has diplomatic immunity,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

415
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,900
The man's a foreign intelligence officer
who murdered a Navy lieutenant.

416
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,419
<i>You have proof of this?</i>

417
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,746
Her death was made to look
like a suicide.

418
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,179
<i>Meaning you can't prove it.</i>

419
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,262
His prints were found
on classified Pentagon hardware

420
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,148
recovered from
the dead woman's home.

421
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,268
<i>The Vienna Convention exists</i>
<i>for a reason, Agent Gibbs.</i>

422
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,581
<i>lf you can prove he committed</i>
<i>murder. l mean, prove</i>--

423
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,264
By the time l prove it,
Roca will have left the country.

424
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,819
<i>Then we take your proof</i>
<i>to the Secretary</i>

425
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,787
<i>and if she signs off on it,</i>

426
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,783
<i>we then ask the Venezuelan Foreign</i>
<i>Mission to waive his immunity.</i>

427
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,020
<i>Not very likely.</i>

428
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,023
And he walks for murder?

429
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,868
<i>l don't make the rules, Agent Gibbs.</i>

430
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,941
<i>l do, however,</i>
<i>expect you to follow them.</i>

431
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,307
<i>Until we give you permission,</i>
<i>you can't question Roca.</i>

432
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,258
<i>Where's he going? Gibbs. Gibbs.</i>

433
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,940
- Hey, boss.
- Nice try, probie.

434
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,221
Power nap, boss.

435
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,745
Doorman at the Watergate hasn't
seen Roca for the past two days.

436
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,423
He's probably holed up
in their embassy.

437
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,621
Take Ziva. Find out.
You can't question him.

438
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,384
Gonna be awful hard to get
answers if l can't ask questions.

439
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,745
DiNozzo, if it was easy,
l would send Joe the janitor.

440
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,219
Customs hasn't checked
his passport in the last 24 hours.

441
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,745
- Most likely still in country.
- Not for long.

442
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,629
The Venezuelan Embassy
booked a private jet this morning

443
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,746
out of Loudoun County Airport.

444
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,542
- To leave when, McGee?
- Sorry. Today.

445
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,065
Simon Roca's name
is listed as a passenger.

446
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,107
We need to tie Roca
to Lieutenant Hill's murder

447
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,783
before he boards that plane.

448
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,588
Go. Go.

449
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,060
How do we prove the lieutenant's
death wasn't a suicide?

450
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,186
- ln a day?
- Abby, l think she was unconscious

451
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,624
when it happened.

452
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,384
lf Ducky can examine the brain
tissue and send me a sample,

453
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,461
- l might be able to prove that.
- Yeah, do it.

454
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,663
Ducky doesn't get in till noon.

455
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,106
Do you want me to call him
or do you want the pleasure--?

456
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,583
You know, l've been thinking, Tony.

457
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,140
Remember when we were locked
in that container?

458
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,902
You said you used
to take piano lessons?

459
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,186
Well, l think you should start again.

460
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,819
l could teach you.

461
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,185
Who knows, maybe it could be fun.

462
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,429
Tony.

463
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,350
But l'm sure you'd make
a lousy student anyway.

464
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,698
- Do it and die, Amadeus.
- l thought you were asleep.

465
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,703
- You thought wrong. l was meditating.
- About?

466
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,146
When you said you were a screamer,
you did mean--

467
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,538
l did.

468
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,105
We've got company.

469
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,458
lt's a restricted zone.

470
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,860
- You can't park here.
- NClS.

471
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,063
We are looking for Venezuelan
Protocol Officer Simon Roca.

472
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,458
Don Juan.

473
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,066
We give them nicknames.
Helps relieve the boredom.

474
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,018
People think Secret Service is like Clint
Eastwood protecting the president.

475
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,987
Yeah, <i>ln the Line of Fire</i>.

476
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,106
- lt's a good movie.
- l wish it were that exciting.

477
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,419
How do you like NClS?

478
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,584
lt has its moments.

479
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,628
- Good hours?
- ls Roca in or not?

480
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,860
As a matter of fact, he is,
which is unusual.

481
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,907
- Why is that?
- l've been here over a year,

482
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,947
Don Juan's never spent
the night before.

483
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,029
Day guy logged him in
1 1 :1 6 a.m. yesterday.

484
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,629
Looks pretty refreshed to me.

485
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,349
Who is that with him?

486
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,784
That's Don Juan's driver.

487
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,827
Looks like they're getting ready
to go for a ride.

488
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,743
- All right, thanks.
- You bet.

489
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,904
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>

490
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,662
<i>Roca's inside the embassy.</i>
<i>Looks like</i>

491
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,428
he's taking sanctuary till his flight.

492
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,979
Stay on station and set up
a video link to MTAC.

493
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,307
- l wanna know when he moves.
- On it.

494
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,584
You weren't planning
on sleeping, were you?

495
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,026
Not unless you're planning
on taking a shower anytime soon.

496
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,386
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,908
l don't know about this, Abby.

498
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,789
Dr. Mallard won't even let me
sit in his chair without supervision.

499
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,305
That's because you mess
with the height adjustments, Jimmy.

500
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,265
- You can do this.
- This is not a good idea.

501
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,109
We don't have time to wait
for Ducky on this, okay?

502
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,779
What comes first?

503
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,141
- The saw?
- Careful, okay?

504
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,902
These are all
in a very specific order.

505
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,903
Stop being so ''Palmer,'' Jimmy.

506
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,785
All right. l will need a scalpel.

507
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,184
Jimmy, are you really gonna do this,
or am l?

508
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,909
l'll do it.

509
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,707
What exactly are you two doing?

510
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,508
Oh, l-- Dr. Mallard.

511
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,982
l-- The thing is, l--
She made me do it.

512
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,061
Well, everything seems to be
in order.

513
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,949
Why don't you begin,
Mr. Palmer, while l get changed?

514
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,543
You're not mad?

515
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,702
Work cannot stop, Mr. Palmer,
because my mother's nurse

516
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,145
elects to abandon us
on a Saturday morning.

517
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,870
l applaud your initiative.

518
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,705
- So, what did you do with your mom?
- Donald.

519
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,264
You promised me
we were going for a ride.

520
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,500
We did go for a ride, Mother.

521
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,025
Oh, well very well.

522
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,101
You drive too fast, Donald.

523
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,022
ls that our housekeeper?

524
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,028
Mother, Mrs. Leary left
for lreland ten years ago.

525
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,347
- Hello, Mrs. Mallard.
- Hello.

526
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,388
Ask the boy to pour me a drink.

527
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,986
We're not at home, Mother.
And Jimmy is not a servant.

528
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,988
Very well. l shall do it myself.

529
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,581
Abby, would you do me a favour?

530
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,425
- l mean, just until we finish?
- Oh, lovely single malt--

531
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,501
Of course.

532
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,221
Mrs. Mallard?

533
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,620
Would you like to see
my mass spectrometer?

534
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,786
What a charming young lady.
Of course l would, my dear.

535
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,859
What is a mass speedometer?

536
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,220
Does it move very fast?

537
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,062
Well....

538
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,024
Can l ask you a question?

539
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,222
Yes.

540
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,300
You really think l smell?

541
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,698
l was just kidding.

542
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,707
- What about now?
- You are disgusting.

543
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,701
You do that again and l'll shoot you.

544
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,069
- Got it?
- Start the car.

545
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,027
What good will that do
when you're still in it?

546
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,224
- lt's Roca's car.
- Gibbs, Roca's leaving.

547
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,779
Boss, the private jet he booked
is refuelled, standing by.

548
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,423
Diplomat's car is considered
foreign soil.

549
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,182
lt's as sovereign as the embassy.

550
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,068
What do we do?

551
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,822
Delay him.

552
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,509
Okay, here we go.

553
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,503
Hippopotamus amphibious.
The river horse.

554
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,099
l once swam with them
while l was on safari in Kenya.

555
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,909
Oh, dear. My apologies.

556
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,823
No. That's Bert, the hippo.
He's supposed to do that.

557
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,423
Really?

558
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,262
How delightful.

559
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,581
Reminds me
of my bagpipe-playing days.

560
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,349
Did you know,

561
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,981
that without those longshoremen
tattoos and that dog collar,

562
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,303
you are the exact spitting image

563
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,301
- of my sister Gloria?
- Thank you.

564
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,824
l hated her.

565
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,946
She once tried to sleep
with my late husband

566
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,066
- while he was still alive.
- Mother!

567
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,262
l'm sure Abigail doesn't want to hear
any more of our family troubles.

568
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,301
lt's fine, Ducky.
We're having a good time.

569
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,823
Brain tissue.
l need a full rundown--

570
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,026
Donald, did you sleep with her?

571
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,499
Mother, please.

572
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,787
Honestly, it's about time
l had some grandchildren.

573
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,908
He isn't getting any younger.
You need to move fast.

574
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,461
How exactly does Gibbs
expect us to delay him?

575
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,188
l have a plan. Buckle your seatbelt.

576
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,908
- What?
- Buckle.

577
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,824
Come on, look out.
Look out. Look out.

578
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,144
Boss, this was recorded
five minutes ago.

579
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,466
Looks like Roca managed
to avoid Tony and Ziva.

580
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,779
You think, McGee?

581
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,702
His plane is scheduled
to depart within an hour.

582
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,220
l guess we can't win them all.
l mean, he--

583
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,704
The plane hasn't left. Delay it.

584
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,221
- How exactly?
- Call the control tower.

585
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,421
Tell them there's
a possible security risk.

586
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,019
- Make something up.
- Can we do that?

587
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,504
l don't know, McGee. Can you?

588
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,224
Feed from the State Department
is coming in, sir.

589
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,666
<i>What the hell were your people</i>
<i>thinking, Agent Gibbs?</i>

590
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,707
<i>That was a diplomatic</i>
<i>vehicle they rammed.</i>

591
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,549
You told us that we couldn't
question Roca.

592
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,507
He wasn't in the vehicle
What's the problem?

593
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,138
- <i>You don't understand the</i>--
- Are you worried about insurance?

594
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,102
NClS has excellent coverage.

595
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,420
<i>You're straining an already</i>
<i>tenuous situation.</i>

596
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,945
We both know that Roca
is no diplomat.

597
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,624
He's a foreign spy
operating on American soil.

598
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,462
- <i>Then prove it.</i>
- Give me permission

599
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,985
to take him into custody.
lf it helps, tell your people

600
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,028
that he may have documents
vital to our national security.

601
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,863
<i>All right.</i>

602
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,066
- <i>l'll start the paperwork from this end.</i>
- How long?

603
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,381
<i>lf l fast track the request,</i>
<i>maybe a week.</i>

604
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,461
Okay, l talked to the control tower,

605
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,700
convinced them to re-screen
all the passengers.

606
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,781
Small airport, delay them
an hour or two at the most.

607
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,783
Roca is on a private jet right now.
He's leaving the country.

608
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,424
<i>The best l can do is lodge a formal</i>
<i>complaint with the embassy</i>

609
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,864
<i>and bar him from returning.</i>

610
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,340
He's not coming back, Levinson.
He is getting away with murder.

611
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,864
Someone's trying to gain access into
MTAC with an unauthorized code, sir.

612
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,185
Here.

613
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,828
- Hello?
- This thing must be broken.

614
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,221
l can't see anyone dancing in there.

615
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,745
- Sir?
- We're okay. lt's clear.

616
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,503
Should l get State back?

617
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,422
For what?

618
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,790
Mrs. Mallard,
are you looking for your son?

619
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,101
Young man,

620
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,942
have we met before?

621
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,748
Leroy Jethro Gibbs, ma'am.

622
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,628
Of the Southampton Gibbs'?

623
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,179
Why don't we see if you can't find
Dr. Mallard, all right?

624
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,387
You're very handsome, Matthew.

625
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,187
Are you married?

626
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,260
l'm so sorry, Dr. Mallard.
l just turned my back for a second.

627
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,308
Not to worry, Jimmy.
l lose her all the time.

628
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,665
l mean, she's really fast for her age.

629
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,058
Yes, l'll call security.

630
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,621
You may find it hard to believe,
but Donald was the cutest child.

631
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,583
He had long, curly blond hair.

632
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,423
Everybody thought he was a girl
until he was 1 2

633
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,069
when his voice changed.

634
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,188
Mr. Palmer, will you chain
my mother to the chair

635
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,506
while l tell Agent Gibbs
what l found?

636
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,507
l'm still waiting for that drink,
Leonard.

637
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,306
l'm certain the shot to Lieutenant Hill's
head was perimortem

638
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,223
based on the lack
of tissue reaction in her brain.

639
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,819
- When shot she was unconscious.
- How'd she get that way?

640
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,981
This is the lieutenant's head
and neck.

641
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,308
The left superior carotid artery
is narrowed.

642
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,540
- Restricted blood flow.
- Choke hold.

643
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,340
Slight pressure for ten seconds
will render a victim unconscious

644
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,307
and leaves no external bruising.

645
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,622
l gave Abby some brain tissue
samples to check for CO2 levels.

646
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,939
Any way to tie Roca to it?

647
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,146
Well, he didn't leave any prints
on her skin.

648
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,902
There's a chance
that some of the samples

649
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,305
we took from her body
could have his DNA.

650
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,745
But then, we don't have his DNA
for comparison.

651
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,220
- And with diplomatic immunity?
- His plane leaves in two hours.

652
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,588
- Find me something.
- Matthew, l'll be expecting your call.

653
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,824
l can't remember my number,
but you'll get it from Donald.

654
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,144
l tried everything.

655
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,380
Yeah, it's encrypted,
and we change the codes every day.

656
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,148
Can you extract a date?

657
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,823
l could try.

658
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,261
You know, Lieutenant Hill
could barely drive her own car.

659
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,660
l find it hard to believe
that she could be the mole.

660
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,707
That's probably why she was
so successful at it.

661
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,019
Yeah.

662
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,306
Not exactly the way
l wanted to end my Naval career.

663
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,585
Asleep at the damn switch.

664
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,184
- What was on that doodad thing?
- Can't tell yet, boss.

665
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,306
l need one of my people
down here to decode it.

666
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,506
- Are you still holding Lt. Napleton?
- Yep.

667
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,104
Well, if you've cleared her,
l could sure use her help.

668
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,864
What? Do you think
she's involved?

669
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,500
We're investigating treason, skipper.
Right now, l suspect everyone.

670
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,060
Well, if Hill wasn't the mole,
why'd she blow her brains out?

671
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,664
She didn't. She had help.

672
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,460
l found a fingerprint
on that flash-chip thing.

673
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,983
Probably the person who did it.

674
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,307
- Napleton?
- The protocol officer

675
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,744
from the Venezuelan Embassy.

676
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,108
Before you ask: No, l haven't found
any physical evidence linking

677
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,147
Simon Roca
to the lieutenant's murder yet.

678
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,183
That can wait, Abs. l need you to do
something else for me.

679
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,669
lt'll only take a few minutes.

680
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,345
Might go faster
if l have another one of these.

681
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,147
Too much caffeine
is not good for you, Abby.

682
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,425
l need you to check
this cereal box for GSR.

683
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,342
- Why?
- Because l don't think

684
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,308
Lieutenant Hill put the chip in there.

685
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,900
l'm begging you, please.

686
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,140
No. No way.

687
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,985
l don't care how nice you are,
how much you bribe me,

688
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,301
or how much you threaten me.

689
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,147
l'm not filling out the paperwork.

690
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,746
lt's not the filing
of the accident report l object to.

691
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,185
l'd prefer if you said
you were driving the car.

692
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,183
Well, that would be lying,
and lying is bad.

693
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,818
Will you just listen to me?

694
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,742
l'm listening.

695
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,308
You're right.

696
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,862
l'm sorry.

697
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,262
l've been at NClS
for a short while.

698
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,343
And it would look very bad to have
another accident in my dossier.

699
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,662
- Another accident?
- l've had some difficulties.

700
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,508
''Some'' indicates more than one.

701
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,309
- How many?
- ls that really important?

702
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,379
Three.

703
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,108
But the second was not my fault.

704
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,142
Now, are you going to help me?
Yes or no?

705
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,221
Oh, that depends.

706
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,659
What's in it for me?

707
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,870
Anything you want.

708
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,621
- Anything?
- Hey. Button your shirt.

709
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,985
- Hey, boss, she came into my space--
- l don't care.

710
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,058
- Roca's at the damn airport.
- Yeah. That's my fault, boss.

711
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,663
l take full responsibility.

712
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,862
l shouldn't have let Ziva drive.

713
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,704
- lt doesn't fit.
- l know.

714
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,863
l talked to my tailor about that. He says
the whole point of bespoke tailoring is--

715
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,261
- But you mean Simon Roca.
- He's got diplomatic immunity.

716
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,580
He knows we can't stop him
from leaving this country.

717
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,189
So why the shell game with his car?

718
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,950
ln fact, how did he even know
we were on to him?

719
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,347
Yeah, Gibbs.

720
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,060
On my way.

721
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,741
- What was that for?
- Blackmailing your partner.

722
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,583
Boss, the flash card data,
it's too corrupted to read.

723
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,587
l'm gonna take a copy back
and have my people--

724
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,978
lt's too late.

725
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,061
Our person of interest
just got clearance for takeoff.

726
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,905
You wanna see the guy who killed
your lieutenant get away? Come on.

727
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,265
Gibbs, come here.

728
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,868
You were right.

729
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,260
DiNozzo, David, McGee.
Waiting for an invitation?

730
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,668
What, just like that?
He gets a free pass?

731
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,298
When a foreign diplomat
is accused of espionage,

732
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,949
all we can do
is ask him to leave.

733
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,543
Roca's doing it on his own.

734
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,304
But if he could walk at any time,
why did he murder my lieutenant?

735
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,938
Without her testimony,
hard to prove a case against him.

736
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,380
So that's it,
there's nothing we can do?

737
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,269
No, l didn't say that, skip.

738
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,909
We can still arrest her murderer.

739
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,260
Outside of my team, only two people
know how Lieutenant Hill died.

740
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,945
Napleton and the person
who killed her.

741
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,750
How'd you know she shot herself?

742
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,263
Napleton told me.

743
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,422
No, she's been in isolation
since she found out.

744
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,865
You were the one who told us
about the missing flash card.

745
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,787
The only thing tying Roca
to the case.

746
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,062
Convenient, yes?

747
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,266
Holing up inside the embassy, huh?

748
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,821
Booking private planes.

749
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,260
You wanted us to focus on Roca.

750
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,866
- No. But Lt. Hill stole that flash card.
- There's gunshot residue

751
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,907
on the outside of the cereal box
we found it in.

752
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,904
The flash card was put there
by the killer after he shot her.

753
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,225
She was framed.

754
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,308
No. Napleton could have--

755
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,940
- Her alibi checked out, Dorn.
- l'm impressed.

756
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,578
The diplomat takes the blame.
We get our mole.

757
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,420
And your cover remains intact,
captain.

758
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,269
l'll have to remember that one.

759
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,105
- You could just rent <i>No Way Out</i>.
- l'll take it from here.

760
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,263
You three go home.
Get some rest. Good job.

761
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,348
That resignation you offered
the admiral earlier.

762
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,989
l got a feeling he's gonna accept it.
