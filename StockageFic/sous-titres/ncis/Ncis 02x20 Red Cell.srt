1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,720
You have entered the circle.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You have felt the flames.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,120
You have suffered the seven trials.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,560
You have reached the
moment of your final test.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,240
Are you prepared?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,040
- Yes, sir.
- Then let's do it.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,400
Go!

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,480
Last one to the house
drinks the keg dregs!

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,840
I love Hell Week.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Did you see their faces?

11
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,870
Strike Force Command, this is
Red Leader. Alpha Team is in play.

12
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,830
Roger that, Red Leader, I have visual. You've got hostiles
on both the north and east quadrants of the building.

13
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,070
Hostile on the left flank. All teams prepare
for entry. Our target is located on the...

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,550
Say again, Strike Force
Command. Did not copy your last.

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,190
Uh, wait one, Red Leader.

16
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,550
Copy that. Red Unit, hold your positions

17
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,070
Hi, Probie!

18
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,550
Uh, David, I have to call you back.

19
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,470
Copy that, McGee

20
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,750
I told you he was a boxers guy.

21
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,670
Damn, McGee, I thought for sure
you were a tighty-whitey man.

22
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,950
Come on, let's get dressed. You
don't want to keep Gibbs waiting.

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,190
You said 0900. It's only 7:30!

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,030
We thought we'd observe you
in your natural environment.

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,790
Kind of like watching
National Geographic.

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,470
We watch as the McGee moves slowly from
the watering hole trailed by hyenas.

27
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,070
Is this the History Channel Room?

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,990
Ah... this is where you
do your writing thing, huh?

29
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,590
Look at this.

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,550
"The Continuing
Adventures of L.J. Tibbs."

31
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,150
That's personal!

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,110
Hmm...

33
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,670
I wonder who "L.J. Tibbs" could be?

34
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,550
Check it out. He eats dinosaur cereal.

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,070
Okay, wod you both please just wait
by the door? By the door, please?

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,470
Got any Macy Gray in here?

37
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,870
Wait, Tony, don't touch those. Those
are collectibles. They're very valuable.

38
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,150
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.

39
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,870
I just thought they
were musty old records.

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,390
It's bad enough having to work on Sundays,
without you guys ransacking my appartment.

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,670
Yes, it was very inconsiderate of that
Marine sergeant to die on a weekend.

42
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,270
I'm getting my weapon.
Don't touch anything else!

43
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,990
Hey!

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,790
George Clooney could not
get laid in this place.

45
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,750
Your place needs a lot of help, McGee.

46
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,190
At least you're not building
a boat in your basement.

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,150
Come on.

48
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,030
Tim?

49
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,750
Strike Force Command, this is
Red Leader. McGee, are you there?

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,950
This is Strike Force
Command. Do you copy?

51
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,670
Based on the rigor resolving itself, I'd say
our Sergeant's been dead for at least 36 hours.

52
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,710
I'm more concerned with
how it happened, Duck.

53
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,230
Well, apart from the obvious,
he took a tumble down the hill.

54
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,550
Neck's probably broken.

55
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,950
Yeah, but then, we never do put
too much emphasis on the obvious.

56
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,550
Do we, Sergeant?

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,270
Ow!

58
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,510
It's remarkable how these college
hangouts all smell the same.

59
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,030
Stale beer, tobacco...

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,590
...vomit.

61
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,390
It's from the kid that found him.

62
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,070
Any idea why the young
man is half-naked?

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,630
It must be a college thing.

64
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,590
Hey...

65
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,310
... where you been?

66
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,430
Stopped for coffee.
Got... you are welcome.

67
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,710
Marine Sergeant Joseph Aaron Turner. Found
dead at 0200 by a drunk college student.

68
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,030
Sounds like Hell Week.

69
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,190
Hell Week?

70
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,350
Yeah, fraternal rite of passage.

71
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,790
Worst week of my life.

72
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,830
Followed by the best four years.

73
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,110
Yeah? You were running around
in your skivvies, DiNozzo?

74
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,190
Technically.

75
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,350
But back then, they made
us wear them on our heads.

76
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,950
I think it was a...

77
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,030
... sort of a character-building thing

78
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,230
Certainly explains a lot.

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,270
- Uh-huh. Hey,
McGee... -Yeah.

80
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,110
- Find out what Turner was doing on campus.
- On it.

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,030
Excuse me, Special Agent Gibbs?

82
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,750
I wonder if we could let Mr. Pippin
go home and dress more appropriately?

83
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,510
Sure. After one of my agents
interviews him. DiNozzo.

84
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,870
Um, you know, I think that's
really more up Kate's alley.

85
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,910
Well, maybe, but you two
have so much in common.

86
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,790
Go.

87
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,390
This area popular with students?

88
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,550
For all sorts of extracurricular
activities. Bonfires, fraternity pranks...

89
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,150
Hazing?

90
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,030
We've had our share of incidents.

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,750
Broken bones, alcohol poisoning.

92
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,990
And this isn't the first
accidental death we've seen.

93
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,870
Who said anything about an accident?

94
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,110
You think this is a homicide?

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,910
Until I find out it wasn't.

96
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:11,310
Boss, I had Turner's SRB pulled. He's an NROTC student
attached to the Waverly University campus. Lives in the dorms.

97
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,510
Get an address?

98
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,070
Uh, just getting on that.
I'm going to radio his unit.

99
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,750
I thought college students
were supposed to be poor.

100
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,230
Most of my midshipmen would not have survived without
at least 200 channels and a DSL hook-up, Agent Gibbs.

101
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,990
How long have you been Turner's Marine
Officer Instructor, Captain Lemay?

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,750
Since he enrolled last year.

103
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,110
You expect to lose men in
combat, not on the college campus.

104
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,830
- What the hell happened to my Marine?
- Working on it, Captain.

105
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,070
What can I do to help?

106
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,110
You can start by telling us about him.

107
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,550
He was one of my best midshipmen.

108
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,870
Came to us straight from the fleet after
two combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

109
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,350
How is he taking to college life?

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,110
There's a fair amount of culture shock,
but like any good Marine, he adapted.

111
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,190
- Any personal problems or issues?
- We had a few incidents with student activists on campus.

112
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,070
Protesting the war?

113
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,190
Protesting anything military.

114
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,430
Our unit was vandalized, rallies outside our offices.
When word got out that Turner was a vet, he took some heat.

115
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,670
What kind of heat?

116
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,310
Name-calling, mostly.

117
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,630
Turner handled it like most Marines.

118
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,750
Not well.

119
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,070
He lost five Marines
in his squad in Iraq.

120
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,790
He handled it as best
he could, Agent Gibbs.

121
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,710
He was a damn fine Marine.

122
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,150
- And intelligent, too.
- Boss...

123
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,510
This is graduate-level mathematics.

124
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,910
- Theoretical calculus.
- He was on the advanced track in math and physics.

125
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,630
He was a real asset to the Corps.

126
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,990
You're blowing in my ear, Mr. Palmer.

127
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,350
Oh, sorry, Doctor.

128
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,390
Something piqued your interest?

129
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,950
It seems this break is too
clean to be the result of a fall.

130
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,310
Correct. If he landed on his
neck, this would be jagged here.

131
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,230
But this? This is too precise.

132
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,390
- You notice anything else?
- Uh, he took a beating.

133
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,110
Yes, bruises round the eyes, knuckles grazed...
but what captured my attention most were these.

134
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,510
This coloration suggests they were recent-
inflicted on our poor Marine just before his death.

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,150
Do we know what caused
them? We do not... yet.

136
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,070
This reminds me of an English earl
who was abducted and asphyxiated.

137
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,470
- Every bone in his body was broken.
- What happened to him?

138
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,670
Well, it was on a moonlit night...

139
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,950
We know what killed him yet?

140
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,910
Sergeant Turner was involved in a nasty
fight that resulted in a broken neck.

141
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,470
- He was murdered.
- Yeah.

142
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,870
What about these welts?

143
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,630
Well, certainly painful,

144
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,030
but they didn't do any internal damage. Mostly
surface. You thinking what I'm thinking, Doc?

145
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,030
I'm afraid so, Jethro.

146
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,270
Call me when you find out.

147
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,990
Find out what, Doctor?

148
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,630
Sergeant Turner...

149
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,670
...may have been
tortured before his death.

150
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,150
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

151
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,150
So that's what happened
to the English earl.

152
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,950
What English earl?

153
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,470
You said Turr was smart, McGee, when, in
fact, you should've said he was brilliant.

154
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,710
These equations rock.

155
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,190
It's Homology.

156
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,870
Mm, close. Cohomology

157
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,230
I think it's Homology.

158
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,710
No it's cohomology. I did my independent study in
advanced string theory; so I think I would know.

159
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,750
- I see you're playing the MIT card again.
- No, I just happened to go to school there.

160
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,270
And you just happen to
talk about it... a lot.

161
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,550
Oh, so glad to see you two
don't need adult supervision.

162
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,190
McGee was annoying me again.

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,990
Don't.

164
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,270
- What do we have from the crime scene?
- Oh, um...

165
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,550
I got Turner's toxicology report back.

166
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,310
His blood alcohol level
was.07- not drunk.

167
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,830
Not sober, either. What else?

168
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,070
- There were foreign blood samples found on
his face and his knuckles... Yeah, and?

169
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,870
And a Chinese menu of chemicals found on his skin. Mixed dried paint,
turpentine, bleach-it's like he was partying in a janitor's closet.

170
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,510
What about Turner's laptop?

171
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,870
Well, I completely underestimated
the depth of his mathematics ability.

172
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,150
I thought that he was concentrating on numerical analysis,
but it turns out he was also working on fiber bundles.

173
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,510
I mean, the work's a little rough...

174
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,950
- Anything connected to his death, McGee?
- Not yet.

175
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,590
Um, I didn't go to MIT, but
I think I found something.

176
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,790
Turner had a private container. It's like a vault
inside the hard drive where he can hide files

177
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,670
... very sophisticated.
- Can you open it?

178
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,790
They don't call me "Five Fingers Sciuto"
for nothing. Actually, nobody calls me that.

179
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,230
- My nickname was actually Vamperstein, but I never
really liked the sound of it. Ah, Abby...

180
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,790
Right. Too much caffeine. Sorry

181
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,710
It'll take just a second...

182
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,350
And...

183
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,190
we... are...

184
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:37,950
... in.

185
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,150
It's an encrypted e-mail.

186
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,510
He received it on Friday.

187
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,470
Same day he was killed.

188
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,230
One, two, three!

189
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,910
That's it!

190
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,550
One, two, three!

191
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,550
Maybe I should give you a break, you
know... because you're college girls.

192
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,230
What do you think, Simmons?

193
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,310
No, Gunnery Sergeant?

194
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,470
Damn straight!

195
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,990
To me, you're midshipmen!

196
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,350
Barely! Understood?

197
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,710
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant!

198
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,630
You pull a stunt like that again with me, and
you can both kiss your scholarships goodbye!

199
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,670
Go!

200
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:19,950
A way!

201
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,990
Gunnery Sergeant Leeka

202
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,710
Special Agents Gibbs
and Todd- NCIS.

203
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,230
Sorry you had to hear all that.

204
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,430
What'd they do?

205
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,710
Notice the hair, ma'am?

206
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,470
Oh... Not regulation?

207
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:34,830
No.

208
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,910
Purple and orange?

209
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,470
Oh.

210
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,270
Sometimes I feel like I'm
a kindergarten teacher.

211
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,950
Oh, yeah... I'm familiar
with the sentiment.

212
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,030
So, Captain Lemay said you wanted
to talk to me about Sergeant Turner.

213
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,190
- What kind of midshipman was he, Gunny?
- He put most of those kids to shame, sir.

214
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,110
Would've made one hell
of a Marine officer.

215
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,270
Your captain said that he had
problems with war protesters?

216
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,790
Eh, you could say that, ma'am.

217
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,990
One of them spit on his uniform.

218
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,470
Turner cleaned his clock.

219
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,630
Well, do you think this protester
was the type to look for revenge?

220
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,350
You saying Turner was murdered?

221
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,750
- We are.
- I want to know why.

222
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,470
- Simmons!
- Sir!

223
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,030
- Get me Midshipman Blake!
Double-time! -Yes, Gunny!

224
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,430
Blake's a Petty Officer.

225
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,190
He was tight with Turner; he's also the one that pulled
him off the protester before the campus cops arrived.

226
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,350
Who else was Turner tight with? Blake'll know.
They're the only two enlisted men in the unit.

227
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,830
Excuse me, Gunnery Sergeant.

228
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,070
- What, Simmons?!
- Midshipman Blake didn't report to formation this morning.

229
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,670
Blake's never been UA-
not since I started here.

230
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,710
You telling me Petty
Officer Blake is missing?

231
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,670
No, I'm telling you
that he is, Agent Gibbs.

232
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,030
No one's seen Blake since Friday night.

233
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,290
Oh, hi, ladies. Oh, God, I miss college.

234
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,010
Find the room yet, probie?

235
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,770
- Right here.
- Yeah. Blake's not there.

236
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,810
You never told me you had a brother.

237
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,650
Any idea when he's coming back?

238
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,370
I haven't seen him for a couple days.

239
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,730
You guys are definitely not campus cops.

240
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,010
- I make you for FBI.
- Wrong. NCIS.

241
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,090
- That stands for...
- Yeah, I know what it stands for.

242
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,010
You're here 'cause of Turner, right?

243
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,690
Did you know him?

244
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,850
I was in his NROTC unit.

245
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,010
- Oh, wow! These are the new docking stations for the...
- Yeah, yeah. He just got that.

246
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,290
For the new Axxum X-5 handheld
computer. It's sweet, right?

247
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,210
Sweet!

248
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,930
Shouldn't you guys be wearing rubber gloves? You're
completely compromising the integrity of the crime scene.

249
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,650
It's not a crime scene.

250
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,170
It's a dorm room.

251
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,850
- You totally think Finnegan had something to do with Turner's death.
Why else would you be here? You got us, Sherlock.

252
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,330
Maybe they were partners in some kind of illicit
business- like, they dealt drugs on campus.

253
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,570
- Well now, did they?
- No. I was being hypothetical.

254
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,130
Do you guys have a warrant?

255
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,130
'Cause if you don't, nothing you find here will be admissible
in court. Unless, of course, you have probable cause.

256
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,410
That is exactly what we have.

257
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,170
- I don't know. Just because he wasn't home?
- Little girl, what's your name?

258
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,050
- Simon Frankel.
- Okay. Listen, Urkel,..

259
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:17,570
...we're here on official business, so why don't you go back to your dorm
room and play Dungeon Master, and let professionals do their work, okay?

260
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,850
I'm just trying to help.

261
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,050
You want to be a big help?

262
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,810
Yeah. Definitely.

263
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,570
Okay. Put your hands in the air.

264
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,650
Nothing to be worried
about. Spread your legs.

265
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,090
Okay, stick out your tongue.

266
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,370
You're the gargoyle
that guards this door.

267
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,930
- That was nice.
- But they don't pay us to be nice, McGee.

268
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,290
Hey!

269
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,170
Put on some gloves.

270
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,970
There is definitely
something wrong with this guy.

271
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,730
What?

272
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,570
Listens to folk music.

273
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,890
There's something else wrong
with this guy too, Tony.

274
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,370
A bloody rag.

275
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,410
Nice work, McGee.

276
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,370
That's a lot of blood loss.

277
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,450
Injured?

278
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,530
Or dead?

279
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,970
Message on the left
was on Turner's laptop.

280
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,370
Message on the right
was found on Blake's.

281
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,290
He received it on Saturday, boss.

282
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,130
- Who sent them?
- McGee's working on it.

283
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,130
What else do we know?

284
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,890
- No one on campus has heard from Blake since...
- Friday.

285
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,890
And Abby says that the blood on the
rag and bed matches Blake's type.

286
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,890
Two enlisted men:

287
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,650
One missing, one dead...

288
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,090
...what do they have in common?

289
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,730
The resentment of the Coalition
Alliance Team for Peace, Gibbs.

290
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,730
Cat-Pee. Not a very attractive acronym.

291
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,730
Their leader's a Waverly
senior, Hunter Huxley.

292
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,490
He's been arrested five times for disturbing
the peace. He's majoring in political science...

293
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,010
Minoring in antigovernment subversion and sticking it to
The Man. I dated a girl like that in college once, boss.

294
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,930
Wasn't bad till she stopped
shaving her armpits and her...

295
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,450
She owns a car dealership now, in
case you were looking for a good deal.

296
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:58,090
Huxley's been leading the antiwar protests on campus, and last month,
at a peace demonstration in front of the NROTC building, we know...

297
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,250
...that he started spitting on midshipmen.
- And Sergeant Turner dropped him.

298
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,130
After that, Huxley made Turner his
personal target. Harassed him regularly.

299
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,490
- You think he could've taken it to the next level?
- I think you and Kate are gonna go find out.

300
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,810
Hey, turn that frown upside down,
sweetie. We're going back to college.

301
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,130
Tony, your problem is you've never left.

302
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,290
This is what I'm talking about. It's
like I'm having flashbacks or something.

303
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,930
I'm surprised you even remember college.
You spent most of it throwing up in a urinal.

304
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,850
Well, I'm pretty sure you spent your Saturday nights
alone, in your PJs, watching Julia Roberts videos.

305
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,810
Oh, you don't know
what I did in college.

306
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,770
Mm, but I do know what you
did on your Spring Break.

307
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,330
I knew it! You still have that
wet T-shirt photo, don't you?

308
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,210
- I don't.
- You swear?

309
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,330
Well, I don't have it on me.

310
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,410
- A-Chi! Way
to go! -Yeah.

311
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,010
God, you're pathetic.

312
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,210
Gotta move on, DiNozzo. They're over.

313
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,250
- What's over? - Your glory years. 
They've passed you by. It's time to retire the beer bong.

314
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,290
- Ouch, Kate. Ouch.
- Oh...

315
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,970
There's our budding anarchist....

316
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,050
...is the puppet of corporate America!
This is an immoral act! No... more... war!

317
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,210
No more war!

318
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,490
Learn the truth about this war!

319
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,410
Your government doesn't trust you, don't trust your
government! Hey, man, help us defeat Big Brother?

320
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,330
We kind of work for him.

321
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,730
- Agents Todd and DiNozzo, NCIS.
- I got a permit to be here.

322
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm sure you do. That's not the
reason we're here, Mr. Huxley.

323
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,450
Sergeant Joseph Turner.

324
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,930
If he's pressing charges on me,
then I'm pressing charges on him.

325
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,090
That fascist nearly broke my jaw.

326
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,050
I'd hold off on the charges.

327
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,730
He's dead.

328
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,170
What?!

329
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,850
His body was found on
campus Saturday night.

330
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,050
- You hadn't heard about that?
- I've, uh, I been out of town. I just got back today.

331
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,330
That's convenient.

332
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,050
Hold on a second. You think I did it?

333
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,570
- Well, you two didn't exactly get along.
- Well, yeah, because tried to beat the crap out of me.

334
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,770
After you spit on him.

335
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,850
You do realize I'm a
peace activist, right?

336
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,530
Anti-violence.

337
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,330
Maybe you knew his friend, too?
Petty Officer Finnegan Blake?

338
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,850
He was a midshipman.

339
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,490
Been missing since Friday.

340
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,090
I get it! So this is
how it happens, huh?

341
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,650
They send their Gestapo goons
to try and quiet the movement.

342
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,370
You planning on arresting me?

343
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,410
- It's crossed our minds.
- Do it.

344
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,890
I'm not afraid of you, I'm
not afraid of your tactics.

345
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,370
You should really meet
our boss. He'd like you.

346
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,010
And you should really meet
my lawyers. They'd love you.

347
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,250
The student organizations
alone are mind-blowing.

348
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,210
- Did you know that there are seven online mystery
writer workshops on campus? No, I didn't.

349
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,530
But I'm sure you're going to tell me
what that has to do with our dead Marine.

350
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,330
I thought that whoever was involved in
Turner's death might have a campus Web account,

351
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,410
...so I hacked into the servers, looking for
any mention of Turner or Blake. -Okay. Any hits?

352
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,170
No- the servers have
been pretty quiet.

353
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,650
What is that?

354
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,690
Someone's IM'ing Sergeant Turner.

355
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,010
- It's an "Instant Message," Gibbs.
- It's like an e-mail, but live.

356
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,250
Just put it up on the plasma.

357
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,010
"Hello, NCIS."

358
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,170
He's not on Turner's buddy list.

359
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,610
He's probably using an alias.

360
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,810
Can you trace it, McGee?

361
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,250
If we can keep him online

362
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,050
- Abby, talk to him.
- Okay.

363
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,930
Hello, Creepy Voice.

364
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,730
"You're looking in the wrong places."

365
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,530
He's diverting his connection
through half a dozen servers.

366
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,810
We've got the Baltimore Public Library
by way of a public server in Buffalo...

367
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,690
That's it- get
him. Get him, McGee.

368
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,090
Where should we be looking?

369
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,410
Deeper.

370
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,490
Oh, come on. How's that gonna help us?

371
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,210
I've back-traced him to the
Waverly University campus.

372
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,290
Where on campus?

373
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,530
Almost there.

374
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,370
Look beyond the surface.

375
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,610
Oh, that's a really sucky clue.

376
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,770
When you say "beyond the surface",

377
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,730
are you being literal or metaphorical?

378
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,810
I'm just trying to clarify.

379
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,610
"They're everywhere."

380
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,210
Okay, I've got it down to one city block.
Right off of campus. Just one more second...

381
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,610
Goodbye.

382
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,690
Got him, boss!

383
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,930
Yeah.

384
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,410
You are sure about this, right?

385
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,730
I was able to triangulate the connection to the
campus servers, and then reran the back-trace...

386
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,850
Just answer the question, McGee.

387
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,490
Yes. I'm sure, boss.

388
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,650
Let's do this. Kate, cover the back.

389
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,890
No, no! Stop!

390
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,330
Federal agents! Don't move!

391
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,650
I am going to kill McGee.

392
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,370
We got it covered, Kate!

393
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,690
So, is Gibbs still mad at me?

394
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,530
About what, Probie?

395
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,690
Dead Marine on campus?

396
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,170
The missing Petty Officer?

397
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,370
Computer hacker who might be
part of a radical peace movement?

398
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,450
None of these things are your fault...

399
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,610
... really.

400
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,890
But sending Gibbs on a panty raid?

401
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,490
He's going to kill you.

402
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,570
Hey!

403
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,650
I want answers.

404
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,170
Where is Abby?

405
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,170
She's on a run to the
evidence garage, boss.

406
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,090
She's on a run to the
evidence garage, boss.

407
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,930
Anything on the hacker?

408
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,970
Um, he was on a wireless connection.

409
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,250
The house you hit was set up for WiFi.

410
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,410
He was probably sitting
somewhere outside on the street.

411
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,130
But I'm working on
tracing him right now.

412
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,730
You tell Abby I want her.

413
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,930
Oh, Gibbs, I never knew!

414
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,890
Ducky asked me to help him figure
out where the welts came from.

415
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,530
I think I'm gonna start with the ball peen hammer.
I don't know why. I just like the way it sounds...

416
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,290
...ball peen, ball peen,
ball peen, ball, peen, ball...

417
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,090
What else?

418
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,850
Um, probably go with the stun
gun, and then the Garden Weasel.

419
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,090
And someone is in a really bad mood.

420
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,690
Spending the night in a room full of
crying women tends to do that to me.

421
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,330
Well, this will cheer you up.

422
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,810
I got the analysis back from
the blood found on Turner's body.

423
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,010
It belongs to your
missing petty officer.

424
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,090
Blake? You're kidding.

425
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,610
I also ran the bloody
rag from Blake's house.

426
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,850
Most of it is his,
and some of it is not.

427
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,010
Sergeant Turner's?

428
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,490
Bingo.

429
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,570
Was his name-o. Blake and
Turner were in a fight.

430
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,770
And one turns up dead and
the other hits the road.

431
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,570
Or they were killed together
at the same location, Kate.

432
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,810
It's the hacker. He's sending
us another instant message.

433
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,930
"NCIS, if you want the truth,..."

434
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,490
"...be at Unity Quad,
ten-hundred hours today."

435
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,410
- He's somewhere on campus right now.
- Tony, Kate, you're with me.

436
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,810
And you get me an exact
location this time.

437
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,090
- You sure you can do it?
- Positive. I think.

438
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,970
Excuse me.

439
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,290
How can we be sure Creepy
Voice is even here, McGee?

440
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,530
Because, Tony, the campus WiFi
system is broken down into nodes,

441
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,610
...and our hacker's signal
is coming from Node Five

442
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,810
Yeah? What does that mean?

443
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,255
Hi.

444
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,970
It means he's somewhere in the quad right now. So
look for somebody with a laptop or a wireless device.

445
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,570
Not real helpful, Probie.

446
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,690
Less chatter.

447
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,730
Keep your eyes open. Find him... or her.

448
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,770
Boss, your 1:00.

449
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,730
Red hat, sunglasses,
looking real suspicious.

450
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,490
That's what I'm talking about.

451
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,370
Don't you get enough of that at home?

452
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,690
My Internet connection's down.

453
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,770
Yeah.

454
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,890
It's 10:45.

455
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,450
The hacker's playing with us again.

456
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,890
No, Kate, I'm telling you he's
here. Look for something abnormal.

457
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,850
You're gonna have to
be more specific, McGee.

458
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,210
Look out! Move!

459
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,010
Out of the way! Hey, watch it!

460
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,890
Move it!

461
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,610
I'd say that's abnormal.

462
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,370
We've got two suspects,
one in a black ski mask.

463
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,050
Moving to intercept.

464
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,010
They're coming out of the tunnel.

465
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,170
Okay.

466
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,890
Hey, get out of the way!
Move it! Get out of the way!

467
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,170
Clear the way! Get out of my way!

468
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,330
You're dead!

469
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,170
He's got a gun!

470
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,290
NCIS! Federal agents! Drop the weapon!

471
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,250
Put down your weapon!

472
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,850
- Drop the weapon!
- Hold your fire!

473
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,490
What's going on?

474
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,690
Shut up, dumbass.

475
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,450
That hurt?

476
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,330
Yeah.

477
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,570
That hurt, right there?

478
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,690
Yeah.

479
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,290
"Kyle Zolin". He's a midshipman.

480
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,170
Yeah. Gibbs.

481
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,090
Gibbs, Gibbs, I figured it out.

482
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,690
- I know what caused the welts on Turner's body.
- We know.

483
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,490
A paintball gun.

484
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,930
I really, really hate
it when he does that.

485
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,890
Whoops.

486
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,930
You retreads think you
deserve to be officers?!

487
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,650
Do you?!

488
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,850
Playing illegal games on campus?!

489
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,570
- You're lucky I don't rip your heads off and stomp on them!
- Agent Gibbs'll take it from here, Gunny.

490
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,970
Yes, sir.

491
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,850
I expect you gentlemen to
answer his questions truthfully.

492
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:52,890
Sit down.

493
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,850
Where's Finnegan Blake?

494
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,850
We don't know, sir.

495
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,650
How many midshipmen in this
little paintball club of yours?

496
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,090
Uh... yeah, that's right.

497
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,250
You turn them in, they'll probably
be kicked out of school just like you.

498
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,850
It's admirable;

499
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,050
...protecting your friends.

500
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,290
Turner... does not need protection.

501
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,370
He's lying dead on a
slab with a broken neck.

502
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,410
- I think Blake is the one who put him there.
- No.

503
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,610
No, not possible, sir.

504
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,570
- They were best friends.
- Yeah?

505
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,490
Then why were they beating the
crap out of each other Friday night?

506
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,290
You were there!

507
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,370
Yes, sir, but it's not what you think.

508
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,970
They tossed a couple
punches, we broke it up.

509
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,730
An hour later, they were drinking
beer and laughing about it.

510
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,330
Does that look like a couple
of punches to you, Midshipmen?

511
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,650
His neck is snapped in half.

512
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,610
He, uh... he didn't look
like that when he left.

513
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,610
What was the fight about?

514
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,690
Turner never lost a paintball game,

515
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,610
...so Blake decided to change
the rules. By killing him.

516
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,290
No, sir.

517
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,450
We play one on one, but Friday morning we
all got Turner's target photo in our e-mail.

518
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,570
And we ambushed him.

519
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,570
It was supposed to be funny.

520
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,850
I want the names of
everyone in your club.

521
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,290
You do that, and we can
talk about your futures.

522
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,090
And if we don't?

523
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,090
Son, you trust me.

524
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,010
You will not do well in prison.

525
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,290
They call themselves "The Red Cell."

526
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,970
They all claim the last time they saw Blake
was on Friday night, right after the fight.

527
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,530
We think they were protecting him.

528
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,730
Who else knew about the group?

529
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,130
According to them, no one.
Only the Red Cell members.

530
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,530
First rule of Fight Club: Never talk about
Fight Club. God, that's a great movie.

531
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,050
Brad Pitt, Edward Norton.

532
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,290
It's, like, the greatest guy movie...

533
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,770
...ever. I'm going to rent that for you.

534
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,370
They're either lying, or one of them
is the hacker that led us to the group.

535
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,370
Find them.

536
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,370
Boss?

537
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,210
Find my hacker yet?

538
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,610
Uh, no, but...?

539
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,890
Poor Probie.

540
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,850
- You think he needs a group hug?
- Oh.

541
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,530
I found Blake.

542
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,490
I've been monitoring the campus WiFi nodes, waiting for the
hacker to come back online, and that's when I thought of it.

543
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,690
When we searched Blake's room, he had the docking
station for an Axim X5 handheld computer,..

544
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,810
...but the unit itself
was not in his room.

545
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,010
And they're, like, 2,000 bucks. He probably took
it with him when he pulled his disappearing act.

546
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,050
Why does this matter?

547
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,970
Because it has wireless built in. It
automatically connects to the nearest network.

548
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,290
He's online right now.

549
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,490
Where?

550
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:05,330
Waverly University, Node Three. And according to the network
logs, he's been hiding out there since Saturday morning.

551
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,690
Not bad, McGee.

552
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,490
Let's roll.

553
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,770
See? I told you he likes you.

554
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,770
You sure about this, Tim?

555
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm sure.

556
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,210
He's here, or at least his computer is.

557
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,970
Well, I hope for your
sake that you're right.

558
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,130
I'm right, okay?

559
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,890
Wait.

560
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,490
He's in the building
right behind this one.

561
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,930
Got some bad news for you, Probie.

562
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,690
I don't understand. He should be here.

563
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,130
- Maybe he disappeared with the building.
- I'm telling you, it's here.

564
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,170
The signal's getting stronger.

565
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,650
It's here!

566
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,690
Where?

567
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,210
It's right below me.

568
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,970
He must have buried it.

569
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,930
We're being screwed with again.

570
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,410
It's the hacker, McGee.

571
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,610
I found something!

572
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,210
It's a body.

573
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,370
It's laying face down. This
is where the head should be.

574
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,170
He's wearing a hood.

575
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,010
This is now a crime scene.

576
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,290
It's Blake.

577
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,530
He's not lying face down.

578
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,890
Petty Officer Blake was killed
early Saturday morning...

579
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,290
...just hours after
Sergeant Turner's death.

580
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,810
Now we're dealing with a killer who's not
only extremely powerful, but methodical.

581
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,610
Each of these young men
had their necks broken...

582
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,090
...in a violent and identical fashion.

583
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,410
I think by someone
using their bare hands.

584
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,210
Well, how's that?

585
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,250
Ah.

586
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,610
Well, it's a very specific technique.

587
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,290
- May I demonstrate, Mr. Palmer?
- Of course, Doctor.

588
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,850
Yes, well, one hand is
placed firmly on the jaw here.

589
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,650
- And the other hand...
- I'll do it, Duck.

590
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,650
Thank you, Jethro.

591
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,530
This ought to be good.

592
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,370
No, on you.

593
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,695
You think that's really necessary?

594
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,650
Yeah, it'll be fun. You
can either lie on the floor,

595
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:21,810
or I'll drop you on the floor.

596
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,490
We used this to silence enemy sentries.

597
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,730
One hand on the jaw, the other
behind the head of the individual.

598
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,850
66 pounds of torque and...!

599
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,290
Your eyes are in the back
of your head, DiNozzo.

600
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,530
Any questions?

601
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,970
No, I think I got it, boss.

602
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,690
You missed your calling, boss.
Could've been a chiropractor.

603
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,570
We're looking for someone
who knows how to kill.

604
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,810
Yes, but what troubles me is our
midshipmen, in order to receive such a...

605
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,450
...killing blow, would have to have
been face-to-face with their assailant.

606
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,410
Which means either
they were ambushed or...

607
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,410
They knew him.

608
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,570
Hey. Another midshipman?

609
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,810
They teach combat
courses at an NROTC unit.

610
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,250
Maybe. You found my hacker yet?

611
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,890
McGee's upstairs working on it.

612
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,330
I didn't ask McGee.

613
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,370
I asked my senior field agent.

614
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,930
I want that damn hacker.

615
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,010
Did you hear that, Palmer?

616
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,610
- Yeah, he sounded pretty upset.
- No,...

617
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,050
...he called me his senior
field agent. Finally!

618
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,290
This guy's good, Abby.

619
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,770
He's too good.

620
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,930
Yeah, but we... are better!

621
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,650
I thought you went to MIT.

622
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,770
Abby, I don't think
I can track this guy.

623
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,250
Don't let Gibbs hear you
talking like that, Probie.

624
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,690
Caff-Pow, baby.

625
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,370
You guys are just in time
for McGee's crisis of faith.

626
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,250
He's starting to realize that there may be
someone on the planet that's smarter than him.

627
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:44,450
Oh, I'm looking at one right now.

628
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,895
Well, Kate, in all fairness...

629
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,810
...I am the senior field agent, but I think it's an
experience thing... -I was talking about Abby, dodo head.

630
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,730
Thank you, Kate.

631
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,850
Okay, the only chance we have of finding this y is if he
contacts us again. I can embed a virus in the IM software.

632
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,210
- Use it to tag his computer and hope that it leads...
- Viruses, tracking software?

633
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,610
You guys are going
about this the wrong way.

634
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,090
What is the first rule
of Fight Club, Probie?

635
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,690
Okay, Tony, you can barely turn
your computer on. So, no offense...

636
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,170
You do not talk... about Fight Club!

637
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,890
And what is the second
rule of Fight Club?

638
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,130
Abbs?

639
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,890
Do not talk about Fight Club! Sir!

640
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,250
Exactly.

641
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,250
And Creepy Voice is the
guy who led us to Red Cell.

642
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,850
- So he's either a member or he knows a member.
- And they're all midshipmen.

643
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,050
Of course, if the guy's giving McGeek a run
for his money, he's got to be pretty smart.

644
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,290
McGee, what was your GPA in college?

645
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,290
3.9.

646
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,450
I failed a fencing
class in sophomore year.

647
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,010
So I'm sure you already checked the NROTC records,
to make sure there's no computer genius in the unit.

648
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,890
- I hate to say it, but that was actually smart, Tony.
- What was, Kate?

649
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,970
- Tony might have figured out how to find the hacker.
- It's his job.

650
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,330
You think I keep him
around for his personality?

651
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,890
There are 22 midshipmen in the unit with computer
science majors. Only one of them has a 4.0.

652
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,890
Look familiar?

653
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,490
You want to bring him in with me?

654
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,370
Considering he embarrassed me, almost got me
fired and ruined my weekend? What do you think?

655
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,930
"Hello, NCIS."

656
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,090
You might be smart,

657
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,930
but my geek carries a gun.

658
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,490
Hello, you twisted piece of...

659
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,890
Howdy, Urkel.

660
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,170
Ow! Man, you're hurting me! Ow!

661
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,530
You hear something, Tony?

662
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,170
No.

663
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,570
Me, neither.

664
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,970
No need to worry. Federal
agents. Have a nice day.

665
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:17,890
Hey.

666
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,450
So what do they call it?

667
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,090
The box? Coffin? Sweat shop?

668
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,890
We just call it interrogation.

669
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,930
What's the deal? You lean on me first, then
bring your partner in, get me blabbering?

670
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,530
Are you the good cop
or the bad cop? Sit.

671
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,210
Okay.

672
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,850
I'm gonna be honest with you.

673
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,890
This is a major waste of time.

674
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,210
You clearly didn't do this.

675
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,370
Reverse psychology.

676
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,930
But my boss, he needs to close the case.

677
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,530
Brass wants answers.

678
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,330
And there is this...

679
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,210
other agent-
Kate...

680
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,250
Severe-looking thing.

681
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,090
No sense of humor.

682
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,850
She built a profile on you.

683
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,690
What kind of interrogation
technique is that?

684
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,290
The DiNozzo method.

685
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,410
Not pretty,...

686
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,730
...but it's effective.

687
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,530
Turns out... you're the geeks' geek.

688
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,130
The last one to be picked for the team.

689
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,410
That's not true.

690
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,690
This isn't me, Urkel.

691
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,370
Okay? I think you're great.

692
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,210
Sure, you broke a few federal laws, interfering
with an ongoing murder investigation.

693
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,450
I was trying to help you.

694
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,730
Right.

695
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,810
It's the way you did
it that's suspicious.

696
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,930
Look at me, hmm?

697
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,890
The last thing I need is to
be pegged as a rat in the unit.

698
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,370
Those guys would have killed me.

699
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,410
Maybe you were looking for payback? They
wouldn't let you into their little club?

700
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,970
That's crazy.

701
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,050
You know what's crazy?

702
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,890
Me almost putting a bullet in a kid's
head 'cause he's playing paint ball.

703
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,970
That's a little crazy.

704
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,770
I didn't...

705
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,490
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.
I was... just trying to help.

706
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,250
Turner was a friend.

707
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,250
So you thought sending cryptic e-mails
was going to help us find his killer?

708
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,970
I think I know who killed him.

709
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,770
Who?

710
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,650
Petty Officer Blake.

711
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,410
Yeah, why'd he do it?

712
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,130
There's this girl in the
unit- Ashley Simmons.

713
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,210
She used to date Blake,
but they broke up.

714
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,290
She started dating Turner?

715
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,330
I'm not sure. I know he liked her.

716
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,690
He liked her?

717
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,770
Not a real strong
motive for murder, Urkel.

718
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,770
Last week I saw all three of them together in the quad. Ashley
was crying. Turner and Blake started arguing with each other.

719
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,490
About what?

720
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,610
I couldn't hear, but
I saw Blake push him.

721
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:33,890
So they fought?

722
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,930
No, Turner just left with Ashley.

723
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,890
When I asked him about it later, he said it was
personal, something between the three of them.

724
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,450
Well, that's a real interesting
theory, Matlock. One problem.

725
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,810
What?

726
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,050
Blake's dead.

727
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,410
He was murdered a few
hours after Turner.

728
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,090
B- By who?

729
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,730
Someone who wanted to frame him
for the murder of his best friend.

730
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,450
Find Midshipman Ashley Simmons. Now.

731
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,810
Why is your hair still purple, Simmons?

732
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,770
It takes a few days to wash out, Gunny.

733
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,410
I hope the time you've spent
field-daying is starting to sink in.

734
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,610
I own you until the day you graduate.

735
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,650
Yes, Gunny. It won't happen again.

736
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,250
You want to give people orders someday?

737
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,850
You need to learn how to follow them.

738
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,570
Sounds like pretty good advice, Gunny.

739
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,210
Good evening, sir.

740
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,290
Any luck finding Blake?

741
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,850
That's why we're here.

742
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,770
We can talk about this in my office.

743
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,010
- You missed a spot over there, Simmons.
- Actually, we're here for her, Gunny.

744
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,570
Simmons? For what?

745
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,250
- We found Blake.
- Where?

746
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,530
He's dead.

747
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,530
- We think she knows why.
- I don't, I don't know anything about it.

748
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,530
Then you won't mind
answering a few questions.

749
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,770
Take her out to the
sedan. I'll be right out.

750
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,450
But I don't know anything!

751
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,410
Tell me everything you
know about her, Gunny.

752
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,490
Simmons?

753
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,890
Kind of a screw-up,

754
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,090
...but not a bad kid.

755
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,970
You think she's involved in this?

756
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,050
I don't understand.

757
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,530
Blake didn't kill Turner?

758
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,330
Nope, they were both murdered.

759
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,170
Not pretty. Almost
twisted his head clean off.

760
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,610
Oh, my God,

761
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,130
he did it.

762
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,850
I'm getting too old for this crap.

763
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,010
ROTC was supposed to be an easy tour.

764
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:24,810
You want a cup?

765
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,130
Uh, no. No, thanks, I'll pass.

766
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,570
Mm. Good call.

767
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,290
So just how was Blake murdered?

768
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,810
I went to them for help last week.

769
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,730
He wouldn't leave me alone.

770
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,570
Wow,

771
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,930
two identical neck-breaks?

772
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,890
Yeah, we think the killer
has military training.

773
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,690
He was forcing me to sleep with him.

774
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,490
Blake and Turner were going to
go talk to him, make him stop.

775
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,890
And he killed them.

776
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,250
Who, Midshipman?

777
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,930
I'll have everyone in this
unit standing by tomorrow.

778
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,090
You can question them
all at the same time.

779
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,570
Thanks, Gunny. Appreciate it.

780
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,050
Just one thing.

781
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,050
What, sir?

782
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,010
I said that

783
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,370
...Blake had been found
dead. You said "murdered."

784
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,970
You gonna answer that?

785
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,690
No.

786
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,450
No, I'm pretty sure I know
what it is they want to tell me,

787
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,570
Put your hands up.

788
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,850
Not bad, Agent Gibbs.

789
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,770
I'd give up now. It's
only going to get worse.

790
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,890
I think he knows.

791
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:53,850
You think?

792
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,770
You should have stayed
out of this, old man.

793
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,330
Okay, stand back.

794
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,570
Cuff him.

795
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,810
Sure thing, boss.

796
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,010
Somehow I don't remember
college being quite like this.

797
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,210
Reminds me of this time at Ohio
State, we had this frat guy...

798
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,170
The next person who
mentions a spring break...

799
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,010
...or a frat party,

800
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,610
or college...

801
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,090
is fired,

802
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,770
are we clear?

803
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

804
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,250
That's good.
