1
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:06,640
Gibbs.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,820
Hey, morning, Henry.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,660
That sushi place you sent me to?

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,300
What, you didn't like it?

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,380
Liked it fine.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,340
Only you didn't tell me I had
to speak Japanese to order.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,660
You don't order.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,060
You eat what you're served with a smile.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,380
It's like being married.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,780
I hope that doesn't
mean I can't come in.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,380
Now just hold your horses.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,260
I wasn't going to hurt anybody with it.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,060
It's evidence.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,980
Yeah. It's okay.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,460
Come on in.

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,340
You wearing jewelry?

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,420
Oh, I forgot.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,700
Senior moment.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Henry, we're in the presence
of a Medal of Honor recipient.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,500
Special Agent Jethro Gibbs, NCIS.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Mister...

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,260
Yost.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,620
Corporal Ernie Yost.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,540
Special Agent, huh?

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,540
Just the man I'm looking for.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,300
Be an honor to help you, sir.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,300
Say that after you know why I'm here.

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,020
That have something to do with
this evidence you're delivering?

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,620
I murdered a marine with that.45.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,740
The Washington Ballet
is totally sold out.

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,780
You're kidding.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,100
People were backed up trying
to hack into the box office.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,540
God, I can't believe that.

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,340
Since when are you
interested in the ballet?

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,820
Since about an hour ago.

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,740
Let me
guess-

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,220
the cashier at the bakery
was wearing leg warmers.

38
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,220
How do you know that?

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,140
Must be the profiler in me.

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,500
Oh, hey, there's another
ballet in town, DiNozzo.

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,100
I can get you two front row easy.

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,500
Really? What ballet?

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,780
The National.

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,180
The National Ballet?

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,420
Bravo, McGee.

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,220
Oh. Only...

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
Only what?

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,700
The nation...

49
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,060
Is not ours.

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,820
Surinam.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,100
Surinam?

52
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,740
The National Ballet of Surinam.

53
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,540
How good can that be?

54
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,420
Depends on how much
you like her buns, Tony.

55
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,740
DiNozzo.

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
Make Mr. Yost here comfortable.

57
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,700
You want me to be comfortable,
slap a pair of handcuffs on me.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
How about something else?

59
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,620
Any good at foot massages?

60
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,340
Kate.

61
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,620
McGee.

62
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,460
Let me get that for you.

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,060
I found him downstairs.

64
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,060
He claims to have murdered
a marine with this.45.

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,140
You believe him?

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
He's a little foggy
on the where and when,

67
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,260
but pretty adamant he did it.

68
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,460
Gibbs, we're not going
to investigate this?

69
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,580
No...

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,860
Good.

71
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,700
We're just going to humor him.

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,260
McGee.

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,020
Says he's been reporting this to
911, can't get anybody to believe him.

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,460
Gee, what a surprise.

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,300
Trace the call.

76
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,300
I want to hear one of them.

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,820
On it.

78
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,620
Kate.

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,540
He's a former marine.

80
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,580
Probably WWII.

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,500
Corporal Ernest Yost.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,060
Dig up his SRB.

83
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,780
Got a social security number?

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,380
They didn't use them for
serial numbers when he served.

85
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,940
So how am I supposed to get
his SRB without a serial number?

86
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,700
Well, Kate, you could ask him.

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,740
Gibbs, I doubt that he
could remember his shoe size.

88
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,460
Corporal Yost.

89
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,020
Yo.

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,060
Serial number.

91
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,020
330090, sir.

92
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,460
Or you could just look him up
under Medal of Honor recipients.

93
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,780
He won the Medal of Honor?

94
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,580
You don't win the Medal of Honor, Kate,

95
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,060
you're awarded it for
conspicuous gallantry

96
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,020
above and beyond the call of duty.

97
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,740
You, uh, got any use for a Metro ticket?

98
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Got ten rides left.

99
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't want to waste 'em.

100
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
Ah... no, thanks.

101
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,540
Come on, too much waste in this world.

102
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,740
Everything's disposable now.

103
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,660
Disposable cameras, disposable razors.

104
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
I won't be needing it.

105
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,460
I drive.

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,180
Oh.

107
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,020
They took my license away.

108
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,940
How come?

109
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,060
Got old.

110
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,980
It's a fatal mistake.

111
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,140
But I can fly anywhere.

112
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,380
For free.

113
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,380
But I, uh...

114
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,900
I don't have anybody to visit anymore.

115
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,980
What a waste.

117
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,740
How'd you score a sweet deal like that?

118
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,740
What do we have here, Gibbs?

119
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,820
Murder weapon.

120
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,860
Cold case?

121
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,900
Icicles.

122
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Hmm. It's rust...

123
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,660
from potassium chlorate
in the powder mix.

124
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,940
Hasn't been fired recently.

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
They didn't even use this kind of ammo

126
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,820
when you were in the marines, Gibbs.

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,540
Check out the muzzle end of the slide.

128
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,500
See that coloring mismatch?

129
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,340
That's from hardening after
the finish was applied.

130
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,780
This weapon is circa early 1940s.

131
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,140
A year or two before I joined the Corps.

132
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,940
Dirt?

133
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,820
Looks like black sand.

134
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,220
Trace its origin.

135
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,900
Don't I always?

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,140
Hey, Gibbs, you gonna
tell me what this is about?

137
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,140
A marine who doesn't clean
his weapon after firing it.

138
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,220
Wow.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,180
Things must be really slow upstairs.

140
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,940
I never said I shot him.

141
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,140
I beat him to death
with it, over the head.

142
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,260
Who?

143
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,300
My buddy.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,940
Corporal Wade Kean.

145
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,100
Why?

146
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,140
Why?

147
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,660
Why would you kill your buddy?

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,860
I don't think he believes me, kid.

149
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,820
Me either.

150
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,060
And what do you know?

151
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,420
You weren't even a gleam
in your old man's eye.

152
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,180
Mr. Yost.

153
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,180
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,900
Yeah, I know. I know.

155
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,740
Why?

156
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Is that all he's gonna ask me?

157
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,420
Pretty much, till he gets an answer.

158
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,620
All right.

159
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,180
You want an answer?

160
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,100
I'll give you an answer.

161
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,620
I don't know why.

162
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,540
You don't know why?

163
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,820
No.

164
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,020
Okay.

165
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,780
Then I don't believe
you killed him, Mr. Yost.

166
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,860
Why won't anybody believe I killed him?

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,980
I smashed him over the head.

168
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,780
I beat his brains in.

169
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,140
Blood was coming out of his...

170
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,260
Calm down, Mr. Yost.

171
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,820
- Relax.
- Where's my.45?

172
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,060
Where's my.45?

173
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,060
I had it when I came in.

174
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,060
I have your.45.

175
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,660
You gave it to me.

176
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,100
Good. Good.

177
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180
You see, that's evidence.

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,820
That'll prove that I...

179
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,460
that I...

180
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,780
Tony, get him a drink of water.

181
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,300
All right.

182
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,660
Come with me, Mr. Yost.

183
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,380
Water cooler's right over here.

184
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,180
It's not a water cooler,
it's called a scuttlebutt.

185
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,500
How long you been in the Corps, kid?

186
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,220
Since I met Gibbs.

187
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,500
This way.

188
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,900
Boss...

189
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,860
Winchester, Virginia P.D. got seven 911
calls from Yost during the past 11 days.

190
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,940
Let me hear the last one.

191
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,460
911.

192
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,940
Hi. Do you have a
pencil and paper ready?

193
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,980
Sir, I have a computer.

194
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,380
What is the emergency
you wish to report?

195
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,540
There's a dead man.

196
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,700
Actually, it's not an
emergency for him, anymore.

197
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,740
He's dead.

198
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,700
The emergency is for me.

199
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,820
See, it's getting late
in the day, very late.

200
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,460
Mr. Yost, is this you, again?

201
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,900
I've heard enough.

202
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,980
Police investigated a couple of times.

203
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,540
Found him to be inebriated
and that he started

204
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,740
making the calls when
his wife passed away.

205
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,220
His citation of conspicuous gallantry
above and beyond the call of duty.

206
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,540
"Corporal Ernest Yost,
U.S. Marine Corps,

207
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,380
"First Battalion,28th
Marines,"Fifth Marine Division

208
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,420
at Iwo Jima,"Volcano
Islands, 4 March 1945.

209
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,220
"The terrain studded with caves and
ravines,"Corporal Yost was standing

210
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,660
point forward of our lines
"when he spotted Japanese troops

211
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,100
attempting to infiltrate
"under the cover of darkness.

212
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,500
"He immediately waged a
fierce battle during which

213
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,820
"a grenade gravely wounded "his
right hand and fractured his thigh.

214
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,460
"Near exhaustion from profuse bleeding, "he continued to defend his forward
position, "engaging in hand-to-hand combat when he was out of ammunition.

215
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,820
"At dawn Corporal Yost was found amid
the bodies "of 26 Japanese soldiers

216
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,060
he had killed in his self-sacrificing
defense of his forward position."

217
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,780
What?

218
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
We just heard about your wife, Mr. Yost.

219
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
You have our sympathies, sir.

220
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,180
Thank you.

221
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,540
Buried her two weeks ago.

222
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,820
Ball's Bluff National Cemetery.

223
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,820
We were married 58 years.

224
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,420
Dorothy...

225
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,780
she was a peach.

226
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,420
She was... a peach.

227
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
Now can we get on with this?

228
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,580
You're not in custody, Mr. Yost.

229
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,660
Now don't say that, Agent Gibbs.

230
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,140
I didn't get anything
for dinner tonight.

231
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,860
Gibbs.

232
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,940
I'd love to buy you dinner, Mr. Yost.

233
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,860
You would?

234
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
Me, too.

235
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,060
She asked first.

236
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,820
We don't know yet.

237
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,460
Video conference. Five minutes.

238
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,100
DiNozzo, entertain Mr.
Yost a little while longer.

239
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
That mean you're gonna hold me?

240
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,620
No.

241
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,820
Oh, yes, you will.

242
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,020
You see this seal,

243
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,020
Special Agent Gibbs?

244
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
You recognize the signature?

245
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,900
Yeah.

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,340
Your eyesight isn't as bad as they say.

247
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,020
How did SECNAV get involved in this?

248
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,140
Apparently, letters from Medal
of Honor recipients get read.

249
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,700
Yost wrote him?

250
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,700
More than wrote, he confessed to
murdering a Corporal Wade Kean, U.S.M.C.

251
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,700
Did he say where?

252
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,260
No.

253
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,140
When?

254
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,740
No.

255
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,820
Why?

256
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,580
No. And that's why you're going to
open a case, to get those answers.

257
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,380
Commander, this man stood tall in hell.

258
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,900
His wife just died.

259
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,060
He does get loaded sometimes.

260
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Even when he's not loaded, he's loaded.

261
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,540
Decisions over competency to
stand trial are not yours to make.

262
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,900
They are for experts in
neuro-psychiatry and a court.

263
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,820
Now let me ask you one
question, Special Agent Gibbs.

264
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,900
Just one?

265
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,220
What's the statute of
limitations on murder?

266
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,820
Statement of Mr. Ernie Yost,

267
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,580
Medal of Honor recipient,

268
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,260
to NCIS Special Agent L. Jethro Gibbs.

269
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,140
"Jethro".

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,580
I used to know a ballplayer

271
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,460
named Jethro.

272
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,540
Negro League.

273
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Do you understand your rights?

274
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,340
Oh, sure, sure.

275
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,540
That Italian kid read 'em to me.

276
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,100
Di... Di...

277
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
DiNozzo.

278
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,380
Tony.

279
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I think he'd make a
heck of a ballplayer.

280
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,420
Promised me a tryout.

281
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,700
Said he used to be a
scout for the Senators.

282
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,540
How sad.

283
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,700
You're obviously too old

284
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,980
to be a professional ballplayer.

285
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,420
Like I told you,

286
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,780
I killed my best friend Wade.

287
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,380
Why?

288
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,300
Now, that again?

289
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,780
If you want me to charge you.

290
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,380
You know, Wade could do a kip.

291
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,620
A kip-up.

292
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,540
He'd lay flat on his
back on the barracks deck,

293
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,260
and in one move, he'd jerk
his body- land on his feet.

294
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,580
Ever see anybody do
anything like that, huh?

295
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,340
Boy, you wouldn't forget.

296
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,500
Man.

297
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,780
I- I got this...

298
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,900
Metro card here.

299
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,580
I got ten rides left.

300
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,500
You want it?

301
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,180
No, thanks.

302
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,460
Yeah. Seems silly.

303
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,340
Wade.

304
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,860
All I remember...

305
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,500
is, is killing him.

306
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,220
All right, Mr. Yost.

307
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,340
I'll have Tony give you a ride home.

308
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,020
Wait a minute.

309
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,740
Wait a minute.

310
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,460
I'm trying to remember, you know?

311
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,100
I know you need to know why.

312
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,540
That would be nice.

313
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,140
All right.

314
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,500
You know, I think...

315
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,900
I think...

316
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,900
it was him or me.

317
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,180
Yeah.

318
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,060
Yeah, that's it.

319
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,220
Him or me.

320
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,180
I picked up his pistol...

321
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,540
I smashed his brains in.

322
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,060
Smashed his brains in!

323
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,060
Smashed his brains in!

324
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,060
We were all covered with blood!

325
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,100
You don't have to remember
it anymore, Mr. Yost.

326
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,100
Take a deep breath.

327
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,020
Take deeps breaths.

328
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,820
Breathe, breathe.

329
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,980
Breathe.

330
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,940
Smells like rotten eggs in here.

331
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,500
Tony, let's get Mr. Yost some air.

332
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,980
Well?

333
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,340
I'm a Medical Examiner,
I'm not a psychiatrist.

334
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,900
I won't sue you, Duck.

335
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,100
Well, he reminds me of my
great uncle William in Bristol.

336
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,460
We'd visit every Christmas.

337
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,900
He was always apologizing for
sitting naked at the dinner table.

338
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,900
He wasn't naked, was he?

339
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,340
No. Aunt Gertrude was.

340
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,500
I'm, I'm, sorry, Gibbs.

341
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,260
My point is my uncle
was a little dotty...

342
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,020
as is your Mr. Yost.

343
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,420
Ducky, what do you think
he smelled in there?

344
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,580
I hesitate to ask.

345
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,340
Nothing.

346
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,140
It was in his mind.

347
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,620
He was back on Iwo.

348
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,140
The sulfur island.

349
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,460
Sulfur smells like rotten eggs.

350
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,660
Good news...

351
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,300
I think.

352
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,180
It's not good if you
have to think about it.

353
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Corporal Wade Kean was
killed in action on Iwo Jima

354
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,460
March 3rd, 1945 according to
the Marine Corps casualty list.

355
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,620
It's the day before Yost
was cited for gallantry.

356
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,500
That means he didn't kill him, right?

357
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,740
If no one witnessed the murder, Yost alleges committing,
they'd assume that Corporal Kean was killed by the Japanese.

358
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,980
I'm sorry, Kate.

359
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,340
It doesn't really prove anything
except a brave Marine died.

360
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,700
Ducky, say Yost's best
friend was killed in action.

361
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,660
What's he feel?

362
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,700
Pain. Anger. Relief.

363
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,700
Survivor's guilt.

364
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,380
He's glad it's not him.

365
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,940
He hate's himself for that feeling.

366
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,660
Exactly.

367
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,460
The next night, Yost's
in hand-to-hand combat.

368
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,860
So he confused killing a Japanese
soldier with killing his friend!

369
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,220
This all started when his wife died.

370
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,420
Survivor's guilt again, Duck?

371
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Wait, wait, wait.

372
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,540
You're onto something there.

373
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,300
But how do you prove it to him?

374
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,940
Kate, prepare an affidavit to exhume
the body of Marine Corporal Wade Kean.

375
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:46,980
In Iwo Jima?

376
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,020
He's not in Iwo Jima.

377
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,420
We gave the island back to Japan in '68.

378
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,820
Every Marine buried
there was brought home.

379
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,500
You find him and dig him up.

380
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,900
Oh-hoh! The Sands of Iwo Jima!

381
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,540
Guys make mistakes, I guess.

382
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,380
But every one we make, the whole
stack of chips goes with it.

383
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,940
Who said that?

384
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,140
That's John Wayne!

385
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,340
Sergeant Striker?

386
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,220
Come on.

387
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,820
He's in the flick you're downloading.

388
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,860
John Wayne is in To
The Shores of Iwo Jima?

389
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,340
It's "Sands" McGee, not "Shores"

390
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,500
No, it's "Shores"

391
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,500
You're going to challenge me on the
name of one of the Duke's finest films?

392
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,940
Tony, this is not a Hollywood film.

393
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,980
It's a Marine documentary.

394
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,420
To the Shores of Iwo Jima.

395
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Wow, it's the same footage.

396
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
The Corps probably let them use it.

397
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
How's he doing?

398
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,460
Listen to him.

399
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
That To The Shores of Iwo Jima?

400
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Yeah. I thought it might help.

401
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,100
Good thought.

402
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,300
When he wakes up, take him home.

403
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,260
Will do.

404
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,980
Stay with him.

405
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,580
I don't want him to be alone.

406
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,900
Oh, boss, I got tickets to
the National Ballet tonight.

407
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,940
The National Ballet?

408
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,660
Yeah. An-And the tickets
are really hard to get.

409
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,780
Tell him, McGee.

410
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,900
Um... well...

411
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,980
What nation?

412
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,340
It starts with an "S."

413
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,740
Bed him down, DiNozzo.

414
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,900
Stay with him.

415
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,100
Can't be a coincidence.

416
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,580
Yost's wife buried in the
same cemetery as Corporal Kean.

417
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,260
Ah, Mr. Yost must have requested
the plot for he and his wife

418
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,620
decades ago to be buried here.

419
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,580
I mean, this section of the cemetery
has been filled since the '70s.

420
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,740
Left, right, left.

421
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,540
Left, right, left.

422
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,260
Left, right, left.

423
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
Left, right, left.

424
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,540
Left, right, left.

425
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,700
Left, right, left.

426
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,060
Left, right, left.

427
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,220
Left, right, left.

428
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,340
Left, right, left.

429
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,700
Detail, halt.

430
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,740
Left face.

431
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,060
Marine burial detail present as
requested, Special Agent Gibbs.

432
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,340
Thank you, Colonel.

433
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Now we're ready.

434
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,700
Skeletal remains as expected.

435
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,500
They were buried only in
a canvas bag or a poncho,

436
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,380
and the 20 years in sulfuric
soil takes it's toll.

437
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,660
What's that in his teeth?

438
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,780
Dog tag.

439
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,420
When you were killed in
action, one of your dog tags was

440
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,660
inserted between your teeth,
your lower jaw was slammed shut,

441
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,500
locking it in place so the
body could always be identified.

442
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,020
My God.

443
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,020
Traumatized bilateral
amputation of the legs.

444
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,740
Artillery shell?

445
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,900
Land mine.

446
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,500
Check the top of the skull, Ducky.

447
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,460
Here.

448
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,820
Don't tell me.

449
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm afraid there is a
blunt-force fracture.

450
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,500
You got to do it.

451
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,060
Pattern mark's a rough fit.

452
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,020
He said he was bringing us evidence.

453
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,760
Yost confessed in a
letter to the SECNAV.

454
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
He surrendered the murder weapon.

455
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,920
Your own Medical Examiner matched it
to toork on the victim's skull fracture.

456
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,760
What more do you want?

457
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,760
A motive.

458
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
I don't need a motive to prosecute.

459
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,480
I do.

460
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,200
McGee!

461
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,000
I picked up his pistol...

462
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
And I hit him with it.

463
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,600
I smashed... killed Wade.

464
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,320
Smashed...

465
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,640
smashed his brains in!

466
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,600
We were all covered with blood.

467
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,960
You don't have to remember any more.

468
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,680
Deep breaths.

469
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,280
Breathe, breathe.

470
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Look at him, Commander.

471
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,320
Agony over something he didn't do.

472
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
How do you know?

473
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,760
You ever been in combat?

474
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,000
No.

475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,320
The only one you depend on

476
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,600
is the buddy next to you.

477
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,160
He's closer to you than your brother.

478
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,840
Why would you smash his head in?

479
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,480
God only knows.

480
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, then, he had better tell me 'cause
I don't understand and neither does Yost.

481
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm tired of arguing with you, Gibbs.

482
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
Deliver Yost to the Quantico brig.

483
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,720
I can't do that.

484
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,440
Damn it, Gibbs, do you think I want
to incarcerate an 82-year-old man?

485
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm following the
SECNAV's direct orders.

486
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,440
He said investigate. You did.

487
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,960
And found enough evidence to
hold him over for court-martial.

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,080
Now, take him into custody.

489
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
I said "can't" not wouldn't.

490
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,320
Please don't insult me
by telling me he escaped.

491
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,800
The older they are,
the sneakier they are.

492
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,000
Yost complained of a weak bladder.

493
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,400
He had to use the
restroom every ten minutes.

494
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,560
We gave up escorting him and one time

495
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,440
he just didn't come back.

496
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,800
We found a window open.

497
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,840
He must have shimmied down a drain pipe.

498
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, I'd like to have seen that.

499
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
We think the weak bladder was a
trick to get us to let down our guard.

500
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,560
We're sick about it, Commander.

501
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,200
Yes, I can see that.

502
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,640
You all look absolutely devastated.

503
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,840
I put out an APB.

504
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,880
Airports, train stations, taxi cabs.

505
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,080
Walker rentals.

506
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,360
All right, Gibbs, I'll give
you 24 hours; that's it.

507
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,360
I want Yost at the Quantico
brig at 08:00 tomorrow.

508
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,520
We'll be there.

509
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't give a damn if you're there.

510
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,040
Just make sure Yost is.

511
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,920
Gibbs...

512
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,840
maybe she's right.

513
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Commander Coleman admits that JAG
doesn't want to incarcerate him,

514
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160
so what's the worst that can happen?

515
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,440
Dishonorable Discharge...

516
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,440
and loss of his Medal of Honor.

517
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,960
I hadn't thought of that.

518
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah, neither has Yost.

519
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,240
And there's worse.

520
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,640
A hero...

521
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,600
could go to his grave carrying
a guilt he doesn't deserve.

522
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,640
I won't let that happen.

523
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,080
So what do we do?

524
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,800
Find every living Marine who
served with Yost on Iwo Jima.

525
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,560
If there is one.

526
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,280
Right.

527
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,200
McGee.

528
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,800
Boss?

529
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,720
I want you and Abby to
reconstruct the battle.

530
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,160
That Marine documentary
you downloaded's a start.

531
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,840
I want to follow Corporals
Yost and Kean minute-by-minute.

532
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,360
From D-Day until Kean was
killed and Yost was evacuated.

533
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,200
You got it, boss.

534
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
I want it so real I
can smell the sulphur.

535
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,520
Yeah.

536
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,440
Hey...

537
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,960
That was fun last night.

538
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,480
You got some arm on you, kid.

539
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
I was lucky.

540
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,400
What?

541
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,760
I said...

542
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,960
I said I was lucky.

543
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,280
What's that?

544
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
That's Wild Turkey, milk back.

545
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,880
Want one?

546
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,480
I don't think my stomach could handle
it after the chili dogs last nit.

547
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,680
I've been drinking one of these
every morning for almost 50 years.

548
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Semper fi.

549
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,280
Got any coffee?

550
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,640
Percolator in there.

551
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
You know, speaking of luck.

552
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,840
Let me tell you

553
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
we almost didn't get to Iwo?

554
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,880
No?

555
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,720
We were in a 40-knot gale, you know, and,
uh, the ship was like a roller coaster.

556
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,040
Up one wave, down the next, you know.

557
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,280
And me and Wade are leaning railing
puking like we had spent the week

558
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,640
in liberty at the slop shoot.

559
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
And guess what happens.

560
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,880
You fell in.

561
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,600
No.

562
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,680
A torpedo shoots out of the water,
zips over our heads that close.

563
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,560
Rides right into the sea.

564
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,600
Right over the ship.

565
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,400
I guess our number wasn't up.

566
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,120
So, what's it feel like?

567
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,720
Smooth.

568
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,520
Being a hero.

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm no hero.

570
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,360
Medal says you are.

571
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,080
The real heroes never came back.

572
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
They deserve that. Not me.

573
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,920
Not me.

574
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,440
I was scared to death.

575
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,080
I don't even remember
doing what they said I did.

576
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,680
You don't remember killing
all those Japanese soldiers?

577
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,840
No, it was like someone else did it.

578
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,160
And maybe somebody else did.

579
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,600
Maybe it was someone
else who killed Wade.

580
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,680
Hey, you want to look at some pictures?

581
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,280
Sure.

582
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,960
First drawer there.

583
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,640
That's it.

584
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Yowzer.

585
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,320
Now, here you go, here you go.

586
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,400
There's me.

587
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,160
There's Ferris Bellows, Chip Stearns.

588
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,000
And that's Wade next to me.

589
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,120
Took this on the Canal.

590
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,520
Guadalcanal?

591
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,400
Yeah. Two days before
I got hit in the chest.

592
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,680
You got wounded at Guadalcanal
and then they sent you to Iwo?

593
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,040
Not only me, but a lot
of Marines, you know.

594
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,440
Chip got hit on the Canal.

595
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Caught one in the butt.

596
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,520
We never let him forget it.

597
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:05,800
Nambu cut him down on Iwo.

598
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,640
Uh, here, here.

599
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,440
This is my Dorothy.

600
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,040
Oh, man, she's hot.

601
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,280
Sorry, Ernie.

602
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,560
It's okay, kid.

603
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,600
She was hot.

604
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
She was the cutest Navy nurse in Hawaii.

605
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,080
Is that how you two met?

606
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,720
Yep. Now, I don't even
remember the hospital ship.

607
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,720
But when I finally opened my eyes on
Oahu she was the first thing I saw.

608
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,480
Love at first sight.

609
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,920
So, you two get married before
you shipped out to Iwo Jima?

610
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,400
No, no.

611
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,920
We had to wait until after the war-
her being an officer and me enlisted.

612
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,400
I would lay in my rack
at night and ache for her.

613
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,760
I bet your buddies were jealous.

614
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,320
Who told you that?

615
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
Nobody.

616
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,280
She's gorgeous.

617
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,960
I'm just saying, who
wouldn't be jealous?

618
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,800
I have to take a whiz.

619
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:18,000
Iwo Jima: five miles
long, half that in width.

620
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,240
27,000 Japanese dug in
so deep that ten weeks

621
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,280
of bombardment couldn't touch them.

622
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,000
One out of every three Marines
at Iwo Jima was a casualty.

623
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,240
The Japanese had 800
pill boxes and three

624
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
miles of tunnels on
this tiny little island.

625
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,640
The Marines hoped to take Mount
Suribachi on the first day.

626
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,880
It took five before
the famous flag raising.

627
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,280
And then the battle went on
for about a month after that.

628
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,560
It was actually the
second flag to be raised.

629
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,720
The first was too small to be seen
by all the Marines on the island.

630
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,040
Hey, I an only interested in two
Marines- Corporals Yost and Kean.

631
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Gibbs, we're trying to
give you background here.

632
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,520
I got that, Abby, at Parris Island.

633
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,440
Okay. D-Day. 0900.

634
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Blue Beach one.

635
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Corporals Yost and Kean land with the
25th Regiment of the Fourth Division.

636
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,880
They're about to take the airfields with the Third Division while
the Fifth Division takes Suribachi and advances up the west coast.

637
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,680
First airfield falls on
D- Day and they sweep up

638
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,920
the east shore toward the
sulphur quarry and Airfield 2.

639
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
Estimates were five days, ten max.

640
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,600
Over two weeks later they're still
trying to take that second airfield.

641
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,280
Corporal Kean's body was
found here: Turkey Knob.

642
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,000
The next night, Yost was cited for

643
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,160
the Medal of Honor here;
about 500 yards away.

644
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,200
What's this here?

645
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,120
It's the gap between the
Fourth and Third Division lines.

646
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,800
The night that Corporal
Kean died the Japanese

647
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,200
had amassed several hundred
troops for a banzai charge.

648
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
They were getting desperate.

649
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,480
See, up until then they'd only
fought from inside the bunkers.

650
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,160
Kean was killed here
below this cave mouth.

651
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
Within spitting distance.

652
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
He'd stepped on a land mine.

653
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
He'd blown off both his legs.

654
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,680
He was in severe pain.

655
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,920
This ditch runs north where
the Japanese were massing.

656
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,640
They had to pass within
yards of Kean and Yost.

657
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,560
You think... Yost hit him in
the head to keep him quiet?

658
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,440
Well, that's got to be it.

659
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,320
He had no reason kill him.

660
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,640
He was his buddy.

661
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,960
Ernie?

662
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,400
Hold your horses. I'm coming.

663
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,280
Bet you never had a ham
and cheese like this.

664
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,440
You see, I mix mayo with mustard and...

665
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Is this Wade and Dorothy?

666
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,280
Looks like a high school photo.

667
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,560
It was the Senior Prom.

668
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,960
She was Queen.

669
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
He was King.

670
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,120
Wade knew Dorothy before you.

671
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,240
Ernie, were they sweethearts?

672
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:01,180
I don't believe it.

673
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,660
There's a man in Boston who does.

674
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Commander Coleman is going to use this
to put Yost away for the rest of his life.

675
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,180
Do we have to tell her?

676
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,820
Well, no, Special Agent DiNozzo, here
at NCIS, we just report evidence we like.

677
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,700
You know, Gibbs, it
doesn't change your theory.

678
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,740
Corporal Kean was in
pain from his wounds.

679
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,620
Yost knocked him out to keep his
cries from alerting passing Japanese.

680
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,380
So, over the years, Yost
begins questioning himself.

681
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,580
Did he have to hit him that
hard to silence him or...

682
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,100
did he do it to get the
woman that they both loved?

683
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,340
Well, I tracked down Private Bellows.

684
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,300
He, uh, was in Vegas last
month, playing blackjack.

685
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,900
Double-down on two
aces, caught two queens.

686
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,100
Reached for his chips, and dropped dead.

687
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,700
Bellows' death makes Yost the last
surviving Marine from his unit on Iwo.

688
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,500
It's just so hard to
believe that there's nobody

689
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,020
left on the planet who
was there that night.

690
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,580
You guys like Benny Goodman?

691
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,460
I'm a... Artie Shaw man, myself.

692
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,740
Now, don't get me wrong-
Benny Goodman was great.

693
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
But Artie
Shaw- whew!

694
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,660
When he lifted that clarinet...

695
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,500
Boy, did we argue about that!

696
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,900
Wade loved Goodman.

697
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,780
Me...

698
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,940
Artie Shaw, any day.

699
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
You dance?

700
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,620
Yes. Sure.

701
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,780
When they begin the beguine Brings
back the sound of music so tender

702
00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:00,980
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory evergreen...

703
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,740
Is past all endeavor...

704
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,900
Where's Gibbs?

705
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,500
And a good afternoon to
you, too, Commander Coleman.

706
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,060
He was to deliver Corporal Yost to me...

707
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,340
Present and accounted for, sir.

708
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
...0800...

709
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,460
You're Ernest Yost?

710
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,580
Yes, ma'am.

711
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,940
This is Lieutenant
Commander Coleman, Ernie.

712
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,580
JAG Corps.

713
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,420
She's here to, uh... arrest you.

714
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,780
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate this, Commander.

715
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,900
What's with the Olsen Twins?

716
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,660
They're here to escort
the accused to Quantico.

717
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,740
Well, it's about time.

718
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
We'll deliver him.

719
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,060
You've got two days to do that.

720
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,300
Right on time, Commander.

721
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,100
I'm on time?!

722
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,380
You're the one who failed to
deliver the accused to me at 0800.

723
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,300
I found a witness.

724
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,900
Witness to what?

725
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,940
What happened the night
Corporal Kean died.

726
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,740
You-you couldn't have!

727
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,420
I- I-I
mean...

728
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,980
you could've, obviously, you did-
did I miss someone in his unit?!

729
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,580
No. All Marines are deceased.

730
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,780
They look alive.

731
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,860
Gibbs...

732
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,940
Commander, there were more
than Marines on Iwo Jima.

733
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,380
There were more than 20,000 Japanese.

734
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,300
They were all killed.

735
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,260
Not all.

736
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
A few were taken prisoner.

737
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
Some never returned to Japan.

738
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,380
You found a Japanese soldier
who fought on Iwo Jima.

739
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,500
A Japanese lieutenant.

740
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,700
Right here in this
district, as it so happens.

741
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,660
As it so happens.

742
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,100
Yes.

743
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,860
And where is this miraculous find?

744
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,660
Well, he went to the
bathroom on the way in.

745
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,540
He should be here any...

746
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,020
Lieutenant Commander

747
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,540
Coleman.

748
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,500
Toshi Yoshida.

749
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,620
Former lieutenant,
Japanese Imperial Army.

750
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,435
You were in the Imperial
Army, Lieutenant?

751
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,460
Army... emperor... lieutenant.

752
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,340
Taken prisoner by Marines on Iwo Jima.

753
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,940
Marine.

754
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,700
Two...

755
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
English isn't his thing.

756
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,300
Gibbs...

757
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,340
I don't know what you're trying to do.

758
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,420
Trying to get to the truth, Faith.

759
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,540
You're only delaying the inevitable.

760
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,620
All we have to lose is a little time.

761
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:48,940
Okay.

762
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,620
I will give you a little time.

763
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,380
What's Gibbs doing?

764
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
He's creating the smell of sulfur.

765
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,900
Corporal Yost...

766
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,820
Sir.

767
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,100
Iwo Jima...

768
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,180
Hill 382...

769
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,460
the Meat Grinder.

770
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,420
Start the tape.

771
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,060
500 landing craft, in waves,
lands on 3,000 yards of beach.

772
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,140
Night patrol...

773
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,660
probing Japanese lines.

774
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,740
You... Private Stearns...

775
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,180
Private Bellows...

776
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,540
Private Morris...

777
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,500
Corporal Kean.

778
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,980
I killed him.

779
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,900
He stepped on a mine.

780
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,380
Blew his legs off.

781
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,540
But I killed him.

782
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,580
You got to be quiet, Wade.

783
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,940
Come on.

784
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,500
Suck it up, Wade. Try!

785
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,540
I can't!

786
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,700
Shut him up!

787
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,740
Wade! Shh!

788
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,300
Ernie, do something!

789
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,340
Ernie, Ernie, shut him up!

790
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,140
Shut him up!

791
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,980
Shut him up, Ernie!

792
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,100
Make him stop!

793
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,460
Shut up, buddy.

794
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,780
S... Sorry, Wade.

795
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,380
I'm sorry.

796
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,420
I'm sorry.

797
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,180
Well?

798
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,500
I will inform the SECNAV
that former Marine corporal

799
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,140
Ernest Yost is suffering
from delayed stress syndrome.

800
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,940
Corporal Kean was killed in action...

801
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,460
not by Yost.

802
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,660
You're not going to arrest me, either.

803
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,140
Nope. You struck Corporal Kean
to quiet him, not to kill him.

804
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,100
You had no choice.

805
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,900
He stopped.

806
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,860
But how... how will I be sure?

807
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,260
Tell me that, Gibbs.

808
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
How can I ever be sure?

809
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,900
You met Dorothy in Hawaii, after
you were wounded on Guadalcanal?

810
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,060
Yeah. She was a Navy nurse.

811
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,820
You decided to get married
before you shipped off to Iwo?

812
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,260
Well, I told you, it
was love at first sight.

813
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,460
We were gonna get hitched
when one of us was discharged.

814
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,420
Who was going to be your best man?

815
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,060
It was going to be Wade. He was...

816
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,540
I asked Wade.

817
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,580
He wasn't going to marry Dorothy.

818
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,220
He said, "No hard feelings."

819
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,020
He said we were meant for each other.

820
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,380
Ernie, you did what you did to
save the rest of your patrol.

821
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,860
No other reason.

822
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,180
Come on, Corporal.

823
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,460
Let a gunny buy you dinner.

824
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,260
You were never an officer?

825
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,980
Oh, hell, no.

826
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,620
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

827
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,740
Semper fi!

828
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,900
Semper fi.

829
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,180
Sail again?

830
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,580
Yeah. Why not?

831
00:41:12,747 --> 00:41:14,020
Arigato.

832
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,340
You conned me, gunny.

833
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,180
Nah.

834
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,340
Would I do that to you?

835
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,060
You're damn right, you would.

836
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,420
And I want to thank you for it.

837
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,020
And you were never on Iwo Jima.

838
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,940
Iwo Jima, no.

839
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,380
Guadalcanal.
