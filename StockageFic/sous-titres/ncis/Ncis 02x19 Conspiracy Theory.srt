1
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,470
Thirteen...

2
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,830
Fifteen...

3
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,070
Seventeen...

4
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,710
Nineteen...

5
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,230
Did you lose something
down there DiNozzo?

6
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,510
Ninety-nine! Hundred.

7
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,790
It's still my morning exercise.

8
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,550
Right. So how old's this one?

9
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,190
Why does it always have
to be about a woman, Kate?

10
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,790
Cause we're talking about you.

11
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,630
Got your favourite here.

12
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,070
Bacon, sausage, cheese,
breakfast burrito.

13
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,390
I'll Pass. Too much fat.

14
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,750
Must be really young.

15
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,630
Oh, she is.

16
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,150
I don't think they have to know about her.

17
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,790
She is 5.10, blond hair, long
legs and gianormous headlights.

18
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,910
The last part was really necessary?

19
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,070
That's what you called them.

20
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,670
She broke down by the Navy yard
last night and Tony helped her out.

21
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,150
Oh, I bet he did.

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,630
She's a junior at Georgetown.

23
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,830
So that would make
her... what about twenty?

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,910
Actually, she could be younger.

25
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,270
I was eighteen when
I was a junior at MIT.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,470
When we need clarification we'll
ask for it probie, thank you.

27
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,190
Oh, I'm asking.

28
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,430
How old, Abby?

29
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,350
Well, she's old enough
to turn Tony down.

30
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,350
Said she only goes out
with guys in their 20s.

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,630
Oh, poor baby.

32
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,310
She wasn't my type anyway.

33
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,310
Well, that's a good thing, 'cause I think it's
time that the "Sex Machine" hung his spurs up.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,550
How do you know about that?

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,710
Your college nickname?

36
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,670
Let's just say that dating your
frat brother had its advantages.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,950
Grab your gear.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,790
Going to Georgetown.

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,630
Petty officer was assaulted
in her home last night.

40
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,310
You're driving...

41
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,230
...Sex Machine.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
Kate, I'd check you
e- mail before we go.

43
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,590
It's kind of important.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,590
Where did you get this?

45
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,800
Wet T-Shirt Wall of Fame.

46
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:00,790
Spring break '94.

47
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,030
Saw it when I was in
Panama City last month.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,030
Oh, my God.

49
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,590
I was going to keep it to myself, but then
you decided to tell everyone my pledge name.

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,350
You wouldn't dare!

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,150
Oh.

52
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,470
Tony, Tony, come on.

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,590
We can work this out.

54
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,830
Name's Petty Officer Jessica Smith.

55
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,870
Claims intruder in military fatigues
entered her home and tried to attack her.

56
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,830
What do you mean, "tried"?

57
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,990
At this point, I'm not even
sure there was an attacker.

58
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,990
Who are you?

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,790
Special Agents Gibbs and Todd.

60
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,390
NCIS.

61
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,590
We have to talk, but not here.

62
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,670
They're listening.

63
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,630
Who's listening, Petty Officer?

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,870
I... I wish I knew.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,670
Turn the radio on.

66
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,070
All right, they can't hear us now.

67
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,150
Tell me about last night.

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,230
How... How do I know I can trust you?

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,110
Because we're here to help.

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,950
I heard voices...

71
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,230
whispering.

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,630
Yeah? Saying what?

73
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,870
I couldn't tell, but it was about me.

74
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,630
You have to protect me.

75
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,190
From what?

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,710
Monsters.

77
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,350
Jessica, it's going to be okay.

78
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,510
Boss, the commander
refused to wait outside.

79
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,230
Lieutenant Commander Allan Witten.

80
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,430
I'm Petty Officer Smith's psychologist.

81
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,190
Outside, Now.

82
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,230
Very well.

83
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,470
I don't want to go back!

84
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,310
I can't go back!

85
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,030
Please tell me I won't go back!

86
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,590
Jessica is under my care.

87
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,790
When she missed her phone
session this morning,

88
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,630
I became concerned.

89
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,310
What's wrong with her?

90
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,870
She's been diagnosed with
"Brief Reactive Psychosis."

91
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,750
We believe it's been triggered by the
death of her fiance in Iraq last month.

92
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,030
Yeah? Why isn't she in the hospital?

93
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,990
As her condition
improved, we released her.

94
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,270
Treated her as an out-patient.

95
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,630
She told the cops there was a man in her
bedroom in camouflage utilities and body armor.

96
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,270
Was she hearing voices
and did he have a knife?

97
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,030
How do you know that, Commander?

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,630
It's a delusion, Agent Gibbs.

99
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,590
She's had several just
like it at Bethesda.

100
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,390
I need to get her back.

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,550
Gentlemen, I assure you no
crime has been committed here.

102
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,710
Why don't you let me decide that?

103
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,910
I'm very, very sorry for the
"Sex Machine" crack, Tony.

104
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,070
It was insensitive and rude.

105
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,670
I swear it won't happen again.

106
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,790
Whatever.

107
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,190
Damn it, what are you going
to do with it, DiNozzo?

108
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
I haven't decided yet.

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,510
I thought it might make a nice poster.

110
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,590
What would?

111
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,550
I am warning you.

112
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,950
It will be war.

113
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,870
Hell on Earth.

114
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,390
What are you guys talking about?

115
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,750
None of your business, Probie.
None of your business, McGee.

116
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:10,750
Probie.

117
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,910
Petty Officer Smith say anything
while I was talking to her shrink?

118
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,190
No. All she kept telling me was to call her CO and
to let him know that the monsters are after her again.

119
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,470
From all appearances,
I'd say she had a relapse.

120
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,590
Well, my first two marriages
were based on appearances.

121
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,430
Pull Petty Officer Smith's
records when we get back.

122
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,310
Navy Achievement medal winner,
Sailor of the Quarter three times.

123
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,150
She is an outstanding sailor, Gibbs.

124
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,630
Lot of overachievers and
perfectionists lose it.

125
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,230
My uncle ran a Fortune 500 company until they found him
digging up holes in a golf course looking for mole people.

126
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,710
You're a perfectionist,
aren't you, Kate?

127
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,310
Before her breakdown she was working for the
Department of Acquisitions at the Pentagon.

128
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,550
Who's her CO?

129
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,030
Captain Ross Vetter.

130
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,950
There's an open case file on him, boss.

131
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,230
Why don't I know about it?

132
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,150
It's not ours.

133
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,230
It's the FBI's.

134
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,550
They opened it about a month before
Smith had her psychotic break.

135
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,350
What are they investigating Vetter for?

136
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,390
I can't tell.

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,070
They're not letting NCIS
access the contents of the file.

138
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,470
McGee.

139
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,710
You want the FBI's case file
on Captain Vetter. On it.

140
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,550
Let's roll.

141
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,550
Where to?

142
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,630
To ask Petty Officer Smith
some questions about monsters.

143
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,830
Hi, I'm Catherine Reynolds.

144
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,190
We've been expecting you.

145
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,990
Welcome to Seven West.

146
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,710
Commander Witten is on his way down now.

147
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,110
I can tell you everything there
is to know about this place.

148
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,230
They don't need to
know anything, William.

149
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,070
All you have to do is ask me.

150
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,830
Who's got the power, who's cool...

151
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,910
...who's got the baby oil.

152
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,190
That's enough now, William.

153
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,750
Go back to group. Go.

154
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,350
Oh, here's Commander Witten now.

155
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,590
Kate, you're with me.

156
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,390
Uh, boss, what about me?

157
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,070
Conflict in the workplace?

158
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,190
You have no idea.

159
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,910
I have a theory that most of it
results from unresolved sexual issues.

160
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,950
Really?

161
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,990
It certainly has been the case for me.

162
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,270
I could use a drink.

163
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,710
How about you?

164
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,550
Mrs. Reynolds, did you get that
shirt out of the laundry room?

165
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,670
The doctors warned you
about this kind of behavior.

166
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,710
Well, the doctor doesn't
have an ass like this one.

167
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,630
Sorry. I can't help myself sometimes.

168
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,830
She's been sedated.

169
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,470
She'll sleep through the night.

170
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,350
I want to talk to her when she wakes up.

171
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,790
Absolutely not.

172
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,350
She's paranoid of authority figures.

173
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,910
From what I've seen, the only one
she seems paranoid about is you.

174
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,110
She had a delusional episode.

175
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,630
This has nothing to do with NCIS.

176
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,150
You can check back

177
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:45,910
in a few weeks.

178
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,990
We'll see you tomorrow.

179
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,270
I have a degree in clinical psychology.

180
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,310
Do you have any expertise
in the area, Agent Gibbs?

181
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,310
No. No, I do not.

182
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,670
Just a BS meter.

183
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,990
See you in the morning, Doc.

184
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,030
The FBI's stonewalling us, boss.

185
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,390
They claim that the Captain
Vetter case is classified.

186
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,190
Last time I checked, we
had clearances, probie.

187
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,670
Well, they're still not releasing the info,
Tony, but I, uh, I did call the Pentagon.

188
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,350
I spoke with the admiral
in charge of his office.

189
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,990
The FBI thinks that Captain Vetter was taking
kickbacks in exchange for government contracts.

190
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,910
He's on administrative leave
pending outcome of the investigation.

191
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,030
They say anything about
Petty Officer Jessica Smith?

192
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,190
Yes. She was questioned, but so was
everybody else in Vetter's group.

193
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,190
Well, if she was found mentally ill, it would
excuse her from testifying against her boss.

194
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,870
She didn't look like
she was faking it to me.

195
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,670
Something tells me you say that a lot.

196
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,830
Kate, when they poor cold water over your
chest, doesn't that sort of make you...?

197
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,350
Hey, DiNozzo!

198
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,590
You do that again, I will put
my boot so far up your ass...

199
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,510
Yeah. Gibbs.

200
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,870
Agent Gibbs, I should have told
you before we have to talk, sir.

201
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,950
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

202
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,990
Not like this.

203
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,630
They're listening.

204
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,910
You got to help me.

205
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,990
Yeah, all right.

206
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,550
We're on our way.

207
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,390
Hurry, please?

208
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,630
Jessica, stay on the phone with me.

209
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,310
You just keep talking to me, Jessica.

210
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,070
I can't. Just get here.

211
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,310
Kate, come on.

212
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,870
You're with me.

213
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,950
Jessica Smith's room?

214
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,150
Sir, I'm not authorized.

215
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,990
Commander Witten told me...

216
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,110
Open her door or I'll break it down!

217
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,830
Yes, sir.

218
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,470
Find out who else she called.

219
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,470
Check out her speed
dial and her phone book.

220
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,830
On it.

221
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,110
She should've been observed
24 hours a day, Jethro.

222
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,590
A young, troubled girl being left
alone all night is negligent at best.

223
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,630
My God.

224
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,790
Did she leave a note?

225
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,950
No.

226
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,070
If she did, what would she have written?

227
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,430
I don't know.

228
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,110
He was the one responsible
for the Petty Officer.

229
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,750
Easy, Duck.

230
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,310
Commander.

231
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,630
How could you have allowed this young
woman to be left alone all night?

232
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,510
There was a corpsman on duty.

233
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,950
One corpsman for an entire ward?

234
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,870
We had seven patients.

235
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,230
None were considered suicide risks.

236
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,830
I'm sure the family will
take great solace from that.

237
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,710
She's ready, Dr. Mallard.

238
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,110
Let's get her home, Mr. Palmer.

239
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,110
What's going on?

240
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,870
Jessica killed herself.

241
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,910
I heard them say it.

242
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,710
She's deader than dead.

243
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,830
Is it true?

244
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm afraid so, Catherine.

245
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,350
Corpsman, can we get everyone
into the day room, please.

246
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,830
Yes, sir.

247
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,870
Come on, William.

248
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,670
It's okay.

249
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,710
It's okay...

250
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,510
I take it you knew her well?

251
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,830
We spent a month together here.

252
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,670
It's about as good
chick-bonding experience as any.

253
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,790
Ah...

254
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,350
It must be difficult.

255
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,670
It's hard.

256
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,630
Yeah, I know.

257
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,390
Really, really hard, Agent Tony.

258
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,150
If you're not too busy, DiNozzo.

259
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,750
You're a shy little minx.

260
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,910
Later.

261
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,430
I didn't hear anything, sir.

262
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,310
Is this where you
were most of the night?

263
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,750
Unless I was making my rounds.

264
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,750
When's the last time you
checked on Petty Officer Smith?

265
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,950
1930, ma'am.

266
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,870
She was sedated and sleeping peacefully.

267
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,990
If she was sedated, how
did she manage to call us?

268
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,630
And hang herself?

269
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:08,150
Ma'am, I've seen patients kill themselves by
stuffing their noses and throats full of toilet paper.

270
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,990
If they want to do it, they find a way.

271
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,350
Or they're helped.

272
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,830
Who classified her a non-suicide risk?

273
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,550
Commander Witten, sir.

274
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,430
All right.

275
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,990
That's all for now.

276
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,150
Yes, sir.

277
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,790
Boss...

278
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,430
finished processing the room.

279
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,470
Okay to tape it off now?

280
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,830
Yeah, go ahead, do it.

281
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,750
I also want everything on Witten.

282
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,350
And every contact he's had
with Petty Officer Smith.

283
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,670
Tonight?

284
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,750
Oh... Oh, I'll get right on it.

285
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,910
What about doctor-patient
confidentiality?

286
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,710
Doesn't exist in the
military anymore, probie.

287
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,150
And sadly for some...

288
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:53,070
doesn't exist between
NCIS teammates either.

289
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,150
You're wasting your time.

290
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,110
Doesn't bother me anymore, Tony.

291
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,270
Probie, you want to see something hot?

292
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:00,830
Sure.

293
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,990
What's it going to cost me?

294
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,870
I don't know.

295
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,110
You still have that
Catholic schoolgirl uniform?

296
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,030
Agent DiNozzo.

297
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,990
I thought you were dead, Fornell.

298
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,670
I got better.

299
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,190
Does Gibbs know you're
sitting at his desk?

300
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,710
Just checking my e-mail.

301
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,910
Don't think he'll mind.

302
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,910
How long has he been here?

303
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,950
Since I got in.

304
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,030
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

305
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,070
Got better.

306
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,270
Does Gibbs know he's
sitting at his desk?

307
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,350
No.

308
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,430
Oh, this is going to be...

309
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:44,950
Great.

310
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,070
Comfortable?

311
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:48,990
Not really.

312
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,070
There's no lumbar support.

313
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,870
And you should get a password
to protect your computer.

314
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,830
That's what this is for.

315
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,910
What do you want, Tobias?

316
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,710
I'm hurt.

317
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,110
Can't an old friend
just stop by to say hi?

318
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,110
Well, you are old, I'll give you that.

319
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,870
Our usual conference room?

320
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,270
Lead the way.

321
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,870
Hey, make sure he didn't do any of that
virus goat rope crap to my... my thing.

322
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,590
Goat rope?

323
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,190
Marine term, probie.

324
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,990
Means halfway between FUBAR and SNAFU.

325
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,870
Okay, what's FUBAR?

326
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,190
You are.

327
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,270
Why is the FBI investigating a Navy
captain without informing us, Fornell?

328
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,070
I forgot.

329
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,630
You always inform us when one of your
cases strays into FBI jurisdiction.

330
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,590
I want to know about this case.

331
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,870
We're looking at a Captain
Vetter for taking kickbacks.

332
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,590
You came all the way
down here to tell me that?

333
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,710
That...

334
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,390
and they want you to back off, Jethro.

335
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,070
Believe me I told them it was futile.

336
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,230
What does Petty Officer Jessica
Smith have to do with this?

337
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,710
No idea. I'm just the messenger here.

338
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,310
Now why don't I believe that?

339
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,190
I'd say mostly because you're a bastard.

340
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,110
But it wouldn't do any good, would it?

341
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,190
I'll see what I can find out for you.

342
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,270
No promises.

343
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,430
Tobias, you owe me.

344
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,910
You're calling that in for a B-and-E
on some petty officer's house?

345
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,510
She's dead.

346
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,630
How?

347
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,750
She killed herself last night.

348
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,550
I want to know why.

349
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,830
I'll find out.

350
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,390
Under one condition.

351
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,630
Name it.

352
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,750
You don't do anything to jeopardize
our investigion into Captain Vetter.

353
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,750
I wouldn't dream of it.

354
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,710
Why don't I believe that?

355
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,910
Mostly...

356
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,510
...because I'm a bastard.

357
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,390
Hey, McGee.

358
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,950
Boss.

359
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,750
Get me the home address
of Captain Ross Vetter.

360
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,870
And get the sedan.

361
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,950
What do you want?

362
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,110
To hear your side of the story.

363
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,790
Off the record.

364
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,310
I'm being railroaded.

365
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,270
By who?

366
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,670
The military industrial complex.

367
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,990
I wouldn't play their game.

368
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,310
What kind of game is that, Captain?

369
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,910
Do you know how defense contracts
are decided in this country?

370
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,470
Usually by the lowest bidder.

371
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,030
Every senator, every congressman, tries to
grab a piece of the pie for their own people.

372
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,390
For their ate.

373
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,870
No- the people, the corporations
that fund their campaigns

374
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,030
and that hire them after they
get out of office, Agent McGee.

375
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:00,070
You think that's why the
FBI's investigating you?

376
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,870
I know it.

377
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,670
I was trying to change that system.

378
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,310
And now I'm paying for it.

379
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,110
Damn it!

380
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,990
Sweetheart, Audrey, need
some towels out here.

381
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,070
Kind of early for the
single malt, isn't it, Skip?

382
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,870
You have no idea what the last couple
of months have been like for me.

383
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,470
For my family.

384
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,190
No, I don't.

385
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,110
But you don't know what it's
been like for Petty Officer Smith.

386
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,590
I've been meaning to visit her.

387
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,350
A little late for that.

388
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,950
Jessica Smith killed
herself last night, Captain.

389
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,670
I knew she was having some...

390
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,870
Issues when her fiance died, but...

391
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,510
Do you know why?

392
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,510
That's what we're hoping to find out.

393
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,590
When a you people
going to leave us alone?

394
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,790
That's all right, sweetheart,
they're NCIS agents.

395
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,070
I don't care, Ross.

396
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,510
I'm not answering any more questions.

397
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,790
I want them out of my home.

398
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,670
I'm sorry to hear about Jessica.

399
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,990
She was like a daughter to me.

400
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,510
I should have been there for her.

401
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,150
She wanted us to pass a
message along to you, Captain.

402
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,710
The monsters were after her again.

403
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Monsters?

404
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,870
I don't understand.

405
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,070
We don't either... yet.

406
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,750
If you think of anything
that might help, call me.

407
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,950
Of course.

408
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,870
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

409
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,430
You have a beautiful home.

410
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,310
When I was a Marine, I could have
never afforded a place as nice as this.

411
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,830
She was right, Jethro.

412
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,910
Monsters were after her.

413
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,310
Hanging leaves a telltale "V"
mark on the neck here... and here.

414
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,110
As you can see, these marks
are missing from her neck.

415
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,990
Also I found bruising and clotting on the inside
of her nose, and on the inside of her lips.

416
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,430
She was smothered.

417
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,750
Yes. Poor girl was dead long before
the noose went anywhere near her neck.

418
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,110
This was no suicide, Jethro.

419
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,510
Our Petty Officer was murdered.

420
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,910
Look familiar, sex machine?

421
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:20,870
Now that you mention it...

422
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,390
Nope, it's a different
style T-shirt. See?

423
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,230
I'm begging you, don't.

424
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,310
Gonna be nice?

425
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,830
Yes.

426
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,750
See what?

427
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,310
Hi there, boss. Um...

428
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,710
Just admiring Abby's handiwork.

429
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:36,070
Why?

430
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,950
Well, I was bored, and I thought
she needed a little personality.

431
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,910
Does she have a purpose, Abby?

432
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,950
Several, in fact.

433
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,030
According to her instruction manual.

434
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,510
For the case, Abbs.

435
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,590
Oh. Right.

436
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,270
Um, I think I know how Petty
Officer Smith was strung up.

437
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,470
According to her hospital chart, she was given 15
milligrams of Trazodone when she arrived at Bethesda.

438
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,270
That's enough to zonk her
out for most of the day.

439
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,350
Then how did she make the
phone call asking us for help?

440
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,710
Well, it would have started to wear off.

441
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,070
She would have been weak,
sluggish at least enough for this.

442
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,310
Except there were no
signs of struggle, Abby.

443
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,990
Have you ever been on Trazodone, Tony?

444
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,790
I mean, she couldn't have
fought off a ten-year-old.

445
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,230
Bustill there is a problem.

446
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,590
How'd they hang her afterwards.

447
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,750
Correct as always,
my silver-haired fox.

448
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,510
I mean, Gibbs, sir, boss.

449
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,430
See what's missing?

450
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,310
Nothing to stand on.

451
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,030
Exactly.

452
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,830
How did the killer lift
her body afterwards?

453
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,950
There were two of them?

454
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,670
Possible.

455
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,990
But there's a simpler way.

456
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,950
The legs of the bed act as a fulcrum...

457
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,110
...making it easier for one
person to lift Jessica's weight.

458
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,590
That would've made some noise.

459
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,430
Enough that you probably would've
heard it from the nurses' station.

460
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,790
Manned by Corpsman Morgan.

461
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,430
Have him report to NCIS tomorrow.

462
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,030
Don't tell him why.

463
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,950
I saw that.

464
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,990
Saw what?

465
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,670
Nothing.

466
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,350
I saw nothing.

467
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,190
You want some of this?

468
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,950
I got a clean cup around here somewhere.

469
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,310
I'm not worried about your cups, Gibbs.

470
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,390
How can you drink that rotgut?

471
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,590
Easy. It's got alcohol in it.

472
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,590
Macallan 18.

473
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,110
Now, there's a drink.

474
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,550
What'd you find out about the FBI
investigation into Captain Vetter?

475
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,070
Officially, not much.

476
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,710
Unofficially?

477
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,950
They weren't getting very
far, so they decided to go...

478
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,750
for someone weaker in his office.

479
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,110
His personal assistant,
Petty Officer Smith.

480
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,790
Why shut NCIS out of it?

481
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,430
They worked her over pretty hard.

482
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,510
Didn't think you'd go along with it.

483
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,070
Threats, jail time.

484
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,550
They forced her to wear a wire to work.

485
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,550
That woman just lost her
fiance in Iraq, Fornell.

486
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,830
Which only made her more
vulnerable, easy to manipulate.

487
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,630
Man, and you call me a bastard.

488
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,390
Wasn't my case, Gibbs.

489
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,870
I'm just here doing a favor.

490
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,950
That said, they think
she was hiding something.

491
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,190
What?

492
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,230
Unfortunately, she killed herself
before they could find out.

493
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,430
Jessica Smith did not commit
suicide she was murdered.

494
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,550
By whom?

495
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,790
That's a hell of a question, Tobias.

496
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,670
That's what you're
gonna help me find out.

497
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,670
Book-on-tape
club?

498
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,310
Jessica Smith's therapy sessions.

499
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,630
Anything interesting?

500
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,670
Well, not from her psychologist, Commander
Witten she's evasive, afraid to talk.

501
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,550
She's a little more outgoing in
the group sessions but not by much.

502
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,350
Is her friend Catherine
Reynolds on those tapes, probie?

503
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,350
Yes. Yes.

504
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,870
Catherine Reynolds she is the
one that talks about sex, a lot.

505
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,590
Gets kind of graphic.

506
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,870
Ooh. Okay, I'm gonna need to, uh, listen
to those, and probably take them...

507
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,470
Tony!

508
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,710
What is wrong with you?

509
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,950
burn him a copy, McGee.

510
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:35,870
What I was going to say: if the petty officer was afraid
to talk in public, she might be talking in private.

511
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,070
She may have opened up to some of her
friends inside the ward- it's a good idea.

512
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,910
It's a well-known fact, Mr. McGee,
that women tell each other everything.

513
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,550
That would explain why none of
my friends will go out with you.

514
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,790
I'm sorry, say something?

515
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,110
Nothing.

516
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,590
Agent DiNozzo?

517
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,310
Yeah.

518
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,630
I was told to report
to you this morning.

519
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,190
Not to me, Petty Officer to him.

520
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,310
Am I in trouble?

521
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,710
Depends.

522
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,870
On what, sir?

523
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,390
You told us you were at the
front desk your entire watch.

524
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,910
Except for when I was
making rounds, sir.

525
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,070
How long do the rounds take?

526
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,390
A few minutes.

527
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,270
A few minutes.

528
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,150
Okay, got that.

529
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,790
Did you see anyone else come in or
out of the exit of the ward that night?

530
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,990
No, sir.

531
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,230
What about hearing anything unusual?

532
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,470
No, nothing.

533
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,150
Until you showed up, sir.

534
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,550
Yep.

535
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,870
We got us a problem, Petty Officer.

536
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,550
Sir?

537
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,190
Jessica Smith was murdered last night.

538
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,430
Murdered?

539
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,590
And... according to you, you're
the only that could've done it.

540
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,670
There's no way he did it.

541
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,790
Look at his reaction.

542
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,150
Maybe he's just a good actor.

543
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,630
Nobody's that good.

544
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,990
I've been thinking, Kate.

545
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,070
About the photo.

546
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,750
I'm sorry.

547
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,110
I mean, you know I'd never...

548
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,870
give it out, right?

549
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,270
In fact, I'm gonna delete it right now.

550
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,310
Really?

551
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,510
Thank you, Tony.

552
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,590
That-that would be a huge relief.

553
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,710
What are you doing?

554
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,790
Acting, Kate.

555
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,550
It's not that hard.

556
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,630
Okay. I... I lied, sir.

557
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,190
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of figured
that out for myself, Petty Officer.

558
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,230
I screwed up, sir.

559
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,870
I really screwed up.

560
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,630
Kind of figured that one out, too.

561
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,670
I- I left my post for about 40 minutes.

562
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,230
I was...

563
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,790
with someone.

564
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,870
This person have a name?

565
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,950
One of the...

566
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,790
patients, sir.

567
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,550
Catherine Reynolds.

568
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,070
Doing what?

569
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,830
W- We've been having sex
for three months now.

570
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,310
Tony, I want you to talk
to Catherine Reynolds.

571
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,350
See if she'll verify Morgan's alibi.

572
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,270
My pleasure.

573
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,910
Kate, you're with me.

574
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,830
McGee.

575
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,070
McGee.

576
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,310
What the hell are you doing?

577
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,750
Well, I'm-I'm listening to Petty
Officer Smith's group therapy sessions.

578
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,510
There's two people that
she interacts with the most:

579
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:34,630
Catherine Reynolds, Lynn Simons they've got a lot in
common: knitting, crossword puzzles, the TV show...

580
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,110
McGee!

581
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,750
Well, I think they may be friends.

582
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,910
Why does this matter?

583
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,830
Well, she may have confided in them,

584
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,470
told them something that
she didn't tell anybody else.

585
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,430
That's good thinking, McGee.

586
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm the one who came up...

587
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,030
Tony, go baby-sit our
corpsman in Interrogation.

588
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,990
McGee, you interview
Reynolds and Simons.

589
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,190
Why didn't you tell him I had that idea.

590
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,710
Tony, a wise man once told
me: there's no "I" in "team."

591
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,550
Where we going?

592
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,030
Jessica Smith's house.

593
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,190
I think she was telling the truth
about someone being in her bedroom.

594
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,150
Down!

595
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,390
Are you okay?

596
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,110
Yeah.

597
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,670
Let's get this bastard.

598
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,550
Did you get a plate?

599
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,990
No.

600
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,110
Aw, damn it.

601
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,630
What do you think they were looking for?

602
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,270
Found something.

603
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,590
Not quite sure what.

604
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,590
You have any idea?

605
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,870
That's a radio receiver
and broadcast speaker.

606
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,390
I guess Jessica Smith
was hearing voices.

607
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,150
Yeah. And they weren't in her head.

608
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,270
So, the parts are off the shelf, but the
execution is very, very sophisticated.

609
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,750
The receiver is actually the
guts from a disposable cell phone.

610
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,070
You dial the number,
and the device activates.

611
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,950
Like a terrorist bomb.

612
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,430
Well, yeah, but in this case,
instead of an explosion, you get this.

613
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,110
Jess... ica... Jessica...

614
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,030
Over here... Over here...

615
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,390
He's dead... your fiance...

616
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,710
It's like the soundtrack
to Friday the 13th.

617
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,990
You know, the movie?

618
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,510
There were, like, 11 of them.

619
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,310
Oh, Gibbs, you really need to
get out of your basement more.

620
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,230
What were they about?

621
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,710
Basically, there's this guy
that wears a hockey mask, and

622
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,470
he kills teenagers with a machete,
usually right after they had sex.

623
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,390
Why?

624
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,110
Well, he died at summer camp, so
his mother killed everyone there.

625
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,670
But he was actually alive and he was living in
the woods, but then he died and he went to Hell,

626
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,230
and then he was frozen, and
then he went to outer space...

627
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,470
It's complicated.

628
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,910
You don't know, do you?

629
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,750
Not a clue.

630
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,390
I keep hoping they're gonna
explain it in the next one.

631
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,910
You call me when you
find something, Abby.

632
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,870
Yeah. Gibbs.

633
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,710
Found something.

634
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,830
See this?

635
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,030
Yes.

636
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,030
I cut myself today installing
a graphics card in my computer.

637
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,430
Ok. Want me to kiss it or something?

638
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,990
That would be really nice,
but it's not my point.

639
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,590
Most of the metal inside
electronics is unfinished.

640
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,750
I cut myself all the time
on burrs and rough edges.

641
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,430
Yeah? Well, you ought to try building a boat
with hand tools after a couple shots of Jack.

642
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,510
Anyway, my point is, I was snooping
around the circuit board, and I found...

643
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,830
...this.

644
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,750
It's blood, Gibbs.

645
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,350
Whoever assembled this cut themselves.

646
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,470
We have their DNA.

647
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,630
That's great work, Abby.

648
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,830
Feel better?

649
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,390
Much.

650
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,390
Is there some reason why you people
don't feel the need to call ahead?

651
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,870
Or is it that you just enjoy
arriving unannounced like this?

652
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,950
Depends on the situation, Commander.

653
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,790
Well, I have a war to run here.

654
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,590
I don't have time for this, Agent McGee.

655
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,670
I'm here to interview
several of your patients.

656
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,550
Catherine Reynolds and
Petty Officer Lynn Simons.

657
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,190
Simons was discharged from
the Navy three weeks ago.

658
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,390
Catherine Reynolds is in her room,
and I do not want her disturbed.

659
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,030
You should've called.

660
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,630
I could've saved you the trip.

661
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,670
Commander...

662
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,390
it wasn't a request.

663
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,870
Do you have any idea how upsetting
your presence was the other night?

664
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,550
Some. Do you have any idea what's
going on inside your own ward?

665
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,190
And what exactly is
that supposed to mean?

666
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,390
Well, we can start with Corpsman Morgan having
sex with Ms. Reynolds during the last three months.

667
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,510
That's impossible I would've known...

668
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,630
And we can end with
Jessica Smith's murder.

669
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,030
It's your call, Commander.

670
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,150
Catherine, it's Commander Witten.

671
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,710
Are you decent?

672
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,790
If I was, I wouldn't be in here, Doc.

673
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:50,990
Go away.

674
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,030
You have a visitor.

675
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,350
NCIS Special Agent McGee.

676
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,510
Bummer.

677
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,510
I thought it was the cute one.

678
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,150
Uh, well, I just need to ask
a few questions, Ms. Reynolds.

679
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,630
Okay, as long as I
can ask you some back.

680
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,950
I'll just be down the hall.

681
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,750
This is about Corpsman
Timothy Morgan, ma'am.

682
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:27,990
Um, claims that he has been in a
relationship with you and that on the night

683
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,790
of Jessica Smith's death that he was...

684
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,430
With me knocking boots.

685
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,390
You take what you can get
around here, Agent McGee.

686
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,590
My turn.

687
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,150
Are you a virgin?

688
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,350
No.

689
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,390
Are you sure?

690
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,430
Uh, the last time I checked.

691
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,870
And that was two
questions, Ms. Reynolds.

692
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,670
What time were you with Morgan?

693
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,750
I think it was between 7:00 and 8:30.

694
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,790
And were you close to
Jessica Smith at all?

695
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,950
I really liked her.

696
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,510
She didn't belong here.

697
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,630
Ever been in love?

698
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,910
Love?

699
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,470
Yeah. Sometimes I think
I might have been, yeah.

700
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,030
Honesty.

701
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,950
I like that.

702
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,950
Very rare in a man.

703
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,070
Did Jessica ever tell you
anything about her problems?

704
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,550
Yes.

705
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,710
So what did she say?

706
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,510
She was hang an affair
with a married man.

707
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,910
Did she tell you his name?

708
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,350
Nope.

709
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,350
Okay.

710
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,470
All right.

711
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,630
Well, thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

712
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,550
You've been very helpful...

713
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,270
But she did tell Lynn
Simons who then told me.

714
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,470
Boxers or tighty-whiteys?

715
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,070
Depends. I guess both.

716
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,750
What about right now?

717
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,710
Boxers.

718
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,830
He was her CO.

719
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,790
Bastard never returned any
of her phone calls in here.

720
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,110
So she asked Lynn to
deliver a message for her.

721
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,950
Petty Officer Lynn Simons,
avionics and electronics tech.

722
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,190
Received a medical
discharge three weeks ago.

723
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,950
Jessica Smith asked her to deliver
a message to Captain Vetter.

724
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,030
She loved him and promised to forgive
him if he would just contact her.

725
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,710
Simons failed to report to her therapy
session at the VA two weeks ago.

726
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,030
No one's seen her since, Gibbs.

727
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,430
Find her. McGee, get
Captain Vetter in here.

728
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,230
He refuses, put him in cuffs.

729
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,630
You might want to hear this, boss.

730
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,030
Vetter and Commander Witten both
served on the USS Kennedy in '99.

731
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,510
It's a big ship, Tony.

732
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,550
It could be a coincidence.

733
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,150
Yeah, I don't believe in coincidences.

734
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,670
Hey, it's me.

735
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,630
We need to talk.

736
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,590
So what's the plan, good cop/bad cop?

737
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,710
More like bad cop/scary cop, McGee.

738
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,430
Which one's which?

739
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,950
I think you'll have to ask
their ex-wives that one.

740
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,150
I demand to know what
the hell is going on here!

741
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:06,790
Not much.

742
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,910
Just the end of your life
as you know it, Captain.

743
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,630
You see what I've had to deal with, Agent Gibbs
threats, intimidation I won't stand for it.

744
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,070
You told me Petty Officer Smith
was like a daughter to you?

745
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,910
What's that got to do with this?

746
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,630
Considering you're
sleeping with her, a lot.

747
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,510
I want a lawyer.

748
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,630
Yeah, you'll need one.

749
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,350
She was murdered.

750
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,710
We think it was you.

751
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,430
Where were you Wednesday night?

752
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,190
At home with my wife.

753
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,710
Well, we checked with her, Vetter.

754
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,310
She said you went out.

755
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,390
Didn't come back till around midnight.

756
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,470
No, she's lying.

757
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,790
Maybe.

758
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,430
They do tend to get vindictive when they
find out you've been cheating on them.

759
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,790
You told her about Jessica?

760
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,430
I did.

761
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,310
You might want to consult a
divorce lawyer while you're at it.

762
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,750
I didn't kill Jessica.

763
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,390
I loved her, for God's sake.

764
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,750
He loved her, Gibbs.

765
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,790
I guess that's it then.

766
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,030
We got to let him go.

767
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,510
Sure. After 80 or 90
years in Leavenworth.

768
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,190
You have means, you have motive
and you have no alibi, Vetter.

769
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,750
She catch you taking the kickbacks
or was she just helping you?

770
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,750
She caught me.

771
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,950
The money was supposed to have
been for us, after the divorce.

772
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,190
But I swear to you both, I
didn't, I couldn't kill her.

773
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,150
You know what might help
me believe him, Gibbs?

774
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,555
If he started crying?

775
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,230
No. If the good captain here
told us where the money is.

776
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,150
Are you offering me a deal?

777
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,910
Depends.

778
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,830
Who else knew the location of the money?

779
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,870
Only me.

780
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,070
Me and Jessica.

781
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,430
He's telling the truth, boss.

782
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,150
He stashed the money in a gym locker.

783
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,790
Looks to be around $800,000
in a green duffel bag.

784
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,350
Who do you think's going
to pick it up, Gibbs?

785
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,110
Our killer.

786
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,070
Boss, the GPS marker
Tony put with the money

787
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,910
is showing movement.

788
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,110
Bag's in play, DiNozzo.

789
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,710
Have Kate ten up on the entrance.

790
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,470
Roger that.

791
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,990
Tight around the entrance.

792
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,710
It's Petty Officer Simons, boss.

793
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,310
Well, yes, Tony, we can all see that.

794
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,910
Take her down?

795
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,590
Negative.

796
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,870
I want to see where she takes it.

797
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,510
That's $800,000 in there, Jethro.

798
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,030
Relax, Tobias.

799
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,710
It's not yours.

800
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,230
Yeah. Gibbs.

801
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,670
He ran the bloodpfrom the circuit
board through AFDIL and I got a match.

802
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,910
It's a Petty Officer...

803
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,070
Lynn Simons.

804
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,550
We got it, Abbs. Thanks.

805
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,150
I really hate it when he does that.

806
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,230
She's heading for Bethesda.

807
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,030
She's picking up Commander Witten, boss.

808
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,910
Strike that.

809
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,630
He's going to follow her.

810
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,950
Or she's going to follow
him. Guess again, Sex Machine.

811
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,790
It's your girlfriend.

812
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,150
Got the money, babe?

813
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,070
Oh, yeah.

814
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,390
Good.

815
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,990
Get out. Wh-What are you doing?

816
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,190
What I always do. Survive.

817
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,150
But if it wasn't for me you never would have gotten her back
and the hospital never would have known where she hide the money.

818
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,950
True.

819
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,590
Now get out, bitch.

820
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,550
Drop the weapon.

821
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,270
They followed you!

822
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:22,950
Drop it!

823
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,230
It's not loaded! Please
don't shoot! Please!

824
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,070
You're a stupid bitch!

825
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,510
Aah! Aah!

826
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,030
Don't touch me!

827
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,350
You're not my type, lady.

828
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,630
Hey, get your hands on the wheel!

829
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,350
Kate, cuff this wack job.

830
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,510
That's not me.

831
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,350
Well of course it's not you.

832
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,110
Too bad nobody else
is going to know that.

833
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,470
That's low, Kate.

834
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,190
I learned from the best Tony.

835
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,030
We both delete at the same time?

836
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,950
One three.

837
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,910
One...

838
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,190
two...

839
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,350
three.

840
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:40,923
See you tomorrow, boss.

841
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:41,750
Have a good one, Gibbs.
