1
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:06,413
You sold your sperm?

2
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:08,652
Stop looking at me like that.
l was a freshman in college.

3
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:13,657
There are little teenage DiNozzos
running around somewhere?

4
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:16,331
That's frightening.

5
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:18,578
l never thought about it
till this morning.

6
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:20,414
l got a registered letter
from the sperm bank

7
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:23,176
telling me to contact them
as soon as possible.

8
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,900
- Why?
- l don't know.

9
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:27,900
- <i>We're moving, DiNozzo.</i>
- Coming out.

10
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,818
- We're on our way down.
- <i>Roger, boss.</i>

11
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,614
- The car's ready.
- <i>Check the exit.</i>

12
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:38,694
- On it. They're coming down.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:40,410
Standing by.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,140
- You're making a mistake.
- You made a mistake.

15
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,413
- Back off.
- Stupid, you're making a...

16
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:53,580
Hey, boss, hold on one second.

17
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,621
What do you got, McGee?

18
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,495
l'm not sure.

19
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:01,856
l had you...

20
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,853
You're not telling me what to do.

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,216
Talk to me, McGee.

22
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:09,061
Go, go, go.
Get him out of here.

23
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,690
Through the front entrance.
Go, go, go!

24
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,176
- You find a weapon?
- Nope.

25
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:19,900
Yeah, well, we're done.

26
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,252
Let's bag him and tag him,
Mr. Palmer.

27
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:24,901
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:29,174
Do you think Mr. Ryan
was connected in any way

29
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:32,140
to the death threat
on the chief of naval operations?

30
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:34,778
Gonna find out.
lt came from a human rights group

31
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,536
protesting Marine abuse
of prisoners at Gitmo.

32
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:41,138
lt's ironic, isn't it? A human rights
group threatening to kill.

33
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:45,620
lt's no different than a right-to-lifer
bombing a family planning clinic, Duck.

34
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:49,019
Yes, we live
in interesting times, Jethro.

35
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,612
You think, Duck?

36
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:55,261
Way to go, probie.
Three shots, three hits.

37
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:58,141
l guess my instruction
on the range paid off, huh?

38
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:00,977
Tony, l killed somebody, okay?

39
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:12,250
What about the CNO?

40
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,492
- Secured at home.
- Doubled his security detail.

41
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,732
- Did you find his weapon?
- No.

42
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:17,891
lt's got to be here.

43
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:22,975
l identified myself
as a federal officer.

44
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:26,331
He fired at me. l returned fire.

45
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,010
The SUV drove off.
His weapon has got to be here.

46
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:32,699
The SUV, McGee. Did you get
the color? Number? Make?

47
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,291
Dark blue or black.

48
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:37,658
Virginia plate.

49
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,892
First two numbers 89.
l don't know the model.

50
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:42,496
- Ziva, get out a BOLO.
- On just that?

51
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,538
- Right, BOLO.
- Hang on.

52
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:48,421
Hey, l wanna know everything
about this guy.

53
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,978
McGee, go back
to where you fired from.

54
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:53,860
DiNozzo.

55
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:57,380
Show me, McGee.

56
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,495
Federal officer.
Drop your weapon.

57
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:08,731
- Got it?
- Got it.

58
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:16,655
Don't worry, McGee.
l'll find the slug.

59
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:19,975
Well, we're done.

60
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,296
- This guy's a mess.
- Yeah, you don't know the half of it.

61
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,532
His lungs were completely blackened

62
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:27,658
from what l would guess
is a two-pack-a-day habit.

63
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:30,132
His coronary arteries
are almost completely blocked,

64
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,736
and his liver shows
definite sign of abuse.

65
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,378
This little sluggy's in good shape.

66
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,772
l took that out of his thigh.

67
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:43,901
Didn't impact any bone. lt imbedded
itself in the adductor longus.

68
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,618
- This one's all banged up.
- Yeah, left shoulder.

69
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:53,378
lt entered the deltopectoral triangle,
smashed the fourth rib,

70
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,420
and ended up
in the upper lobe of his left lung.

71
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,220
Both those were non-lethal.

72
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,419
That one, however,
caused massive damage.

73
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:06,817
- Abigail.
- Ducky.

74
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:10,731
You know, there was a time
when you wouldn't set foot in Autopsy.

75
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:14,053
- Look how far l've come.
- Regrettably, for the moment.

76
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:17,055
Look, back off.

77
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:19,661
l think l'm ready
for the next big step.

78
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:21,496
And what's that?

79
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,374
- Assisting in an autopsy.
- Oh, yeah, right.

80
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,739
Actually, Mr. Palmer,
a medical degree

81
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:32,053
is not required,
even to be a coroner.

82
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:35,619
Abby has an exceptional
analytical mind.

83
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,181
She's a quick study.

84
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,896
l think you'll do very well.
Put it on.

85
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:47,253
Your first lesson,
lesson number one.

86
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:51,301
The third bullet removed
what was left of the fourth rib,

87
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,214
smashing the costal cartilage,

88
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:57,898
took a piece out of the left atrium,
and lodged itself

89
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,815
against the costal surface
of the scapula.

90
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:03,621
lt's amazing how much damage
one bullet can do.

91
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:06,177
Definitely the kill shot.

92
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,091
Something wrong?

93
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:16,013
l'm sorry, McGee.
That wasn't meant for your ears.

94
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,298
Not a problem, Ducky.

95
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:26,290
l was hoping when l woke up
this morning it was all a nightmare.

96
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:28,259
Somebody needs a hug.

97
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,652
l was trained for last night, but...

98
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:39,610
Well, shooting a human cutout
is not quite the same, Timothy.

99
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:43,657
No one is prepared for their first kill.

100
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:49,458
Abby, l'm gonna need you
to run his prints.

101
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,772
The driver's license was phony.

102
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,133
The only Andrew Aidan Ryan
l could find

103
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,815
is 3 years old
and lives in Los Angeles.

104
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:00,411
The address, if it existed, would be
in the middle of the Potomac.

105
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,971
- Run his prints.
- Why didn't we think of that, Tony?

106
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:06,533
Abby's working on it.
FBl's identified three radical groups

107
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,579
protesting prisoner abuse
at Gitmo, boss.

108
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,414
Catch anything with the BOLO,
Officer David?

109
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,534
We did.
Six hundred thousand SUVs.

110
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:17,181
- That are registered in Virginia.
- Yeah, so?

111
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:20,579
So we're gonna check them
against radical groups.

112
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:22,491
Don't--

113
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,573
Something bothering you, Tony?

114
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:28,173
He doesn't want to say
what we're all thinking.

115
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:29,536
Spit it out.

116
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:33,578
McGee says he was shot at,
but we can't seem to find the slug,

117
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,256
shell casing or a weapon.

118
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,014
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Sir, the director would like</i>

119
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,252
- <i>to see you in her office.</i>
- Be right up.

120
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:47,417
McGee isn't your father,
and he isn't Ari.

121
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,931
He doesn't know how to lie.

122
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:54,851
What'd he say?

123
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,332
To go back to work.

124
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,498
Go right in, Special Agent Gibbs.

125
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,821
Shut the door, Jethro.

126
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:19,292
l'm flashing back
to Paris in '99.

127
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:28,739
- Not what you're thinking.
- No?

128
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,057
Then what?

129
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:33,250
l remember you covering
for another agent

130
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,614
who messed up.

131
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,535
- What agent was that?
- You know damn well what agent.

132
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,658
Oh, you mean the time
you shot that guy.

133
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,141
Did McGee blow it?

134
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,451
McGee is a probie.

135
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,501
Probies make mistakes. Having said
that, no, l don't think he did.

136
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:47,697
Where's the gun?

137
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,696
- The slug that was fired.
- l don't know, but l will find out.

138
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:55,099
The CNO's aide called me
at 7 a.m. this morning.

139
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,940
Admiral Chapman wants
to know what's going on.

140
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,535
He asked me--

141
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:02,010
What are you thinking about?

142
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,095
Paris.

143
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:07,180
Get your mind
out of the bedroom, Jethro.

144
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:10,334
Let's get some answers.

145
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:14,735
<i>Your call is very important to us.</i>
<i>Please stay on the line.</i>

146
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,415
<i>We will be with you in a moment.</i>

147
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,334
You've been holding for 1 5 minutes.

148
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:20,415
Must be important.

149
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,380
Yep.

150
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:25,379
Sperm bank?

151
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:32,700
- Yeah.
- Why'd you do it?

152
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,215
You didn't need the money.

153
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,452
lt was easier than giving blood.

154
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:39,341
You enjoyed making those deposits.

155
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,576
Was there a penalty
for early withdrawal?

156
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:49,974
You're a sick chick, David.

157
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:51,934
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

158
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:56,613
Hi there. l received
a certified letter requesting l call.

159
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:58,852
Thanks, Agent Vandalay.
You are the man.

160
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,859
- l owe you one, man.
- Anything useful, DiNozzo?

161
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:04,332
Of the 621 ,800 SUVs
registered in Virginia,

162
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,096
approximately 1 27,000
of them are dark-colored.

163
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:08,651
Vanity plates aside,

164
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:11,620
one in every hundred
begins with the numbers 89.

165
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:14,819
- That's over 1 ,200 vehicles.
- We're running the registered owners

166
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,860
against the names on the list
of protesters. lt's gonna take a while.

167
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,371
What's wrong?

168
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:25,212
l ran the fingerprint through AFlS.

169
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,452
The victim's real name
is John Benedict.

170
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:29,854
Has he got a record?

171
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:32,254
He was a Metro detective.

172
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,979
He was working undercover.

173
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,773
l killed a cop, boss.

174
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,578
Can l get you two anything?

175
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:52,857
No, thanks.

176
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,461
Yes, ma'am. l'll send them in.

177
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:12,613
Special Agents Gibbs and McGee, this
is Metro Police Captain Dan Karzin

178
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:16,132
and Sergeant Keith Archer,
the dead officer's partner.

179
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:19,852
- l'm sorry about--
- Director Shepard already gave us

180
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:24,095
the official NClS condolences,
Special Agent McGee.

181
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,658
We're here to find out
what happened.

182
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,255
Please sit.

183
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:38,054
l'd like to ask Sergeant Archer
some questions.

184
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:41,056
Do you know why your partner
was behind the hotel last night?

185
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:44,214
- No. We were off duty.
- When did you last see him?

186
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,697
Yesterday about noon.

187
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,773
They were working
undercover, Narcotics.

188
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,536
Just got off a 36-hour shift.

189
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,014
l read your report.

190
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:55,378
l got some questions.

191
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,978
You say you identified yourself?

192
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,340
- Yes, sir.
- Loud enough to be heard?

193
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:02,817
Definitely.

194
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:06,258
And you contend that Lieutenant
Benedict then turned and fired at you.

195
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:07,821
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:10,174
So why can't you find
a bullet or a weapon?

197
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,617
- We can't answer that yet.
- Yeah, l can.

198
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,898
Bennie wasn't carrying one.

199
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:18,740
Are you sure it happened
like that, son?

200
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:27,898
lt happened the way
that l reported it, captain.

201
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:31,213
Because l knew Lieutenant John
Benedict maybe 20 years.

202
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:35,619
He was a highly decorated officer.
A great cop.

203
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:39,020
And if Agent McGee
had properly identified himself

204
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:42,492
the way that he claims, there's no way
Bennie would've acted threateningly.

205
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,414
- Evidently he did.
- l don't believe it.

206
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:46,971
Special Agent McGee,

207
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,059
why don't you return
to the squad room?

208
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,611
We'll call you if we need you.

209
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,858
l'm really sorry.

210
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,614
With all due respect,
Director Shepard,

211
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,579
l think we all know
what happened here.

212
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:16,381
Nobody else saw another vehicle
in the alley.

213
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,737
A nervous rookie panicked.

214
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,130
Fired prematurely.

215
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,451
Killed a veteran cop.

216
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,931
McGee's young,
but he's a damn good agent.

217
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,616
Are you sure your partner
wasn't carrying a weapon last night?

218
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:30,290
lt would've blown his cover
on the case that we were working.

219
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,373
You said he was off duty,
just like you are right now.

220
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:33,731
- Yeah.
- You're carrying.

221
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,373
The small of your back.

222
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:39,934
Your partner's liver
said he drank a lot.

223
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,053
Oh, go to hell.

224
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,452
- Gentlemen.
- l'm not gonna stand for a cover-up.

225
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,733
And neither am l, captain.

226
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:50,656
l shared our preliminary report, and
you'll have full access to our findings.

227
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:52,699
l'm gonna conduct
my own investigation.

228
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:55,217
- That is your prerogative.
- And l wanna interrogate McGee.

229
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:56,576
That's not gonna happen.

230
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,302
- l'll handle this, Special Agent Gibbs.
- McGee has made his statement.

231
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:02,613
- That's not going to change.
- Thank you for coming.

232
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,382
You'll have NClS's full cooperation.

233
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,740
- Do l get to question Agent McGee?
- Yes.

234
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,297
But not today.

235
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:22,739
Before you jump down my throat,
you think about what you would do

236
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,611
if that cop shot McGee
and McGee didn't have a weapon.

237
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,736
DiNozzo, look at this.
Got a possible.

238
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:33,614
Robert Gershon.

239
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,898
Thirty-two-year-old white male.
Lives in Alexandria.

240
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:38,895
Drives a 2003 dark blue
Ford Expedition.

241
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:42,452
First two digits
of license plates, 89.

242
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:46,211
McGee, was the SUV
as big as an Expedition?

243
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,536
Maybe. l don't know.
l'm not sure.

244
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,136
This guy belongs to a protest group
called CACA.

245
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,935
You're making that up.

246
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,535
''Citizens Against Criminal Abuse.''

247
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:58,170
He was arrested last May
for defacing the main entrance

248
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,856
of the Pentagon with horse manure.

249
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:03,297
Call me crazy, but a guy
that belongs to a group called CACA,

250
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,140
smears horse pucky
on a government building,

251
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,896
- isn't making death threats.
- DiNozzo, David.

252
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,576
Get back in that alley.
Find that damn bullet. Do it now.

253
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,380
Boss, we spent hours.
We covered every inch

254
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,294
of where McGee was standing
when he--

255
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,771
Well, maybe we'll find something
in daylight.

256
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,614
We're working the protester angle.

257
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,773
l don't think that cop being there
had anything

258
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,580
to do with the threat against that CNO.

259
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,655
Can somebody tell me
what the hell is going on here?

260
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:31,613
First, Abby's lab nerd frames DiNozzo
for murder and then McGee kills a cop.

261
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:34,455
Did somebody break a mirror?

262
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:35,896
Boss, can l go
with Tony and Ziva?

263
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,814
- An extra set of eyes might help.
- No.

264
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,973
Metro P.D. is out to get you.
You find the bullet,

265
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,541
it's compromised evidence.

266
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:43,021
Hey, DiNozzo.

267
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:46,094
While you're there, see if anyone
saw Benedict in the area last night.

268
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:47,854
Got it.

269
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,053
- What should l do?
- Find that SUV.

270
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:56,019
This is a waste of time.

271
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:58,742
Gibbs says search the alley again,
we search the alley again.

272
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,661
You never question anything
he tells you to do, huh?

273
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:03,653
- No.
- We can't find anything

274
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,540
because there's nothing to be found.

275
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:07,215
You don't believe McGee
was shot at?

276
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,260
Tony, McGee stumbled
across something,

277
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,253
misread it and overreacted.

278
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:15,539
Not McGee.
His brain's like a computer.

279
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:20,059
lt's scary. l'm sure procedures and
regs warp-sped through his processor

280
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,780
before he pulled the trigger.

281
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:24,615
lt happens so fast
you don't have time to think.

282
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,291
We're talking about a guy

283
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,454
who has protocols and checklists
for brushing and flossing.

284
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:35,539
l'll start flashing Benedict's
photo on the street.

285
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:49,330
Hey.

286
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:51,371
How are you doing?

287
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:54,174
Okay.

288
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:57,057
What's this music?

289
00:16:57,702 --> 00:16:59,340
l'm almost done here.

290
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:00,816
Tox screen?

291
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,654
Yeah, it's Benedict's.

292
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:05,212
Ducky said his liver
showed signs of cirrhosis,

293
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:08,180
but he was clean
and sober last night.

294
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,420
ls that why you called me
down here?

295
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:13,657
Nope. Come with me, McGee.

296
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:17,460
- Where are we going?
- Your therapy session.

297
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,260
What?

298
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,257
What is that smell?

299
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,535
Aromatherapy.

300
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:30,172
You're stressed. Anxious.

301
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,659
Thirty minutes in here,
and you'll be back to your old self.

302
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,616
Probably even better.
Now sit.

303
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,778
l don't believe
in New Age panaceas, Abby.

304
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:45,617
What are these things?

305
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,852
Frankincense, lavender,
and neroli oil.

306
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,577
What the hell's neroli oil?

307
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:57,056
''Used for the treatment of depression,
nervous tension, flatulence,

308
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,099
and irritable-bowel syndrome.''

309
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:02,140
Are you denying that more than one
of those apply to you?

310
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:03,821
You know what,
l think l'm gonna pass.

311
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,821
- Where did you get these?
- Never leave home without them.

312
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:13,381
Okay, Abby,
l have to get back to work.

313
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:16,852
And you will as soon
as you clear your mind.

314
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:20,094
You'll see things
from a new perspective.

315
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:22,537
Just relax,

316
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:26,457
enjoy and inhale.

317
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:58,621
- You still here?
- No, l'm the director's doppelganger.

318
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,733
l never did know what that meant.

319
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:21,416
- Good night.
- Good night.

320
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,411
So a doppelganger
is someone who's pissed?

321
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,771
Yes, Agent Gibbs.

322
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:27,176
- This one definitely is.
- Why?

323
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:30,015
Why? Because you countermanded
me in front of Metro Police.

324
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:31,900
l didn't countermand you.

325
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:34,132
- You overruled me.
- Oh, semantics.

326
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:39,775
- ls that like doppelganger?
- Get a dictionary.

327
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:03,496
Open up, McGee.

328
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:08,339
- Tony, l'm really not in the mood.
- Let me in.

329
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,015
Okay, you're in.
What do you want?

330
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:17,937
We're going out.

331
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:19,611
Where?

332
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,212
When the going gets tough,
the tough go clubbing.

333
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,781
We've got to get you dressed.

334
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,898
Tony, l really wanna
be alone tonight, okay?

335
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:28,691
No, you don't.

336
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:31,980
Still working on the novel,
l see, huh?

337
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:35,259
DiNozzo, l'm begging you.
Do not rag on me tonight, okay?

338
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,174
Well, l wouldn't be DiNozzo
if l didn't.

339
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:38,901
The wardrobe.

340
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:42,335
You got any party clothes, McGeek?

341
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,220
- Tony--
- Baby, you are not gonna be scoring

342
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:46,771
- in any of this stuff.
- Hey, would you stop?

343
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:47,977
l'm not going anywhere.

344
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,179
Hey, listen, man, l'm sorry.
l just wanted to--

345
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,014
No, l know. l know.

346
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,732
l know you're just trying to help.

347
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,897
Tony, l'm not like you guys.

348
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,811
You were trained as a cop.

349
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,856
Gibbs was a Marine sniper.

350
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:21,938
Kate protected
the president of the United States.

351
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:25,615
God only knows
what Ziva did with Mossad.

352
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:31,498
My background is biomedical
engineering and computer forensics.

353
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,496
l don't think l'm cut out
to be a field agent.

354
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:46,171
The first time l shot at someone...

355
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:50,735
...l wet my pants.

356
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,494
Really?

357
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:54,851
Really.

358
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:00,732
lf you tell anyone that,
l will slap you silly.

359
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,535
You got anything to eat?

360
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,331
l know it's bad.

361
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,214
l've been where you are.
But a week from now,

362
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:13,091
this will all be behind you.
Just a bad memory.

363
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,581
What time did you get up, Ziva?

364
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:36,934
Zero four hundred.

365
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:40,339
Background check on the cop McGee
killed didn't come up with anything.

366
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,732
He drank a little too much,
had three ex-wives...

367
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,575
Yeah, well, that does not make him
a bad person.

368
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,221
His police service record is clean.

369
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,936
Several commendations
for meritorious service

370
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,172
and a mayoral award.

371
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:53,411
Nothing negative.

372
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,574
Metro's gonna make it look like
our probie killed their hero.

373
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,413
They're going to interrogate McGee
this afternoon.

374
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:04,811
Request was approved
by the director.

375
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,331
And you know this how?

376
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:11,497
l'm a spy, remember?

377
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:15,610
When were you gonna tell me?

378
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,773
l see we're picking up
where we left off yesterday.

379
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,137
lf you're sending McGee to Metro,
you're damn right we are.

380
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:22,497
Didn't know l had to ask
your permission.

381
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,815
Don't give me the stare.

382
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:27,212
- l'm not a junior agent.
- No, you're a junior director.

383
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:29,737
That's enough, Special Agent Gibbs.

384
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:32,416
<i>Excuse me, director.</i>
<i>They're waiting for you in MTAC.</i>

385
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:34,335
l'm on my way, Cynthia.

386
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:36,174
You have to learn how to say no.

387
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,333
l did, Jethro.

388
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,018
Or have you forgotten?

389
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:53,894
McGee, what are you
doing here so early?

390
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,374
l had an epiphany.
A different way of tracking the SUV.

391
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,775
So the aromatherapy worked.

392
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:02,376
lt cleared your mind so you could
come up with new ideas.

393
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,136
- l don't know about that.
- l do.

394
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:07,980
Did you get any sleep last night?

395
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:10,178
Not much.
DiNozzo kept me up till 3.

396
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:11,291
Our DiNozzo?

397
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:13,896
He came by my apartment
to cheer me up.

398
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:15,654
- Really?
- Yeah, l know.

399
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,495
DiNozzo being nice to me
means l'm really in trouble.

400
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:22,573
l think it's sweet.
So, what was your light bulb?

401
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:25,540
Well, are you familiar with
the Ajzen-Fishbein Theory

402
00:24:25,702 --> 00:24:27,932
- of reasoned action?
- Of course.

403
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:31,418
lf Lieutenant Benedict was having
an argument with the man in the SUV,

404
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:35,012
the theory hypothesizes there's a high
probability they had prior contact.

405
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:39,779
So you're matching SUV owners
to people Benedict knew?

406
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:42,496
- Exactly.
- Using what as a database?

407
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:47,292
l wrote this program to cross-check
registered owners with telephone calls

408
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:50,613
and e-mails sent and received
by Benedict over the last three months.

409
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,252
Timothy, that's brilliant.

410
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:56,572
l thought so,
but l didn't get any hits.

411
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,381
Problem is l only got
his home and cell numbers.

412
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,692
l was denied access
to Benedict's extension at Metro.

413
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,255
lf you had the maintenance codes

414
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,617
for the telephone servers
at the police department,

415
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:06,971
do you think that would help?

416
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:09,101
Yes.

417
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,537
While you're getting me
a Caf-Pow! , l'll make a phone call.

418
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:16,977
ls there any way of finding out
why she wants to talk to me?

419
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,610
<i>Not without asking her.</i>
<i>Are you a personal friend of hers?</i>

420
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,534
- l was a donor.
- <i>l'm sorry. l can't hear you.</i>

421
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,052
- l'm a donor.
- <i>Oh, a donor, right.</i>

422
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,338
- <i>What was your last name again?</i>
- DiNozzo.

423
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:29,699
- Could you spell that for me, please?
- Big D, little l, big N, little ozzo.

424
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,136
- <i>And your first name?</i>
- Anthony.

425
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:33,862
<i>Would you please hold a moment,</i>
<i>Mr. DiNozzo?</i>

426
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,657
Playing phone-tag
with the sperm bank.

427
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,018
You haven't found out
what it's about yet?

428
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:43,855
Well...

429
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:48,414
They're probably running low
on their favorite fossil fuel,

430
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:49,850
''Essence of DiNozzo.''

431
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:53,694
- <i>Hello, sir?</i>
- Yeah, l'm here.

432
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,614
<i>She's in a meeting at the moment.</i>
<i>Out of the office.</i>

433
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:57,500
- When will she be back?
- <i>Not till tomorrow.</i>

434
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,380
- Thank you.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

435
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:01,096
Problem?

436
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:06,100
The woman who's been trying
to contact me isn't there.

437
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,093
Her title is director of critical issues.

438
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:10,777
What do you think that means?

439
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:14,651
l don't know, but it sounds serious.

440
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,540
Yeah.

441
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,934
lt could be one of my offspring
has a medical condition.

442
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:23,821
Maybe they need
an organ transplant.

443
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,292
You-- You, who won't share
a Krispy Kreme doughnut.

444
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:33,453
You are going to give up a kidney?

445
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:41,691
You wouldn't understand.
You're not a parent.

446
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:53,901
That's so cute.

447
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:55,620
l didn't know you were superstitious.

448
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:57,617
l'm not.

449
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,171
We've got a hit.

450
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:05,571
Edward Francis Halligan.
Owns a black 2005 Range Rover.

451
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:07,812
License plate 8967YZE.

452
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:10,815
He received a call from Benedict's
Metro office extension two weeks ago.

453
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:12,421
You wanna know how McGee
figured it out?

454
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:14,061
- No.
- Halligan's an lrish national.

455
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,258
He's been living here
for the past three years.

456
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:18,015
l'll run him by my lnterpol contacts.

457
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,339
- Find him, Tony, bring him in here.
- On it.

458
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,141
So...
Are you gonna bust them, Archer?

459
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:29,054
Blow my cover.
Why don't you?

460
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:31,099
They don't look Navy.

461
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:32,571
Who are you staking out?

462
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:34,858
A second-tier pusher
released from Elkton this morning.

463
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,775
Right now he's in that hotel
reacquainting himself with his old lady.

464
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:40,661
Historically, the pusher's second stop
is to look for employment,

465
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:42,733
so l'm hoping he'll lead me
to a local distributor.

466
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:44,660
l'm surprised you agreed to meet.

467
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,221
Just wanna find out the truth.

468
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:49,260
l'd appreciate it if Captain Karzin
didn't find out we were talking.

469
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,339
He's not going to hear
anything from me.

470
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,091
Do you know this guy?

471
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:57,213
Never met him, but l'd love
to get my hands on him.

472
00:27:57,382 --> 00:27:58,417
lt's Ed Halligan.

473
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:01,380
He's a rich lrishman rumored to be
the money behind a local crack ring.

474
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,657
He drives a black SUV.

475
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,978
He collects expensive cars.
He has dozens of them.

476
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,814
Why'd Benedict call him
two weeks ago?

477
00:28:06,982 --> 00:28:08,779
We set a trap for Halligan,
but he never showed.

478
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,336
Bennie suspected he was tipped.

479
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,015
Wait, what are you
getting at, Gibbs?

480
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:17,859
We think that Halligan was the guy
your partner was talking to in the alley.

481
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:21,691
- lf he was, he had a legitimate reason.
- Wouldn't he have told you?

482
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:22,971
Look, l'm...

483
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,459
l was the junior partner on the team.

484
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,341
We hadn't been together that long,
so he didn't share everything with me.

485
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,298
lf you think that he was
a dirty cop, forget it.

486
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:32,895
Bennie was as straight up
as they come.

487
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:35,132
You just said
you hadn't been together very long.

488
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,862
How long does it take
to know if your partner's dirty?

489
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:45,972
- ls that your dirt bag?
- Yeah, l gotta get to work.

490
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,181
Okay.

491
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,577
Anxious?

492
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:02,381
Does it show?

493
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,419
May l give you some advice?

494
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:05,571
Please.

495
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:08,131
Be confident when Metro
interrogates you.

496
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:10,975
lf you don't believe what you're saying,
how can they?

497
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:13,134
Every time l think about it,

498
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:15,215
it comes out a little different.

499
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:18,976
For God's sakes,
don't tell that to Metro.

500
00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:20,734
Where's the boss?

501
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:24,617
- Where's Halligan?
- Not at home. l went to his house.

502
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:28,099
lt's really more like an estate.
lt's all marble and stone.

503
00:29:28,262 --> 00:29:31,174
Monolithic thing
with Greco-Roman statues.

504
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:32,661
lmpressionist art and flowers
everywhere.

505
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,973
ln the front hall, there were these two
flowers like swans that were kissing.

506
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,019
What about the Range Rover?

507
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:41,379
Oh, that wasn't in the garage,
but the thing was loaded.

508
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,898
Lamborghinis, Ferraris,
1 965 Aston Martin, the <i>Goldfinger</i>--

509
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:46,734
Tony.

510
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:48,815
Sorry.

511
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:50,211
Sorry.

512
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:52,577
Reminded me of when l was a kid
in the Hamptons.

513
00:29:53,102 --> 00:29:54,660
So you have no idea where he went?

514
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:57,861
Well, he told Shamus,
that's his houseboy,

515
00:29:58,022 --> 00:29:59,296
he was going away for a few days.

516
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:01,578
l'm telling you, if l had
a master bedroom like that,

517
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:02,777
mirrors on the ceiling...

518
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:05,775
My contact at lnterpol said Halligan's
been under investigation

519
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,978
in lreland, Britain and France.

520
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:12,332
Several indictments.
All drug related, but none ever--

521
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:18,936
- Whatever that is doesn't sound good.
- Halligan's on the goat.

522
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:20,171
Oh, no. Not goat.

523
00:30:21,462 --> 00:30:22,815
Sheep?

524
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,138
- Lam?
- That's it.

525
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,981
He's on the lam.
There's no B in that, by the way.

526
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:29,814
Thank you.

527
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:32,212
He bought a ticket
at Dulles yesterday afternoon.

528
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:35,180
- To lreland?
- Rabat, Morocco via Lisbon.

529
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,260
No extradition.

530
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:40,976
Benedict was arresting him.

531
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,692
l killed a cop arresting a drug lord.

532
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:51,615
His goose is cooked.

533
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,693
You would get that one right.

534
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:17,179
Bennie didn't point
a weapon at you...

535
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,341
...did he?

536
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:33,220
No.

537
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:43,576
- ls the director in?
- Expecting you.

538
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,131
Close the door, please.

539
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:49,532
No, you don't want
that door closed, director.

540
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,738
- l don't?
- No.

541
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:58,617
- Let her rip.
- The U.S. Attorney's office

542
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,579
is charging McGee
with negligent homicide.

543
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:03,176
Metro is booking him right now.
Do you know why?

544
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:05,014
Because he admitted
to making a tragic mistake.

545
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:08,180
No, because you may know
how to kiss ass,

546
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,060
but you sure don't know
how to protect it.

547
00:32:10,222 --> 00:32:12,611
And you think you're protecting
that boy by ignoring the facts?

548
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:15,057
He's not a boy.
He's an NClS special agent.

549
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:17,690
He's one of my people.
l don't leave my people behind.

550
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:20,330
- lt's a Marine thing.
- What are you going to do?

551
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,698
l'm gonna go to Metro
and get him.

552
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,779
- No.
- No?

553
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:28,099
Your eyesight's weak,
not your hearing.

554
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:37,459
You're not going to Metro
because McGee's on his way here.

555
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:40,779
l convinced Captain Karzin
that he wasn't a flight risk

556
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:45,060
and to release him into our custody
until his arraignment hearing.

557
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,541
- You should have gone with him.
- Why me? He's your bud.

558
00:32:56,702 --> 00:33:00,297
- Bud?
- Bud. Buddy. Friend.

559
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:03,016
You're not McGee's friend?

560
00:33:03,502 --> 00:33:05,299
Of course l'm his friend.

561
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:08,653
English is
a very confusing language.

562
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,096
lf you're his--

563
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:16,857
- There's that word again.
- lnterpol missed Halligan in Portugal.

564
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:19,934
He cleared Mora Customs
an hour ago.

565
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:28,495
l let you down.

566
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:32,532
- l think it's the other way around.
- l should have gone with you to Metro.

567
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:36,697
l don't think
it would have made a difference.

568
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:39,896
l panicked.

569
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:42,736
l thought he had a weapon in his hand.
l need to face it.

570
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,900
l shot a good cop making an arrest.

571
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:47,860
What cop makes a drug bust
without a weapon?

572
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:49,971
None.

573
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:51,860
Rule number eight is gonna
save you, McGee.

574
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:53,776
Never date a coworker?

575
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,461
Never go anywhere
without your knife.

576
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:58,090
- l thought that was nine.
- Never take anything for granted.

577
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:00,059
<i>Correcto, jefe,</i>
but you did make up the rules--

578
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,611
- Get to the point, Abs.
- l didn't do forensics on the jacket

579
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:04,215
because we knew what happened.

580
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:06,936
Then l remembered
rule <i>numero ocho.</i>

581
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:08,455
Gunshot residue.

582
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,620
Based on the density and the pattern
of the stippling and the sooting,

583
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:17,140
one of the slugs in Lieutenant Benedict
was fired from only one foot away.

584
00:34:17,582 --> 00:34:20,460
- One of my shots missed?
- l knew you weren't that good, probie.

585
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,817
Three for three at 25 meters?
l don't think so.

586
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:24,461
Halligan shot him
from behind the wheel.

587
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:25,850
Wrong, boss.

588
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,740
Slap him, Ziva.

589
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:33,417
lf Halligan was behind the wheel,
then he was five or six feet away.

590
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,413
l pulled the registration
from the Range Rover.

591
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:38,012
lt was brought in the DMV
for an inspection

592
00:34:38,182 --> 00:34:40,696
because it was imported
from lreland.

593
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:44,135
Right-hand drive.

594
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:47,100
British, like Ducky's Morgan. Steering
wheel's on the right-hand side.

595
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,492
The person l saw arguing
with Benedict was a passenger.

596
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,493
- There was a third man.
- That's a great movie.

597
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,256
- Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles.
- We're looking in the wrong direction.

598
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:56,333
lf McGee's third round
didn't hit the SUV,

599
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:59,858
then it's somewhere at the other end
of that alley. Go. Abby, thank you.

600
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:04,134
Boss, he still didn't fire at me.

601
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,452
You saw a flash, McGee.
You heard a gunshot.

602
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,501
You had no way of knowing
if Benedict was firing at you or not.

603
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:13,175
lf l was in your position, McGee,
l'd have fired.

604
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:15,101
Go on.

605
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,498
Run Halligan's phone records.
See if you can't figure out

606
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,381
- who he was meeting with.
- Right.

607
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:24,541
Could be your two rounds
weren't the fatal one.

608
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:35,372
lf you ever Gibbs-slap me again, David,
and l will slap you back harder.

609
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,340
- l was following orders.
- The dutiful Mossad agent.

610
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,578
You miss the spy game?
Must have been exciting.

611
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:44,977
You've seen too many
James Bond movies.

612
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:49,021
- lt's not all about car chases and sex.
- lt wasn't?

613
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:52,575
Well, there was a lot of sex.

614
00:35:58,462 --> 00:36:00,930
Six-one-four. Ohio.

615
00:36:01,462 --> 00:36:02,781
Sperm bank.

616
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:04,540
Yeah, this is Anthony DiNozzo.

617
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,420
<i>There's something l need</i>
<i>to talk to you about.</i>

618
00:36:06,822 --> 00:36:08,494
- Yeah?
- <i>Your sperm is being discharged.</i>

619
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:11,291
Yeah, l know. There's gotta be
some kind of mistake because--

620
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:14,420
- Yeah, that's me. But, l mean--
- <i>Were you hoping for birth notification?</i>

621
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:15,611
No.

622
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,374
- <i>Well, have a nice day.</i>
- Thank you.

623
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,260
<i>You're welcome.</i>

624
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,414
Do you want to discuss it?

625
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:22,971
lt's nothing.

626
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,531
For two days, you've obsessed
on that letter, driving me crazy.

627
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:28,136
- Now, all of a sudden, it's nothing?
- Drop it.

628
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:31,300
l understand.
l'd be embarrassed too.

629
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:36,492
l shouldn't have done it, but your
phone kept on ringing this morning,

630
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:40,052
and l knew this call was important,
so l answered it.

631
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,217
You talked--?

632
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,340
To the woman at the sperm bank,
the director of critical issues.

633
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,770
Yes.

634
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:50,977
l'm sorry, Tony.

635
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:57,099
She had no right to tell you
that no one wants my sperm.

636
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:59,495
Yes.

637
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:06,332
- You didn't talk to her.
- So no little DiNozzos anywhere.

638
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:09,142
lt's hard to believe that a stud like you
would not be chosen.

639
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:13,381
Were any of the prospective women
shown a photo of you? Because...

640
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,621
You're enjoying this a lot,
aren't you?

641
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,137
Oh, yes.

642
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:28,258
- Are they going to return your sperm?
- Let's focus on finding the bullet.

643
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,941
Don't have to.

644
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:39,978
The striations in the bullets
are exact.

645
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:41,973
lt was definitely fired
from McGee's SlG.

646
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:45,020
- Where did you two find the bullet?
- Miss Abby Sciuto.

647
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,131
Right here, boss.

648
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:51,897
Behind the body,
embedded in the door frame.

649
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,257
McGee was wide to the left.

650
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:56,413
Where the hell
is Benedict's weapon?

651
00:37:58,702 --> 00:38:00,738
- Yeah?
- l have a theory.

652
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:02,460
Okay.

653
00:38:02,662 --> 00:38:05,699
McGee identified himself.

654
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:08,740
The man in the car fires point blank
at Benedict.

655
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:11,336
Now, like you said,
it was too close and it was dark.

656
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:14,056
So McGee couldn't distinguish
where the flash came from,

657
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,460
and McGee fires back.

658
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,175
One missed.

659
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:20,821
And when Benedict fell,

660
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,931
he dropped his weapon through
the open window of the Range Rover.

661
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,532
- What do you think?
- What's going on?

662
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:30,011
- We're saving your butt.
- Hey, come on. What do you got?

663
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,934
lt's a dump of Halligan's
phone records.

664
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,821
The morning of the shooting, he
placed several calls to Archer's home

665
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,779
- and cell phones.
- You mean Benedict's?

666
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:38,171
No, Archer, his partner.

667
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:40,936
The call from Metro two weeks ago
came from Archer, not Benedict.

668
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:42,780
Partners share extensions
at the precinct.

669
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:46,014
l showed Archer a picture of Halligan.
He acted like they'd never met.

670
00:38:46,182 --> 00:38:47,900
Well, one of the phone calls
lasted 1 8 minutes.

671
00:38:49,782 --> 00:38:52,057
Come on, McGee.
You're with me.

672
00:38:53,702 --> 00:38:54,896
McGee, come here.

673
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,492
Use my backup.

674
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:04,819
Archer's gotta know
that Halligan's in Morocco.

675
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:07,337
- He's never gonna talk.
- ls Halligan in Morocco?

676
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:08,981
Ziva said he passed through Customs.

677
00:39:09,142 --> 00:39:12,373
Well, maybe Archer doesn't know that.
Pull an old warrant.

678
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:28,690
What's up?

679
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,011
Got a few questions.

680
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:33,212
- He's supposed to be in custody.
- He's in my custody.

681
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:35,134
You never told me
you spoke with Halligan.

682
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,775
- Never did.
- Phone records show

683
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,012
you exchanged several calls.

684
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:41,213
You know what, l don't care
what your phone records say.

685
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,657
l never talked to Halligan.
You can ask him.

686
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:46,814
One of the calls was two weeks ago,
the time you claim you set the trap.

687
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:49,371
l don't need this from the guy
who killed my partner.

688
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,659
McGee shot him after someone
inside the car fired first.

689
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,137
Your partner suspected
you were working with Halligan.

690
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,572
He followed you to a meet in the alley.

691
00:39:58,382 --> 00:39:59,895
You guys aren't laying this off on me.

692
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,656
We pulled a nine-millimetre slug
out of Benedict's chest.

693
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:04,938
l wanna run that
against your service weapon.

694
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:08,771
We're gonna search the premises.

695
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:10,495
l'm not talking
to Navy-wannabe cops.

696
00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:13,130
lnterpol picked Halligan up
in Lisbon.

697
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:14,894
He never made it to Morocco.

698
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,252
We'll get him back here
and he'll talk.

699
00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:19,897
Halligan's not gonna take the fall
for you.

700
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:39,461
Don't ever hesitate because you
second-guessed yourself again.

701
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:40,975
l'll take your badge.

702
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:43,337
- Are we clear?
- Clear.

703
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:01,498
l thought you would be out celebrating.

704
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:04,657
No.

705
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:11,339
Did you come down for a hug?

706
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:15,136
What'd you find out?

707
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:20,101
l ran every test l could think of.

708
00:41:20,702 --> 00:41:22,738
The slugs are too damaged.

709
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,536
There's no way to tell
who fired the kill shot.

710
00:41:29,382 --> 00:41:31,691
Does it really matter?

711
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:34,494
Yeah.

712
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:38,020
lt matters.
