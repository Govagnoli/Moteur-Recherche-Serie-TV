1
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,060
Mr. Palmer.

2
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,900
Mr. Palmer.

3
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,620
Yes, Doctor.

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,460
As a serious and dedicated
student of anatomy...

5
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,540
you are a serious and dedicated
student of anatomy, are you not?

6
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,660
Well, then, Mr. Palmer,
are you up to the task

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,180
of identifying the
reconstructive blunder

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,540
that has been foisted upon our deceased?

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,740
Would you call that a thumb?

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,180
I would call that a toe.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,300
Why then, perchance, did you place it

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,020
with the other digits
from his right hand?

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,180
Because that's where it belongs.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,860
If you look at the scar
line, it matches perfectly.

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,060
Plus, his right foot had a
cleanly-amputated big toe.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,460
This guy lost his thumb
in an accident or something

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,820
and had a surgery to
replace it with the big toe.

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,220
My God.

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,820
I think I know who this is.

20
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,780
Mm, I love Filomena's ice cream.

21
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,620
Filomena's in Georgetown?

22
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,420
My standard first date place.

23
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,700
I went there on a first
date Saturday night.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,340
Yeah? After dinner, I like
to stroll the lucky lady

25
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,140
down Wisconsin to this pretentious
art gallery called Impressions.

26
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,940
Boy, they really eat it up.

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,180
That's where we went after dinner.

28
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,380
Really?

29
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:36,180
You've been following me.

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,060
Me follow you on a Saturday night?

31
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,700
Not that desperate, Kate.

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,060
I don't believe you.

33
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,660
Well, on my mother's life
I was not following you.

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,620
Your mother's dead.

35
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
I didn't follow her, boss.

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,020
I do know her boyfriend, Steve Adler.

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,660
He's not my boyfriend!

38
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,140
I don't believe this.

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
You tell her about your
fraternity brother yet?

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,940
I was just getting to the
good part there, McGee.

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,340
Steve Adler is your fraternity brother?!

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,100
I'd show you the secret handshake,

43
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,340
but then I'd have to kill you.

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,180
He told you about our date?!

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,180
Well, not the intimate details.

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Until I asked him.

47
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,100
Then he had to.

48
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,260
Goes with the oath.

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,180
Gibbs!

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,180
DiNozzo!

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,940
Jethro, I need you in Autopsy.

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,660
What he had was a great
toe transplantation,

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,820
an incredibly arduous
surgical procedure.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,020
Nerves smaller than a human hair

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,740
are connected using microscopic sutures.

56
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,300
They sewed his toe to his hand.

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,500
Exactly.

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,300
In a catastrophic injury
when the thumb is lost,

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,340
the patient's hallux,
or big toe, is removed

60
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,820
and attached to the hand.

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,460
The opposable thumb is one of the most
important milestones in human evolution.

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,980
It's what makes us us.

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,420
Our ability to make
tools, a defining element

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,020
which separates us from animals,
comes directly from this dexterity.

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,060
Drawn-out digressions is a
privilege earned, Mr. Palmer.

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,580
Sorry, Doctor.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,980
If I'm right, the victim's
name is Michael Grant.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,180
He was a Baltimore District Attorney.

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,940
Ten years ago I testified at
several cases he was prosecuting.

70
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,860
What about the other bodies, Duck?

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,220
Well, at this point I still
have no idea who they are.

72
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,140
We need positive IDs, Duck.

73
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,980
The flesh was peeled off
the pads of the fingers.

74
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,460
That rules out fingerprints.

75
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,100
The flesh and skin of the
face have also been removed.

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,380
So photographic identification
won't be possible, either.

77
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,060
Dental?

78
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,660
Unless we can find a piece
of Michael Grant's DNA,

79
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,540
the dental records will have to do.

80
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,540
Do it.

81
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,820
Jethro.

82
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,980
A barrel is left at
Bethesda in my jurisdiction

83
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,460
containing three dissected
bodies, one of whom I knew.

84
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,460
This isn't a coincidence.

85
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,620
Is it?

86
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,300
No, I didn't think it was.

87
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
Possible ID on one of
the Meat Puzzle bodies.

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,820
DA named Michael Grant.

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,180
Hey, cool, after six months,
we finally got a lead, huh?

90
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
Find out if he's been reported missing.

91
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,140
Kate, pull the cases
that Ducky testified

92
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,660
where Michael Grant
was the lead attorney.

93
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,980
On it.

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,020
Hey, it looks like
we're going to work late.

95
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,500
So do you want me to call Steven
and cancel your dinner reservation?

96
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,380
This is a nightmare.

97
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,860
If you have a thought about
continuing your genetic line,

98
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,620
I would suggest a change of position.

99
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,980
Jaws expand and contract, Mr. Palmer.

100
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:57,300
Teeth wear, but fillings,
crowns, and bridges remain.

101
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,020
Now let's see.

102
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,340
Four fillings on the
lower left bicuspids...

103
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,660
crowns on the upper left molars.

104
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,900
It's him.

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,860
Yes, it's he.

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,620
Dr. Mallard, on a more personal note...

107
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,620
It's not the best time, Mr. Palmer.

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,060
I just want you to know that I
am determined to learn from you.

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,460
Your point, quickly.

110
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,180
It's important for me
to know that you know

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,940
that even though there
are nearly 2,000 pieces

112
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,900
of tissue on these
tables, that I... I...

113
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,740
Please come to the point, Jimmy!

114
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420
I know the differee
between a thumb and a toe.

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,900
He called me Jimmy.

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,020
Michael Grant disappeared eight months
ago hiking the Appalachian Trail.

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
His body was never found.

118
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,500
Local LEOs could never determine
if he got lost or killed.

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,460
Definitely killed.

120
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,660
The poor fellow was then
dissected into small pieces,

121
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,380
put in a barrel of alcohol
along with two other bodies

122
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,820
and deposited in a dumpster
behind Bethesda Naval Hospital.

123
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,140
The dental records matched?

124
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm afraid so, Jethro.

125
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,460
Ducky?

126
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,220
Remember a Judge Roland Davis?

127
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,020
Of course.

128
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,020
A man of small stature and enormous ego.

129
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,300
A highly competent jurist, nonetheless.

130
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,460
He was the judge on one of two cases

131
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,780
you testified, where Michael
Grant was the lead attorney.

132
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,820
The significance of that, Caitlin?

133
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,180
He was reported missing
seven months ago.

134
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,460
I'll run a dental comparison, the
judge with the two other bodies.

135
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,580
Pull up the case, Kate.

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,420
Ah, yes, of course.

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,540
Who could forget him?

138
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,380
Vincent Hanlan.

139
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,620
A medical school washout.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,740
He was studying to become a...

141
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,820
medical examiner.

142
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,740
He was accused of raping and
murdering a Navy Lieutenant

143
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,500
who worked at Bethesda
Hospital's pathology lab.

144
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,380
I performed the autopsy.

145
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,260
She was a beautiful girl.

146
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,580
I believe her name was
Lieutenant Sylvia...

147
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
Sylvia Waksal.

148
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,460
Yes, that's right.

149
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,580
She was working late one night.

150
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,980
Vincent Hanlan stalked her with
the intention of raping her.

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,020
The speculation was that he
was unable to perform the rape.

152
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,140
His impotence so enraged
him that he proceeded

153
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,660
to beat the poor girl to death.

154
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,300
When it went to trial, Michael
Grant was the prosecuting attorney.

155
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,380
Judge Davis presided.

156
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,660
And I testified.

157
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,420
The evidence was all circumstantial.

158
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,060
So when the judge offered the jury

159
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
second degree murder, they accepted it.

160
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,700
Vincent Hanlan served eight years

161
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,620
in the Maryland Correctional
Adjustment Center.

162
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,740
Kate, start building a
profile on Vincent Hanlan.

163
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,060
Tony.

164
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,620
Find the whereabouts of everybody else

165
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,860
associated with prosecuting
Vincent Hanlan, fast?

166
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,220
McGee, I need the last
address for Vincent Hanlan.

167
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,980
I want to bring him in.

168
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,340
McGee!

169
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,820
Sorry, boss, I already found him...

170
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,420
Give me the address.

171
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,900
It's 22 Victor Road,
Mount Ephraim Cemetery.

172
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,460
He's been dead over a year.

173
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,020
Crown, crown, match, match,
filling, filling... match.

174
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,020
As we feared...

175
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,260
The second corpse is Judge Roland Davis.

176
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,660
Any guesses on number three here?

177
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,700
Carl Foss.

178
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,940
The jury foreman.

179
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,820
Of course.

180
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Missing since last summer.

181
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,620
His X-rays are on their way
over from his family dentist.

182
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,220
Are you okay, Duck?

183
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,740
I assume this macabre play is
being put on for my benefit.

184
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,340
My testimony was key in putti
Vincent Hanlan in prison.

185
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,860
I was able to lift a partial
print of Vincent's off a body.

186
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,860
Thinking back, I think I was slightly

187
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,260
unnerved by Hanlan during the trial.

188
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,300
How so?

189
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,980
He just seemed particularly
agitated when I was on the stand.

190
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,900
You were the medical examiner
he was never going to be.

191
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,460
I was using his failure against him.

192
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,940
You'll stay at NCIS as much as possible.

193
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
Other than that, one of us
will be with you at all times.

194
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,620
Jethro, my mother is 96 years old.

195
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,100
She suffers from dementia.

196
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,900
She gets very nervous when
I'm not home in the evenings.

197
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
Tony, you'll take the first shift.

198
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,420
With his mother.

199
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,500
Uh, doing what, boss?

200
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,980
Whatever she wants.

201
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,940
Yes, it would be helpful if
you could assist with the dogs.

202
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,220
Oh, gosh, I'm not really
an animal person, Ducky.

203
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,980
I just haven't spent a lot
of time with them lately.

204
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,500
The yappy creatures are all she has
in this life except me, of course.

205
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,580
If Vincent Hanlan's dead,
who is getting revenge?

206
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,820
His family?

207
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,060
Find 'em, Kate.

208
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,060
According to their tax returns, Vincent
Hanlan's parents are both morticians.

209
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,420
They've run a funeral
home for the last 13 years.

210
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,620
Siblings.

211
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,900
One brother who's a taxidermist.

212
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,980
Mortician, taxidermist,
wannabe medical examiner.

213
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,500
Yeah, the death obsession
pretty much runs in the family.

214
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,260
Vincent's conviction
tore the family apart.

215
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,220
His death pretty much put us under.

216
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,620
Through here.

217
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,740
Mary...

218
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,500
Get these people out of here.

219
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,580
They're Federal Agents.

220
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,060
I don't care.

221
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,220
They're here about Vincent.

222
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,260
They're not authorized.

223
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,860
Get out!

224
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
Individuals connected
with Vincent's prosecution

225
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,100
have been found murdered.

226
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,900
Good.

227
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,060
Good?

228
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,540
Vincent was innocent.

229
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,460
He was a good boy.

230
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,820
He was in medical school.

231
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,380
Jack the Ripper went to medical school.

232
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,020
When my son got out of
prison, he had nothing left.

233
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,820
No hope. No promise.

234
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
They labeled him a sex-murderer.

235
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,340
What was he doing when
he got out of prison?

236
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,420
He was drinking.

237
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,220
A lot.

238
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,660
Oh, that's all you have
to say about your dead son?

239
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,020
That's isn't what I meant.

240
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,060
I was just trying to explain
how difficult his life was.

241
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,340
What happened on the night he died?

242
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
He was driving with his
brother and they hit a tree.

243
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,380
Can you think of anyone who
would want to get revenge

244
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
on the men who put your son in jail?

245
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:43,980
Me.

246
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,100
But I don't know anything about it.

247
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,500
So why don't you just
get the hell out of here

248
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,020
before I call the authorities
and have you arrested

249
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,580
and maybe you'll go to prison.

250
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Bastards.

251
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,060
Two bridges, ten
crowns, seven fillings...

252
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,700
Not exactly a paragon of
oral hygiene, my dear fellow.

253
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,740
Is it Carl Foss?

254
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,380
Was there ever any doubt?

255
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,420
Well, that's all three:

256
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,460
prosecutor, judge and
now foreman of the jury.

257
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,740
Are you scared, Dr. Mallard?

258
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,260
Madame Curie, one of the
world's most brilliant thinkers,

259
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,020
once said, "There is
nothing in life to be feared.

260
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,860
It is only to be understood."

261
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,340
I think it's safe to
say that Madame Curie

262
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,060
never set her eyes on a meat puzzle.

263
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,740
Yes, I'm scared.

264
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,380
Scared as hell.

265
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,380
Put them away, Jimmy.

266
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,180
They're tired of talking.

267
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,100
They need to rest.

268
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,940
Yes, Doctor.

269
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,260
Yes?

270
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,980
I'm Anthony DiNozzo, Mrs. Mallard.

271
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,900
I work with your son.

272
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,620
He called, said I'd be coming over?

273
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
You're Italian.

274
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,740
Yes, I am.

275
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,140
You're a gigolo.

276
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,980
Uh, well, I wouldn't exactly...

277
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,580
You move furniture.

278
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,620
I could.

279
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,460
I have a commode that has
no business being here.

280
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,460
It belongs in the lounge.

281
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,820
I've told Donald this.

282
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,460
He never listens.

283
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,820
I understand. Okay.

284
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,980
If you'll just show me where you want...

285
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,620
Who are you?

286
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,460
Anthony DiNozzo.

287
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,500
Everyone calls me Tony.

288
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,820
That's an Italian name.

289
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,140
Yes, it is.

290
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
So if you just show me where...

291
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,740
You're a gigolo.

292
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,060
If you look down my blouse,
I shall disembowel you.

293
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,460
That's funny.

294
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,300
I have a knife in my brassiere.

295
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll keep that in mind.

296
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,420
Good.

297
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,380
Who are you again?

298
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,700
Couldn't there be another case
where these men worked together?

299
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,660
I haven't found one.

300
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,580
u're brother's case is the common link.

301
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,180
I would love to have stuffed Vincent.

302
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,620
He would've liked that.

303
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,740
Had a good sense of humor, Vincent did.

304
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
But...

305
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,580
it's against state law.

306
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,620
"Best Mammal" at the
regionals last year.

307
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,620
Like anything else, you get obsessed.

308
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,380
Becomes a way of life.

309
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,220
I thought pandas were endangered?

310
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,220
Oh, they are.

311
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,620
"Re-creation Category."

312
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,540
I took two black bears
and I bleached one,

313
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,660
and then I sewed them
together in a panda pattern.

314
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,500
You miss your brother?

315
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,940
He's my brother.

316
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,700
You two get along?

317
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,540
When he got out of
prison, he was depressed.

318
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,460
He couldn't go back to school.

319
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,740
He couldn't get a job.

320
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,180
He started drinking heavily.

321
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,420
You didn't answer my question.

322
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,060
We were close.

323
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,580
And I have no idea who killed
the men that put him in jail.

324
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,500
What happened the night he died?

325
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,020
Vincent was driving.

326
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,780
He lost control.

327
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,980
We went off the road into the woods.

328
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,580
My head hit the dash, hard.

329
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,380
I stumbled out of the
car fell to my knees.

330
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,260
When I got my bearings,
I saw the car was on fire.

331
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
You feel guilty you didn't pull him out?

332
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
I was told he died
instantly from the impact.

333
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,740
That he never felt the flames.

334
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,020
I think he felt the flames.

335
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,180
Second place, nationals,
small animal division.

336
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,620
African civet.

337
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,420
Yeah, Gibbs.

338
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,300
Boss, I've been running
down other people

339
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,620
involved in the Vincent Hanlan case.

340
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,740
Got something good.

341
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,220
Spit it out, McGee.

342
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,980
The lead detective in the Hanlan case

343
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,460
was a Baltimore officer
named Marco Cesaretti.

344
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,540
Retired in '96 missed
his last rent payment,

345
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,020
nobody's seen him in three weeks.

346
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,540
Where do you need this?

347
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,060
Mrs. Mallard?

348
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,380
Mrs. Mallard!

349
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,580
Who are you?!

350
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,260
And where are you going with my commode?

351
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm your son's coworker, remember?

352
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,260
Tony DiNozzo?

353
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,580
The Italian gigolo furniture mover?

354
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,260
No!

355
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm a Federal Agent, ma'am.

356
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,300
That's what they all say.

357
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,980
Will you please go stand over there?

358
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,540
Now.

359
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,660
And keep the girls and
boys in the other room.

360
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,580
Stay.

361
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:36,940
Quiet down.

362
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,580
What is it?

363
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,500
Delivery.

364
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,780
What kind of delivery?

365
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,740
Don't know, sir.

366
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,980
It just says "perishable."

367
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,300
Hi.

368
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,500
Step back, please.

369
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,900
Step back. Thank you.

370
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,840
Victim number four, Jethro.

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,000
The size of the pieces,
the cuts, are all consistent

372
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,320
with the bodies of the DA,
the judge and the foreman.

373
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,520
The homicide detective
completes the team.

374
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,000
You forgetting the
Medical Examiner, Jethro,

375
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,920
whose testimony put
Vincent Hanlan behind bars.

376
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,640
That's you.

377
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,040
Very good, Mr. Palmer.

378
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,200
He's saving the best for last.

379
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
It's not going to happen, Ducky.

380
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,520
Boss...

381
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:33,360
You may load it, Mr. Palmer.

382
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,040
Right, uh, should I, uh, roll it?

383
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,080
Well, one could do that, but
I think it might be easier

384
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,720
if you used the hand trolley.

385
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
Oh, oh, of course.

386
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I was so distracted by its
contents, I didn't notice it.

387
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,400
Here, let me help you with this.

388
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,240
The guy works for an independent
delivery service downtown.

389
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,880
Picked up the barrel from
a new client on 27th Street.

390
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,720
That's the order.

391
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
"Universal Scrap Metal".

392
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,040
The owner called it in.

393
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,560
Yeah, the, uh, print's kind of small.

394
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,560
Even I had trouble reading...

395
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,560
Print's fine, McGee.

396
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,600
Jeffrey...

397
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
Jeffrey Winston.

398
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,280
Uh, actually, it's Jeffrey Wilson.

399
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
But you're very close, boss.

400
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,000
You sure it's Wilson?

401
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,400
Gibbs is right.

402
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,000
Whoever he is, he's
not going to get you.

403
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,240
There's only one thing better
than looking into the eyes of

404
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,840
a beautiful woman and have her say
that everything's going to be all right.

405
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,800
And what's that, Ducky?

406
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,680
My saying it to her.

407
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
All loaded, Doctor.

408
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,360
You stick to him like...

409
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,840
Glue.

410
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,400
...an ex-wife after an alimony check.

411
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
Gibbs, what did Ducky look
like when he was younger?

412
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,880
Ilya Kuryakin.

413
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,240
The sweet smell of freedom.

414
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,240
Mrs. Mallard?

415
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,360
Sleeping.

416
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
Her usual afternoon
fistful of Wild Turkey.

417
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
Her last words to me were either,

418
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
"I'm going to slit your throat"

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,680
or "kiss your moat."

420
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
I couldn't tell 'cause she was slurring.

421
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,360
That's good work, Tony.

422
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,840
Thank you, boss.

423
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,080
So who's taking over for me now?

424
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Kate's on protection detail with Ducky.

425
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,440
Yeah?

426
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,120
McGee's...

427
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,440
going with me to interview the
guy who delivered the barrel.

428
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah.

429
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
I guess that leaves you.

430
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,360
Me?! Boss, I just spent all day
playing furniture mover for this

431
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,160
slightly demented old lady
and her pack of yapping hounds!

432
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,880
They're not hounds, DiNozzo.

433
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,040
They're Corgis.

434
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,000
No, boss! No, boss!

435
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,080
I'm on the verge, man!

436
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,520
McGee? Boss?

437
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
I'm going to go postal!

438
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,240
I'm not kidding! I'm this close!

439
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,720
God!

440
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,200
Here's Tony.

441
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Come on. Here you go, guys.

442
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,880
Whoa... Come on.

443
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,800
Who's got treats?

444
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,120
In the house. In the house.

445
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,480
I got treats.

446
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,880
Good boy, Tyson.

447
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,280
You going to badge me?

448
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
That's what they say on TV.

449
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,920
NCIS.

450
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,400
Naval Criminal Investigative...

451
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,320
I know what it stands for.

452
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,320
Wasn't always in the junk business.

453
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,320
USS Forestal.

454
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Machinist's Mate First Class.

455
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,160
Are you Jeffrey Wilson?

456
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,800
It's about that barrel, ain't?

457
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
I knew that deal was too good.

458
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,440
Tell us about that.

459
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,360
While ago, this dude comes in.

460
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,680
He... buys a few of those.

461
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,320
Where do you get 'em?

462
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
Back of plants, factories.

463
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,600
They don't want 'em.

464
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,840
I clean 'em up, resell 'em.

465
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,520
Okay. Go on.

466
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,240
Well, the dude brings one of
'em back, and it's got some kind

467
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,440
of liquid in it, 'cause I
can hear it sloshing around,

468
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,080
so at first, I thought it might
be some stuff to make meth.

469
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,520
He offers me 200 bucks to
messenger it someplace in Reston.

470
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Probably didn't give his real name.

471
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,240
No name, no address.

472
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,160
Didn't tell me what was
in it, and I didn't ask.

473
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Need you to come to the Navy Yard,

474
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,080
sit down and describe
him to a sketch artist.

475
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,600
Won't do no good.

476
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,520
Dude always wore a hooded
sweatshirt and shades.

477
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,200
He could've been Elvis.

478
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
What was in that barrel anywhere?

479
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,240
A meat puzzle.

480
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,080
Gibbs!

481
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,200
You scared me.

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,160
Come on, Abs, you sleep in a
casket dressed in a funeral gown.

483
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
I don't always wear the gown.

484
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Too much information.

485
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,920
What do we got here?

486
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
Straight to the point.

487
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,560
That's our Gibbs.

488
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,720
Okay, bottom line:

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,280
the sicko that's killing
everyone that sent

490
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,560
Vincent Hanlan to jail is
definitely not Vincent Hanlan.

491
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,080
Before Ducky went to see
his mum, he checked the

492
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,840
dental x-rays with those from the
Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center.

493
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,720
Vincent Hanlan is in the casket.

494
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,940
Every last inch of what is probably

495
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,920
very rotting flesh at this point.

496
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
What about a DNA test?

497
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,800
Maryland incinerates all biological
evidence three years after sentencing.

498
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
Okay, find an earlier X-ray...

499
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,000
before he went to prison.

500
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,840
Before?

501
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
Before.

502
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,680
Mother, I'm home!

503
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,240
Your dogs...

504
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
Oh, not just dogs, Kate Welsh Corgis.

505
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah. In Wales, the Corgi was
the protector of the farmer.

506
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,760
Now they protect my mother.

507
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,480
That's Tyson.

508
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Because he thinks he's a boxer?

509
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,320
No, because he bites.

510
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
The bedrooms are upstairs.

511
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,520
of course.

512
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,960
Mine's there.

513
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,120
Uh, uh, you could use the guest room.

514
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,680
I won't be sleeping, Ducky.

515
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,720
Ah, of course.

516
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,040
Where's your mother's room?

517
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,720
Oh, she sleeps down here now.

518
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,560
Must be difficult for her to
get up the stairs at her age.

519
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
Has nothing to do with stairs, Caitlin.

520
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
Her snoring is deafening.

521
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,320
She kept me awake all night.

522
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,920
She'll keep you awake, too.

523
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Hello.

524
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,080
There you are, Contessa.

525
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
When you're clean, you're beautiful.

526
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,920
Oh, Tony, you've finally
found your true calling.

527
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,960
Mother, may I present Caitlin.

528
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
She works with Tony and me.

529
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,560
Mother!

530
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,600
We talked about this.

531
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,840
Caitlin is here protect us.

532
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,440
Show me your knickers.

533
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,920
Um... ma'am?

534
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,880
Your underwear, missy.

535
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,280
One can always tell a woman's
intention from her panties.

536
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,280
That's always been my philosophy.

537
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,800
I do apologize.

538
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Come along, Mother.

539
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,520
Time to get dinner ready.

540
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
Haven't I had dinner?

541
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,680
No, you haven't.

542
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
Well, use butter tonight.

543
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,520
You always use ban fat.

544
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
I use canola oil.

545
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,680
I can tell that, too.

546
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,320
Sometimes, older people
can make so much sense.

547
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,680
You're relieved, Tony.

548
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,440
Oh, God!

549
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,200
Okay. This is Contessa.

550
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,800
She likes it rough.

551
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,960
Good night, Tony.

552
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
Yeah, look at the time.

553
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
I got to meet Steven for a beer.

554
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,120
Hate to be late. So much to catch up on.

555
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:38,731
Yeah, Gibbs.

556
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:42,120
Vincent Hanlan's dental x-rays
just arrived from medical school.

557
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,960
McGee, you're with me.

558
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,400
Come on.

559
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,200
These x-rays were taken at
Vincent Hanlan's autopsy,

560
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
and these were 11 years
ago when in medical school.

561
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,960
Now, if you look closely, you can see a

562
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
perceptible difference
due to molar wear,

563
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,400
which is highly unusual given the short

564
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,240
span of years, at least in modern man.

565
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,320
Neolithic man, who used
to gnaw a lot of bones,

566
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,760
you know, could incur this kind of...

567
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Are you telling me these X-rays match?

568
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,360
I'm-I'm afraid so.

569
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,800
The fillings in the upper
third molar and second bicuspid

570
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,160
are identical, as are
the shape of the teeth.

571
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
He gnaws on bones like a caveman?

572
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,120
I... can't explain that.

573
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,920
Well, he grinds his teeth, boss.

574
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Why, I did it as a kid in my sleep.

575
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
I had to wear a special
retainer at night.

576
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,000
You still should.

577
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,280
I want Vincent Hanlan's body exhumed.

578
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,280
Why? We...

579
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,920
I- I didn't mean to say that, sir.

581
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,800
It just... it just...

582
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,880
spewed out.

583
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Abby, call Mount Ephraim Cemetery.

584
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,880
McGee, you're with me.

585
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
You dig up that body!

586
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,520
Love to!

587
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,560
He's supposed to get a
judge's authorization.

588
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
He didn't even give us a reason why.

589
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
Well, obviously, Gibbs doesn't
think that Hanlan is dead.

590
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,560
He is dead.

591
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Dental x-rays don't lie.

592
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,400
Well, either Gibbs
is wrong, or Hanlan is

593
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,560
one of the dead that
still walks at night.

594
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,120
Okay, well, then Gibbs is wrong.

595
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,400
Isn't he?

596
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Mrs. Mallard?

597
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,520
Mrs. Mallard.

598
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,920
Sneaking off after having your
fun just as I knew you would.

599
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,400
No, it's not like that, Mrs. Mallard.

600
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Now, please, I need you to take
your dog and go back inside.

601
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, that's not my dog.

602
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,600
Of course it's yours.

603
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Now, please, Mrs. Mallard...

604
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,360
I've never seen that
dog before in my life.

605
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,440
I only have Corgis.

606
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,400
Back inside, now!

607
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Ducky?!

608
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Ducky!

609
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,320
Ducky!

610
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,400
Gibbs, I'm sorry.

611
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,480
It's my fault.

612
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:57,960
Two agents.

613
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,840
Excuse me?

614
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,840
Two protectees.

615
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,040
I should've had two agents.

616
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,960
You were as responsible for the
mother as you were for Ducky.

617
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,280
Boss, Abby says the tire tracks from
the van were made from Uniroyal Laredos.

618
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,760
They're standard on
Chevy Express cargo vans.

619
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,600
Both the funeral home and the taxidermy
business own Chevrolet Express cargo vans.

620
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
That's good enough for
a search authorizations.

621
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,040
On it.

622
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,680
Tony, you and Kate take
the turkey-stuffing brother.

623
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,280
McGee, come on.

624
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,680
You're with me.

625
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,240
You have no right to invade
my home and my business.

626
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Actually, that search
warrant says we do, ma'am.

627
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,680
Don't "ma'am" me, you simpering wimp.

628
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,800
No, ma'am.

629
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,640
Unlock this door.

630
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,800
Ma'am, if you impede our search

631
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,200
in any way, you will be
charged with obstruction.

632
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,360
That's not the way to do this.

633
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,120
I have the right to break down
that door and anything in my way.

634
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,120
Are you satisfied?

635
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,040
Nope.

636
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,680
McGee, take a scraping from inside.

637
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,560
One son beats a young woman to death,

638
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,000
the other one plays with dead animals.

639
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,200
I wonder where they get that?

640
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,040
From their mother.

641
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,560
Same teeth.

642
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,640
Vincent Hanlan's corpse
matches his autopsy X-rays.

643
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,520
Teeth don't lie, Jimmy.

644
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,920
What?

645
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,400
Do you think...

646
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,040
you could get a blood type from
the nerve tissue in this tooth?

647
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
If I can rehydrate it.

648
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,520
What are you thinking?

649
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,920
I am thinking something crazy, Abby.

650
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,600
Crazy is good.

651
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,420
It's heavier.

652
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:14,960
Definitely something in this one.

653
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,760
Mr. Goldberg. He's being
buried in the morning.

654
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,560
Check underneath Mr. Goldberg.

655
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,400
There's nothing.

656
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,320
I'll inform the Goldbergs their grandfather
was frisked by NCIS in his coffin.

657
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,040
They're litigators.

658
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,080
Boss, van is on the way to
the garage for forensics.

659
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,080
What next?

660
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,120
Why don't you just admit that you made

661
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
a mistake and get the hell out of here?

662
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,160
Gibbs.

663
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,200
No joy, boss.

664
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,880
We looked under every furry creature...

665
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
and inside a couple.

666
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,120
Ducky's not here.

667
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,520
I knew you'd find something, DiNozzo.

668
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,160
That's good work, Tony.

669
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,680
You bring him in for interrogation.

670
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,120
Did you hear what I said, boss?

671
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Yeah.

672
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,640
Yeah, I heard you.

673
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,720
Let's go, McGee.

674
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,520
What'd they find?

675
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,120
Jonathan called.

676
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,160
They're searching his shop, too.

677
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,280
What do they think?

678
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,520
He stuffed their precious doctor?

679
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,000
Mary, we should do
something to prevent...

680
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,880
Fred, Fred, shh, shh, shh.

681
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Don't start thinking now.

682
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,960
You're far too old for that.

683
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,640
I already told you.

684
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,560
Tell me again.

685
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,440
We crashed into a tree.

686
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Vincent was driving?

687
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,160
Yes.

688
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,200
You jumped out of the car.

689
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,280
That's right.

690
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,640
You didn't even attempt
to help your brother?

691
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,240
Car was on fire.

692
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,480
I was in a daze.

693
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,960
But you didn't even try.

694
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
It was too hot!

695
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,800
There was no way I could get to him.

696
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,520
What did your mother think about that?

697
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,960
I wouldn't know.

698
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
We don't talk.

699
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,040
We haven't spoken since that night.

700
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
Yeah? Why is that?

701
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,520
He was her favorite.

702
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,000
She blames you for his death.

703
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,960
If my friend dies, I'll blame you, too.

704
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,000
Gibbs, uh, Jimmy Palmer
and Abby need to see you.

705
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,040
I pulled one of Vincent Hanlan's
teeth and gave it to Abby.

706
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,440
We did a blood analysis
of the nerve tissue

707
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,080
and compared it to the blood type
of the tissue from the corpse.

708
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,840
They didn't match.

709
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,080
These are Vincent Hanlan's teeth,
but they were put into this jaw.

710
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,080
This body is not Vincent Hanlan's.

711
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,640
I did a gas chromatograph
and I found traces

712
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,080
of cyanoacrylate on
the bottom of the...

713
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,360
In a language I speak, Abby.

714
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,000
There is Super Glue on
the root of the tooth.

715
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,920
Just a drop. It would
never show up on an X-ray.

716
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,960
So the teeth were pulled
from Vincent's mouth?

717
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,160
One by one.

718
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
And then they were
glued back into this jaw.

719
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Homo Sapien.

720
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,160
Reconstruction Category.

721
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,480
Someone took your brother's
teeth and put them in that skull.

722
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,680
It wasn't me.

723
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,120
It was them.

724
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
It was always them.

725
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,120
Your mother and Vincent?

726
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
Vincent was drunk the night

727
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,400
he slammed into that tree.

728
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We got out just before
it burst into flames.

729
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,600
When we got home,
Mother had a car-crash

730
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,600
body laid out on the embalming table.

731
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,720
Closed-casket job.

732
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,920
She came up with the idea
of giving Vincent a new life.

733
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
He's got to be telling the truth.

734
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Why?

735
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,720
Who would make that up?

736
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
After she extracted Vincent's
teeth and put them in

737
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,280
the car-crash body, she burnt
the corpse beyond recognition.

738
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,080
Where's Vincent?

739
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,480
With Mother.

740
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,360
He's always with Mother.

741
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,960
We already searched the
funeral home. Look harder.

742
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Is Dr. Mallard there?

743
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Probably.

744
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,600
They don't keep you informed?

745
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
They have lots of secrets.

746
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Terrible secrets with each other.

747
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,680
You call your mother, Jonathan.

748
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,760
You tell her we've released you.

749
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,240
You tell her that
everything is okay now.

750
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,320
That we have run into a dead end.

751
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,240
You convince her, Jonathan.

752
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,600
If you don't, I will tear
every tooth out of your skull.

753
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,560
I got a light.

754
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,440
Let's go.

755
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,960
Wait.

756
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,640
For what?

757
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,200
Let them get Ducky out of
wherever they've been hiding him.

758
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:12,920
Now?

759
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,640
Not yet.

760
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,240
Okay, get into positions.

761
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,080
It'll only take four
minutes to drain your blood.

762
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,800
Versus eight years...

763
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,800
in the same cell...

764
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,120
24 hours a day.

765
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,240
He's getting off easy, angel.

766
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,360
Where are they?!

767
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Turn around.

768
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,400
Hands out.

769
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:11,960
He's clean.

770
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,440
Get back!

771
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,000
Move back.

772
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Or you're dead.

773
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,200
Tony.

774
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
My hands. Release my hands!

775
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
Get me something to stop the bleeding!

776
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,320
Hands in the air!

777
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,760
I can't go back there.

778
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,320
Just do what they say, Vincent.

779
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,640
Turn around, face the wall.

780
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,560
Just do it.

781
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,480
I love you, Mother, but
I can't do this again.

782
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:57,960
No!

783
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,440
No!

784
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,560
My God, no!

785
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,000
They killed my son!

786
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Come on. Let's go.

787
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
They killed...

788
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,200
You're the one that
got off easy, my boy.

789
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,640
What kept you?

790
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,080
The mother finally gave a statement?

791
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Yeah.

792
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,640
Short one... two words.

793
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,960
So, you seeing my frat bro tonight?

794
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,280
As a matter of fact, I am.

795
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,120
Steven feels bad.

796
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,400
Said he'd like to make it up to me.

797
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
How's he gonna do that?

798
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
By telling me things about you.

799
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,600
Never gonna happen.

800
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,040
The Fraternal Oath is sacred.

801
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,640
Some things are even more sacred, Tony.
