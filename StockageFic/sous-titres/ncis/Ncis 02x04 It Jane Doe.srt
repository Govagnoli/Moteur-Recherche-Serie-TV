1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,180
It's been six months,
three weeks, 14 hours...

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,820
18 minutes since I last
saw Tina's cute little...

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,060
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,980
Got to go.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,820
You can't hold it for 20 minutes?

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,380
I'm not going to tell Marci
I got to hit the head first.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,700
Aw, come on, Tom.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,620
I promise not to shake
it more than once.

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
I'd have returned the money.

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,800
A buck eighty-five.

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,280
It's the principle, not the amount.

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
I didn't notice at the drive-thru.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
I dropped the change in
the ashtray and we left.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,480
You didn't notice because
you were too busy leering

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,360
at the blonde working the window.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,600
I wasn't leering.

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,800
Drooling a little, maybe.

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
The point is, I didn't
notice her mistake

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,800
until after we parked and I took
the change out of the ashtray.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,480
The point is, you did notice,

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
which makes not returning
the money a conscious act.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
Well, I'd burn more than a buck

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
eighty-five in gas driving back there.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
It's going to come back to haunt you.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,520
What is?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,520
Karma. What goes around,
comes around like a boomerang.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,160
And when yours comes back around
you better duck really low.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
Mm, well, you don't have to
duck if you don't believe.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,400
Believe what?

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
Kind of a private conversation, McGee.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
With all the bad karma you've
built up with women alone,

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,880
I am surprised that something
hasn't just fallen off.

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
Missing something, DiNozzo?

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
Yes. Gibbs.

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,120
Agent Gibbs, this is dispatch.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Have a DOA in Norfolk.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
We've got a body at Norfolk.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,160
Get Ducky.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
I thought he was flying to London.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
Plane doesn't leave for a few hours.

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,920
Do you believe in karma, boss?

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
I've had three wives, DiNozzo.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,120
Should have driven back.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,040
Driven back where?

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Who found the body, Commander?

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Those two seamen off
the George Washington.

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,520
She docked yesterday, after a
six-month deployment in the Gulf.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
They were driving off
station for two weeks leave.

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Stopped to use the head.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,120
That what they call
bleachers in Norfolk?

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,320
The one over there was locked.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,320
Yeah, well, I guess I'd go
out behind the bleachers, too.

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
After discovering the
body, they flagged down

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Petty Officer Cluxton, who
was passing by on patrol.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
You do all this, Petty Officer?

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,080
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,880
After ascertaining the Lieutenant
was deceased I searched for I.D.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
You touched the body?

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I was wearing gloves, sir.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,640
Go on.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
Finding no I.D., I radioed in
the report, retraced my steps,

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,600
marked my footprints for
exclusionary purposes,

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,040
and taped off a 20-yard perimeter.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,480
How often did your patrol take
you past this area last night?

65
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,840
Every hour on the 30, sir.

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,560
From?

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,560
20-hundred hours when
I came on duty, sir.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
Saw nothing unusual
until Seamen Jennings

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,880
and Wilkens flagged me down at 0132.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,680
- DiNozzo, get their statements.
- On it, boss.

71
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
I took their statements, sir.

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,400
You mind if we take them, too?

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,000
No, sir. Of course not.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
You did a good job, Petty Officer.

75
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Thank you, ma'am.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
Petty Officer Cluxton.

77
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,640
Agent McGee.

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
Hey, how... how...

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,120
how have you been?

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
I've been good.

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,440
You?

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
Sorry, Kate.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Yeah, good.

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,080
Uh, um... yeah, I've been assigned

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
to NCIS headquarters at the Navy Yard.

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,120
So I heard.

87
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,680
It was kind of a surprise transfer.

88
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,120
Uh, you know, one minute
I'm in Norfolk, the next...

89
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,880
You're back at Norfolk maybe
even permanently, McGee.

90
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,880
Yeah, uh...

91
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,840
sorry, sorry, boss.

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
The Petty Officer and I, we...
vetted civilian job applicants back...

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm going to start
measuring and sketching now.

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
Yeah, McGee, you do that.

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
That will be all for now, Petty Officer.

96
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,840
Yes, sir.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
If you need me, Special Agent
Gibbs, I'll be in my office.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,280
Okay.

99
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
You could have told her, Gibbs.

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,320
Told who what?

101
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,760
Petty Officer Cluxton.

102
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,360
She did a good job.

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,480
Did she now?

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,640
She wore gloves, marked her footprints,
cordoned of the crime scene...

105
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Searched the body for I.D.

106
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,360
How do you do that without
disturbing the body, Agent Todd?

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
She could have... should
have waited for the M.E.

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
That would have been doing a good job.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,640
Keep shooting.

110
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,640
Dr. Gutterman will be
filling in in my absence.

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,800
I should warn you, the old boy
does love to hear himself talk.

112
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
I'll do my best to handle, Doctor.

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yes, I suspect the good doctor
will be a tad grumpy as well.

114
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,560
Why is that?

115
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,840
He lost the coin toss.

116
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
What coin toss, Ducky?

117
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,040
The one that, in two hours,
will send me to London,

118
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,920
to the assembly of the
Collegium Mortum Scrutinium.

119
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,800
Of course.

120
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
The Society of Medical Examiners.

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
Very good, Kate.

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Four years of Latin
has finally paid off.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Do you know who founded the society?

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Not a clue.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Leonardo Da Vinci himself.

126
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
Wow, indeed.

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes, we can trace the
roots of our society,

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,440
dedicated to the history
of forensic sciences,

129
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
to one formed by Leonardo in the same

130
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,600
year that he began the Mona Lisa.

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,320
In fact, that transcendent
painting is the symbol...

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,000
Duck, you want to meet with your
society in London, or give us a lecture?

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,400
Ooh, quite right.

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,400
I do have a plane catch.

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,640
Thank you, Jethro.

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,720
De nada.

137
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Now, what story do you
have to tell us, my dear?

138
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,400
You know, Ducky, someday,
one of them will talk back.

139
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,240
The language of silence may
be hard to hear, Caitlin,

140
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
but, unlike the living, when
the dead speak, they do not lie.

141
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,000
Small abrasions and visible
bruising of the neck.

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,800
Strangled?

143
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,880
Most likely.

144
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Dr. Gutterman can confirm that
when he examines the soft tissues.

145
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Bruises on the thighs.

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
She could have been raped.

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,480
Gutterman can confirm that, too.

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,640
Liver probe.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,200
Ready.

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,360
Usually, you ask, Jethro.

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,680
Master-Of-Arms already
searched the body, Duck.

152
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm double-checking.

153
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,200
I do wish they'd wait until I arrive.

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,760
Hey, boss, got statements from
Seamen Jennings and Wilkens.

155
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
Can I cut them loose? They've
been at sea a long time.

156
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:00,440
Know where to find them?

157
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,560
Motel at Virginia Beach.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Girlfriends are waiting.

159
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,400
Yeah. Let 'em go.

160
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,200
Haven't been with their women in...

161
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
six months, three weeks, 18 hours.

162
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
The longest I went
was 11 days, six hours.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,520
I can't believe you
actually know these things.

164
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,160
It's a gift.

165
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
Liver temp: 81.6.

166
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,600
Ambient temperature: 73.1.

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Time of death?

168
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Uh, somewhere between 2300 and 0100.

169
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,160
Well, my children, I
have a plane to catch.

170
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,960
How long are you in London for, Ducky?

171
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,800
Only three days.

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,840
Actually, I won't be in London.

173
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,440
I'll be in the city of London.

174
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,800
There's a difference?

175
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,800
There's a little known
fact that the city of London

176
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,080
isn't actually London at all.

177
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,560
How can it not be London?

178
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
No, I.D.

179
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
We've got a Lieutenant Jane Doe.

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
The moment Special Agent Gibbs is done

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
processing the scene, we
get her back to the morgue.

182
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,480
Of course, Doctor.

183
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
Ducky, if it's not London, what is it?

184
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Shouldn't you be on a
plane by now, Doctor?

185
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,800
One of the modern marvels
of air travel, Mr. Palmer

186
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,400
miss one flight, there are numerous
others from which to choose.

187
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,200
You started without me.

188
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,800
I believe, as you are my
assistant, as opposed to the

189
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,960
other way around, it is my
prerogative to start without you.

190
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,360
Abby here.

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,240
You're on the air.

192
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,400
Abby, it's Ducky.

193
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,240
Oh, Ducky on the AirFone. How cool.

194
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm in Autopsy.

195
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,440
Then you're going to be
way late for afternoon tea.

196
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm sending Mr. Palmer up
with the victim's fingerprints,

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,320
semen and blood, for DNA analysis.

198
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,320
Ooh. Raped and murdered.

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,880
Be sure to sign the
evidence exchange forms.

200
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,720
I will check.

201
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Okay.

202
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,000
As soon as I'm finished
with this explosive

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,800
swab analysis I will get all over it.

204
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,040
No, you will get all over it now.

205
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Why are you still here?

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
I- I'm not.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
You're back, aren't you?

208
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,840
You bastard.

209
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,360
That good for you?

210
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,360
Trust me, Mr. Goodwrench, I'm smiling.

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm not.

212
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,800
Hey, Gibbs.

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Hey, boss.

214
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,240
Special Agent Goodwrench?

215
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
McGee is rewiring my hot box.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
That's a nickname for a bundle
of receptors in the firewall

217
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,680
that regulates the flow of
energy throughout the system.

218
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,400
See, when stimulated
correctly it sends out

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
waves and waves of rhythmic pulses.

220
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,120
Waves that, uh...

221
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,120
that hyper-crank the transfer
speed of digitized infor...

222
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,640
Abby.

223
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,280
McGee is helping me speed up the search

224
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,720
for Lieutenant Jane Doe's
fingerprints in the AFIS database.

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,440
I got to I.D. her fast,
to keep their hound at bay.

226
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm more Jack Russell Terrier.

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,280
No, not you, Gibbs. Ducky.

228
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,840
He's barking at my heels
like a dog with the mange.

229
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,480
He's still here?

230
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
He's in autopsy.

231
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,400
And he's so grouchy he'll
give you a run for your money.

232
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
If I said that to Gibbs,
I would be seeing stars.

233
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, that's the advantage of being me.

234
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Now get back down there.

235
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Dr. Mallard?

236
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,560
Jimmy Palmer.

237
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Oh... how stupid is that?

238
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
I know that you know
I'm not Dr. Mallard.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,680
I just...

240
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,440
because he... uh...

241
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
He's not here, sir.

242
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
He catch a flight to England?

243
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,360
No, he said he was going to Norfolk.

244
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,760
I think drove.

245
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,920
Why?

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,520
Why'd he drive?

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,320
Go to Norfolk.

248
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,200
Oh. Uh...

249
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,280
he didn't say.

250
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,160
He just finished the autopsy,
told me to put her to bed

251
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,880
and then he said he
was going to Norfolk.

252
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,640
Anything unusual in the autopsy?

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know, sir.

254
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,240
Dr. Mallard wouldn't
even let me assist him.

255
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,400
He did everything by himself.

256
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,920
He ever do that before?

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,320
No, sir.

258
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,640
He took quite a while, too.

259
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,245
He wanted to check everything over and

260
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I thought he only made
me do that 'cause I'm...

261
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,680
...inexperienced.

262
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,360
Sheesh!

263
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,280
seen that look before.

264
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,360
You went to the men's
room 45 minutes ago.

265
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,520
You clocked me?

266
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,160
What could take you so long?

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,040
Don't answer that.

268
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Actually, Kate, I was...

269
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,720
I don't want to hear it!

270
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,800
...returning the buck
eighty-five to the drive-thru.

271
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
You returned the money?

272
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,080
See, the whole hands over
the ears thing doesn't work.

273
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
I used to do that when I was a kid

274
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,280
I could hear everything my parents said.

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,880
They had some interesting words.

276
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
I can't believe you gave it back.

277
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,320
Well, she was off duty.

278
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
You didn't give it back.

279
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,960
The pimply-faced mall
rat at the drive-thru

280
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
would've just pocketed it.

281
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,040
You brought the teacher coffee?

282
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
Thinking ahead, Kate.

283
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,640
Thinking ahead.

284
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,000
After you tell Gibbs
we've got nothing, a cup

285
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
of his favorite brew
will tame the beast.

286
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,360
After I tell Gibbs?

287
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,480
Tell me what?

288
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,480
Hey, boss.

289
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,240
I got you a little...

290
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,440
Hot, hot, hot, hot...

291
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,480
Aah...!

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
What are the odds of that
happening twice in one day?

293
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,920
The same as me firing the two
of you if I don't get a report.

294
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,120
The victim's picture
is on the Navy Intranet

295
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
to department heads of every
in-station vessel and base unit.

296
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,640
Nothing yet.

297
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,760
PSA?

298
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,280
No missing females.

299
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
Officers or enlisted.

300
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,760
PSA is Personnel Support Activity.

301
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
I've been here a year, Tony.

302
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,800
I know the acronyms.

303
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,200
Ah, a year.

304
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Seems like only yesterday you were

305
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
mixing up NAV-SOCs
with NAV-SUPs.

306
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Our little girl's growing
up fast, isn't she, boss?

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,520
What was that for?

308
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,280
Not growing up.

309
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,160
What else you got?

310
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Nothing.

311
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,520
Nothing.

312
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,560
Hey, guys.

313
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
But it looks like Abby does.

314
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,960
Who is our victim?

315
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,240
We do not know.

316
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Then what are you doing here?

317
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,880
We're... we're...

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,920
we're through, boss.

319
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,080
We ran the entire AFIS data
bank, we didn't get a match.

320
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
How can AFIS not find a match?

321
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,000
She's a Navy lieutenant.

322
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,000
No, she isn't, Jethro.

323
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,760
Lieutenant Jane Doe is a misnomer.

324
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
The poor woman was never in the navy.

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,240
Match this sperm against the
sample I removed from our victim.

326
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Please.

327
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,440
You've been holding out on me, Doctor.

328
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,920
Yes, Agent Gibbs...

329
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,560
I have.

330
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,280
Tell my family what happened to me.

331
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,440
Please.

332
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,240
Dr. Mallard.

333
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
That's not the first trident you've seen

334
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
carved in the neck of a victim, is it?

335
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,520
No.

336
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,080
I shouldn't have held out
on you, but I wasn't sure

337
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,080
it was the same until I did the autopsy.

338
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,280
You weren't sure when
you saw the trident

339
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,760
on her neck at the crime scene?

340
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,120
Unlike you, Agent
Gibbs, I prefer to rely

341
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,840
on forensic evidence and not my gut.

342
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,760
We're a team, Doctor.

343
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Team members don't hold out.

344
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, you'right.

345
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,120
It was... unprofessional.

346
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm still hoping that
Abby doesn't get a match

347
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
and all this is just
some macabre coincidence.

348
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,960
Forgive me, Jethro.

349
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Tell me about that other case.

350
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
Well, it was ten years ago...

351
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,640
A Navy corpsman, out jogging,
fod a body in a culvert

352
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,240
beside an athletic field at Norfolk

353
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,720
a Navy lieutenant who'd
been raped and strangled.

354
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
She had a trident carved
on the side of her neck.

355
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,840
We ran her prints through
AFIS and got nothing.

356
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
She wasn't in the Navy.

357
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,480
Our profiler believed that the
murderer had dressed his victim

358
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,160
as a Navy lieutenant to
fulfill some revenge fantasy.

359
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,280
'94 was the first year women
were deployed on combat ships.

360
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,720
Special Agentes Iassumed that the killer

361
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,440
had served under a female officer.

362
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,720
Dawes?

363
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,720
I don't know him retire?

364
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,520
Uh-uh. He passed on,
oh... seven years ago.

365
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,120
He investigated every Navy
unit with a trident insignia.

366
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,080
Especially those wiemale officers.

367
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,720
He didn't come up with a single suspect.

368
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,760
The trident symbol may have
nothing to do with the Navy.

369
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,000
That's the conclusion we came to. But...

370
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,400
this note was found at
the scene of the crime,

371
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,640
three days after the
body was discovered.

372
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
Was it missed on the initial search?

373
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,400
No.

374
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,920
It was found where the body had been.

375
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,360
But he didn't come back.

376
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,840
Not until now.

377
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,680
I've got one question for you, Ducky.

378
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Why is this case so personal?

379
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,200
Did you know that Leonardo Da
Vinci never gave the Mona Lisa

380
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,200
to the patron who commissioned it?

381
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,120
Nope.

382
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,640
Instead... he carried
the painting with him

383
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,240
for the rest of his life.

384
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,200
She's been with me
for ten years, Jethro.

385
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
She was the only Jane
Doe I never identified.

386
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
The only one whose
family has no closure.

387
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,440
The only one who never went home.

388
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,000
Autopsy.

389
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,640
Ducky?

390
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,840
Do I sound like Ducky?

391
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,520
No. Actually, these days he
sounds more like you, Gibbs.

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
I'm not in the mood, Abbs.

393
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320
Well, maybe this will rise your spirits.

394
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,960
The semen sample from
Jane Doe's murderer

395
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
matches the sample of the Ducky case.

396
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,560
This is good news, right?

397
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,360
Abbs, that semen is from
a ten-year-old cold case.

398
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,960
He's back, isn't he?

399
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Not again Jethro.

400
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,000
We can't let him escape again.

401
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,260
I saw this trident carved into the neck

402
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,580
of the victim at the crime
scene and told no one.

403
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,540
Not even Gibbs.

404
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,620
All I can do is apologize and assure you

405
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,780
that such an inexcusable
lapse of forensic protocol

406
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,020
will never happen again.

407
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,900
Right.

408
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,420
Ten years ago, another Jane Doe
was found raped and strangled

409
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,220
in a culvert beside an
athletic field at Norfolk.

410
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,140
She, too, was a civilian, dressed
in the uniform of a naval lieutenant.

411
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,660
She had a high blood-alcohol level

412
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,740
and a trident carved
into the side of her neck.

413
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,540
Abby has confirmed that
sperm from both victims

414
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,140
came from the same man, so we are
pursuing a serial rapist and murderer.

415
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,100
This note was found three days after

416
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,340
the crime scene had been processed.

417
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,900
A challenge to investigators.

418
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,980
You think, Kate?

419
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,140
I've asked Commander Reynolds to place

420
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
our crime scene under
discreet surveillance.

421
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Since '94 was the first year
we deployed women on warships,

422
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,060
this wacko may be an enlisted
man acting out a revenge fantasy.

423
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,300
They investigate units with
tridents on their patches?

424
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,060
Gee, I don't think they
thought about that, Tony.

425
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,900
Yeah.

426
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,260
They investigated every ship and
shore division with female officers.

427
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,540
Nada.

428
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,500
Abbs, you need to go to the head?

429
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,860
No. I have a question.

430
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,100
Isn't ten years a long
time between murders?

431
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,100
Absolutely.

432
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
This doesn't fit a
serial killer's profile.

433
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,900
Ducky, could pull the headshots
up for me again, please?

434
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,060
Now if he goes through the
trouble of dressing two civilians

435
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,620
like a lieutenant he hates, why
is one blonde the other brunette?

436
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,980
One Anglo, one Hispanic?

437
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,100
They're both cute for being dead.

438
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,940
He's a wacko!

439
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Maybe just being female and
intoxicated was good enough.

440
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,020
Unless Abby blew the sperm match...

441
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,700
No way.

442
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,660
...the same man killed both of them.

443
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,580
Which means he didn't rape and
murder for ten years because...

444
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,860
He was in prison!

445
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,300
Hey...

446
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,060
- Okay, homework assignments: McGee
- Boss.

447
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Search JAG records for sailors
incarcerated after October of '94.

448
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,140
And recently released.

449
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,460
On it.

450
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,260
Kate, suspect interviews
from ten years ago.

451
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,220
If any of these men still
live in Norfolk, question them.

452
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,700
Okay.

453
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,780
DiNozzo, flash this Jane
Doe at every bar, club

454
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,660
and strip joint within a
mile of the Norfolk Gate.

455
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,700
Given the victim's blood-alcohol level,

456
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,060
maybe he picked her up at one of them.

457
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,820
No problema.

458
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,540
Abby, forensics may have
missed something in '94.

459
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,100
Go over it again.

460
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,260
Yes, Professor.

461
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,740
Come on, people.

462
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,660
Let's go! Let's go!

463
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,380
Hey, wait.

464
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,340
Come here.

465
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,820
You'll need Ducky's help.

466
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,420
No, I won't.

467
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,140
Abbs...

468
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Yes, I will.

469
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,340
Hey, uh, Duckman...

470
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
Yeah.

471
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,300
The cross polars in my polarizing

472
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,340
light microscope won't center.

473
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,660
You may have a problem.

474
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,620
However, I think I have the solution.

475
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,620
How's NCIS doing?

476
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,100
Well, according to my friends,
I'm having some bad karma.

477
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,620
Not that I really believe in
that stuff, but... you know.

478
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,620
You really should, you know.

479
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,500
That right?

480
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,260
Yeah.

481
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,780
See, I used to reject
all things spiritual,

482
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,420
mystical and existential

483
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,660
But once I began to embrace them,
my whole life started to blossom.

484
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,140
She been in recently?

485
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,620
No. What'd she do?

486
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,740
Got herself raped and killed.

487
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,060
Such a sweet countenance.

488
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,100
"Sweet countenance..."

489
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,860
Yeah, that radiant look on her face.

490
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,620
She doesn't look
radiant- she's dead.

491
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,220
In that picture?

492
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,340
Yeah, she's dead.

493
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:41,900
She's dead?

494
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,820
She's dead.

495
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,660
Why do you think her eyes are closed?

496
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,820
I thought she was meditating.

497
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,180
Okay, thanks.

498
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,180
Guess he doesn't
believe in that, either.

499
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,900
Well, have Petty Officer
Cluxton deliver it ASAP.

500
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,780
No. The evening pouch
will not do, Commander!

501
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,380
He didn't wait three days.

502
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,060
Hello.

503
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,460
Abbs, Norfolk got a note from our wacko.

504
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,740
Ooh, did you catch him?

505
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,900
He made the drop before
surveillance was in place.

506
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,500
You'll have it in a couple of hours.

507
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,060
Listen. Compare the ink,
the paper, the handwriting.

508
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,820
Did you get DNA?

509
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,420
You get DNA off the first note?

510
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,900
Yep. DNA testing was in
the caveman aera in '94.

511
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,780
I'm good.

512
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I'm really good.

513
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,100
Gas pain?

514
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,740
What?

515
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,860
No!

516
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,820
Well, then stop grinning
and tell me what you got.

517
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,020
When he found the first
Jane Doe while jogging,

518
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,060
Petty Officer Goetz was in port
on a carrier, the Teddy Roosevelt.

519
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,100
Really? Agent Dawes
interrogated him a number

520
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,580
of times on the Big Stick and here.

521
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,660
Big Stick?

522
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
Teddy Roosevelt.

523
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,100
"Talk softly, carry a...

524
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,380
Carry a big stick. Cute.

525
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,380
Goetz stayed in the Navy, is a chief

526
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,540
and arrived in Norfolk
on the same carrier

527
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,780
as the seamen who found our Jane Doe.

528
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,700
Uh, the "Honest Abe."

529
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,940
"Shall Not Perish."

530
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,660
What?

531
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,220
The Lincoln's not the "Honest Abe."

532
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,820
It's "Shall Not Perish."

533
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,980
What kind of a nickname
is "Shall Not Perish"?

534
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,260
Ask Chief Goetz when you
pull him in for questioning.

535
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:23,940
Okay.

536
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
The Emancipator.

537
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,100
That, that would be a good
name for the Abraham Lincoln.

538
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,020
Since he, uh, he signed the
Emancipation Proclamation.

539
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,180
Uh, the... Sorry.

540
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,740
This have to do with the body
I found ten years ago, sir?

541
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,540
Yeah.

542
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,260
Isn't there a statute of
limitations on questioning a suspect?

543
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,780
Didn't say you were a suspect.

544
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,300
Why se would I be here, sir?

545
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,540
Another body was found two nights ago.

546
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,700
Same MO.

547
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,980
She have a trident... here?

548
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,260
He said he'd be back.

549
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,740
Now, how did you know that?

550
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,340
Agent Dawes never told you.

551
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,460
No, sir.

552
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,940
But he had me write out "I'll be
back" with my right and left hand.

553
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,340
Not too hard to figure out why.

554
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,620
You arrived two days ago
on the Abraham Lincoln?

555
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,060
Yes, sir.

556
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,940
First nit back, where'd you go?

557
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,700
You think I raped and murdered her?

558
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,060
Never said she was raped.

559
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,140
You said the same MO.

560
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,020
Where'd you spend your
first night ashore?

561
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,940
Clubbing?

562
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,540
I didn't leave the station.

563
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,540
Six months at sea,
your first night in port

564
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,420
you spend it aboard ship?

565
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,665
No, sir.

566
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,820
I said I didn't leave the station.

567
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,580
I stayed with a friend.

568
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,500
stationed here at Norfolk?

569
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:57,940
Yes, sir.

570
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,660
Hey.

571
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,900
Hey! Whoa. Whoa!

572
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,020
Where's the five-alarm?

573
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,140
I think I have a suspect.

574
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,780
Machinist Mate Harlan Wilson.

575
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,540
He was there in October '94.

576
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,580
Discharged that December.

577
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,340
Arrested two months later in Toronto

578
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,860
for sexually assaulting a
female Canadian naval officer.

579
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,700
Got 15 years.

580
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,980
Paroled two months ago and
is now living in Norfolk.

581
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,740
I didn't know there were
women in the Canadian Navy.

582
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,780
I gotta tell Gibbs.

583
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,020
Whoa, probie, first, you report
to your immediate superior.

584
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,780
I just did.

585
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,580
"Blah-blah-blah-blah, female
Canadian naval officer."

586
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,340
That's not reporting.

587
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,300
Yeah, that would be all you heard.

588
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,420
Again, start with the name.

589
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,260
Can't do that, sir.

590
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,380
Your friend married?

591
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,940
No, sir.

592
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,740
An officer?

593
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Yes, sir.

594
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,220
So, you see how I
can't give you the name.

595
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:38,740
Chief,

596
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,020
I'm not interested in ruining careers.

597
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,460
I need to know where you
spent the night of the murder.

598
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,940
Can we speak off the record, sir?

599
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,300
Just you and me?

600
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,740
Kate...

601
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,940
stop the tape.

602
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,460
Stop the tape.

603
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,420
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,020
No sound?

605
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,420
Gibbs is having a private
interrogation: no sound, no video.

606
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,460
McGee needs to talk to him.

607
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,780
I'm not going to interrupt him.

608
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,460
Kate...

609
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,700
No.

610
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,020
Okay. Fill her in, McGee.

611
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,500
Tell her about Harlan Wilson.

612
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,900
Meet me in the garage in five.

613
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm waiting, Chief.

614
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,380
How do I know they stopped taping?

615
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,940
Because I told them to.

616
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,460
The name.

617
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Lieutenant Commander...

618
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,900
William McDougal.

619
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,700
Hey, Starsky, check
the sweet '70's ride.

620
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,700
Nice.

621
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,260
All right, you be the Avon Lady.

622
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,980
I'll cover the rear.

623
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,140
Yah.

624
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,900
What's the peekie, probie?

625
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

626
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,900
I'd love to get a look
inside while he's away.

627
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,500
I told you we should
get search authorization.

628
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:20,940
No time.

629
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,220
Besides it's a Catch-22.

630
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,180
It is?

631
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,980
Yeah. We go inside and get something

632
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,860
we shouldn't, we're screwed.

633
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
We don't go inside
and don't get something

634
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,460
we could've, we're more screwed.

635
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,540
I'm not following.

636
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,340
That's because I'm a
highly seasoned senior

637
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,620
field agent and you're a pathetic...

638
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,500
Probie. Yeah.

639
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,060
You're a fast study, McGee.

640
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,180
15 seconds personal best.

641
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Harlan's no Martha Stewart.

642
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,860
Well, he's gonna be home soon.

643
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,540
How can you tell?

644
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,940
Hungry Man in the oven.

645
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,140
Buck
eighty-freakin'- five.

646
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,820
Pickup's pulling up!

647
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,060
Yeah?

648
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,820
NCIS.

649
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,540
Harlan Wilson?

650
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
Tom Wilson-
his big brother.

651
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,660
Your kid brother around, Tom?

652
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,220
No.

653
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,860
He listed this address
on his parole release.

654
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,300
He was here.

655
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,780
You know where he is now?

656
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,540
Yeah.

657
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,180
Well, we need to talk to him.

658
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,140
Well, that's gonna be hard to do.

659
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,900
He's been dead for six weeks.

660
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,980
Chief Goetz's alibi checks out.

661
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,980
Where was he?

662
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,340
With a friend.

663
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,020
You're taking the word of a friend?

664
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,620
No,

665
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,620
a saliva swab to compare his DNA
with sperm taken from the victim's.

666
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,380
Any other questions?

667
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,940
Good. My turn.

668
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,740
Where's McGee?

669
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,460
He took Harlan's hairbrush to Abby

670
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,900
to compare his DNA to the sperm.

671
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,420
Probie won't give up on the obvious.

672
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,060
Harlan Wilson was dead when the

673
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,820
second murder occurred,
wasn't he, DiNozzo?

674
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,700
Very dead, boss.

675
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,820
Big mother heart attack.

676
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,745
Fax of the death certificate.

677
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,420
How many bars and clubs did you canvass?

678
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
Uh, 24, 25.

679
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,260
Which was it?

680
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,220
24 or 25?!

681
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,020
You in a bad mood, Boss?

682
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,380
No!

683
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,940
Didn't think so.

684
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,620
Covered every one within
a mile of the Norfolk

685
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,540
main gate like you said.

686
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,100
What about the other gates?

687
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,940
You didn't ask me to look at...

688
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,940
I'm gonna... I'm on that.

689
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,300
Kate, you go with him.

690
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,020
You want me to go bar-hoppg with Tony?!

691
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,900
You've never been in a bar, have you?

692
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,020
Not the kind sailors hang at.

693
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,940
Agent Gibbs?

694
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,180
You can catch him at the rear elevator.

695
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,780
Agent Gibbs.

696
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,340
You have the note, Petty Officer?

697
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:24,780
I do, sir.

698
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,580
Knowing how important the note
is forensically, I jumped a ride

699
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,460
with a CH-53 that was
headed to Quantico, caught

700
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,300
the Amtrak to D.C., then hailed a cab.

701
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,860
Well, that's creative
thinking, Petty Officer Cluxton.

702
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,220
Thank you, sir.

703
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,060
Are you taking the note to the lab now?

704
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,460
I'm...

705
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,420
pretty interested in forensics, sir.

706
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,020
Tell me you're not serious
about the last place.

707
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,380
Completely serious, Kate.

708
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,940
I mean, strip clubs
are good for more than

709
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,180
just fraternity bashes
and bachelor parties.

710
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,860
You honestly think bar
mitzvahs are appropriate.

711
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,580
Oh, trust me.

712
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,900
Nothing says "welcome to manhood"

713
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,180
as perfectly as a skillful lap dance.

714
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,580
Speaking of...

715
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,700
Hello.

716
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,500
We don't open until 6:00.

717
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,740
And you're working here
instead of catching rays

718
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,980
at the beach in a thong.

719
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,580
I know it's cold out, probably too cold.

720
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,980
You do wear a thong, don't you?

721
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,340
Tony...

722
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,340
Sorry.

723
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:24,900
It's my humor.

724
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,500
Not for everyone.

725
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
NCIS.

726
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,060
Naval Criminal Investigative Service...

727
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,860
Yeah, I know what it means.

728
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,700
What do you want?

729
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,820
Tony...

730
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,540
Well...

731
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,700
Tony.

732
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,860
What?!

733
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,940
This is the girl playing
the drums, isn't it?

734
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,980
Yeah, she hasn't been
here the last three nights.

735
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,020
What happened to her?

736
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,140
Can you tell us her name?

737
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,380
Janice Santos.

738
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,340
She isn't sleeping, is she?

739
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,460
Not sleeping.

740
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,740
Oh, my God.

741
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,660
We need an address.

742
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,020
What happened to her?

743
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,060
She was raped and murdered.

744
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,380
Some man raped and murdered her?

745
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,220
Yeah. It wasn't me.

746
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,620
I'm trying to catch the bastard.

747
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,620
Sorry.

748
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,220
It's just a shock.

749
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,940
Any ideas who could've done this?

750
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,780
No. God, no.

751
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,220
Do you have the address?

752
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,020
Yeah, of course.

753
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,700
I'll get it for you.

754
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,260
She took that hard.

755
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Yeah. She sure did.

756
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,140
The writing looks the same
to me, Special Agent McGee.

757
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,620
It's pretty similar,
Petty Officer Cluxton.

758
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,340
There are slight discrepancies,
within the range that

759
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,020
a person's handwriting
would change in ten years...

760
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,140
Special Agent McGee.

761
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,300
What's this?

762
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,060
Oh, that's a polarizing
light microscope.

763
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,780
Let me show you how to use it.

764
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,220
You touch that, McGee,
you'll be singing soprano.

765
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,780
Yeah, Abby's under a lot of pressure.

766
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,140
What are you doing to the note?

767
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,260
Are you writing a book?

768
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:27,940
No, I'm just...

769
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,260
interested, ma'am.

770
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,900
Looking for prints.

771
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,260
The fumes are from heated super glue.

772
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,500
In its gaseous form,
its bonding capabilities

773
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,940
enable us to obtain fingerprints.

774
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,180
Nothing.

775
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,620
Well...

776
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,700
I'd better get back to Norfolk.

777
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,660
Thanks for letting me observe, ma'am.

778
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,420
Anytime. Well...

779
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,380
not anytime... sometime.

780
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,020
Maybe.

781
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,380
Good seeing you again,
Special Agent McGee.

782
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,540
Likewise, Petty Officer Cluxton.

783
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,140
So, are you two that formal when
you're exchanging bodily fluids?

784
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,860
Stay outside, sir.

785
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,660
Did Janice Santos always
keep the place so empty?

786
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,580
I don't know.

787
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,460
No clothes.

788
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
No personal effects.

789
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,220
This place has been cleaned.

790
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,380
We better call Gibbs.

791
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,660
At least I can tell Duck you've

792
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,340
I.D.'d Jane Doe Number Two.

793
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,780
If her apartment's
that clean, this Janice

794
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,940
Santos probably knew her killer.

795
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,740
Wh you're finished with the crime scene,

796
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,380
bring everything back here.

797
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,380
I'll see you at Abby's in the morning.

798
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,740
DNA processing can take several days,

799
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,100
but knowing the hyper-urgency
of the case, I processed

800
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,620
all of the sperm
samples in just 37 hours.

801
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,900
Gonna be another 37
before we get some results?

802
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,500
Okay, um...

803
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,100
DNA off the first
note matched the sperm.

804
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,100
The killer wrote it.

805
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:30,860
The second note?

806
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,260
No prints. No DNA.

807
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,340
What about the handwriting?

808
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,380
It could be a match.

809
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,980
I sent a copy to an expert I met at

810
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,900
a forensics conference
at the Greenbriar.

811
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,540
It is such a sweet place.

812
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,180
They have golf, tennis, falconry...

813
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,460
Falconry!

814
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,540
I hunted with a falcon
in Scotland in my youth.

815
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,300
It's so cool. Yeah.

816
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,300
It's almost a lost art, I'm afraid.

817
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,980
Like forensics reporting?

818
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,140
Okay... moving on to saliva,
always a crowd pleaser.

819
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,060
There is no way Chief Goetz's DNA
comes close to matching the sperm.

820
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,540
I guess you were right, boss.

821
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,060
You guess?

822
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,940
I know.

823
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,500
Abby, why do you call us all
in here when you have nothing?

824
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,860
But I do!

825
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,100
I matched the DNA off the hair
from the brush McGee gave me.

826
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,780
Hello, Mr. Wilson?

827
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,060
The DNA matches the sperm
found in both victims.

828
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
That's impossible.

829
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,500
Wilson had been dead weeks
when Janice Santos was raped.

830
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,700
DNA does not lie.

831
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,220
Hey.

832
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,900
Hey, he died before
she did, boss, I swear.

833
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,700
Boss, what if...

834
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,660
what if Wilson's semen was inserted in
Janice Santos after she was murdered?

835
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,940
Ew!

836
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,860
How'd the murderer get the semen?

837
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,140
Same way I did.

838
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,340
Looking at the time code, this
is the day before the murder.

839
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,860
What is it, McGee?

840
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,180
She's the one.

841
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,740
Well, how can you tell?

842
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,820
She's not even near the refrigerator.

843
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,940
His gut.

844
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,660
No, no, no, it's not just my gut, boss.

845
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,380
When I was back at Norfolk, Cynthia...

846
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,180
Petty Officer Cluxton
and I, we were friendly.

847
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,940
Really!

848
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,820
Abby...

849
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,260
She liked me, but not that way.

850
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,820
What way would that be, probie?

851
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,540
I didn't ask, Tony, and she didn't tell.

852
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,140
Cluxton's gay?

853
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,180
Boss, we I.D.'d Janice
Santos in a lesbian bar.

854
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,620
There's more.

855
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,500
Petty Officer Cluxton
used her mother's name.

856
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,020
Her father was an NCIS
Agent before he died.

857
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,980
Special Agent Dawes.

858
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,300
Boss, I didn't think about this until...

859
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,780
I think that's her.

860
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,820
That's okay.

861
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,260
Run the tape.

862
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,620
Janice Santos was your lover.

863
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,300
You met her at Flip Side...

864
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,980
a lesbian bar.

865
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,780
Which is why the
bartenderdidn't respond to me.

866
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,100
You accusing me of being gay, sir?

867
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,020
No. No, I'm accusing you of murder.

868
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,900
Murder?

869
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,700
I didn't murder anyone, sir.

870
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,620
She jilt you, Petty Officer?

871
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
I have no idea what
you're talking about, sir.

872
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,420
It doesn't matter.

873
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,020
We have you on tape removing
semen from a Jane Doe case

874
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,420
your father worked ten years ago.

875
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,060
Can you identify on that tape what I'm
removing in the evidence locker, sir?

876
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,740
I can't.

877
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,660
You copied the killer's M.O.

878
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,100
from your father's case file.

879
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,060
I'm not sure where my
father's case files are, sir.

880
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,860
You strangled Janice Santos,
put her in a Navy uniform.

881
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,060
carved a trident in
her neck, inserted semen

882
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,900
from the first murder in her vagina.

883
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,140
Not true.

884
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,580
None of it, sir.

885
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,820
Even left a note like the one
found at the first crime scene.

886
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,620
I didn't leave that note, I found it.

887
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,780
So, who killed Janice Santos?

888
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,180
Obviously, whoever murdered
the Jane Doe ten years ago, sir.

889
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,820
No, not whoever.

890
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,700
His name is Harlan Wilson.

891
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,980
A former machinist's
mate stationed at Norfolk.

892
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,060
You caught him, sir.

893
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,900
No.

894
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,260
No, but we matched his DNA to
semen found in both victims.

895
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,300
Why are you accusing me?

896
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,620
Harlan Wilson died five weeks
before you killed Janice.

897
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:47,980
Damn...

898
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,420
damn...

899
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,740
damn!

900
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,020
It's time for our relationship
to change, my dear.

901
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,260
It's time for you to go home,

902
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,060
but it's not the home
you knew in this life.

903
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,740
But I think you'll find peace here.

904
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,780
And the way things
turned out, so will I.
