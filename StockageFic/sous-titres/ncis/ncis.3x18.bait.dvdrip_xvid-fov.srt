1
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:10,767
Hey! Hey!

2
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,208
You got a problem with living?

3
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,725
You feeling frisky today, Meyers?

4
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,168
Make your move.

5
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:21,926
l'm begging you.

6
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:26,208
Didn't think so.

7
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:41,650
- Kody, are you okay?
- Oh, look, he's following me.

8
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:43,850
- l think he's in love.
- Come on, guys.

9
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,288
Hey! No!

10
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:56,448
No one else leaves.

11
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:59,129
Okay!

12
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:51,809
Oh, my God. Hurry up.

13
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,843
Gibbs is already on the scene.
You two follow my lead.

14
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,574
lt's not my first time
at this particular kind of dance.

15
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,133
Yeah, l've been
to a few myself, Tony.

16
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:03,852
Know what,
l play <i>Counter Strike</i> online.

17
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:05,083
lt's pretty realistic.

18
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,814
Well, you only get one
life here, Elf Lord.

19
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,687
Kid's in a classroom
in the south wing.

20
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,810
SRT's set up a command post
in the east wing.

21
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:16,250
McGee, Ziva, recon the exterior.
Put the gear down.

22
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:18,973
DiNozzo. With me.

23
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,413
On your six, boss.

24
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:30,767
Target's name is Kody Meyers,
1 5 years old.

25
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,447
According to the witness,
he came to class

26
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,366
with a bomb strapped to his chest.

27
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,286
We set a perimeter
outside the classroom.

28
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,092
Evacuated all nonessentials.

29
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,051
EOD's on site
sweeping for secondaries.

30
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:41,727
- How many hostages?
- Four, maybe five.

31
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,532
Men are doing a head count
on the student body.

32
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:45,412
The witness describe the device?

33
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:48,134
She was rushed to emergency
being treated for a panic attack.

34
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,613
DiNozzo, find out who
Kody Meyers is.

35
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,412
- Get his parents in here.
- On it.

36
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:53,326
- He try to make contact?
- No, sir. Not a word.

37
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,052
We didn't try to
establish communication.

38
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:56,886
Figured that was your job.

39
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,283
Ziva.

40
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,687
Ziva!

41
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,530
l am here. We need to be stealthy.

42
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,844
New shoes.

43
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,049
- l'm going to that transformer.
- Okay.

44
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,291
l meant alone.

45
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:33,886
Got you.

46
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:55,291
Come on, boy. Show me your bomb.

47
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:17,972
- lt's okay.
- Stop doing that.

48
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,607
l can't help it.

49
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,323
You gotta try.

50
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,203
What, what's wrong with her?

51
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,727
She has asthma, Kody.

52
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,165
What does she need?
Water or something?

53
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,892
She needs her inhaler.

54
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:42,934
- lt's not here. Where is it?
- My locker.

55
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:50,009
Classroom's around the corner,
second door on the right.

56
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:51,926
The rooms can only be locked
with a faculty key.

57
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,322
Kody wouldn't have access.

58
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,566
My TAC team is ready to go.

59
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,406
Snipers are moving
into position outside.

60
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:01,488
lf you wanna take him down.

61
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:04,805
- Any other way into the room?
- One door and a wall of windows.

62
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,442
Blueprints are on their way
so we can check for ducts.

63
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,967
Boss!

64
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,690
- Sorry.
- <i>Come.</i>

65
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:32,283
l found Kody's father.

66
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,126
He was at a conference
in Washington D.C.

67
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,807
MPs are escorting him now.

68
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:38,613
l just thought you'd want
to know before you go in there.

69
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,333
l'll head back now.

70
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,572
Kody Meyers.
Special Agent Gibbs, NClS.

71
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,772
- Kody.
- Get away from the door.

72
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,448
- Talk to me first.
- Get away from the door

73
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:57,933
or l blow this thing!

74
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,166
All right.

75
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,894
- l'm sending someone out.
- l'll be right back.

76
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,806
Make sure you're the one
who brings it back, okay?

77
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,451
l'm coming out!

78
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,084
Debrief her.

79
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,006
lt's okay.

80
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,207
- l need to get Nadia's inhaler.
- We're getting it.

81
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:40,887
- She needs it.
- That's what we're doing.

82
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,487
- She can't breathe!
- Stephanie,

83
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,010
we're getting it
from her locker, okay?

84
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:48,086
Tell me what happened.

85
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,810
l was in homeroom

86
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:55,763
and l heard Joe messing
with Kody.

87
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,453
And then all of a sudden
it got really quiet

88
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:04,653
and l looked up
and Kody unzipped his sweatshirt.

89
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:08,851
And he had a bomb!

90
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,732
- Okay, what kind of bomb?
- Like in the movies.

91
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,249
lt was strapped to his chest.

92
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:15,974
Okay, that's really good, Stephanie.

93
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:17,933
Was he calm?

94
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,252
He was acting really weird. He--

95
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,767
He was talking to himself.

96
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,652
Okay.

97
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:28,485
- What about Nadia?
- We're helping her.

98
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,690
That's what we're doing right now.

99
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:35,810
Okay, all right. l know this is hard.

100
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:38,408
Stephanie, l need you to hold it
together, can you do that?

101
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,328
Okay.

102
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,008
Tell me a little bit about Kody.

103
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:47,483
He transferred this year.

104
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,885
He's like a loner.

105
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:52,729
The football players,
they'd screw with him.

106
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:55,408
- But they screw with everyone.
- Okay.

107
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:57,884
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:02,086
- ls that what this is about?
- Could be.

109
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,283
He's gonna blow everyone up!

110
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:06,853
No, he's not.

111
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,893
Stephanie, it's gonna be okay.

112
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,527
Boss, l got the inhaler.

113
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,768
- See?
- l have to take it to her!

114
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:19,004
That's what he said.
He said l have to get the inhaler

115
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,165
- and l have to bring it to her.
- We'll take it to her.

116
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,370
- She needs it!
- Okay, calm down.

117
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:27,004
- DiNozzo, get her a drink.
- You got it.

118
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,324
Okay, so we'll get you some water.

119
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,004
Boss, you're not really gonna
send her back in there, are you?

120
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,009
Of course not. You've got a plan.

121
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:43,208
- What exactly--?
- Got background on Kody yet?

122
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:45,923
l do. Searched the school records.

123
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:48,289
He's an average student,
member of the chess club.

124
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:53,050
- He's also in junior UN.
- Background that's useful, McGee?

125
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:55,808
We've got a team now at Kody's
house collecting his computer,

126
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:58,488
personal effects, to transport back
to Abby's lab.

127
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,127
l'm gonna go back there
and supervise.

128
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,049
Okay.

129
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,645
What is this? Robby the robot?

130
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:19,966
Sort of. lt can climb stairs,
negotiate corners, unlock doors.

131
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:22,568
lmpressive.
Will it convince Kody to surrender?

132
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:25,407
No. But it will deliver the inhaler
to the sick student

133
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,405
without endangering anybody else.

134
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:29,565
And its camera might get
a video of the bomb.

135
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,532
l don't trust anything
controlled by a videogame thing.

136
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:34,366
l've seen one
of these cross a minefield

137
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,445
while under heavy fire in lraq,
Agent Gibbs.

138
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,605
How long until this POC
is ready, captain?

139
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:42,849
There's a problem with the software,
just have to run a quick diagnostic--

140
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:47,249
- Twenty minutes?
- We don't have 20 minutes.

141
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:56,452
Ziva,

142
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:57,967
tell Tony channel two.

143
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,123
Channel two.

144
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,004
What the hell are you doing?

145
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,404
- Nadia's inhaler.
- Stephanie's supposed to bring it!

146
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,690
- Where's Stephanie?
- Safe.

147
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:33,048
No.

148
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:36,650
- This is all wrong.
- Give this to Nadia. l'll make it right.

149
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:38,486
l'm in charge here! Not you!

150
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:41,847
- You're in charge, Kody.
- Get Stephanie back in here!

151
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,289
Not gonna do that.

152
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,130
You're killing everyone!

153
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,766
l'm not the one wearing the bomb.

154
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:55,132
l am giving this inhaler
to Nadia now.

155
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,606
Better?

156
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:07,933
She's fine, now get out!

157
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:09,686
l'm a valuable hostage, Kody.

158
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,492
More valuable than a room
full of kids?

159
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,292
Get out now or we all die!

160
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,968
You're surrounded by Marines
who all think you're crazy.

161
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:19,844
Kody, l'm the last chance
you have of getting out of here alive.

162
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:22,889
Shut the door.

163
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,852
Search him.

164
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,285
Like they do on <i>Cops.</i>

165
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,852
Empty his pockets.

166
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,330
Now l know why Gibbs
didn't go armed.

167
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,291
- Where's Stephanie?
- With her folks.

168
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,410
<i>Check his ankles.</i>

169
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,731
- This kid is pretty smart.
- He's not just smart. He's trained.

170
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:57,249
- <i>Put everything on the desk.</i>
- This could be a statement.

171
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,166
- <i>Come on!</i>
- He's a 1 5-year-old kid.

172
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,087
Well, l've seen 1 2-year-old
suicide bombers in lsrael.

173
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,052
- He's not a terrorist.
- He's obviously mentally disturbed.

174
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,411
- And if that's the case, well, l think--
- l know, it's not good.

175
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,528
He's clean, Kody.

176
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:16,250
- Check his ears.
- For what?

177
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:17,972
Do it.

178
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,209
The guy's wearing
some sort of hearing aide.

179
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,646
Take it out.

180
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:32,809
Check his wrists.

181
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,088
Step on both of them.

182
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:55,810
He's very well-trained.

183
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,846
We need eyes in that classroom.

184
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:04,731
SRT snaked cameras through
the vents here and here.

185
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,283
Both were taped shut.
Kody was covering his plates.

186
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,332
Bases. What about that door?

187
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,566
Now, make sure
you cover every crack.

188
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:16,123
Okay, l'm on it.

189
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,203
You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

190
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:32,365
l think it's safe to say that Kody's
got some suicidal tendencies.

191
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,172
You should see his webpage.

192
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,131
lt's all about death and dying.

193
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,764
- The kid is obsessed.
- So what's your point?

194
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:42,687
My point is he finally worked up
the nerve to do something about it.

195
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,812
lt's not the kids that talk about dying
that you have to worry about, Timmy.

196
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,043
it's the ones who stay quiet.

197
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:50,251
Abby, l've been in this kid's room,
okay? lt's all black.

198
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,723
lt's got skulls everywhere.
He listens to death metal.

199
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:57,407
There is nothing wrong
with those things if you are an adult.

200
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:02,372
McGee, you slaughter people online.

201
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,172
Are you gonna become
a mass murderer?

202
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,404
l did not take
my classroom hostage.

203
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,804
Yeah. Did you ever think about it?

204
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:13,803
You said the bomb-sniffing dogs didn't
alert to anything in Cody's house.

205
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:17,933
l haven't found explosive markers
on any of his clothing or his effects.

206
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,847
He didn't visit
any bomb-making websites.

207
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:25,053
And these photos,
they show us nothing.

208
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:29,443
Maybe his bomb is fake.

209
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,851
Do you believe that?

210
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,526
No.

211
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,091
We can end this now, Kody. Tell me
what you want. l'll get it for you.

212
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,449
l'm not making demands
until l speak to a negotiator.

213
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,443
- l am the negotiator.
- They wouldn't send a negotiator

214
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,206
busting through the door.
l'm not stupid.

215
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,842
- No one says you are.
- Just be quiet. Hurry up!

216
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:59,130
- Relax, Kody.
- Stop saying my name!

217
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,006
You're not gonna build
a relationship with me.

218
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:05,086
So keep talking
and l really will end this now.

219
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:14,651
Nadia. Nadia, you have to stop that,
please. Please?

220
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:19,205
- l can't. Kody, l can't.
- She's scared, Kody.

221
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,093
- Yeah, like she's the only one.
- You're right. We're all scared.

222
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,210
They just wanna go home
and see their parents.

223
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:25,932
You expect me to identify with them.

224
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:28,369
See them as people. Make it
harder for me to do anything.

225
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:32,447
- They are people, Kody.
- Stop saying my name!

226
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:33,888
One more word,

227
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,092
l press this button.

228
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,888
Director Shepard,
Dr. Mallard's here to see you.

229
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,248
Send him in, Cynthia.

230
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,249
Anything new?

231
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,607
l just got off the phone
with DiNozzo. Still no contact.

232
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:59,005
- What exactly happened?
- Jethro happened, Ducky.

233
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,324
He went in to deliver
a sick girl's inhaler,

234
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:05,203
- and got invited to stay.
- Yeah, but how could he--? Of course.

235
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:08,730
- He probably planned the whole thing.
- Jethro doesn't plan, Ducky.

236
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,532
He follows his damn gut.

237
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:12,765
Well, it usually serves him well.

238
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,573
lt also gets him into trouble.

239
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,804
You would only be a hindrance
down there.

240
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:22,444
- What makes you think--?
- You're wearing your sidearm.

241
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:27,729
Gibbs was my partner, Ducky.
For a long time.

242
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,328
l cannot just sit by here
and do nothing.

243
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:34,043
Well, of course not.
Nobody expects you to do nothing.

244
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:39,092
Cynthia?

245
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:44,723
l want a direct feed into DiNozzo's
command post, ASAP.

246
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:48,284
- Yes, director.
- That is a good decision, director.

247
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:51,730
l'll believe that, Ducky,
when the situation is defused.

248
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,891
Right.

249
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,612
WWGD?

250
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,253
ls that a weapons acronym?

251
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,406
No.

252
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,405
lt stands for
''What Would Gibbs Do?''

253
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:12,134
Well, it's too bad we can't ask him.

254
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,565
Captain, your teams are in place?

255
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,486
We've got three snipers
in position, sir.

256
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:20,771
- lf the target looks out the blinds--
- No one takes a shot unless l clear it.

257
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:21,969
You're with me.

258
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:25,206
- Where are you going?
- Talk to Kody.

259
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:30,367
You wanna stay away
from the windows, Kody.

260
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:35,250
What, because the snipers?
They won't shoot a kid.

261
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,609
l wouldn't count on that.

262
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,685
lt's not too late to fix this.

263
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:48,168
You're gonna reason with me?
Go ahead. No, really. Go ahead.

264
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,768
Convince me l'm not in trouble.

265
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:55,448
No. You're in trouble.
How much is up to you.

266
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,045
What did you just do?

267
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:02,444
- Nothing. Just stretching my arms.
- You just did something! What was it?

268
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:05,089
Kody, this is Special Agent DiNozzo.

269
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,369
How's Nadia?

270
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,607
- She's fine for now.
- How are the other kids?

271
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:13,652
- They're fine, okay?
- l'd love to take your word on that.

272
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,453
But l'm gonna need some proof,
Kody. Open the door.

273
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:20,607
No! No way! You try and get in here
l'm setting this off!

274
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:25,325
No one's coming in. l'd like to speak
to Special Agent Gibbs.

275
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:28,124
Everybody's okay, boss.

276
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,284
Well, that's good to hear,
Special Agent Gibbs.

277
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:35,412
- Your agent says he's a negotiator.
- Well, that's right. He's my best man.

278
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,883
Your best man's a moron
for getting caught in here.

279
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:39,646
He always had an attitude problem.

280
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,171
We're all gonna work
on this together.

281
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:48,132
- What do you say to that, Kody?
- You know, l want the man in charge.

282
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,854
Not the field commander. The one
who makes the final decision.

283
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:52,367
That's me, Kody.

284
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:54,126
lf l ask for a plane
and a million dollars,

285
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:55,409
you just give it to me?

286
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,724
- ls that what you want?
- Answer my question!

287
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:03,647
- l'll make some calls.
- Are you the man or not?

288
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,564
l'm the one you want.

289
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,011
Bring my mother to the classroom.

290
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:19,371
No deals, no stalling.
You have until sundown.

291
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:23,090
lf you can't do that,

292
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,093
then everyone dies.

293
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,969
- l want to see my son.
- That's not happening, major.

294
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,568
- The hell it's not!
- Calm down.

295
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,485
l need to see he's okay.

296
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,849
Aside from holding five people
hostage, he's doing great.

297
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,244
- What does Kody want?
- He wants his mother brought to him.

298
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:46,803
- Oh, God.
- What?

299
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,372
Kody's mother is dead.

300
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,372
She died a year ago.

301
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,808
A boating accident.

302
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,602
Angela liked sailing.

303
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,687
Kody took it--
Well, we all took it hard.

304
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,414
- Clearly.
- Kody's had some difficulties,

305
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:14,893
but he's never acted out before.

306
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,967
Your son strapped a bomb to his
chest, kidnapped his homeroom

307
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,806
and is demanding
to see his dead mother.

308
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,124
l'd say he's past
the acting out stage, major.

309
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:23,807
- And frankly--
- Let me talk to him.

310
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,090
l can calm him down.
l can get him out of there.

311
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:28,688
Contact with you
may only exacerbate the situation.

312
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,414
He's my son.
He's having a breakdown.

313
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:33,724
His mind is playing tricks on him.

314
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,122
Tricks? What kind of tricks?

315
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:40,045
Listen, if this is gonna end well,

316
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,523
we need all the intel
you can give us on your son.

317
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:47,370
Kody thought he saw his mother
a couple of months ago.

318
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:49,365
- Alive?
- His therapist said

319
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:52,094
it's completely normal,
a coping mechanism.

320
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:54,688
A lot of people imagine
seeing dead loved ones.

321
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,687
Well, it's the part
where he wants to talk to her

322
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:59,446
that's got us a little worried.

323
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:02,533
l saw the SRT teams
outside the school.

324
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,845
l know what comes next.

325
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:12,527
l'm begging you,
please, give my boy a chance.

326
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:16,450
We'll do everything we can to get all
those kids out of there safely, major.

327
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:18,889
All of them, including your son.

328
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,726
Thank you.

329
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:28,772
There are easier ways
to see your mother, Kody.

330
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,653
lt's none of your business.

331
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:33,203
You made it my business
when you threatened their lives.

332
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:39,050
- lt's not up to me, okay?
- Well, who's it up to, Kody?

333
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:44,844
You can't fix this.

334
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:48,563
- No one can fix this.
- l don't wanna fix it.

335
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:49,928
l wanna end it.

336
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,210
You just have the answers
for everything, don't you?

337
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,127
No! No! Don't touch me!

338
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,727
Kody, is something wrong in there?

339
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,851
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Giving you an update.

340
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,289
l wanna let you know
that Special Agent Caitlin Todd

341
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:04,569
is out looking for your mom.

342
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,929
Don't come back until you find her!

343
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:10,564
- l won't tell you again!
- All right, l'm going.

344
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,962
How are you gonna tell Gibbs
the kid's mom's dead?

345
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,169
l already did.

346
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,165
Special Agent Todd is dead.

347
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,325
- DiNozzo.
- <i>Hold for the director.</i>

348
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:24,531
He wants his dead mother
brought to the classroom?

349
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,889
<i>He won't accept she's dead.</i>
<i>Thinks he saw her recently.</i>

350
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,204
lt's not an unusual fantasy in grief.

351
00:22:29,374 --> 00:22:31,092
That's an impossible demand.

352
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,324
<i>l know, director. l'm working on it.</i>

353
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:36,054
Define working on it,
Agent DiNozzo.

354
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:39,012
SRT's in place, working on getting
visual access into the room

355
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,324
- and a way to contact Gibbs.
- <i>And?</i>

356
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,008
- And we're just getting started.
- <i>What's your deadline?</i>

357
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:46,563
Sundown. About five hours.

358
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,647
How powerful is the bomb?

359
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:50,289
Don't know yet.

360
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,332
Sciuto and Agent McGee
are going through the kid's computer

361
00:22:53,494 --> 00:22:56,531
and everything found in his room,
trying to work out what the explosive is.

362
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:58,252
Does he have a dead-man switch?

363
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,644
Hoping Sciuto and McGee
can tell us that.

364
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:02,413
And if he doesn't?

365
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:06,532
- You want me to take him out.
- lt may be your only option.

366
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:07,968
<i>l'd like to get them all alive,</i>

367
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,886
- including Kody.
- <i>l agree.</i>

368
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,932
But if it's not possible,
l need to know that you're capable

369
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:14,163
of making the call.

370
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,212
- l've done it before.
- <i>On a 1 5-year-old?</i>

371
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,205
<i>lf the time comes,</i>

372
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:22,332
you cannot hesitate.
You cannot second guess yourself.

373
00:23:22,494 --> 00:23:24,405
lf you don't trust me,
l suggest you relieve me.

374
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:26,804
Otherwise, leave me alone.
l've got work to do, ma'am.

375
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,207
She asked if you had
the calzones for this, yes?

376
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,527
<i>Cojones.</i>

377
00:23:39,574 --> 00:23:41,166
Do you?

378
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:46,531
- Gibbs has rubbed off on him.
- Well, that's a positive thing.

379
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:50,130
- He isn't Gibbs, Ducky.
- No, but he's very capable.

380
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,968
- The boy's mother?
- Yes.

381
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:56,409
Cynthia?

382
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,929
- <i>Ma'am?</i>
- l need the NClS case file

383
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,972
on the drowning of
Marine dependent Angela Meyers.

384
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:04,125
- <i>Right away, ma'am.</i>
- What are you up to?

385
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:08,493
The boy wants his mother.
We may have to give her to him.

386
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:19,414
There is no way that kid assembled
that bomb at his house.

387
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:20,689
Which means?

388
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:26,847
Which means he either made it
somewhere else,

389
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:30,086
or someone helped him.
What do you think?

390
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,846
Sounds good.

391
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,007
- What? What was that for?
- Not paying attention to me.

392
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,483
l'm trying to tell you
l think there's more kids out there.

393
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:40,168
- This could be part of a larger plan.
- l don't think so.

394
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,768
Kody believes his mother
is still alive. Look at this.

395
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,526
He's sending her photo
all over the web,

396
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:48,084
asking if anyone's seen her.
He expects us to find her.

397
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,846
This could be a good thing.

398
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:52,289
There were no traces
of explosives at his house.

399
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,569
No bomb-making materials.

400
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:57,329
There were no plans or schematics
for construction on his computer.

401
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:00,327
The bomb has got to be
a fake. l hope.

402
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,126
- Oh, wow.
- Wow, what?

403
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,603
lt would help if you could get
a better look at it, right?

404
00:25:05,774 --> 00:25:07,765
- How we gonna do that?
- Look. Three computers

405
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,129
- in the back of the classroom.
- With webcams and mics.

406
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:12,524
- All we have to do is hack in.
- We'll have eyes and ears

407
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:14,412
and we can see the bomb.

408
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:18,207
- Hey!
- Should've thought of that hours ago.

409
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,613
- Don't be gentle.
- l am not gonna hit you.

410
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,129
- Come on. l deserve it.
- No.

411
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,406
Elf Lord.

412
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,566
- l don't see squat, probie.
- Tony, are your laptops even on?

413
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,087
Probie, now is not the time.

414
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:41,326
Wait, Tony. lt's on our end, okay?
lt's still buffering.

415
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:45,085
- <i>That should do it.</i>
- You are amazing, Abby.

416
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,973
Actually, that was my idea--
Would you stop doing that?

417
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,570
<i>Hey, cut that out!</i>

418
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:54,447
Why is it so hot in here?

419
00:25:56,694 --> 00:25:58,412
You can walk away from this.

420
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:03,167
Do you have any idea what they'll
do to me if l walk out of this building?

421
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,403
No one will touch you.

422
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:06,929
- You have no idea.
- l won't let them, Kody.

423
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:18,524
What'd you--? What'd you just do?

424
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:20,207
What just--? What just happened?

425
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:22,205
- l don't--
- She dropped her inhaler.

426
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,366
Let Nadia go, Kody.

427
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:29,604
As a sign of good faith
while we look for your mom.

428
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:33,971
No one leaves! Do you get this?

429
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:43,011
Electrical blasting caps
wired into a central circuit board.

430
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:46,246
Four visible charges,
all equipped with nails

431
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:50,407
to inflict maximum shrapnel damage.
This is no fake bomb, Tony.

432
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:55,286
Good news. The detonator appears
to be remote in his hand.

433
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:57,410
- Good news?
- Well, it doesn't seem

434
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,246
to be a dead-man's switch.

435
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:02,963
A head shot will stop
this without setting off the bomb.

436
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:06,013
Just like that.

437
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,683
- Head shot.
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:26,290
Tell me about your mom, Kody.

439
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,449
- Doesn't she wanna see you?
- Don't say that.

440
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:34,687
l'm just wondering why
you're threatening to blow all of us up

441
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,924
just to see her.

442
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,328
Because l-- l do, okay?

443
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:45,293
She's dead, Kody.

444
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:48,446
l know.

445
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:55,333
l know l saw her. Shut up!
Shut up! Just--

446
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,128
Target acquired.

447
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,770
<i>l say again, target is acquired.</i>

448
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,930
We may not get
another chance, sir.

449
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:16,246
Do l have a go? Over.

450
00:28:17,974 --> 00:28:19,612
Tony?

451
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:21,727
The shot is still good, sir. Over.

452
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:23,771
Sir, we're gonna lose the target.

453
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,570
He's not a target.
He's a 1 5-year-old boy

454
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:31,010
who misses his mom.
All sniper units stand down.

455
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,209
<i>Do not take the shot.</i>

456
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:34,285
All units stand down.

457
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:37,491
- Why?
- lt's a Gibbs thing.

458
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,486
My gut.

459
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,644
Stop! Don't! What are you doing?
Just get away from me!

460
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:07,610
- He's signing.
- What's he saying?

461
00:29:07,774 --> 00:29:09,651
l can't tell.
He's not being obvious about it.

462
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,571
Wait.

463
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:18,687
Puppet.

464
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:24,093
Yes.

465
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:27,966
- Puppet. What does that mean?
- l don't know.

466
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,322
Wait, not puppet. lt's marionette.

467
00:29:31,494 --> 00:29:34,531
He's saying that somebody's pulling
Kody's strings.

468
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:38,289
- What, like controlling him?
- Not just controlling him, McGee.

469
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:39,682
Controlling the bomb.

470
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:53,406
lf somebody's controlling Kody,
they have to be talking to him.

471
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,163
- Earwig!
- Earwig!

472
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,006
Ask Gibbs.

473
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:00,769
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

474
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:04,327
Send it now.

475
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:13,167
- <i>Why'd you just nod?</i>
- What?

476
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,369
- <i>You just nodded.</i>
- <i>Did l?</i>

477
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,013
- <i>Yes!</i>
- How did he see that?

478
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:18,927
- His back was to Gibbs.
- <i>l don't know. Nervous? Jumpy?</i>

479
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,209
l guess.

480
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,486
Are you signalling someone
in this room?

481
00:30:23,814 --> 00:30:25,088
No.

482
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,292
l swear.

483
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,806
They're not just talking to Kody.

484
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,363
They have eyes
in the classroom too, McGee.

485
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,286
- Tony, did you copy that?
- <i>Roger.</i>

486
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:38,684
Dirtbags have eyes
and ears in the classroom.

487
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:40,287
Good.

488
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:43,643
- Good?
- We backtrack the feeds.

489
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:45,964
- lt'll lead us to them.
- Earwigs have a limited range

490
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:48,807
and only a handful of frequencies. We
have the equipment here to sweep.

491
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,453
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,163
Get the equipment.
Set up for a frequency sweep.

493
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,369
Abby, SRT is sweeping

494
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:55,762
<i>earwig freqs to trace the source.</i>

495
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,413
<i>Can you do the same thing</i>
<i>with the eyes?</i>

496
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,132
- McGee?
- We got three computers

497
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:02,127
with webcams in the back of the
classroom. We're using one of them.

498
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,012
- They must be using--
- The blocked router.

499
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:05,732
- The one we couldn't get into.
- How long?

500
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:08,772
Depends. They could be using
counter attack software.

501
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,004
<i>lf they're using</i>
<i>a sophisticated encryption system,</i>

502
00:31:11,174 --> 00:31:12,766
it could be 1 28, even 256 bit--

503
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:14,208
- <i>Probie.</i>
- On it, boss.

504
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:17,252
Tony.

505
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,004
- What?
- He called me boss.

506
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:26,530
- Yeah, he'll never live that down.
- Nope.

507
00:31:32,294 --> 00:31:35,172
What happens if they can't find
your mom, Kody?

508
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:38,927
You know what will happen.

509
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,608
- Kody, just let us go, man.
- Shut up!

510
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:48,811
Just don't ask me that again.
Okay, Nadia?

511
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,530
Okay.

512
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,889
You don't want to carry out
your threat, do you, Kody?

513
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,413
No.

514
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,848
But l will
if l don't talk to my mother.

515
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:07,171
Talk or see? We might have time--

516
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:10,053
See! See! l have to see her right here
in my homeroom!

517
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,444
l'm saying that talking to her
might give us more time.

518
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,525
There is no more time, okay?

519
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:17,572
She has to be here before sunset!

520
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:25,410
Nautical, civilian or astronomical?

521
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:29,086
What?

522
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:32,370
Which sunset? There are three.

523
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:35,093
Before it gets dark.

524
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:37,452
Astronomical.

525
00:32:38,934 --> 00:32:41,243
- How's it coming, captain?
- Narrowing it down.

526
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,563
l can't stand doing nothing
while everyone else is working.

527
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,213
Well, then do something.

528
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:52,326
- Any suggestions, Ziva?
- Yes, DiNozzo.

529
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,330
We didn't really have time
to question Major Meyers.

530
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:57,610
He may be able to tell us
who's controlling his son.

531
00:32:59,214 --> 00:33:01,648
Captain, have your men bring
Major Meyers in here.

532
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,327
That's gonna be a problem.

533
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,485
The major was taken
to NClS Headquarters.

534
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,007
l didn't authorize that.

535
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:08,607
No, sir. Your boss did.

536
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,844
My boss is a hostage right now.

537
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,845
l don't think he's authorizing
much of anything.

538
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,406
- Not that boss, sir.
- He's the only boss l have.

539
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:20,492
You are forgetting the director.

540
00:33:22,054 --> 00:33:25,410
l'm an amphibious warfare instructor
at Command and Staff, Quantico.

541
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:27,724
Are you involved
in anything sensitive?

542
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:29,088
You mean like secret?

543
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:33,725
No. What does this have to do
with my son?

544
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:35,691
Someone is controlling him.

545
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:41,254
- So this isn't his idea?
- l doubt it.

546
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,168
Thank God.

547
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,132
He still has a bomb
strapped to his chest.

548
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:47,973
Yeah.

549
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:50,928
Why would they have him
asking for his mother?

550
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,005
l have no idea.

551
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:56,727
- How long did you know her?
- Since college.

552
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:59,613
We were married 1 8 years
when she died.

553
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:02,368
- What did she do?
- Grade school teacher.

554
00:34:03,654 --> 00:34:07,806
Look, Angela had no dark side.
She loved me. She loved Kody.

555
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:11,967
Whoever's doing this must have her
confused with someone else.

556
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:15,007
You're probably right.

557
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:19,450
Thank you for your cooperation,
major.

558
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:23,169
What are you gonna do?

559
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:26,411
Get him out alive.

560
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:27,963
Thank you.

561
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:38,206
You really think this is a bizarre case
of mistaken identity?

562
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:39,853
Doesn't really matter.

563
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:42,926
Every scenario plays out
exactly the same.

564
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:47,167
The only way this can end well
is if we find Angela Meyers.

565
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:51,525
And if she is dead?

566
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,210
The detonator
in Kody's hand is a prop.

567
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,365
The people controlling him
have the real one.

568
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:01,094
- You think?
- Yes.

569
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:04,849
l think shooting Kody wouldn't have
saved anybody in that classroom.

570
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,282
Doesn't make you Gibbs.

571
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,885
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to raise Angela Myers from the grave.

572
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:17,251
Well, obviously he, she
or they don't believe she's dead.

573
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:20,292
They intend to kill her
with a big boom.

574
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,728
And blame it all on Kody.

575
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:24,010
- Got the freq on Kody's earwig.
- Where are they?

576
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:26,483
Don't know.
They're communicating in short bursts.

577
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,007
We can't get an accurate fix.

578
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:32,450
The sunset <i>esta muy hermosa</i>, Kody.
Enjoy it.

579
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:35,407
<i>lt will be your last</i>
<i>if your mama doesn't show.</i>

580
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:37,804
Look, we're running out of time.
Where's my mother?

581
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:40,010
Let me talk to my boss.
l'll get a progress report.

582
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,643
<i>Okay, put the cell phone</i>
<i>on speaker.</i>

583
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:49,446
Do it. Put it on speaker.

584
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:55,972
- DiNozzo.
- <i>Hey, boss,</i>

585
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,045
<i>you locate Kody's mother yet?</i>

586
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:01,487
Agent Todd has her phone number
and is trying to make contact.

587
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,326
- <i>Get the number!</i>
- What is the number?

588
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,810
l don't know, Kody.
Agent Todd is on it.

589
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:08,329
- <i>Get the number!</i>
- l want the number!

590
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,165
Better get him the number, boss.

591
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:13,564
l'll contact Agent Todd
and get back to you.

592
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:17,213
You had to say
you had her number?

593
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:18,689
l know.

594
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:21,493
- l know, it wasn't--
- A mistake Gibbs would have made?

595
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:28,010
Sir, EOD's been studying
the pictures of the bomb vest.

596
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:30,688
This is the remote to the detonator.
One shot could destroy it.

597
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:31,969
And Kody.

598
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:33,613
There's more than one life
at stake here.

599
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,571
Okay, okay.

600
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:40,131
McGee, tell me
you're making progress.

601
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:41,727
We are making progress, Tony.

602
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:44,806
Back-tracing their connection
to the classroom computer now.

603
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,205
Okay, they're in Triangle, Virginia.

604
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,126
Piggybacking off a wi-fi node

605
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,046
at the warehouse
outside the main gate.

606
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:53,250
l'm sending you the address.
Do you want us to cut

607
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,245
<i>their connection to the webcam?</i>

608
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:59,010
Negative, probie.
l got a better idea.

609
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,124
You know what, Tony?
This might actually work.

610
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,172
- Don't sound so surprised, probie.
- He's right, Tony.

611
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,484
We should have thought of it.

612
00:37:14,654 --> 00:37:16,724
- <i>What the hell was that?</i>
- McGee tripped.

613
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:19,772
<i>Trip on your own time, probie.</i>
<i>Can you make it happen or not?</i>

614
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,209
The problem is finding
the right stream to mirror, Tony.

615
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,126
We'll need to re-create
a virtual hard drive--

616
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,488
To replace the physical one.

617
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:27,485
<i>The key is the insertion phase,</i>
<i>we're gonna need</i>--

618
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:30,088
A natural buffering period
so we won't be detected.

619
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:32,688
- Using a standard codex--
- Means we'll be able to retag

620
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:34,367
the algorithm during decompression.

621
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:35,853
<i>What we need is a multi-point</i>

622
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:39,973
- control unit to enable a seamless--
- <i>Guys, phys ed major here.</i>

623
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:43,332
- We can do this, Tony.
- <i>When?</i>

624
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:46,527
- Now if you want.
- <i>On my mark. DiNozzo out.</i>

625
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,128
What was that one for?

626
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:53,092
Pissing off Tony. Can't you tell
he's under a lot of pressure?

627
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,167
<i>Answer it.</i>

628
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,167
- We're here.
- <i>Kody, Agent DiNozzo here.</i>

629
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,531
<i>l have some good news.</i>
<i>We have your mom.</i>

630
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:18,528
- You found her?
- <i>Yes, we did.</i>

631
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:20,844
<i>She's being escorted</i>
<i>onto the base as we speak.</i>

632
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:23,164
<i>She should be at the school</i>
<i>in 20 minutes, you sit tight,</i>

633
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,245
<i>we'll have a happy ending here.</i>

634
00:38:29,294 --> 00:38:30,613
<i>Okay, probie, now!</i>

635
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:33,485
Do you actually think
this is gonna work?

636
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,006
lf l tell you,
are you gonna hit me again?

637
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:38,132
Yeah.

638
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,764
Yeah.
l think it's actually gonna work.

639
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,126
lt has to.

640
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:52,451
Do you hear those sirens, Kody?
You might just survive this after all.

641
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:19,567
Hi.

642
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:25,092
Not bad, DiNozzo. Not bad at all.

643
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:29,402
That was brilliant, Tony.

644
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,610
Looping the classroom video
to the bad guys

645
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:35,164
- while you evac'ed the kids.
- She's right. lt was a great idea, Tony.

646
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,209
- Hey!
- Boss.

647
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,966
lt was a great idea, boss.

648
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,887
- Slip of the tongue, okay?
- Freudian slip of the tongue.

649
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:47,012
Give it up, McGee.
Some things Tony never forgets.

650
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:51,645
That's true. So, Tony, what movie
gave you the big idea?

651
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:53,486
- Movie?
- Yeah.

652
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:55,849
You know, making the video
of the classroom

653
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:57,811
to feed back to the bad guys?

654
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,645
lt just kind of came to me, actually.

655
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,931
l saw it! They had these terrorists.

656
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,531
Half the movies today
are about terrorists.

657
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:11,367
No, no, no. And they took over
this bus, and it starred

658
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,685
that actress with the name
like an animal. A cow.

659
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:17,163
No, ox. No, it's not that.

660
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,643
- Bullock.
- A Bull. Bullock. Sandra Bullock.

661
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,805
And l can't remember the title
of the movie, but it's--

662
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:24,283
l'm gonna look it up.
l'm gonna check her credits.

663
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,684
- No, don't you have a report to finish?
- Yeah. l did it.

664
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,651
Good for you. That's good.

665
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:32,204
Wait. Stop typing. Wait.

666
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:35,163
Has anyone seen Gibbs?

667
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:38,044
lt takes guts to testify
against Carlos Mendez.

668
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:39,408
Took more guts to fake her death

669
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:42,088
and walk away from a husband
and son to protect them.

670
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:44,449
Eighteen years is a long time
to seek revenge,

671
