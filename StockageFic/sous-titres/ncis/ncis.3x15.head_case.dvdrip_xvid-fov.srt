1
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,203
ls it just me,
or are we getting faster at this?

2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,881
Faster is five cars
in one night, newbie.

3
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:17,916
- You hear that?
- Sounds like money to me.

4
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:28,285
Now that's what l'm talking about.

5
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:31,484
This baby is loaded:
GPS navi, killer sound.

6
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:33,160
We're gonna get three G's
for these rims.

7
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:34,840
More if the spare's alloy.

8
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,565
- What?
- NClS.

9
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:41,921
- Don't shoot.
- Freeze!

10
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:43,964
- Hands in the air.
- Okay, okay.

11
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,919
- All right. All right.
- Cuff them.

12
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:48,566
- Against the car, dirtbag.
- On the car.

13
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:50,206
- Assume the position.
- Okay. Okay.

14
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:53,404
Your first mistake was stealing tools
from the motor pool, geniuses.

15
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:58,204
Yeah, it's Gibbs. l need
prison transportation for three.

16
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:02,155
Get ahold of Metro P.D.
We busted these guys on their turf.

17
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:03,316
Gibbs?

18
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:05,726
You have the right to remain silent.

19
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,639
Car's not the only thing
they've been chopping.

20
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,837
l swear we didn't kill anybody.
lt's not even our cooler.

21
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,237
We had nothing to do with that.

22
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:06,996
Do you believe him?

23
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,840
They had a human head
in the trunk of a car, McGee.

24
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:11,725
What do you think?

25
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:18,524
First severed head?

26
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:23,803
Mine was a motorcycle accident
in Baltimore.

27
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:27,562
- l thought l was picking up a helmet--
- lt's worse when you know the person.

28
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:31,204
You knew someone
who was beheaded?

29
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,925
A friend.

30
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:40,998
He infiltrated a Hamas cell
in Ramallah.

31
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,598
They sent his head

32
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,044
overnight express.

33
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:51,602
- l'm sorry. l didn't--
- That's when l decided l'd...

34
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,478
l'd never be captured alive.

35
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,237
You did me a favour tonight, Jethro.

36
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:06,763
Tonight is <i>SmackDown</i> night
at the Mallard residence.

37
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,121
Can you believe it?

38
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,596
Mother's favourite television program:
Wrestling.

39
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,157
Mine too. l love the WWE.

40
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,637
l haven't the heart to tell her
it's not real.

41
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,280
Where's the body?

42
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,438
Three sailors running
a chop shop, Duck.

43
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:21,722
We found it in the trunk.

44
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,526
You're not gonna need
the gurney for this one, Palmer.

45
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,244
Oh, my.

46
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,121
Decapitation.

47
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,040
A most ancient form of execution,

48
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,359
which the French elevated
to a public spectacle.

49
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,716
The guillotine.

50
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,636
The French Revolution.
Scissors, please.

51
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:52,485
Actually, the hideous machine
was invented by a doctor,

52
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,285
Joseph Guillotin.

53
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,441
He proposed his machine be used,

54
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:01,236
as it was a humane form
of capital punishment.

55
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,238
- That's ironic.
- Yes, l'd say.

56
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:06,524
Although the guillotine
is mostly associated with the French,

57
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:09,241
the Nazis actually
guillotined more people

58
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:11,238
than the entire French Revolution.

59
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,999
- That's pretty gruesome.
- lndeed.

60
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,362
Hitler thought it was a demeaning
form of punishment,

61
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,802
so he used it for political executions.

62
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,878
l was referring to the severed head,
Ducky.

63
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,164
Do you know how many people
the Nazis decapitated

64
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:26,080
between 1 942 and 1 943?

65
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,519
- No.
- Over 20,000.

66
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,599
l never cease to be amazed by
the depth of your knowledge, doctor.

67
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,485
Yes, well, one thing
we can say for certain:

68
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,679
Beheading was not the cause
of this poor man's demise.

69
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,519
Look at the tissue reaction.

70
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:44,475
lt isn't engorged with blood
from the severed capillaries and veins.

71
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,683
So he was dead
before his head was removed?

72
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,838
For what sicko reason
do you keep it preserved on ice?

73
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,998
l don't know,
but it's gonna make determining

74
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,998
the time of death impossible.

75
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,479
As to cause, well,
without the rest of the body--

76
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,327
Perhaps you can make us an l.D.

77
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,398
Lay some tissue samples on me,
Duckman.

78
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,001
l knew there was a reason
l invited you down here.

79
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,683
Would you do the honours, Mr. Palmer?
l need to take care of the paperwork.

80
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,923
So white meat or dark?

81
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:20,083
lt's inappropriate?

82
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,560
With a big dash of creepy, Jimmy.

83
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:27,515
lt's my delivery.
l have to work on that.

84
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:33,958
Who is Naomi Krutzhammer?
One of your girlfriends, yes?

85
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,640
l'm trying to read my email here.
You mind?

86
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,446
Not at all. l didn't know
your nickname was ''Honeybuns.''

87
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,365
Only Naomi and l call him that.

88
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:42,199
Didn't think you
were gonna say anything.

89
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,720
Who owns the car with the head?

90
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:45,957
- We don't know yet.
- You're reading your email

91
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,004
and you don't know yet?

92
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,522
We traced the VlN
to a Mercedes dealership in Riverdale,

93
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,882
which sold it two weeks ago.
The registration is temporary

94
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,719
and hasn't been processed
by the DMV.

95
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,720
We called the dealership. They don't
open for another 25 minutes.

96
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,639
The car's registered
to an Epsilon Corporation.

97
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:02,922
Thanks for sharing, probie.

98
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:06,841
l just found it. Had to hack
into the DMV's processing computer.

99
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,638
- ls that legal?
- l doubt it.

100
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,241
l wonder what the penalty is?

101
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,205
Less than reading your emails
on my time, Honeybuns.

102
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,676
Corporate address is in care
of Sean Oliver, attorney at law.

103
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,360
225 Sheraton Street.

104
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,358
- Phone number, McGee?
- When they answer the phone,

105
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,597
what are you gonna say,
Officer David?

106
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,235
''Hey, we found your car.

107
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,796
Anybody at Epsilon
missing a head?''

108
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:33,285
Tony, take Ziva with you. Go.

109
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,766
That's a good job, McGee.

110
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,918
- Thank you, boss.
- But Tony's right.

111
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,157
Hacking is illegal.

112
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,316
l hate lawyers.

113
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:49,445
l thought lawyers were an integral part
of the American legal system.

114
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,563
Defenders of civil liberties.

115
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,797
This guy wouldn't know a civil liberty
if he choked on it.

116
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,007
You don't get an office like this
working pro bono cases.

117
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:58,965
You don't even know the man.

118
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,919
l can tell you anything
you need to know.

119
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,005
Okay, what does he look like?

120
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,601
The name ''Sean'' was popular
in the 1 960's.

121
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,555
l wonder why.

122
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:11,876
That puts him in his 40s.

123
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,925
Probably has a combover, balding,
maybe even plugs.

124
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,319
Shall l continue?

125
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:18,642
Well, you're on a roll.

126
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,480
Oliver: Old money. Esquire?

127
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:23,805
Cheeseball, pretentious.

128
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,798
l'm sorry to keep you waiting.

129
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,639
lf you'd follow me, please?

130
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,275
Count your fingers
after you shake his hand.

131
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,765
Okay, thanks.

132
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,441
Of course, there are exceptions.

133
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,405
So, what can l do for NClS today?

134
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,797
- l'm Special Agent DiNozzo.
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:45,642
We recovered a stolen Mercedes
registered at Epsilon Corporation

136
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:48,367
- at this address.
- Epsilon's a client.

137
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,358
l'm sure they'll appreciate
you finding their car.

138
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,280
lt's a little more complicated than that.
ls it Mrs.?

139
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,836
lt's Ms., and please call me Sean.

140
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,963
Sean. Pretty name.

141
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,118
- Thank you.
- You're a coach?

142
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:01,960
No, not exactly.

143
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,322
l do a lot of pro bono work
for youth groups.

144
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:08,042
The car may have been involved in
some criminal activity prior to the theft,

145
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,084
Ms. Oliver.

146
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,524
We'll need to speak
to your client about this.

147
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,279
First define ''criminal activity.''

148
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:17,007
We're not prepared to disclose
that kind of information right now.

149
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,324
Then l'm sorry, l can't help you.

150
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,161
Why is that?

151
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,442
Attorney-client privilege.

152
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:24,444
lt prevents me
from divulging any information

153
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,040
without my client's permission.

154
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:27,879
l'm ethically bound
to protect their rights.

155
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,958
Even if they may have
committed a crime?

156
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,436
lf you believed that, you would have
come with a search warrant.

157
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,279
Oh, we didn't think it was necessary.

158
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,278
So l'll assume
you'll try and go get one now?

159
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:37,846
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

160
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,999
Great. Then l look forward
to seeing you again, Agent DiNozzo.

161
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,237
- Tony.
- Tony.

162
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,078
l hate lawyers.

163
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:58,439
Have a seat.

164
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,444
l'm not saying anything
till l get a lawyer.

165
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:06,445
You're not here to talk,
Petty Officer Hobie.

166
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:07,676
You're here to listen.

167
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,400
They said you jacked the car

168
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,922
and they know nothing
about what was in the trunk.

169
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,759
Me?

170
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,640
l believe them.

171
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,241
That means you're screwed,
petty officer.

172
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,524
Agent McGee?
Seven stolen cars in two weeks.

173
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,843
- What's he looking at?
- First offence?

174
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's see, seven to ten for theft.

175
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:30,926
Another four to five
for selling stolen property.

176
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,805
So roughly, 1 2 years.

177
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,561
Maybe out in six
with good behaviour.

178
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:38,924
What about carrying around
a human head in an ice chest?

179
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:40,645
Well, capital offence,

180
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:43,196
with the gruesome nature
of the crime?

181
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:47,565
l'm thinking... l'm thinking life,
and that's if he's lucky.

182
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,118
- lf not...
- The death penalty.

183
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,957
Whoa, hey.
l didn't know that was in there.

184
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,400
When you boost a car, you don't check
to see what's in the trunk first.

185
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,519
Where?

186
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,802
lt was a parking lot.

187
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,241
Chez Nude.

188
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,238
lt's a strip club in Anacostia.

189
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,806
l took it around midnight.

190
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,082
Did you see the driver?

191
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,206
No.

192
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,519
All l saw was the chrome.

193
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,038
Yes, but are you absolutely positive?

194
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,356
Science doesn't lie, Ducky.

195
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,321
No, but in my experience
it often can be misleading.

196
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,596
- Abby.
- Gibbs. Okay,

197
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,678
so we have two questions for you.
Where's my Caf-Pow?

198
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,200
The machine was empty.

199
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,358
- Second question?
- That wasn't one of the questions.

200
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,199
- The machine's never empty.
- Abby.

201
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,881
According to the Armed Forces
DNA Registry,

202
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:41,598
the head in the autopsy room belongs
to Navy Captain Parker Wayne.

203
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,405
You wanna know how he died
and why.

204
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,683
We know how and why.

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,957
He suffered
a fatal coronary infarction

206
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,164
at Bethesda Naval Hospital
four months ago.

207
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:55,286
So, what is his head
doing in the trunk of a stolen car?

208
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,757
And where is the rest of his body?

209
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,835
Can't connect Captain Wayne
to any of the three suspects, boss.

210
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,759
No common service, ship or base.

211
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,679
lf they had contact,
it wasn't through the Navy.

212
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,280
You're asking me to believe a sailor

213
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:16,961
jacked a car with a head in the trunk
and that he didn't know it?

214
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:18,640
lf the glue sticks...

215
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,760
- ''Shoe fits.''
- <i>Thank you.</i>

216
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,086
DiNozzo.

217
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:25,480
l'm with you, boss.

218
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,724
Our carjacker definitely knows
more than he's telling us.

219
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:31,236
We don't believe
in coincidences around here, Ziva.

220
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,644
However, we do believe in bad luck.

221
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,517
Did you get the search warrant?

222
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:42,238
Faith Coleman says that we need
to petition for a preliminary injunction

223
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:45,046
to compel Sean Oliver, Esquire,
to give up the name of her client.

224
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:46,799
- So do it.
- Done it.

225
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:49,365
Well, l mean, l did it.

226
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,762
Since the captain died
of natural causes,

227
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,157
it's gonna take the judge a while
to sign off on it.

228
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:57,683
The lawyer drooled over Tony.
Why doesn't he just sleep with her?

229
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,444
What?
lt's a viable interrogation technique.

230
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,439
- l've done it.
- Me too.

231
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:10,038
No trauma to the head.
No signs of cerebral haemorrrhage.

232
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:13,517
The cause of death was definitely
coronary inclusion, Dr. Mallard.

233
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,564
Caused by arteriosclerosis.

234
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,561
l took this when l performed
the autopsy on Captain Wayne.

235
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,957
Jethro. Special Agent Gibbs,
Commander Ross,

236
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:25,483
the ME who performed the autopsy
on our captain four months ago.

237
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,559
l must admit l've never been involved
in anything this strange.

238
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,287
Remind me to show you
some of our cases sometime.

239
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:32,641
Last year, we had a patient

240
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,684
who spontaneously combusted,
or so we--

241
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:36,883
You're certain heart attack
was the cause of death?

242
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,958
Absolutely. Captain Wayne
was pronounced dead

243
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,687
on the operating table
by one of our best heart surgeons.

244
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,758
l performed the autopsy
two days later.

245
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:47,124
When you last saw the captain,
his head was attached?

246
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:48,876
Of course.

247
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,001
What happened to his remains?

248
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,556
At the request of the widow,
they were released to a mortuary.

249
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,285
The...

250
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:02,435
Let's see, Vernon Family Mortuary
in Annandale, Virginia.

251
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,516
You'll have to excuse me,

252
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,723
but l'm extremely short-handed
this afternoon, gentlemen.

253
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,684
My furnace operator
didn't show up today.

254
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,596
Mr. Vernon,
are those human remains?

255
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,400
Were. Now they're just
carbon and ash, Agent McGee.

256
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,202
Now, what can l do for you?

257
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,438
We're investigating a death.

258
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,484
l figured as much.

259
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,205
How's that?

260
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,760
The only time l see cops
around here

261
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,236
is when they're on
an official investigation or when,

262
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:39,041
you know, you're customers.

263
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,681
The customer we're interested in
was here four months ago.

264
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,356
Name?

265
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,199
Captain Parker Wayne.

266
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:54,599
Let's see: Wyatt, Winter and Wayne.

267
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,883
From Bethesda.
He was cremated 1 22 days ago.

268
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,003
- Wait, he was cremated?
- Yes.

269
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,284
His wife asked for a Sea-rest urn
with interior gold-plated lining.

270
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,244
Very high end.

271
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:07,556
Sounds nice.

272
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:12,043
Yeah, except for the fact
that there's a piece missing, Vernon.

273
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:13,196
Oh, what do you mean?

274
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,757
Well, a part of his body
has turned up.

275
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:20,523
You mean like a body fragment,
or a bone fragment, or a tooth?

276
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:22,245
Actually, more like his head.

277
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,323
- A head?
- Found in a car trunk.

278
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:27,440
We'd like to know how it got there.

279
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,801
Remains picked up
at 7:45 a.m. on the 24th.

280
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,242
He was cremated that evening,
Furnace 2.

281
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,284
Attending technician, Martin.

282
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,324
- Martin who?
- Broussard.

283
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:42,125
- Where is he?
- He didn't show up for work,

284
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,517
which is why l'm here
instead of out there where l'm needed.

285
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,643
- We're gonna need his address.
- No need.

286
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,365
l'll take you to his room.

287
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,643
l can't believe l let him
live on the grounds.

288
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,923
- For how long?
- Almost three years.

289
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:56,403
This could ruin me. My family's
been in the business for 63 years.

290
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,558
Anyone else licensed
to operate these ovens?

291
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:02,561
Furnaces, Agent DiNozzo.
Just myself and Martin.

292
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,917
Martin, if you're in there,
open up, damn it.

293
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:15,761
Wait here.

294
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,400
You thinking what l'm thinking,
probie?

295
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,035
Yeah, we just walked into
an episode of <i>The X Files.</i>

296
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:56,686
- Open that up, probie.
- No, you open it.

297
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:01,243
- Who's the senior field agent?
- Gibbs.

298
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:04,007
ln this room,
who is the senior field agent?

299
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,446
Open it.

300
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,556
Chucklehead.

301
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,279
- What is it?
- lt's feet.

302
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,516
l knew it.

303
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,917
We're dealing
with another Dahmer here.

304
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,162
The pig kind.

305
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:48,478
Hi. What's your name?

306
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,760
l'm Jethro.

307
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,085
l'm here to talk to your mom.

308
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,643
Did you know my daddy?

309
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,197
No. No, l didn't. Not personally.

310
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,437
He's dead, you know.

311
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:26,516
l had them on the mantle,

312
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,201
but Chrissy would stare at them
for hours.

313
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,883
She couldn't understand
how her daddy could fit inside a jar.

314
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,881
Her therapist said
it was probably unhealthy for her so...

315
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,403
l understand that this must be tough
for you, Mrs. Wayne.

316
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:43,560
Ashes are ashes, Agent Gibbs.

317
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:44,955
Now what is this about?

318
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,362
There may have been a mix-up.

319
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,487
- These aren't my husband's ashes?
- No. No, they probably are.

320
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:55,037
There just was a paper snafu
at Bethesda. We need to verify it.

321
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,001
How can you do that?

322
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,197
Teeth aren't totally destroyed
during cremation.

323
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:10,437
l've been a Navy wife
for close to 20 years, Agent Gibbs.

324
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:13,644
NClS agents
don't investigate mix-ups,

325
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:17,197
at least not agents as old as you.

326
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:22,406
Well, we have a new director,
ma'am.

327
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,286
A female director.

328
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,397
Let's just say l'm not

329
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,440
as politically correct
as some of the younger agents.

330
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,358
What did you do to piss her off?

331
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,358
Well, see, if she was more like you

332
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,722
then l wouldn't be sent out here
to do a probie's job.

333
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,683
Not that this isn't important.
This is very important.

334
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,759
l will handle the captain's remains
with the utmost respect, ma'am.

335
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,280
That's a promise.

336
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,356
- What did you do?
- She overheard a conversation

337
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,961
- l had about her physical attri--
- Where are you taking my Dad?

338
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh, Chrissy. lt's okay.

339
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,885
Agent Gibbs is a Marine. You know
how much Daddy liked them.

340
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,046
Twenty years in the Navy,

341
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,118
l know a Marine when l see one,
Agent Gibbs.

342
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,036
As soon as this is verified,
it'll be returned.

343
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:20,246
Our last command was a cruiser,
the <i>Manassas</i>.

344
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,399
They deploy for eight months
next Thursday.

345
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:28,199
Park's last wish was to have his ashes
scattered at sea by them.

346
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,325
You'll have them back.

347
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:43,122
l've hit a dead wall.

348
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,797
Have any of you heard
of the nation of Nevis?

349
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,959
No.

350
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,241
- lt's in the Caribbean.
- l'm impressed.

351
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,926
lf you're looking
for the most attractive

352
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:58,797
and convenient offshore corporate
domicile, like my father, it's the place.

353
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:01,165
That's where Epsilon's incorporated.

354
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:02,680
lt's a haven of confidentiality.

355
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:06,078
l mean, they won't disclose the names
of owners, officers, or directors.

356
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,318
That's why the old man
seems to like it.

357
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:09,761
lt sounds suspicious.

358
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:11,845
l have a contact
who can get me that info.

359
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:14,282
Ziva, don't talk about it. Do it.

360
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,122
Well, it's a delicate situation, Gibbs.
Perhaps l should elaborate a--

361
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,841
Martin Broussard.

362
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,885
- Raised in New Orleans--
- Boss, barely graduated high school.

363
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,436
- Dropped out of--
- Junior college after only one year.

364
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,926
Record?

365
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,236
- Two DUls and a--
- Shoplifting charge.

366
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:39,085
We got prints from his room.
Abby is--

367
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:41,363
Trying to match them
for the Mercedes from the chop shop.

368
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:43,995
You think Broussard
could be Sean Oliver's client?

369
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:47,603
No way. This guy's apartment makes
McGee's look like the Four Seasons.

370
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:50,002
Whoa, what is wrong
with my home?

371
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,677
There's nothing that a bulldozer
and a few coats of paint wouldn't fix.

372
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,360
At least l wasn't afraid
to open a cooler.

373
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,483
Okay, l wasn't afraid
to open a cool--

374
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,158
l'm shutting up, boss.

375
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,200
- Ziva.
- Director.

376
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,358
- What can l do for you?
- A favour.

377
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,758
- You wanna go back to lsrael?
- No, l actually love it here.

378
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:17,646
- Gibbs is a great teacher.
- You'll learn.

379
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,119
He's like the Hope Diamond:

380
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,005
A valuable gem,

381
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,998
but it comes with a curse.

382
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,806
- Anyone l know in that car?
- You know what they say:

383
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,162
''lf you have to ask...''

384
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:38,160
Hey, they refilled the machine.

385
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,400
What are you doing?

386
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,082
lt's been a long day.
Yoga. Sirshasana.

387
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,681
lt increases the blood flow
to the brain.

388
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,756
l thought that's what this is for.

389
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:54,726
That helps too.

390
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:58,243
- l assume you're done.
- With the ashes? Yeah.

391
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,637
Since cremation destroys all DNA,

392
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,798
then genetic fingerprinting
of the cremains won't work.

393
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,719
So l put them
through a particle accelerator

394
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:07,117
- to try to ferret out any trace elements.
- And?

395
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,000
And l found calcium,
which is present in human bones,

396
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,566
- but no phosphorus.
- Which means?

397
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:13,683
There's really no foreplay with you,
is there, Gibbs?

398
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,407
What, you've been talking
to my ex-wives again?

399
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:21,158
The urn contained burnt wood chips,
concrete, dust and pebbles.

400
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:22,760
The ashes are bogus.

401
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:33,804
Ask yourself what kind of guy

402
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:37,323
lives in a coffin storage shed
at a funeral home.

403
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:40,236
- Perhaps a poor one?
- l'd buy that except for the fact

404
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:43,922
that it looks like this guy did an episode
of <i>Trading Spaces</i> with Satan.

405
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,800
What we need to figure out
is why this guy

406
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,241
decided to keep the man's head.

407
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:50,086
And how it ended up in the trunk
of a stolen Mercedes.

408
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,238
Maybe he needed it
for some sort of ritual.

409
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,637
- Or sacrifice.
- Witchcraft?

410
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,240
Whatever you wanna call it, probie.

411
00:22:56,767 --> 00:23:01,238
l agree. Anyone so obviously
fascinated with death

412
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:03,045
has to be deeply disturbed
on some level.

413
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,198
l mean, take these masks,
for instance.

414
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:08,518
What kind of a person would collect
such horrid-looking things?

415
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:09,961
- Me.
- Of course, by ''horrid,''

416
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:14,757
l mean, finely crafted and artistic.

417
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,643
- Good morning, Abby.
- Hi.

418
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,236
The masks are Ogum.

419
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,967
They're used in tribal ceremonies
in Africa. Friend of mine makes them.

420
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,561
- l see. And this?
- <i>Drapeau</i> or flag.

421
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:30,720
lt symbolizes the bridge between
your spiritual and your earthly planes.

422
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,560
l'm not an expert,
but l would say that

423
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,962
Martin Broussard
is in to voodoo, bigtime.

424
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:39,318
- So it is witchcraft.
- No, McGee, it's voodoo.

425
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,522
What's the difference?

426
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,678
Haven't you ever seen <i>Voodoo lsland</i>
with Boris Karloff?

427
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,599
<i>The Believers</i>, Martin Sheen?

428
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,325
<i>The Serpent and the Rainbow?</i>

429
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,715
<i>Sleepless in Seattle?</i>

430
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,555
That was about voodoo?

431
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,685
No, but the first time l saw it,
it scared the bejesus out of me.

432
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,360
- ls that a fact, DiNozzo?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,518
We think we just had
a major breakthrough in the case.

434
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,565
- You found Broussard?
- No, not exactly.

435
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:01,524
You got the warrant
to search the law offices?

436
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:02,915
Not yet.

437
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,601
Your contacts found out
who owns Epsilon Corporation?

438
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,280
They haven't gotten back to me yet.

439
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:11,235
ln retrospect, ''major'' may have
been overstating things, sir. l'm sorry.

440
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,045
What, Abby?
You have to go to the bathroom,

441
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,279
- or you have something to say?
- l do. But that's not the point.

442
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,757
Ducky and l might have found
something that's ''minjor.''

443
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:24,239
lt's maybe not major,
but it's more than minor.

444
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,967
Duck, are you saying Captain Wayne
was used in some kind of sacrifice?

445
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:29,516
l'm just saying
it's a possibility, Jethro.

446
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:31,598
We found traces of blood
on three of the knives

447
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,086
we got from
Martin Broussard's room.

448
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,045
- All three came back the same type.
- Captain Wayne's?

449
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:38,238
- Nope, chicken.
- Chicken.

450
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:42,480
Well, it's not an uncommon substance
to find at a voodoo ritual.

451
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,320
Yeah, or at a KFC. What else?

452
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:46,476
Patience, Gibbs.

453
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:49,115
l ran the fingerprints
from the Mercedes,

454
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,006
the cooler in the back of the car,
and Martin Broussard's room.

455
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,919
They're all the same
and they're all his.

456
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:55,315
Broussard stole the Mercedes?

457
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:58,604
Either that or he just
really likes to touch stuff.

458
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:02,244
Okay, l'll let Gibbs know. Thank you.

459
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,284
Let Gibbs know what,
Agent McGee?

460
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:09,037
That Captain Wayne's widow
is on her way up, director.

461
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,756
- How much does she know?
- l'm not sure, ma'am.

462
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,280
Gibbs returned with the cremains,

463
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,119
but l don't know what he said
to get them.

464
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:17,322
Let's hope he didn't say

465
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:19,762
that we found
her husband's head in a trunk.

466
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:23,160
Well, l don't think that-- Would he?

467
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,841
Have you gotten the warrant
for Sean Oliver's law office?

468
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:28,277
Still working on it, ma'am.
l've put several calls in

469
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:31,007
to the Assistant
U.S. Attorney's office,

470
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,680
but they're dragging their feet.

471
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:34,843
l expected they would,
so l made a personal call

472
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,599
to the Attorney General's office.

473
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:38,725
Here's your warrant.

474
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,443
You can close your mouth,
Agent McGee. lt's not that impressive.

475
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,965
Get Gibbs.

476
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,160
l'll escort Mrs. Wayne from here.

477
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,601
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,525
Special Agent Gibbs is on his way.
l'm--

479
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,439
Did he make
a positive identification?

480
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:58,837
A positive identification?

481
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,440
Of your husband's cremains?

482
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,359
l want the remains verified
for every body

483
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,358
Broussard was supposed to burn.

484
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:05,516
Not a problem, boss.

485
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,757
- What do we tell the families?
- Depends on what we find.

486
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:10,316
- You think he's done this before?
- The guy's cutting up chickens

487
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,000
and carrying heads around
in coolers, Ziva.

488
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,998
l don't know.
What's your gut tell you?

489
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,442
That l never want to be cremated.

490
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:19,921
Sorry, boss. One, got the warrant.

491
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:21,315
Good job. Tony, you're with me.

492
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:24,559
Sir, Mrs. Wayne is here
and Director Shepard is with her.

493
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,842
He said the paper mix-up could be
resolved with my husband's teeth.

494
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,160
lf Special Agent Gibbs told you that,
l'm sure it's the truth.

495
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,921
He's one of the most knowledgeable
agents l've ever worked with.

496
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:41,160
l had that impression. l'm glad he was
assigned this, even if it is punishment.

497
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,959
- Punishment?
- The new director has it in for him.

498
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:49,116
He told you that?

499
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:51,482
Well, l've seen it before.
When Parker was XO

500
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,797
for one of the first female
ship captains:

501
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:57,404
The woman was a nightmare
trying to prove herself.

502
00:26:57,567 --> 00:27:01,480
Special Agent Gibbs, l didn't know
the new director was punishing you.

503
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:05,324
She always seemed very fair to me.

504
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:08,524
Well, you're a woman. She doesn't
have anything to prove to you.

505
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:13,000
How about you? What do you think?

506
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,398
Do you think the new director
is reasonable?

507
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,842
- Very.
- Why are you here, Mrs. Wayne?

508
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,406
Have you made
a positive identification?

509
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:21,636
The lab's working on it.

510
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,718
- l'm sorry to be troubling you.
- No trouble at all.

511
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:26,242
The <i>Manassas</i> has been put
on alert to sail early.

512
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:27,681
- How early?
- Tuesday.

513
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,042
l have to have Parker's ashes there
by Monday night.

514
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:33,165
l don't wanna wait another year
to honour my husband's last wish.

515
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,521
l'll do my best.

516
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,406
You'll have your husband's ashes
by Monday.

517
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,080
Won't she, Agent Gibbs?

518
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,402
lf you say so.

519
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:50,557
She isn't the new--

520
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,162
Hi. Nice to see you again. NClS.
We have a search warrant.

521
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:59,440
Go right on in.
Ms. Oliver has been expecting you.

522
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:05,956
That was fast.

523
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:07,640
lt gives us the right to search
the premises

524
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:10,446
for every and all documents
pertaining to Epsilon Corporation.

525
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,075
l think you'll find everything
you need in those boxes.

526
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:21,558
Your director's not the only one with
friends in the U.S. Attorney's office.

527
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:24,522
You have the papers,
so l can't stop you,

528
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,247
but l do think this is overkill
for a stolen car.

529
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,001
We're more interested in
who was driving it before it was stolen.

530
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,484
- Why?
- l'll make you a deal.

531
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,844
You tell me
who runs Epsilon Corporation,

532
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:37,481
l tell you why.

533
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:41,999
Unfortunately, l can't make deals
without consulting my clients.

534
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:43,640
You should make the call, Sean.

535
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:47,802
At least give me a clue as to what it is
we're dealing with here, Tony.

536
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:51,601
Was it drugs?

537
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,361
More along the lines
of human sacrifice.

538
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,916
She's had 24 hours
to cleanse these files.

539
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,318
- What are we hoping to find?
- Names of employees and addresses.

540
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,319
We might get through this
by the end of the month

541
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:04,636
if you actually helped us, Tony.

542
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,365
l'm supervising.

543
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,562
Hi, Gibbs.

544
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:11,325
- Nice one.
- Yeah, it is.

545
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,407
- Boss, l was just about to call you.
- What a coincidence.

546
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,319
l was just about to put my boot
up your--

547
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:17,476
Got a lead.

548
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,797
Found an electric bill
in one of the boxes.

549
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,765
An industrial space in Anacostia,
three miles from the strip club

550
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:27,842
- where the Mercedes was stolen.
- Ziva, McGee, go check it out.

551
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:32,638
Tony? Go on, supervise.

552
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,685
lt doesn't look like anybody's here.

553
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,275
All right, what do we do?

554
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,836
- Well, at least we have a warrant.
- Right.

555
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:58,281
No. Not really.

556
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,766
What is your problem, probie?

557
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,646
Well, the warrant only covers
Epsilon's files.

558
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,758
- Can you see inside that window?
- You know that l can't.

559
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:12,044
So for all you know,
there could be files in there, yes?

560
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:15,005
Technically, yes. But we could be
obfuscating the warrant.

561
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,046
- You know what that means?
- Not at all.

562
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,799
Good. Neither do l. Pick the lock.

563
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:20,521
''Obfuscating.''

564
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:23,679
What sort of knucklehead
uses a word like ''obfuscating''?

565
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:25,916
Picklehead.

566
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:27,600
Nice work, Ziva.

567
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:31,237
- Tony?
- Two to one. You lose, probie.

568
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:36,117
- A bad idea.
- What?

569
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:49,916
Wonder what they do in here?

570
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:55,159
- We should not have broken in here.
- What?

571
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,000
- We shouldn't have broken in here.
- lf you wanna be a crybaby,

572
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,998
why don't you wait outside
for the police?

573
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,078
What are we gonna tell them?

574
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:15,157
Might be easier to show them.

575
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,518
You know what this place
reminds me of?

576
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:34,917
One of your stupid voodoo movies?

577
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:36,440
No.

578
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:40,316
My Uncle Vincenzo's shop
on Long lsland. He's a butcher.

579
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,641
Yet another reason why
l'm considering becoming a vegetarian.

580
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:47,002
We may need a couple extra gurneys
on this one, Palmer.

581
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,165
- How many are we looking at, Duck?
- Based upon size,

582
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:57,481
skin tone, and gender difference,
there are at least

583
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:02,158
partial remains
of six cadavers in here.

584
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:03,476
This isn't voodoo.

585
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:08,004
l agree. Based upon the surgical skill
with which they were dissected,

586
00:32:08,687 --> 00:32:11,360
you've found yourself
another chop shop, Jethro.

587
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,643
Only instead of automobiles
being harvested--

588
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,922
Body parts?

589
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:16,839
Any of these parts
belong to Captain Wayne, Duck?

590
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:19,601
Oh, Jethro, please.

591
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,636
- So how grisly was it?
- Not bad.

592
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,241
Shelves lined with body parts
is not bad?

593
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:26,999
At least they were
surgically removed.

594
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,156
Yeah.

595
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:29,806
Were the bodies
supposed to be cremated?

596
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,036
l don't know.

597
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,675
McGee's getting the mortuary records
for the last few months.

598
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:36,486
l do not know why anyone
would wanna be cremated.

599
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,878
Do you really wanna
be stuck in the ground?

600
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:40,765
- She already has a coffin.
- Oh, no.

601
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,197
l just wanna know
that the rest of my body parts,

602
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,437
after l donate whatever l can
to science,

603
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,286
are gonna rot for eternity
in a familiar place.

604
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:52,998
- How about you, Tony?
- The slow rot or the fast burn?

605
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,362
Neither, please,
thank you very much.

606
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:56,562
What's your alternative?

607
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,799
Ted Williams. Cryogenics.

608
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:02,322
Appropriate under the circumstances,
Agent DiNozzo.

609
00:33:02,487 --> 00:33:05,479
The only thing Ted Williams
had frozen was his head.

610
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,199
Here's the information
you were looking for.

611
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,518
The principal and sole shareholder
of Epsilon Corporation.

612
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,126
Sean Oliver!

613
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:16,524
Now l really do hate lawyers.

614
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,118
- Thank you, director.
- Glad l could be of help.

615
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,075
ls something wrong?

616
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:29,363
Oh, l was just wondering if Gibbs
knows who Ziva's secret contact is.

617
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:34,285
We had a saying in Europe:
''Whatever Gibbs doesn't know--''

618
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:38,360
- Can't hurt him.
- No. ''Can't hurt us.''

619
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:44,278
lt would appear they were all dissected
by the same individual, Jethro.

620
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:49,363
lt's the direction
that the incisions were made. Look.

621
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,405
Straight cuts
are normally canted to the right

622
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:55,161
due to the position of the scalpel
in the right hand.

623
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,366
All of these were canted
in the opposite direction.

624
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,516
We're looking for someone

625
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:00,881
- that's left-handed.
- Precisely.

626
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,402
Any idea which ones
are Captain Wayne's?

627
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,035
We're taking tissue samples
of the individual parts

628
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,925
and prints from the hands.

629
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,363
And we'll try to assemble
Captain Wayne where we can.

630
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,205
l've got less than two days, Duck.

631
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,927
We told his wife
we'd return his ashes by Monday.

632
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,647
- l could bring in another ME to help.
- Yeah, yeah. Do it.

633
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,956
My contact came through, Gibbs.

634
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,685
The client Sean Oliver was
protecting was--

635
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:23,758
- Sean Oliver.
- Tony and McGee are picking her up.

636
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,760
- Not bad, Officer David.
- Well, l do what l can.

637
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:29,487
When you see the director,
thank her for me.

638
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:34,518
There's a reason you couldn't find her
anywhere last night, Jethro.

639
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:37,440
She was meeting
with the District Attorney's office

640
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,078
cutting a deal.

641
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,125
- What kind of deal?
- More than she deserves.

642
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:44,720
Do you think it would
be inappropriate,

643
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:48,004
if, as director, l went in there
and smacked that smile off her face?

644
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,876
Yeah, it would.
But that's what you have me for.

645
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:02,123
Thank you very much, ma'am.

646
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,839
That was one of Martin Broussard's
elementary school teachers.

647
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:08,316
What could she possibly tell you
that's relevant to this case?

648
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,921
A lot, Ziva. Slow learner.

649
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:14,875
Troublemaker.
Not real big on oral hygiene.

650
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,845
That's fascinating, Tony.
And this helps us find him how?

651
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,202
lt doesn't. But at least now we know
he was left-handed.

652
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:25,196
Officer David.

653
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,437
- <i>Got something for you guys.</i>
- On our way.

654
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:31,524
Abby found something.

655
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:37,081
His name
was Captain Parker Wayne.

656
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:40,243
He was married.

657
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,556
Had a 9-year-old daughter

658
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,321
who just worshipped
the ground he walked on.

659
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:47,636
My client admitted
her involvement in the sale

660
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:51,356
of illegal body parts already,
Agent Gibbs.

661
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,162
His last request was to have
his ashes scattered at sea.

662
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:59,282
What would you like me
to tell this little girl, Ms. Oliver?

663
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:00,880
That that can't happen
because you wanna

664
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,799
join a more expensive
country club?

665
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:05,959
- This was never about money.
- Sean, he's baiting you.

666
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,799
Let him, Simon.

667
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,326
The deceased were to be cremated.

668
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:13,523
By supplying their bodies
for medical research,

669
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,917
advances were made
to benefit the living.

670
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,203
Any profits you made
were just incidental, right?

671
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:21,882
Part of my client's plea agreement
is to make financial restitution.

672
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,766
Your client was carving up
dead people

673
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:27,043
and selling parts like meat.

674
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:28,640
Where's Martin Broussard?

675
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,478
Not part of our arrangement.

676
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:35,115
l've got the parts
to six different bodies downstairs.

677
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:38,597
She is not going anywhere
until l l.D. them.

678
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:42,883
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation. Why?

679
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,082
l found him.

680
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:52,238
- ''We.'' We found him.
- Found who, Abby?

681
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:55,758
Martin Broussard.

682
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:05,036
We located Martin Broussard.

683
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,286
Then you have no further need
to question my client.

684
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:10,677
We have him downstairs in autopsy.

685
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:11,996
- To identify the bodies?
- Nope.

686
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,442
- Sean. They can do whatever--
- He's one of them.

687
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,642
Martin is dead?

688
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,367
l don't know anything about it.
Simon?

689
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,439
We found his body parts
in your building.

690
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,363
The only thing we can't locate,
it seems, is his head.

691
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,125
l think your deal with the DA
just went south.

692
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:31,640
l didn't kill him.

693
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:33,081
lf you didn't, you know who did.

694
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:36,557
As your lawyer, l advise you not
to answer any more questions, Sean.

695
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:39,195
A man was murdered here, Simon.

696
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:42,320
Vernon supplied the bodies.

697
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,719
Martin was--
Was just a delivery man.

698
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:48,879
They must've thought he was too weak
to stand up to an investigation.

699
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,480
They?

700
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:56,763
l appreciate your volunteering
to help, Dr. Ross.

701
00:37:56,927 --> 00:38:00,044
Anything to get out of Bethesda
for a couple of days, Dr. Mallard.

702
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:01,879
Where do you want this one,
doctor?

703
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,517
ls that what this is all about,
the body parts?

704
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:06,922
lt would appear that way.

705
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:08,725
lt's understandable. That arm alone

706
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,923
- would be worth a fortune.
- Really?

707
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:13,396
Pharmaceutical
and medical-instrument firms

708
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,762
would pay vast sums for cadavers.

709
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,522
- Where do they get them?
- Willed-body programmes, universities.

710
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:21,996
But the need far outstrips the supply.

711
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,442
A human body can be worth
as much as $200,000.

712
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:28,244
Well, how much do you suppose
just a little arm would be?

713
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:31,679
A lot. lt's not unlike car theft.

714
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:37,600
A vehicle stripped and sold for parts
is worth far more than when it's whole.

715
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,883
And harder to trace.

716
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,364
Table 2.

717
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:45,640
Wow, this could pay off
my college loans.

718
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:49,483
Don't give me cause to check
your car trunk tonight, Mr. Palmer.

719
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:55,444
We haven't yet determined
the cause of death of this poor man.

720
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:59,162
Would you care to open?

721
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,679
My pleasure, doctor.

722
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:14,797
l suppose you'll tell me
you didn't do it for money.

723
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:16,356
Excuse me?

724
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:18,483
Dissecting these bodies.

725
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,126
What--?

726
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,846
What would ever
make you think that?

727
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:29,444
By the way you used this.

728
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:33,242
- They know, Ross.
- What?

729
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,395
l admit the money was good, but--

730
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:43,039
- My intent was to help people.
- ls that so?

731
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:46,916
Yes. l don't care
whether you believe me or not.

732
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,406
As long as you do, doctor.

733
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,006
Before you buy this,
he murdered Broussard.

734
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,635
- No. No, l didn't.
- The hell you didn't.

735
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,479
- She presented his body to me--
- He's lying!

736
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,922
l don't give a damn
which one of you did it.

737
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:00,760
Well, l do.

738
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:03,681
Tony, get them out of here.

739
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,644
Scum ambulance chaser.

740
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,798
- Stop lying.
- lf you think for one minute l'll take--

741
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,322
- Would you for once tell the truth?
- lt was all your idea.

742
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:14,116
Mr. Palmer, would you leave us alone
in a minute, please?

743
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,479
Jethro, you do realise
that Captain Wayne's remains

744
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:20,605
are considered evidence
in this case.

745
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,158
Well, you can't possibly
be considering cremating them

746
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,158
in time to give them to his widow.

747
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:28,806
Right.

748
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,995
l'll go with you to the crematorium.

749
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,677
Chrissy was really starting to worry,

750
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,481
but l told her that Marines
always keep their word.

751
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:45,396
Sweetie, go get changed.
We have to leave for the ship soon.

752
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,556
Okay, Mommy.

753
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,558
And put the dress on that Daddy
brought from France.

754
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:50,445
He loved you in it.

755
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:02,159
Are those my husband's ashes?

756
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,885
Yes, ma'am.

757
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,519
l give you my word.

758
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:12,758
lt would be my pleasure to escort you
and your daughter to the ship.

759
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:16,766
The Navy's sending a car,
but thanks.

760
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,680
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

761
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:35,482
And Parker would never forgive me
if l didn't say <i>''semper fi. ''</i>

762
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:48,083
Fair winds and following seas,
ma'am.
