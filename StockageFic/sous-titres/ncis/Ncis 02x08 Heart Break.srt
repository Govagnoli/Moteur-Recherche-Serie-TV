1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,840
Tell me he's asleep.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,880
Dr. Byers saw to that.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,160
Gave him Percocet before she left.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,520
If I were her, and he called
me in at 2:00 in the morning,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,560
I would have killed him.

6
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,660
Yeah. It's Gibbs.

7
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,540
No, you did not wake me up, DiNozzo.

8
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,100
Okay, I'll meet you there.

9
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,100
Hey, can you drop me by Bethesda?

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,860
Ho. You got here quick.

11
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,660
Where were you?

12
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,380
Home asleep.

13
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,140
Asleep, maybe, but not at home.

14
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,980
I got you on your cell.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,900
Drop it, DiNozzo.

16
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,620
Do not make this a challenge, Kate.

17
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,380
I will find out.

18
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,980
See ya.

19
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,981
Bye-bye.

20
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:18,340
Looks like you and I were the only
ones flying solo last night, McGee.

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,620
Speak for yourself.

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,060
'Morning, Boss.

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,780
Where?

24
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,820
First floor.

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,380
A- wing.

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,580
Some kind of explosion.

27
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,460
Guy went up in flames.

28
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,340
Name?

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,340
Commander Michael Dornan,
Safety Officer on the Kennedy.

30
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
It just got back from the Gulf.

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,860
Yeah, Friday.

32
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,940
Been complaining of chest pain.

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,620
Had open heart surgery four days ago.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,020
Doctor who led the team
that operated on him

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,020
is on the way in.

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,540
I'll talk to him.

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,180
Uh, that would be a her, boss.

38
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,380
Commander Janice Byers.

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,420
Come on!

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,540
Whoa, that had to hurt.

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,620
What the hell happened here, Duck?

42
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,500
The source of t conflagration
appears to be internal.

43
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,380
The majority of the damage
is confined to the torso.

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,260
He was receiving oxygen
through a nasal canula.

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,060
Still, it would have needed
a source of ignition and

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,300
I seriously doubt it could've
caused this kind of damage.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,260
Could he have been smoking in bed?

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,500
Corpsman saw him ten
seconds before the explosion.

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,420
Dornan was out cold.

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:25,820
Hey, boss...

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,580
Listen, I know this may
sound far-fetched, but...

52
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,820
Will you spit it out, McGee?

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,940
Spontaneous human combustion.

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,420
Where's the surgeon?

55
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,340
She's in the waiting room.

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,220
Just got here.

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,460
Probie, what are you thinking?

58
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,180
Spontaneous human combustion?!

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,020
It's an urban myth.

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,300
Actually, Tony, we shouldn't
disregard the notion.

61
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,460
Stories of the phenomenon go
way back- to the Bible, in fact.

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,180
Although it wasn't
popularized until Dickens.

63
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,660
Charles Dickens?

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,220
Yes.

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,420
He used spontaneous
combustion to kill off one

66
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,820
of his characters, Mr. Krook,
in the novel Bleak House.

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,220
It caused a minor uproar.

68
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,140
Dickens was accused of perpetuating
the age-old superstition.

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,860
I saw that movie.

70
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,260
The silent version or
the British mini-series?

71
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,380
They were talking.

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
Commander Dornan was
complaining of pain.

73
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,500
He insisted the night staff call me in.

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,100
"Insisted"?

75
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,640
The commander liked to
throw his weight around,

76
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,700
especially with the junior
nurses and the corpsmen.

77
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,300
Normal post-op pain?

78
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,820
To appease him, I did an
echocardiogram and he was fine.

79
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,620
I gave him a Percocet for the
pain so he could fall sleep.

80
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,380
Oh, Jethro,

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,185
I'll be... uh...

82
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,340
- You headed back?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Commander Byers, this
is Dr. Mallard, our M.E.

84
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Dr. Byers is the surgeon
that operated on the victim.

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,580
Dr. Mallard's a man of few words.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,100
I don't have any more questions
for you right now, Doctor.

87
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,740
Thank you for your time.

88
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,260
Sure.

89
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,020
What exactly was the procedure?

90
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Aortic valve repair.

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,700
Congenital aortic stenosis?

92
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,700
Acquired.

93
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,780
and the prognosis?

94
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,860
Everything went well.

95
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,660
I was expecting Commander Dornan to
be back on active duty in two months.

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,180
Ah... thank you.

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,860
Uh, I may have to ask you a
question or two after the autopsy.

98
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,620
I'll give you my numbers.

99
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,900
Too bad you didn't get
to bed at a sensible hour.

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,860
I mean, to sleep, cause
obviously, you were in bed.

101
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,740
I get it, Tony.

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,060
McGee...

103
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:44,940
Yeah, boss?

104
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,540
Stay here.

105
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,340
Meet with the engineers
and the plant manager.

106
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,140
I want this oxygen system
completely checked out.

107
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,980
On it, Boss.

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,980
Everything in this
room goes back to Abby.

109
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,900
Everything?

110
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,620
Right.

111
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Background the victim.

112
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,660
This is the beginning
of a very long day.

113
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah. Too bad you had
such a short night.

114
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,420
I must say, I was very
intrigued by your doctor.

115
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,020
I'm not quite re why.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,860
Did you find her that way, too?

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,900
Looks like he burned
from the inside out.

118
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,380
It does, doesn't it, Mr. Palmer?

119
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,220
Oh, that's the remains of his stomach.

120
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,460
Make sure they get to
Abigail for content analysis.

121
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
Uh, Doctor?

122
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,060
Yes?

123
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,500
Does it help you to talk to them?

124
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,580
They're still human.

125
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,780
What we do is very
invasive and impersonal.

126
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
It helps me establish a relationship.

127
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,700
Hey, Gibbs.

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,220
I hear you're not a fan of SHC.

129
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,100
That a band?

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,740
No.

131
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,860
Spontaneous human combustion.

132
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,420
Don't waste my time, Abbs.

133
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,060
If you read my Master's thesis,
you may become a believer.

134
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,740
Doubt it.

135
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,380
I can show you photos of what
was left of a 240-pound woman.

136
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,460
Yeah, but you won't.

137
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,820
She was sitting in a chair.

138
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,260
All that was left were
blackened seat springs,

139
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,980
a section of backbone, one foot still in

140
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,580
a satin slipper and ten pounds of ashes.

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,980
The rest of her apartment was untouched.

142
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
Abby, you know what?

143
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,660
Just tell me what caused the explosion.

144
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,900
Ooh! A bribe!

145
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,260
That always works.

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,620
So I checked out all
the electrical equipment

147
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,220
from the hospital, trying to
find the source of ignition.

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,540
Nothing; everything's

149
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,300
in perfect working order,
including this monitor, which

150
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,180
recorded the victim's vitals
up until the point of blastoff.

151
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,260
Somebody went a little postal

152
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,300
with the fire extinguisher.

153
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,020
It complicates finding trace evidence.

154
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,780
The commander was being barbecued.

155
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,620
I doubt they were
concerned with forensics.

156
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,580
- True.
- You don't know what caused the explosion?

157
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,500
Other than SHC?

158
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
All right,

159
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,740
get with Ducky.

160
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,060
Maybe together you can solve it.

161
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,580
Roger that.

162
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,740
When he's finished slicing and
dicing, we'll go bang heads.

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,380
Don't cause any sparks.

164
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,940
No, that's more than enough for now.

165
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,740
Thanks for your time, Doctor.

166
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,980
I was thinking of becoming a doctor.

167
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,500
You. A doctor.

168
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,460
Anthony DiNozzo, comma...

169
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,580
M.D.

170
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,340
Let me guess: a gynecologist.

171
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,900
Ooh, no, I was thinking
more dermatologist.

172
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,540
Normal hours. Big bucks.

173
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,460
Never an emergency.

174
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,100
I mean, nobody ever died from a zit.

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,020
I had a terrible case of acne as a kid.

176
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,300
Of course you did, Probie.

177
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,100
Boss, plant engineer
says oxygen is supplied

178
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,340
to the rooms through a central system.

179
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,620
They did a complete check
and everything was in order.

180
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,380
Day shift concurred with night shift:

181
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,620
The commander was a pain in the ass.

182
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,860
Divorced, ten years ago, no kids.

183
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,620
Wife's happily remarried,
living in Santa Fe...

184
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,580
Parents are retired.

185
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,140
One sister, and they're being
notified by CACO. DiNozzo...

186
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,380
Harrison...?

187
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,020
Hi.

188
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,140
It's Harrison.

189
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,900
I'm glad you called.

190
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,860
I never cease to be
amazed by your skill, Abby

191
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,820
You know, when I was a young M.E.,

192
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,300
we used to recreate crime
scenes using interns.

193
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,100
You also used to listen to
"records" and do the jitterbug.

194
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,660
Actually, I was quite the hoofer.

195
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,300
Let's see it, Abbs.

196
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,860
Based on the condition of the body,
the burn patterns and debris scatter,

197
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,260
we were able to recreate the explosion.

198
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,020
Doesn't tell us much.

199
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,780
Watch when I rotate it
180 and play it in slo-mo.

200
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,620
That's the point of ignition.

201
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,260
What caused the explosion?

202
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,140
Well, this was taken from
that area of the mattress.

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,060
I also provided Abby
with epidermal scrapings

204
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,500
from the victim's upper left torso.

205
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,340
And the spectrometer found minute traces

206
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,300
of antimony sulfide and
potassium chlorate on both.

207
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,940
Matches.

208
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,020
Light my fire, McGee.

209
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,900
Someone struck a match
and ignited the oxygen.

210
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,140
Well, according to the corpsman,
the commander was asleep.

211
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,180
This was no accident, Gibbs.

212
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,380
Barbeque Boy... he was murdered.

213
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,480
Get back to Bethesda.

214
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Review their security tapes.

215
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
Find out how someone got
into that hospital room

216
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,560
and then managed to get
out without being seen.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,120
On it, boss.

218
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,440
Start a timeline.

219
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,120
24 hours before the explosion.

220
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
I want to know every
doctor, nurse, orderly,

221
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
visitor that went into
that hospital room.

222
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,160
Okay.

223
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,880
You two are going to Norfolk.

224
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,240
Dornan spent the last
nine months on the Kennedy.

225
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,080
I'll get the car.

226
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,160
What are you so jazzed about?

227
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,800
He knows that the first person you'll
be talking to is the NCIS Agent Afloat.

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Special Agent Paula Cassidy.

229
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,600
You're kidding.

230
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
She was reassigned there.

231
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,640
What am I missing?

232
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,200
Paula Cassidy is a rather
attractive agent that

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,800
DiNozzo drooled all over last
year when we were at Gitmo.

234
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:06,560
Enough talk, Agent Todd.

235
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's go.

236
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,560
Okay, Zero-two-32-eight-Q
would be this way.

237
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,560
Last time we were on a carrier, you
were the one who got lost. Not me.

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,680
I wasn't lost.

239
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
I was momentarily disoriented.

240
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
Like you were with Paula in Gitmo?

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm not the type to
kiss-and-tell, Kate.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
It's not like you to be discreet, Tony.

243
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,240
She's something special, isn't she?

244
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Is he something special?

245
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,000
Who?

246
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
Mr. Short Night Harrison.

247
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,520
Six is two down this way.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
No. It's this way.

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
Trust me. I'm right.

250
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
We have to check in with the XO.

251
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
Why don't you take care of that?

252
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Why don't you?

253
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Because I outrank you.

254
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,120
That'll be six up and three to the left.

255
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,640
She is something special.

256
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
Enter.

257
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
I was expecting Gibbs.

258
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,200
Disappointed?

259
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
Hi. You've been back a week.

260
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,600
You didn't call.

261
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,880
Oh... I've been gone months.

262
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,440
I didn't get any e-mails.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Well, I figured you'd
be too busy to reply.

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,960
You were at sea with 5,000 men.

265
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
I had trouble choosing.

266
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,680
Guess I'm a hard act to follow.

267
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,120
Actually, I was afraid of
making the same mistake.

268
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,720
Ooh, wow. Full contact. There.

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,080
Nice. Let's start over.

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,880
I'll go back outside and do this again.

271
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
It won't change anything.

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
Commander Dornan really blew up?

273
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
Literally.

274
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,440
There was no accident?

275
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,120
Doesn't look that way.

276
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,120
Was he having trouble with
anyone aboard the ship?

277
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,240
Safety officers are generally disliked.

278
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,080
They have the authority
to stick their nose

279
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
in anyone's department;
no one can say a word.

280
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,040
That sounds like Gibbs.

281
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,160
So Commander Dornan made enemies.

282
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,720
Made an art of it.

283
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Definitely sounds like Gibbs.

284
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
So I've just been pulling files
of all the people he put re...

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,360
...put on report.

286
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,680
Could be the record for a cruise.

287
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,720
How the hell did pure oxygen
accumulate in the chest cavity?

288
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
I do not know, Jethro.

289
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
I mean, lungs, I can understand.

290
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,040
The commander was receiving
oxygen through a nasal canula.

291
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,680
But the fire originated
outside the lungs in the cavity.

292
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,160
Dr. Byers!

293
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,120
You're early.

294
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,160
No traffic.

295
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
Copies of Commander
Dornan's medical records.

296
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Ah! Thank you.

297
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
We were finished, weren't we, Jethro?

298
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,360
We were, Ducky.

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,560
Ducky?

300
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,840
Yes. It's something I was tagged
with in school in my youth.

301
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
I used to resent it.

302
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
Now I quite like it.

303
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,040
So do I.

304
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
Well, have you finish the autopsy?

305
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes. Oh, oh, yes, there was one question

306
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,800
I wanted to ask you.

307
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,960
Why did you choose to perform a valve
repair as opposed to valve replacement?

308
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,800
It was a close call, but
Commander Dornan was insistent.

309
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,200
If we replaced the valve,
he wouldn't be able to

310
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,840
go back on active duty.

311
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,000
Ah, yeah. True.

312
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,400
But the team felt that the
valve was repairable, and it was.

313
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
Ironic, though, isn't it?

314
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
We saved his life only to have
him die in a freak accident.

315
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm afraid it wasn't an accident.

316
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,160
I reviewed the hospital's
surveillance tapes with security.

317
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
Between the end of visiting
hours and the fire, all but five

318
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,120
people can be identified
as hospital personnel.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
I downloaded them onto my laptop.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
You eliminating the
hospital personnel, McGee?

321
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,960
No, boss.

322
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,920
No. Definitely not.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm gonna check them all out.

324
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,680
In the meantime, I'm going
to run the five images

325
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,280
through the face-recognition system.

326
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,280
Just give me one second and I
will have them up on the plasma.

327
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Agent Cassidy.

328
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,880
Special Agent Gibbs.

329
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Agent Cassidy pulled files on everyone
Commander Dornan put on report.

330
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,880
Not a people-friendly guy.

331
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,160
Yeah, we'll have to get
into all that. You ready?

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah. My first pass at facial
recognition will be against a database

333
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
of military personnel
and government employees.

334
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
I can save you the trouble.

335
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,480
That's Ensign Evan Hayes.

336
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,480
He's in the Engineering
Department on the Kennedy.

337
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
Commander Dornan rode his ass.

338
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,320
More than the other young officers?

339
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Yeah.

340
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,040
He did not like him,
and I'm not sure why,

341
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,640
but it got so bad that Ensign
Hayes verbally threatened him.

342
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
DiNozzo, give me the
Report of Investigation.

343
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,400
There isn't one.

344
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,200
Commander Dornan asked
that I not write one up.

345
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,400
That he would handle it himself.

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,320
NCIS special agents do
not look the other way

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
because they're asked to, Agent Cassidy.

348
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
That wasn't what happened.

349
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah? What happened then?

350
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,960
I felt sorry for the kid.

351
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
He didn't deserve the abuse.

352
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
Some people can handle
it and he couldn't.

353
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
And I didn't think it
should show up on his record.

354
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,240
Get Ensign Hayes in here, Agent Cassidy.

355
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,480
DiNozzo, you go with her to make sure.

356
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Is that Dornan's surgeon with Ducky?

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,600
Ducky's older, Kate.

358
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,800
He's not dead.

359
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,360
Ensign Hayes went U-A, Agent Cassidy.

360
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
Isn't most of the ship on leave?

361
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,640
Not Ensign Hayes.

362
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,800
Commander Dornan put him on Rivet Watch.

363
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
He was restricted to the ship.

364
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,160
Two days ago, he walked off.

365
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,720
This is his quarters.

366
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,200
We've put out calls.

367
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,120
Can't find him.

368
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,200
Thank you, Chief Velat.

369
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,000
We're going to take
a little look around.

370
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,840
Scuttlebutt's Commander
Dornan was murdered...

371
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,360
...and Ensign Hayes did it.

372
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,840
You've been in the Navy long enough
to know not to listen to scuttlebutt.

373
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,400
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,125
But I wouldn't blame him.

375
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Dornan rode him from the
minute he came aboard.

376
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,080
Why do I get the feeling
you know why, Chief?

377
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,720
Captain Dornan and I both served under
Ensign Hayes' father, Captain Hayes.

378
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
Dornan was a lieutenant
then, who needed to be

379
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,200
put in his place, and,
boy, did the old man do it.

380
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,720
This cruise was payback time.

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
I got to go topside and
make a phone call. Thank you.

382
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,840
The EKG and the IVAC
recycle at timed intervals.

383
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,720
I was able to salvage the last
seven minutes of Dornan's vitals.

384
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,200
I thought you could use them.

385
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Thank you.

386
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
Are you making a statement
with this tie, Ducky?

387
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,120
Oh, too much, you think?

388
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,320
Oh, no, no, no.

389
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,480
You can pull it off.

390
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,240
So, what's the big event?

391
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,120
Dinner date?

392
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh, too... ordinary.

393
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,000
What then?

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,200
I thought I'd show her
something that reveals who I am.

395
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,240
If she gets turned on, too,
we haven't wasted our time.

396
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
You're the man, Ducky.

397
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,360
Mm.

398
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,760
Why can't I find someone like you?

399
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,720
Well, if this doesn't
work out, I am available.

400
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,240
I'll be right back.

401
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,920
Evan!

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,120
What're you still doing here?

403
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,040
You promised me you'd
go back to your ship.

404
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,280
I can't, Coach.

405
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,200
Now, come on- a two-day
absence can't be that serious.

406
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,160
It's more than that.

407
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,480
What?

408
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,280
Did you call your father?

409
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,360
No.

410
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,640
He could help you.

411
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Commander Dornan put me
through hell because of him.

412
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
You can't blame
everything on your father.

413
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,040
You've got to take
responsibility for yourself.

414
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
You're throwing away your career.

415
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,840
I... I never wanted to be in the Navy.

416
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,640
But you are.

417
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,680
Promise me you'll go back
to your ship, all right?

418
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,560
Set things straight.

419
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,640
Hey, Coach!

420
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,720
We're ready.

421
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,640
All right, all right.

422
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,120
I'll be right there.

423
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,520
Hey, you're going back.

424
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,080
Hey, Coach.

425
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,880
Thanks.

426
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Keep me posted, huh?

427
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,534
Ensign Hayes was recorded on the
hospital security tape at 0203.

428
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,840
The explosion that killed
Commander Dornan wasn't until 0317.

429
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,480
Where was he in between those
time Find him and you can ask him.

430
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
Any hits on his cell
phone or credit cards?

431
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,520
Nothing.

432
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,710
Kate, what you've learned?

433
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,280
Dornan punished Hayes with port watch.

434
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,680
He was one of the few left on board.

435
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,880
Most of the others have scattered.

436
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,080
They were away for nine months.

437
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,000
The few I could track down
haven't heard from him.

438
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,480
Ensign Hayes was your typical Navy brat.

439
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,320
His family moved around
a lot when he was young.

440
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
Went to high school in Alexandria

441
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,680
when his father was
assigned to the Pentagon.

442
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,320
Talk to the parents?

443
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,160
The mother.

444
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,720
When Captain Hayes retired,
they moved to Scottsdale.

445
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
She seemed a little
concerned because she hasn't

446
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,680
heard from her son since
the Kennedy made port.

447
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,920
E- mail his photo to the locals.

448
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,600
It's done, boss.

449
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,840
DC, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.

450
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
You need anything from
your sleeping quarters?

451
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,560
What you're thinking...

452
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,280
that's against regs.

453
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,400
Great. You can handcuff me.

454
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,800
It's not going to happen, DiNozzo.

455
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,120
We're both game players.

456
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,920
Too much alike, huh?

457
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,240
We would drive each other crazy.

458
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,200
Crazy's good.

459
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,480
Yeah.

460
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,960
Hey. What you working on?

461
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,760
Stomach contents.

462
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,360
Gastric juices and glandular secretions.

463
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
This is whacked.

464
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,680
What... is whacked?

465
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
Something's is missing
that should be here.

466
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,600
I going to have to lock you
up for the night, Commander.

467
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,040
No! Don't put me back in the dark!

468
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,160
Abby, you made me almost...

469
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,480
Made you almost what?

470
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,600
Jimmy...

471
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,760
You know what!

472
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,640
Where's Ducky?

473
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,040
He left early.

474
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,560
Can you get him on his cell?

475
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,040
Something wrong?

476
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
I guess he doesn't want to be disturbed.

477
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,560
When you asked me out, I didn't expect

478
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
to be touring the basement
of the Smithsonian.

479
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,840
This is where they prepare the exhibits.

480
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,440
Can't you just feel the history, Janice?

481
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,680
Where do we start?

482
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,480
This is my favorite.

483
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,880
These were used by army
surgeons Joseph Woodward

484
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,520
and Edward Curtis at the
postmortem of Abraham Lincoln,

485
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,160
performed in a guest
bedroom at the White House.

486
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,960
The Lincoln Bedroom, hence
the popular misconception.

487
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,600
Lincoln never slept there.

488
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,160
How do you have access to this?

489
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
Oh, I consulted on Lincoln's autopsy.

490
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,560
That is the ball fired by
Booth that killed Lincoln.

491
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,680
These bits of bone are skull fragments.

492
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
You're are an unusual man, Ducky.

493
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,600
Would you care for a bite to eat?

494
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,360
We just got here.

495
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,400
How does a woman like
you end up in the Navy?

496
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
My father's a retired
Chief Petty Officer.

497
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,200
You ever contemplate private practice?

498
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,280
Actually, my obligation
to the Navy is up.

499
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm leaving next month to accept
an offer from Columbia Pres.

500
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,760
New York.

501
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,520
Now that is exciting.

502
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,720
Thanks.

503
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,680
NCIS, Special Agent McGee speaking...

504
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,480
Thanks.

505
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,200
What?

506
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,000
Why are you being so,
tough on Agent Cassidy?

507
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,640
I haven't done anything to her yet.

508
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,040
You made her spend the
day, alone, with DiNozzo.

509
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,200
She survived. They're on their way back.

510
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,280
Wait, boss, one second.

511
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,080
Okay. Got it.

512
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,680
Thank you, ma'am.

513
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,560
Ensign Hayes just made a
charge on his credit card.

514
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,120
A hotel on Braddock Road, Alexandria.

515
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,080
Contact DiNozzo and Cassidy.

516
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,040
Have them meet us there.

517
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,640
You man the phones.

518
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,000
Kate, come on. Let's go.

519
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Gibbs, NCIS.

520
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,000
May I see that, please?

521
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,800
Okay. What can I do
for you, Agent Gibbs?

522
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,760
You just checked in an Evan
Hayes. What room's he in?

523
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
It would be illegal to
release that information.

524
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,760
We're investigating a crime
and we need to speak with him.

525
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,920
Then I suggest you get a warrant.

526
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,800
Hayes is in the United States Navy.

527
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,480
As you just saw, I'm a Special Agent

528
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
with the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

529
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,200
I don't need a civilian warrant.

530
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,200
You are absolutely correct there, sir.

531
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
You need the military
equivalent, a DD-553.

532
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,760
You a law student?

533
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,600
Second year at Georgetown.

534
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,280
Gonna give you a lesson
tonight in practical law.

535
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,240
I'm going to ask for
Hayes's room key, politely,

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,880
and you're going to hand it over.

537
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,840
Key? Hotels haven't used keys in years.

538
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,520
If he has to wake up a judge,
nobody is going to be happy.

539
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,360
Okay. But announce yourself first.

540
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,560
That's in compliance with the
recent Supreme Court decision.

541
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,640
All right, Tony, you're with me.

542
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Kate, seal off the hallway.

543
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Paul, you got the service elevator.

544
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,640
We announce, and then we go in.

545
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,080
Okay.

546
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
NCIS! Get your hands up!

547
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,840
Get your hands in the air.

548
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,640
Up, up, up!

549
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,160
Get 'em up!

550
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,680
Party's over.

551
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,120
Get up!

552
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,640
Where's Ensign Hayes?

553
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,360
Put your hands down.

554
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,120
One of you checked in as Evan Hayes.

555
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,800
DiNozzo, search them
and find the credit card.

556
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,320
Let's see some I.D.

557
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,320
Just give it to him, Jonathon!

558
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,200
Thank you, Jonathon.

559
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,280
Where'd you get this?

560
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,280
A guy gave it to me.

561
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,080
Gonna have to do better
than that, Jonathon.

562
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Look, I swear it's the truth.

563
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,360
Okay, we were hanging out after swim
practice and this strange guy just walked in.

564
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,240
Really spaced.

565
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,760
He... he just handed
me the card and said

566
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,920
that we should have a good time with it.

567
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,640
That he didn't need it anymore.

568
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,600
It's true, mister. He was
trying to get rid of us.

569
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
He said he wanted to use the pool.

570
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
And you didn't think
that was a little weird?

571
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,840
Well, yeah, but, I mean, he said
could party with his credit card.

572
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,720
Where's the pool?

573
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,520
Alexandria Central High.

574
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,080
Agent Cassidy!

575
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,480
You and DiNozzo baby-sit these
people until their parents get here.

576
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,960
And collect their car keys.

577
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
Aw... Come on, man.

578
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Nobody likes a whiner, Jonathon.

579
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,920
Nice shirt.

580
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,880
See? I knew we'd end up
in a hotel room tonight.

581
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,240
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

582
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,560
Get down on your stomach.

583
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,440
Spread your arms and legs. Quickly.

584
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm done taking orders.

585
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Do it now, Ensign Hayes!

586
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
No, son. You don't want to do that.

587
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,040
Then put the weapon down.

588
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,240
Can't.

589
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I've got to cover my partner.

590
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,400
Isn't that right, Kate?

591
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,760
Right.

592
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,920
A woman?

593
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,160
I would never hurt a woman.

594
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,680
Okay.

595
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm holstering my weapon, okay?

596
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,520
All right, your turn.

597
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
I've been trying to pull
this trigger all night...

598
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,880
but I can't...

599
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
'cause I'm a coward.

600
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,080
You're not a coward.

601
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,120
You just don't want to die.

602
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,120
I can't spend the rest of
my life taking his orders.

603
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,040
Commander Dornan pushed a lot of
people's buttons. Not just yours.

604
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
Commander Dornan...

605
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,080
he's... he's not my problem anymore.

606
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,560
This is the only place I ever felt safe.

607
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,960
It's the only place, I was ever happy.

608
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,560
All right. Let's talk about it.

609
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,520
It's too late to talk.

610
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:12,320
Don't do it.

611
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,520
That's Evan.

612
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,480
He was troubled...

613
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,800
...but I had no idea he was suicidal.

614
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,360
He was suspected of murder.

615
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,560
Murder?

616
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,040
Evan? No way.

617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,240
We think he killed a superior officer
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital Tuesday.

618
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,160
Tuesday?

619
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:52,920
When?

620
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
A little after 03:00.

621
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,720
3:00 a.m.?

622
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,800
That's impossible.

623
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,360
He was with me.

624
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,920
He called.

625
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,920
He woke me and my wife up.

626
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,440
He wasn't making any sense.

627
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I told him I'd come get him.

628
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
I picked him up in front
of the hospital around 2:00.

629
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,880
You must have the wrong time.

630
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,520
No, I'm certain.

631
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Well, it's not possible because...

632
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
Agent Todd, I'll meet
you up in the squad room.

633
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,040
No, Gibbs, that would mean...

634
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,040
How long were you with him?

635
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,200
We sat up talking all night.

636
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,680
About what?

637
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,560
Mostly his father.

638
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
They had a lot of problems.

639
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,000
Ensign Hayes tell you why
he was at the hospital?

640
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,080
Said he wanted to confront
someone who was giving him

641
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,200
a hard time, but he lost his nerve.

642
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,720
Ensign Hayes has an alibi?

643
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,200
What's going to happen?

644
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,720
Nothing. You did everything by the book.

645
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,120
I killed an innocent man, Gibbs.

646
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,920
It was
suicide-by-cop, Kate.

647
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,920
Get over it.

648
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
We focused on the wrong guy.

649
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,760
No one went in or out of
Commander Dornan's room

650
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,600
between the time the corpsman
checked up on him and the explosion.

651
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,240
What about the corpsman?

652
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,200
I checked his record
against the commander's.

653
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Their paths never crossed until
the commander came in for surgery.

654
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,920
There were four others on the
security video you couldn't identify.

655
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
Right. I've cleared three of them.

656
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
One is still unknown.

657
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,360
And I'm on it.

658
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,800
Go back to the ship.

659
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,720
Go over your files again.

660
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,280
Agent Gibbs, I need to explain...

661
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,880
There's nothing to
explain, Agent Cassidy.

662
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,600
You didn't file a report.

663
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,640
Now two naval officers are dead.

664
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,200
Would it have mattered?

665
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,520
We'll never know.

666
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,560
DiNozzo, go down to the lab.

667
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,200
Go over all the physical evidence
from the hospital room again.

668
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
Uh, what am I looking for?

669
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,480
I'll figure it out.

670
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,760
Good morning, Mr. Palmer.

671
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Oh. Is that the Ensign Agent Todd shot?

672
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,560
Yes, sir.

673
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,920
Oh, dear.

674
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,520
Oh, Abby wanted you to see
this as soon as you got in.

675
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,720
Mr. Palmer, I want Commander
Dornan's remains back on the table.

676
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
Kate, how are you?

677
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,120
Well, I shot an innocent
man, That give you you ideas?

678
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,120
I'm sorry.

679
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,840
I need a service record.

680
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,680
Stop playing with my equipment.

681
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,080
Well, I haven't had a woman
say that to me in a long time.

682
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,320
Sorry.

683
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
You break anything, you're dead meat.

684
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,200
What you working on?

685
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,040
Evidence analysis report, DiNozzo.

686
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,120
I think you misspelled...
tetrafluoroethylene.

687
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm a great speller.

688
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,720
Don't you have somewhere else to be?

689
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,680
Gibbs told me to go
through physical evidence.

690
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,520
Oh, he expects you to find
something that I didn't?

691
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,720
Just another set of eyes, Abbs.

692
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,960
I really need to finish this.

693
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,200
Sorry.

694
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
Dornan's personal effects?

695
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,360
Yeah.

696
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,520
Ooh.

697
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,520
He didn't only have heart
problems, this guy was blind.

698
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,440
Did you find any trace of cigarette ash?

699
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
In an oxygen fire?

700
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,680
I don't think so.

701
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,600
Wait.

702
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,200
I did find something that
might be a cigarette filter...

703
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,840
Abby...

704
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,160
I think I know how
the oxygen was ignited.

705
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,840
Here's the service record
you asked for, Ducky.

706
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Thanks.

707
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,480
Thanks, Kate.

708
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,480
Abby, what do you got for me?

709
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:41,920
Not me.

710
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,080
Cecil B. DiNozzo.

711
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,040
Stalag 17.

712
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
GI uses a cigarette as a time
fuse to blow up a Nazi train.

713
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,280
Come on, guys.

714
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Don't try this at home, McGee.

715
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,480
It's for grownups.

716
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,600
DiNozzo...

717
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,000
How do people do this?

718
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Okay, cigarette becomes a time fuse.

719
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,720
Check this.

720
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,560
In real time, it takes about 12
minutes for it to reach the matches.

721
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,760
Cool, huh?

722
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,680
The killer placed it next to Dornan's side, under
the tented sheet, next to the open oxygen line.

723
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,160
Then he left the room.

724
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,280
Who was there 12
minutes before the fire?

725
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,120
Dr. Byers.

726
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,680
She was the one who murdered him?

727
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,840
He wasn't murdered.

728
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,440
Commander Dornan died as
a result of his surgery.

729
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
Only Dr. Byers made it
look as if he was murdered.

730
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
Who was she trying to frame?

731
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:48,880
No one.

732
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
She was covering her mistake.

733
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,400
In 1995, she was the subject of a malpractice
investigation on a heart valve repair,

734
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,720
almost identical to the one
she performed on the commander.

735
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,600
So how do you know that he was
dead before the fire started?

736
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,640
I compared Dornan's previous
EKG's to the last IVAC recording.

737
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,160
That heartbeat wasn't his.

738
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,920
She still could have murdered him.

739
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,160
Well, not intentionally.

740
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,200
Duck...

741
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,520
You trust my gut on this one.

742
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,640
Everything is fine.

743
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,720
Ducky, what a pleasant surprise.

745
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Special Agent Gibbs.

746
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,720
Janice, there was no Percocet
in Commander Dornan's stomach.

747
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,440
I'm glad it's over.

748
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
Dornan was in pain and
demanding to see me.

749
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,840
I rushed to the hospital,
did an echocardiogram,

750
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,480
and realized not replacing
the valve was a mistake.

751
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:02,880
It was failing.

752
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,040
Why didn't you operate immediately?

753
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,120
When I told him, he became hysterical.

754
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
He went into cardiac arrest.

755
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,800
I tried to resuscitate him...

756
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,080
but couldn't.

757
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,560
A second failed valve repair would end
my career and the job at Columbia Pres.

758
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,280
I panicked.

759
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,680
I tried to cover up.

760
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,360
I placed the EKG
sensors on my own chest.

761
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,120
I turned off the audible
alarm, cleared the record data

762
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,920
and reset the time/date stamp ahead 15
minutes, disconnected the oxygen tube

763
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,680
from his nasal canula and
inserted it into his incision

764
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,520
so the oxygen could
accumulate in his chest cavity.

765
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,200
Then using one of his own
cigarettes and a matchbook...

766
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,480
I placed it on the bed.

767
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,960
On my way out, I stopped the
nurses' stationand told them that

768
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,200
I had sedated him and he was resting
and to check on him in a half hour.

769
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,160
Janice...

770
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,680
...you didn't kill him.

771
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,080
But I did...

772
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,440
by not replacing the
valve in the first place.

773
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,320
This is Paula.

774
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,000
Leave a message.

775
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,080
Hey, it's me.

776
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,920
Come on, just cause you're pissed at Gibbs
is no reason not to return my calls, right?

777
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,680
So dial the number,
'cause you've got it. Okay.

778
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
Sometimes, you've just got
to know when to let go, Tony.

779
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,560
You don't really expect me to take
advice about women from you, do you?

780
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,520
I could stay here and argue
the point, but I have a date.

781
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,280
So now what?

782
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,760
I don't know.

783
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,680
You can't let any woman
affect you like this, Duck.

784
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,200
Especially one you
didn't know that well.

785
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,080
My concerns are more immediate.

786
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,000
I have two tickets
for the opera tonight.

787
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,120
She was going to accompany me.

788
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,320
Jethro?

789
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,040
No.

790
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,360
I wonder if Kate would be interested.

791
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,720
Do you know where she is?

792
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,000
No.
