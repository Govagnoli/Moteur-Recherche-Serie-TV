1
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,996
- <i>Well, what do you want?</i>
- l don't care. Whatever you want.

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,725
- <i>You don't care?</i>
- l didn't mean that.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,242
- l'm not that picky.
- <i>How come l always have the ideas?</i>

4
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,875
Why don't you make that thing
you made the first night?

5
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:18,642
- <i>What was that thing l made?</i>
- lt had a green sauce, right?

6
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:21,162
- <i>You don't even know, do you?</i>
- Do we have to do this now?

7
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,397
- <i>You never remember anything.</i>
- lt's our anniversary.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,041
<i>You never listen to me,</i>
<i>you bastard.</i>

9
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:29,406
<i>Jerry.</i>

10
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,639
<i>Jerry.</i>

11
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,400
- Finish that database?
- Yesterday.

12
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,237
Then it should have been
on my desk yesterday.

13
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,967
l didn't realise a compilation
of nudie bars was that urgent.

14
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,236
Well, it is.

15
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,880
- Why?
- l don't have to explain myself.

16
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,966
- Okay, is this work-related, because--?
- But l will just this once.

17
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,118
lt's a mercy mission, probie.

18
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:41,646
A buddy of mine is getting married

19
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,559
to a particularly unpleasant
beast of a woman.

20
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,684
- So?
- So?

21
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,082
So the memory
of his bachelor party

22
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,800
will be the only thing
that sustains him

23
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,878
through the rest
of his miserable existence.

24
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,038
l'll print it out
as soon as l'm finished with this.

25
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,203
On behalf of men everywhere,
we thank you, probie.

26
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,402
What are you working on?

27
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,364
l'm reviewing
my credit card statement.

28
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,165
There appears
to be some anomalies.

29
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,682
Fifty DVD copies
of <i>Forrest Hump?</i>

30
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,957
Yeah, see, l don't even know
what a <i>Forrest Hump</i> is.

31
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,641
Well, it's like <i>Forrest Gump</i>
with naked people, probie.

32
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,724
- What?
- lt's a porno

33
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,526
or so l've been told.

34
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:15,838
This is obviously an error
with the credit card company.

35
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,759
Or it's identity theft.

36
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,195
No. lt's not possible.

37
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,916
l use a secure browser
and the latest firewall protection.

38
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,925
Look at that, a $5,000 charge
from John Deere.

39
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,277
A down payment on that combine
you've always dreamed of.

40
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,085
Put the farm equipment on hold.

41
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:32,357
A sailor was shot on Route 249.

42
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,995
Tony, grab the gear. Green Acres.

43
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,323
Gas the truck.
Where the hell is David?

44
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,766
- Boss, Officer David is--
- Late.

45
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,320
l took the wrong bus this morning.

46
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,245
Had to walk
from the 1 8th Street stop.

47
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:45,562
That's a tough part of town.

48
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,679
l've been in worse.
Won't happen again, Gibbs.

49
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:49,996
l know.

50
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,042
Special Agent Gibbs?

51
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:06,604
No, he's the older gentleman
with the smile on his face.

52
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,005
Agent Gibbs,
car's in the crevice at the bottom.

53
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,163
The victim's dead inside.

54
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,045
Lieutenant Hampton,
Virginia State Police.

55
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,840
The last few yards are pretty steep.

56
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,517
One of the EMTs managed
to make it all the way down.

57
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,724
The fire department's bringing special
equipment to extricate the body.

58
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:27,922
lt's gonna take a while.

59
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:31,483
McGee. Sketch. Get close enough
without breaking your neck.

60
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,962
- On it.
- DiNozzo, photos.

61
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,556
ls there a problem?

62
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,285
You didn't say anything
about my neck.

63
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:39,996
But l'll be careful.

64
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:42,926
What about me?

65
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,282
- Who called it in?
- His wife.

66
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,324
She was on the phone with him
when it happened.

67
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,603
Officer David, take her statement.

68
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,644
l should warn you
l'm not very good with women.

69
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:54,877
That'll make two things
you're not very good at today.

70
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:57,117
- And the first?
- Being on time.

71
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:01,286
- l'm sorry for the delay, Jethro.
- Traffic, it was murder.

72
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,239
Sorry, poor choice of words there.

73
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,806
See what you can get, Duck.

74
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,124
- He's trapped in there pretty good.
- Oh, we'll do our best.

75
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:11,046
l hope you brought more
appropriate footwear, Mr. Palmer.

76
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,239
The journey to our petty officer
looks rather challenging.

77
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,677
Don't worry, doctor.
l have a merit badge in hiking.

78
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,923
l have a driver's licence, Mr. Palmer.

79
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,762
lt doesn't mean l turn up
at lndianapolis in my Morgan.

80
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,478
You were on the phone with him
when he was shot?

81
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,406
He couldn't remember pesto
and it pissed me off.

82
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,758
How stupid is that?

83
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,839
Could you tell me how many shots?

84
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,877
Do you know what the last words
l said to him were?

85
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,766
l called him a bastard.

86
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:53,001
And l can't take it back.

87
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,806
Not now, l can't.

88
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:08,119
lf it's any consolation, probie,
l had my identity stolen once.

89
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,444
- Really?
- l had a charge on my Visa

90
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,996
for a vintage Barbie doll.

91
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,600
Career Girl outfit.

92
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,719
With the matching briefcase
and pumps?

93
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:26,721
l had a girlfriend who collected once.
We used to line them up on the--

94
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,316
l lost respect for you
at the word ''pumps.''

95
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,076
Get back to work.

96
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,318
lt's kind of hard to sketch
from this distance.

97
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:35,796
Don't get any closer.
lt gets steeper as it gets deeper.

98
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,320
One false move and--

99
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,406
Look out.

100
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,243
Good hustle, Palmer.

101
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:49,076
No skid marks. He didn't attempt
to control the car before it went over.

102
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,881
They were having an argument
over a six-month anniversary.

103
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,362
l don't understand the half-year thing.
l thought perhaps--

104
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,961
l don't understand anniversaries,
period.

105
00:05:58,207 --> 00:05:59,640
Apparently, neither did her husband.

106
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,236
She was screaming at him
when she heard a loud gunshot

107
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:03,635
followed by the crash.

108
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,803
- What else?
- She could hear a low moan

109
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,197
for a few minutes after impact.

110
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,404
Oh, yeah. l think it's sprained, guys.

111
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,804
Oh, Dr. Mallard's gonna be upset,
isn't he?

112
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,360
Wouldn't worry about him.

113
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,445
But if Gibbs sees you wearing loafers
at a crime scene...

114
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,440
He'll pretty much kill you dead.

115
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,802
They were having
a little trouble with the help.

116
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,679
Nothing for you to worry about.

117
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,639
lt's gonna take more time
than usual,

118
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,640
but we're gonna get you out of there,
l promise.

119
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,755
ls anybody gonna join me
down here?

120
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,645
Well, Gibbs said not to get too close.

121
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah, you really shouldn't be
down there, Ducky. lt's not safe.

122
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,197
The exit wound
to the petty officer's neck

123
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:05,285
seems to indicate
the bullet went straight through.

124
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,079
There could be a spent round

125
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,364
that might be crucial
to our investigation.

126
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:15,480
Well, as you've pointed out many
times, l'm just a junior field agent.

127
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,723
All the more reason
you need the experience, probie.

128
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,716
How about l follow in your footsteps?
You lead the way.

129
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:24,566
How about you kiss
my experienced buttocks?

130
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,043
Am l gonna have to call Jethro
on this one, gentlemen?

131
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:29,356
No, we're good.

132
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,558
The chances of finding
that bullet are--

133
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,280
One in a million.

134
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,715
You've got to see this, Gibbs.

135
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,838
The grooves made that pattern.

136
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:41,877
lt's the exact same design as the cover
of Classic Death's second CD.

137
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,525
Don't tell me you don't know
Classic Death,

138
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:46,917
- because it's my favourite--
- Not now, Abby.

139
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,361
But it could be a sign, Gibbs.

140
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,842
Like that tortilla skillet
with the image of Jesus in it.

141
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,079
- They thought that was a miracle.
- lt'll be a miracle if you still have a job

142
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,805
if you don't get back on topic.

143
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,925
l see your point, O Great One.

144
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,164
This is me getting back on topic.

145
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,638
Nine millimetre, 1 20 grain.

146
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:05,439
The window was rolled up
when he was shot.

147
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,239
- Glass?
- There's traces in the rifling.

148
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,965
- Manufacturer?
- Can't tell.

149
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,556
l'm gonna plug this
into the FBl's Drugfire database

150
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,366
- and see if l get a match, but--
- But it's gonna take a while.

151
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,319
See? Mind reading.

152
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:19,041
There may be something supernatural
going on here.

153
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,160
Let me know
when you have something.

154
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,637
l bet l could sell this on eBay.
Did you know they got 28 grand

155
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,839
for the grilled cheese sandwich with
the image of the Virgin Mary on it?

156
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:31,075
Gibbs?

157
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,921
Preliminary trajectory shows
that the bullet passed straight

158
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,406
through the driver's side window.

159
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:39,486
So l recommend we search the area
along this path looking for spent brass.

160
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,802
You won't find it.

161
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:44,795
Nine-millimetre rounds are slow
and only accurate to about 30 metres.

162
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,441
The shooter was in a moving car
that pulled up alongside.

163
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,959
Yeah, that is one possibility, Ziva.
But, you see,

164
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,477
we're investigators, which means we
investigate things, we don't assume.

165
00:08:57,247 --> 00:09:00,159
She's right. Wife said she heard
the gunshot over the phone.

166
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,005
- The shooter had to be close.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,520
What about Petty Officer Smith?

168
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,560
l ran his military lD.
He was a clerk at Norfolk.

169
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,485
Had four months left
before his discharge.

170
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,922
Tony, take Ziva with you
and check with the C.O.

171
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,283
When you're done,
sweep the trajectory for brass.

172
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,844
- But why? You just said l--
- Because DiNozzo's right too.

173
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:23,960
All of these people
are in the military?

174
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,924
Yeah, the uniforms
are kind of a dead giveaway.

175
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,719
Then why aren't they armed?

176
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,559
Because we're in America,

177
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,038
and the machine guns
would just get in the way.

178
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,926
All right. Okay.

179
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:38,355
- Commander.
- What can l do for NClS today?

180
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,639
Sorry to have to tell you this but one
of your men was killed this morning.

181
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,838
My God, who?

182
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,515
- Petty Officer Jerry Smith.
- Smith?

183
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,116
He was shot on Route 249
on his way into work.

184
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,197
l think you have my man confused
with someone else.

185
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:55,685
That's Petty Officer Jerry Smith
right over there.

186
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,880
Why would anyone
want to impersonate me?

187
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:13,523
Let's see. Blackmail, espionage,
terrorism, potential assassination.

188
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,200
l'm just-- l'm just a clerk, ma'am.

189
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,323
l don't even have
a security clearance or anything.

190
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:20,644
- What kind of a clerk?
- l'm in a supply unit. l'm an SK2.

191
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,043
l'm new to NClS, petty officer.

192
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,839
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

193
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:28,517
Well, well--
Basically, l'm just a storekeeper.

194
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:35,204
Like today, l filled requests for tp,
liquid soap, toilet seat covers.

195
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:39,320
We call it ''Getting a Head Day.''

196
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,436
Because in the Navy,
the head is another word--

197
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:44,285
For the toilet. Yes, l know.

198
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,523
This has something to do
with your personal life?

199
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,958
Well, probably not.
l don't really have one.

200
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:54,843
l mean, most nights l just go home
and surf the web or watch reality TV.

201
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,481
Really into <i>Survivor. Average Joe</i>.

202
00:10:57,687 --> 00:11:00,963
<i>The Amazing Race</i> is cool.
l like <i>Extreme Makeover</i>, but--

203
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,317
- l don't own a TV.
- Really?

204
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,404
l don't think l've ever
met anyone who didn't--

205
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,240
What does your wife think
about all this nightly stimulation?

206
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,836
l don't have a wife.
No girlfriend either.

207
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:15,166
l just don't really seem to do very well
in that department.

208
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,516
lt's just me and Max.

209
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,763
- Max is your boyfriend?
- No. No.

210
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,322
Jeez,
l'm like as straight as they come.

211
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,803
- Max is a marmoset.
- A monkey.

212
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,599
A pet. Nothing more.

213
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:29,117
That's reassuring, petty officer.

214
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,125
A buddy of mine was shipping out.
He was in a bit of a bind.

215
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:35,922
l said no way, but when l got
one look at the little guy...

216
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,444
He's just so damn cute, ma'am.

217
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,644
Petty Officer Smith
was transferred from Pearl

218
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,559
about the same time l was,
Agent DiNozzo.

219
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,723
- You serve with him there?
- Different units.

220
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,599
We never crossed paths
until this command.

221
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,958
- What kind of a sailor is he?
- Officially, he's never missed work.

222
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:54,276
He's always on time.

223
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:58,046
l'm more interested in unofficially,
commander.

224
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:01,042
lt's not in my nature
to be disparaging.

225
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,560
Well, l've got a body
lying on a slab back at NClS.

226
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,446
So by all means, disparage away.

227
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,361
l guess you could say Petty Officer
Smith is not the brightest sailor

228
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,676
that l've ever commanded.

229
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:23,797
Now that l say it out loud, the thought
occurs to me that could be the reason

230
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:27,118
someone found it so easy
to steal his identity.

231
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,125
Can you think of any reason

232
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,118
why someone
would want to impersonate him?

233
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,081
God, no, Agent DiNozzo. God, no.

234
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,086
More porno?

235
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,679
What do we have, McGee?

236
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,481
Three more charges
since yesterday.

237
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,000
Sorry. Sorry, boss.

238
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,044
Cell phone records
are downloading now.

239
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,363
Okay, it looks like
Petty Officer Smith--

240
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,081
Officer Smith in the car,
not the one on base who's the real--

241
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,402
Yeah, l got it, McGee.

242
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,400
Well, he was definitely talking
to Mrs. Smith, if that is her real name.

243
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,040
McGee.

244
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,603
He was talking to her
at their home from his cell

245
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,918
just before she called in the accident.
l've got an address here.

246
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:16,035
lt's an apartment in Newport News.

247
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:19,000
- Lease is in the wife's name.
- Ziva, you're with me.

248
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,524
Possibly a point man for an operational
reconnaissance of the naval base.

249
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:24,962
- l--
- That means you go with him.

250
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,725
- Now.
- Before the elevator doors close.

251
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,961
You just hung up
on Director Shepard.

252
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,636
ln my country, the officer in charge
is always treated with--

253
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,002
ln my country, on my team,
working my cases,

254
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,681
my people don't bypass
the chain of command.

255
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,206
- Which is?
- Me.

256
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:03,123
Are we clear on that, Officer David?

257
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,962
Crystal, Agent Gibbs.

258
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:20,405
Except she called me.
What would you have me do?

259
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:26,480
Smile. Talk about the weather.
Tell her to call me.

260
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,086
And if that doesn't work?

261
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,120
You're a smart girl.
Think of something.

262
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,485
- l am merely trying to do my job.
- Your job is to follow my instructions.

263
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,957
And l respect that. ls it too much
to ask for some in return?

264
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,839
No. lt's not.

265
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,004
So that's it?

266
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,166
Don't l even get a slap on the head?

267
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,402
Don't push it.

268
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,081
Just to be clear, are there any more
of these rules l should be aware of?

269
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:07,402
About 50 of them.

270
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:11,085
And l don't suppose
they're written down

271
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,158
- anywhere that l could--
- No.

272
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:17,242
- Then how am l supposed to--?
- My job is to teach them to you.

273
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,359
No picture of your husband
in uniform?

274
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,798
Jerry hated the Navy.

275
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,919
He only joined for the money
they'd give him for college.

276
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,640
But he couldn't wait to get out.

277
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:42,203
l was so mean to him on the phone.

278
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,924
lt was our half anniversary.

279
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,722
We know. A very special occasion.

280
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,918
Why can't men understand that?

281
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,517
Your husband talk
about his work much, Mrs. Smith?

282
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,485
Never.

283
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,721
He wouldn't even let me visit him
on base or even call him there.

284
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,440
You never saw him at his work?

285
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,600
You never dropped him off?

286
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,798
l told you he hated the Navy.

287
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,801
Every morning, he'd put on his uniform
and go to the office.

288
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,926
Soon as he got home,
couldn't get out of it fast enough.

289
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:19,280
You didn't know Jerry long
before you married, did you?

290
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,246
Only three months.

291
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,286
l know. lt was crazy.

292
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:28,445
lt just felt right, you know?

293
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:33,675
Jerry was the first truly decent man
l had ever met.

294
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,000
What's going on here?

295
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,719
This is Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

296
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:47,884
He's been working at Norfolk
for about four months.

297
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,884
His commanding officer
confirmed it.

298
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,918
He look familiar?

299
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,765
l don't know this man.

300
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,757
l don't understand.

301
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,923
Neither do we.

302
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:03,402
Discolouration
indicates blunt-force trauma.

303
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:08,118
Yes, these abdominal bruises here
in this area

304
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,603
are consistent with the door frame
crushing against his body.

305
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,765
You think Epsom salt
reduces swelling faster?

306
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,966
Mr. Palmer, l'm sure our mystery guest
would appreciate it

307
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:21,083
if you could concentrate
all your efforts

308
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:24,045
on helping me to discover
the cause of his demise

309
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:28,280
rather than obsessing on how
you will look in shorts this weekend.

310
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:29,806
- Sorry, doctor.
- Actually,

311
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,205
l found the ladies tend to be
sympathetic towards visible injury.

312
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,398
- Really?
- Yes. My first year in college,

313
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,679
l suffered an unfortunate injury
to my testicles.

314
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:46,883
The excruciating pain was offset
by an impressive swelling

315
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,198
which Ramona Kincaid--

316
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,920
Bless her heart.

317
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,484
--found extremely fascinating.

318
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,485
Yeah.

319
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:13,562
Now, the bullet wound to the neck
evaded the anterior triangle,

320
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,679
thus missing both
the carotid artery and jugular vein.

321
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,286
Most of the damage was muscular.

322
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,884
lt also grazed
the oesophagus and thyroid.

323
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:27,480
Oh, dear. Severe damage
to the liver, pancreas, spleen.

324
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:33,324
Oh, and there's a nasty tear to the left
ventricle caused by a bruised rib.

325
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,916
Cause of death
is from the trauma of the crash.

326
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,039
You just earned yourself
another merit badge, Mr. Palmer.

327
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,483
He was alive for several minutes
after he was shot.

328
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:47,157
Sorry to have to say it, my poor fellow,
but you'd have been better off

329
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:51,002
if your assassin had been
a more precise marksman.

330
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:10,843
This case reminds me of something
my father used to tell me as a child.

331
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,716
''Really, Ziva? What was that?''

332
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:19,955
He would say that no one

333
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,796
could ever truly know another person
or their secrets.

334
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,761
l, of course, refused to believe him.

335
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,282
''And now, Ziva?''

336
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,843
As an adult,

337
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,520
l believe he was never
more honest with me.

338
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,763
What do you believe, Gibbs?

339
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:47,921
l think l really got to get the radio
in this car fixed.

340
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,086
- Yeah, Abby?
- <i>l've got a match</i>

341
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,800
on the dead guy's prints, Gibbs.

342
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,646
- <i>From the AFlS database.</i>
- He's in the military?

343
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,122
- Anchors aweigh, Gibbs-o.
- <i>Who?</i>

344
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,080
You're not gonna believe it.

345
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,606
- Try me.
- <i>You're not.</i>

346
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:07,720
- Who the hell is he, Abs?
- Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

347
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,600
He actually
is Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

348
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,958
He's stationed at the Regional
Supply Office in Norfolk.

349
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,164
Okay, the dead guy downstairs
who we thought was impersonating

350
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:28,205
Petty Officer Jerry Smith is actually
the real Petty Officer Jerry Smith.

351
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,517
And that Jerry Smith
Tony and Ziva talked to in Norfolk

352
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:33,685
turns out to be the fake Jerry Smith,
and it's confusing.

353
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,526
Like the pellet with the poison's
in the vessel with the pestle--

354
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,847
The chalice from the palace
has the brew that is true.

355
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,285
<i>Court Jester?</i> Danny Kaye?
Come on, guys, it's a classic.

356
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,079
- Thank you, boss.
- Who is he, McGee?

357
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,847
John Kirby. We lifted his prints
from his desk at Norfolk.

358
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,436
His empty desk.
He didn't report for duty today.

359
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:54,003
He and Smith had overlapping tours
at Jacksonville in '02.

360
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,038
- Kirby was discharged in '03.
- Honourably.

361
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:59,125
These guys had this planned from the
first day of Smith's new assignment.

362
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,515
Think so, McGee?

363
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,319
- l'm gonna need Kirby's--
- Address.

364
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,916
He lives on West Little Creek.
Been there about a year.

365
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,482
And the warrant.

366
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,440
- DiNozzo, David, take a ride.
- You got it, boss.

367
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,922
Get a BOLO out on Kirby
with the FBl, local and state.

368
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,600
- Already done, Boss.
- BOLO?

369
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,399
''Be on the lookout.''

370
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:19,402
Good job, McGee.
Go on. Catch up to them.

371
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:24,037
- ''Good job, McGee.''
- ls he always this juvenile?

372
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:26,198
Only on days of the week
ending with the word ''day.''

373
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:30,401
- l'll drive, Tony.
- No, no, no.

374
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:31,920
Not gonna make that mistake again.

375
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:34,357
Did you really think
my driving was that terrible?

376
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,717
Aside from the high speed
and near misses.

377
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:40,078
Let's just say it's an acquired taste,
like regurgitated lunch.

378
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,801
- That's disgusting, DiNozzo.
- Tell me about it, probie.

379
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:46,044
That chilli cheese dog was hard
to chew the second time around.

380
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,965
Maybe we should give her
another chance.

381
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,680
lt's not like she killed
or maimed anyone.

382
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,281
Maybe we should concentrate
on why John Kirby switched places

383
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:56,201
with Seaman Smith at Norfolk,
and leave death wish for another day.

384
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:59,240
- He could very well be an assassin.
- He works in a supply office.

385
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,324
Who's he gonna assassinate?
Mr. Clean?

386
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,757
All the better not
to draw attention to himself.

387
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,117
Well, she's right.
lt's a big base. A lot of targets.

388
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,726
l don't know. Look at the guy.

389
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,645
- He's such a--
- Pimp.

390
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,486
- Wimp.
- Wimp.

391
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,362
Very much in line
with other assassins.

392
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,682
She's right, Tony.

393
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:18,321
Look at Lee Harvey Oswald,
Sirhan Sirhan.

394
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,445
That's original, McGee. ls there
any part of your brain that's your own?

395
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:24,960
At least l have one, Tony.

396
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,965
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

397
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,680
We're not going anywhere.

398
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:33,357
- What, until l apologise?
- No, not until you apologise.

399
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:36,800
We're in the wrong damn car.

400
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:40,917
- What'd you find, Abs?
- After the car crashed,

401
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,681
it went end over end
for about a hundred feet

402
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,202
before finally slamming to a stop
up against a boulder,

403
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,323
which crushed the driver's side door
into his body,

404
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:53,486
which led to a lot of blood.
l also found these in the trunk,

405
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:56,918
three identical sets of Hawaiian shirts
and khaki pants.

406
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,163
Correction.
Did you find anything useful?

407
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,244
Maybe. But it's probably nothing.

408
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,360
Do not make me say
a magic word now, Abs.

409
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,037
Of course not. But it is a cool idea.

410
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:09,441
lt's in the blood patterns.

411
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:13,759
The residual splatter
from where the blood struck is there.

412
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,639
Exit-wound splatter is there.

413
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,717
Dropping slightly
from the angle of the impact.

414
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,440
Normal when they pass
through flesh.

415
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:21,921
Very good, Gibbs.

416
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:25,722
But that would be the case
of a senior lead special agent

417
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,918
who's worked hundreds
of crime scene investigations

418
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:29,236
throughout his storied career.

419
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,716
l'd hate to start smacking you
like l do DiNozzo.

420
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,236
You wouldn't. You would?

421
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,926
lt won't be on the head.

422
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:43,882
The blood here is darker,
and the pattern is random.

423
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,604
Skip to the ''probably nothing'' part,
will you?

424
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,565
The trail of splattering
is wider than you'd expect.

425
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:53,521
And the blood is smeared
somewhat here

426
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,166
like something
brushed up against it.

427
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,086
- What?
- l have absolutely no idea.

428
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,164
That would be
the probably nothing part.

429
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,319
l haven't analysed it
in my computer yet.

430
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,761
Do it.

431
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,402
Oh, l love Hawaiian shirts.

432
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:13,801
l'm not surprised.

433
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:16,805
lt's a cultural experience
you couldn't appreciate.

434
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:19,805
- lsn't that right, probie?
- l wouldn't be caught dead in one.

435
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,518
lt can't be.

436
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,638
Do you realise what we have here?

437
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,041
Another ugly shirt?

438
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,925
lt's an authentic <i>Magnum, P.l.</i>
Jungle Bird design.

439
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:34,595
Hundred percent cotton,
bamboo buttons,

440
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,277
''Made in Hawaii'' label.

441
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:40,604
Come on, this is the Holy Grail
of Aloha garments.

442
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:43,879
- That's great.
- Eight seasons Magnum wore this.

443
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:47,080
Putting up with Higgins
and those stupid dogs.

444
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:48,766
Zeus. Apollo.

445
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,318
lt was a TV show,
it was big in the '80s.

446
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:55,006
l know who Tom Selleck is, Tony.

447
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,437
The hot, sexy
American man of adventure.

448
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:00,323
He was-- He was good, sure.

449
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:04,440
But take away the shirt, moustache,
Detroit Tigers hat, Ferrari, the Audi,

450
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:08,879
wine cellar, Robin Masters' estate,
Rick, TC and the helicopter.

451
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,282
Well, it looks like Kirby
has not checked his e-mail

452
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:14,081
or even turned on his computer
since yesterday.

453
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,926
Once he saw us at Norfolk,
he must have taken a kite.

454
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:20,437
Hike.
The expression is ''taking a hike.''

455
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:23,115
She may have had it confused
with ''go fly a kite.''

456
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:28,646
l speak five languages, forgive me
if l get confused sometimes.

457
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,036
- l found his bankbook.
- Chequebook.

458
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,717
Whatever you call it.
His deposits seem high.

459
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:45,124
Where you come from,
they may seem high

460
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:48,364
but here in the good old U.S. of A.,
these are really, really high.

461
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,798
l think it's the--

462
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,485
- lt's a--
- lt's a marmoset.

463
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:11,359
Actually, that's a capuchin.

464
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:14,525
l don't advise shooting him.
Americans and their pets.

465
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,285
lt will be a public-relations
nightmare.

466
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:17,476
You knew all about this.

467
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,643
l tried to tell you,
but you shushed me.

468
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,360
Well, next time try harder.

469
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,682
His name is Max.

470
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:26,675
Oh, l read a Snapple cap that said
that the most popular name for a pet

471
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,684
in the United States is Max.

472
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,400
That's funny, l thought it was Tim.

473
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,440
We know that your husband
and John Kirby served together.

474
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,763
And we also know
that they switched places.

475
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:40,482
lt's a federal crime
to impersonate military personnel.

476
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:44,202
Which means that withholding
any information

477
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:49,242
is a chargeable offence.
So, what do you know, Mrs. Smith?

478
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:55,803
l lied before.
l saw the other man once.

479
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:57,925
When?

480
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:01,358
Right after we moved here
from Hawaii.

481
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,882
l came home early from yoga.
l wasn't feeling well.

482
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,362
He was with Jerry in the den.

483
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:07,966
Jerry was upset.

484
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:11,797
lt was clear l'd interrupted them.

485
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:17,916
When he left, he said
l should forget l ever saw him

486
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:20,880
and never tell anyone.

487
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,279
Do you think he's the one
who killed my husband?

488
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,236
Kirby was getting e-mails

489
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,597
from an anonymous lnternet account
several times a week.

490
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,325
Each one
was just a time and a location.

491
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,279
The times were random
all throughout the day,

492
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,517
the locations were business
and residential addresses

493
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:37,881
all throughout Norfolk.

494
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:41,045
- How long have they been coming in?
- About four months.

495
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,917
Same time Kirby's
been posing as Smith.

496
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,960
You think Kirby was doing Smith's job,
while Smith was doing Kirby's?

497
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:49,924
l've seen communications
like this before.

498
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,078
- So have l.
- Many intelligence agencies

499
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,919
use this technique
for arranging a drop-off.

500
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,967
l believe you refer to them
as goblins.

501
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,283
Spooks. The term is spooks.

502
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,921
According to this, there's
a drop scheduled for this afternoon.

503
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:03,964
- Where and when, Abs?
- Granby and Harbor,

504
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,606
southeast corner, 1 400.

505
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:07,604
One of you is gonna have
to pose as Kirby.

506
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,724
That really doesn't work for him.

507
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:16,959
For once, l've got to agree with Tony.
l don't think l'm a Hawaiian-shirt type.

508
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,761
You're the closest we've got to age
and looks to Smith and Kirby.

509
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:22,487
Which won't matter if whoever
he's meeting with knows their faces.

510
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,485
No, it won't. But if it doesn't,
we just might get something,

511
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,444
which is more than we have now.

512
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:31,203
DiNozzo, you and Ziva
will be here mobile on Granby,

513
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,363
as far as you can
while maintaining visual contact.

514
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,642
l'll be over here on Harbor.

515
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,644
McGee, we do not know
what we have here.

516
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:40,522
So go with the flow.
lf it gets hinky, call it.

517
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:43,036
Hinky? What's hinky?

518
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,636
You know, like when your gut
is telling you something?

519
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:50,477
Oh, l see. ln my country,
we refer to that as gas.

520
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,756
<i>You got a visual, DiNozzo?</i>

521
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,366
Affirmative, boss.

522
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,081
Suck that gut in, probie.

523
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,441
Guy with the briefcase.

524
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:06,796
l got him, McGee.

525
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,517
The logistics for the drop
may only start here, McGee.

526
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,922
- Look for any sign.
- <i>Like what?</i>

527
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,244
A hand gesture,
the angle he holds his briefcase.

528
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,845
<i>lt's nothing, boss.</i>

529
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:31,322
- Lost the visual.
- Same here, DiNozzo.

530
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:32,926
Move up the block.

531
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:49,442
There's a park bench across the street
from the Baltimore Museum of Art.

532
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:52,241
- <i>Leave it underneath.</i>
- Girl with the pack.

533
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,563
Wait, McGee,
for her to make the move.

534
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,758
- Don't be late.
- Right.

535
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,677
- Kirby, my 9 o'clock, boss.
- <i>l got him. Get the girl.</i>

536
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,037
Go. Go. Go.

537
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,606
We lost her.

538
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,963
More like she lost us.

539
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:45,159
There are three wheels,
numbered zero through nine each.

540
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:48,205
- That's a thousand possibilities.
- Then your fingers better get busy.

541
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,482
Wait, there's more.

542
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,957
The seams are filled with something
that looks like an epoxy material.

543
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,202
May be for waterproofing.

544
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:57,086
Or to hold explosive components
in place until they're exploded.

545
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:58,515
X-rays.

546
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:01,082
Didn't penetrate.
The metal's high-density steel,

547
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:02,919
probably with a thin layer
of lead sheeting.

548
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,965
- The nitrate sniffer came up negative.
- That's because of the epoxy.

549
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,321
Probably.

550
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:10,166
Gibbs, it might not be rigged
with a bomb, per se.

551
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,164
l love saying per se.
lt's one of those phrases

552
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:15,000
nobody really knows what it means,
but you say it anyway.

553
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,526
- Am l off topic again?
- Bigtime.

554
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,517
lt could be armed with something
like formic acid in a glass liner.

555
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,758
Destroy the contents
if opened incorrectly.

556
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,963
There's also the possibility
it could be nothing.

557
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:28,000
lt's just a bluff to scare anyone
from taking a peek inside.

558
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:31,404
- Do we have a bottom line here, Abs?
- We do.

559
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,316
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Yes.

560
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,876
The bomb squad is gonna pick this
up, they'll do their thing

561
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:38,117
and then l will get to the bottom
of this, but--

562
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,640
lt's going to take time.

563
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:42,919
See? We are having
a melding of the minds.

564
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,601
- lt was called <i>The Transporter.</i>
- Didn't see it.

565
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:48,037
Cool British guy
delivers illegal stuff for a price.

566
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,640
Obviously, what Smith was doing.

567
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:51,036
Then what Kirby was doing.

568
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:52,760
Then what you were doing, probie.

569
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,800
- Only badly.
- Yeah, l got the case, didn't l?

570
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:58,919
- You're missing the point.
- How could there possibly be a point?

571
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,759
l think what Agent DiNozzo means

572
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,725
is that the Transporter would have
gotten the case, gotten the girl

573
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:05,798
and still have held on
to his cappuccino.

574
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,004
Exactly. Speaking of movies, you know
what l was thinking about, probie?

575
00:32:09,247 --> 00:32:11,715
- Really not interested, Tony.
- <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i>.

576
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,480
ldentity mystery.

577
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,558
Then there's our Smith.
ldentity mystery.

578
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:17,241
And if it turns out the guy

579
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:19,637
charging porn and tractors
on your credit card is a Smith,

580
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,286
- then that's identity mystery.
- Tony?

581
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:23,717
Not now, probie.
l'm almost done with this level.

582
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,442
Find out what's in the case yet,
boss?

583
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,485
- Are you going to interrogate Kirby?
- No.

584
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,475
That is a mistake. The longer we wait,
the more time he has to--

585
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:39,160
l am going to be interrogating Kirby.

586
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,885
You and DiNozzo will be observing.

587
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:48,922
lt takes a while for him
to warm up to people, doesn't it?

588
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:50,879
Wanna know how to get
on his good side?

589
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:53,157
- Of course.
- Me too.

590
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,882
l didn't kill Jerry.

591
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:02,401
l know. We checked.

592
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,120
You were on base
when it happened.

593
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,447
So can l go now?

594
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:13,485
lmpersonating a petty officer.

595
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:16,159
That's a felony.

596
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:18,597
Lying during a federal investigation,

597
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,001
felony.

598
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,196
Resisting arrest.

599
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:23,676
That's a misdemeanour.

600
00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:26,481
Not to mention what we have
in that case downstairs.

601
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:28,325
You looked in the case?

602
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,842
Look, l was only trying to help.
l swear to you.

603
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:33,275
lt wasn't even my idea.

604
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:35,876
l doubt this has anything to do
with espionage, Tony.

605
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,555
Kirby's far too stupid
for this line of work.

606
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,405
Why did you two switch places?

607
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,883
Because Jerry,

608
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:46,357
he couldn't keep it
in his damn pants.

609
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:49,599
Keep what in his pants?

610
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,483
You're kidding, right?

611
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:54,725
Come on.

612
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:00,999
Dancing?

613
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,361
- Yeah, dancing.
- What happened?

614
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:08,520
He'd been fooling around
with this officer's wife over at Pearl.

615
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:13,318
One night, the officer came home
early and caught him in the act.

616
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:18,078
He got a good look at Jerry's face,
but he didn't recognise him.

617
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:20,762
Jerry wasn't worried.

618
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,838
He knew he was shipping out
the next week

619
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,964
and they'd never met before.

620
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,361
That was the good news.

621
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,320
Until he got the bad news.

622
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:35,724
The husband was gonna be
his C.O. in Norfolk.

623
00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:37,559
Commander Morris.

624
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:38,836
Yes, sir.

625
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:41,726
Jerry only had four months left
to an honourable discharge.

626
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:43,963
Morris would have made sure
that didn't happen.

627
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,283
- Who else knew about it?
- No one.

628
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:49,121
That's why Jerry begged me
to switch places with him.

629
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:53,122
Except l couldn't leave my job.

630
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,726
Delivering illegal goods.

631
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,397
Wait. l mean, l didn't even know
what was in the cases.

632
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:00,165
l was strictly transportation.

633
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,325
Hey, Kirby,
they weren't exactly using FedEx.

634
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:05,722
- lt was stupid, l know.
- Yeah.

635
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:07,679
But the money was really good.

636
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,765
Life since the Navy...

637
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,526
...has been kind of hard on me.

638
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,475
- You never looked inside?
- No.

639
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:18,405
There were only two rules.

640
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,562
Be on time

641
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,236
and don't look in the cases.

642
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,045
Jerry,

643
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:26,921
l guess he looked.

644
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:30,125
Then they killed him for it.

645
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:33,237
l think--
l think l want to get a lawyer now.

646
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:35,119
Oh, yeah.

647
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,840
You're gonna need one.

648
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:42,445
Remember that smeared area
that l thought was probably nothing?

649
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,802
Well, it probably
might not be probably nothing.

650
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,043
l'm not saying a magic word, Abs.

651
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,715
Okay, this is the windshield
of the vehicle.

652
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,559
See the smeared marks?
There's four of them.

653
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:54,525
And they connect together.
Now, step back and squint.

654
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:56,285
At what?

655
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,443
Just do it
like when you're trying to figure out

656
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:01,798
the hidden message
in the bad 3-D art at the fair.

657
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:07,719
This is important.
Try to see the bigger picture for once.

658
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,606
See it?

659
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,445
- Maybe an M.
- Yes, Gibbs, yes.

660
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,365
Those smears
were smeared on purpose.

661
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:26,205
Now, these are the photographs

662
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,796
of Petty Officer Smith's body
before it was washed.

663
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,762
He has blood
on his right index finger.

664
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,446
There were no lacerations
on that hand.

665
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:36,684
Petty Officer Smith used his finger
to write a message in his own blood.

666
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:39,566
Sometimes people in the throes
of death try to communicate.

667
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:42,082
Like that guy
in the L.A. Metro Rail crash,

668
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:43,999
he wrote l love you to his wife
in his blood.

669
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,680
- He lived?
- He did.

670
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:49,960
But Petty Officer Smith
is trying to tell us who killed him.

671
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,885
- What does M mean?
- <i>Commander Morris.</i>

672
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,197
How could you think
that l had to do with his murder?

673
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:00,835
Because you found out he was the
sailor sleeping with your wife.

674
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:04,443
- At Pearl.
- Yes, commander, at Pearl Harbor.

675
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:05,921
That was Smith?

676
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:08,800
lf l had known who he was,
l would have killed him myself.

677
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:11,242
But l didn't. l was here that morning.

678
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,921
There's a dozen witnesses
who will vouch for that.

679
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:21,643
Surveillance camera at the main gate
has Commander Morris

680
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,765
coming on base an hour
before Smith's time of death.

681
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,964
- Leeway at time of death?
- Ducky says 1 5, maybe 20 minutes.

682
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,759
Drive time to the crime scene?

683
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,559
Thirty minutes.
Fifteen if you're driving.

684
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:34,281
Seven sailors in his office all verify
he was in the supply unit

685
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:36,039
- until we showed up.
- Where?

686
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,118
Mostly in his private office,
behind closed doors.

687
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:41,484
Was there another exit? Could he have
left unseen through a window?

688
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,877
Windows don't open, boss.
Solid plate glass.

689
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:45,799
Morris couldn't have been
at the crime scene.

690
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,606
- Yeah, l know that, McGee.
- He knows that, McGee.

691
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:52,201
His murder has to be related
to the delivery service.

692
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:53,726
Which we know nothing about.

693
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,963
Kirby claims he didn't know
who he was working for.

694
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,086
Was Petty Officer Smith wearing
his seat belt when he crashed?

695
00:38:01,607 --> 00:38:05,441
Was Petty Officer Smith
wearing a seat belt?

696
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,602
No. He wasn't wearing a seat belt
in the crash.

697
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:12,844
He was in an unnaturally
contorted position.

698
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:15,555
Yes. Very, very unusual.

699
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:20,840
l can flip the image,

700
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:23,162
only if you want.

701
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,237
- W.
- What was the wife's name again?

702
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:32,999
lt's Wendy.

703
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:36,037
Did you discover your husband
was cheating on you, Wendy?

704
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:39,726
l don't know
what you're talking about.

705
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,600
Must have been a real shock.
You were so much in love with him.

706
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:46,766
The one decent man you've ever met
wasn't really decent at all, was he?

707
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:48,280
That's not true.

708
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:50,762
He called you on the way to work.
You weren't home.

709
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:53,475
l was. He called me at home.

710
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:56,685
Phone records show you forwarded
your home phone to your cell.

711
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:58,917
He had no idea you followed him,
Wendy.

712
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,680
He only worked
a couple of days a week.

713
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:04,124
l wonder what he did
with all the rest of that free time?

714
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:16,205
Did you know he cheated on me
on our wedding day?

715
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,438
Our wedding day.

716
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,683
<i>Honey, honey, it's our anniversary.</i>

717
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,404
Great, thank you.

718
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:45,480
Well, that takes care of them all.
Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, Diners.

719
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,245
Old cards cancelled,
new ones reissued.

720
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:48,760
lt only took me 200 phone calls.

721
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,400
You know what l find interesting?

722
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,838
- What?
- That you actually have Diners.

723
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,003
- What's wrong with that?
- l've never met anyone

724
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,239
who used Diners Club
who wasn't wearing Depends.

725
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:01,238
lt's a very hip piece of plastic, Tony.

726
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,875
Yes, in the year 1 927.

727
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:06,517
Good news and bad news.
The good news is l'm still cute.

728
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:09,321
Bad news, the bomb squad
got a little trigger happy.

729
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,366
They blew up the metal box?

730
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:15,405
Do you have any idea
what's beyond smithereens?

731
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,125
- Not a clue.
- Me neither.

732
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:19,477
That's what we've got.

733
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:21,643
- There's not much l can do.
- Nope.

734
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,240
Except put it back together.

735
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:27,320
Gibbs. lt's in like a jillion pieces.
That would take months.

736
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:29,597
lt's the only link we have
to that delivery service.

737
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:33,766
Yeah? Well you're not the one that has
to put it back together, Officer David.

738
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:39,606
She doesn't like me, does she?

739
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:58,283
- Are you going home?
- Not yet.

740
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:03,162
l thought l might be able
to help you with that.

741
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,562
Do you have a degree
in forensic science?

742
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,246
No.

743
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,646
But l'm very good at jigsaw puzzles.

744
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:15,238
We'll see.
