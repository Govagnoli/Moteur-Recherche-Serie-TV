1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,860
I am here in Shenandoah State Park.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,580
Oh, that's beautiful.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,980
Wow.

4
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,730
He did that? You're kidding.

5
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,810
No, I'm not.

6
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,250
Well, I wouldn't put it
in my romantic column, Deb.

7
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:22,815
Oh, I don't know.

8
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,250
I mean, it's definitely kinky.

9
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:24,690
Affectionate.

10
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,770
Maybe affectionately odd, but...

11
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,210
I mean, I don't find anything
romantic about having sex with...

12
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,050
I'll call you back later.

13
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,650
Sex with a what?

14
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,730
None of your business.

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,490
Another woman?

16
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,290
Go back to your desk, Tony.

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,130
Another man?

18
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,170
I told you...

19
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,250
Some kind of root vegetable?

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,850
You're disgusting.

21
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,210
Wasn't me having a conversation
about kinky sex, Kate.

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,370
It was a private conversation, Tony, something
you seem to have a difficult time with.

23
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,130
If I'd been having that conversation,
you'd accuse me of being a Neanderthal.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,770
Well, that doesn't require
a conversation, Tony.

25
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,770
You know what I think, Kate?

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,370
I think there's a secret side to you,

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,890
a Spike Steel video kind of side.

28
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,370
Keep it hidden under your mattress?

29
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,770
Leave now.

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,330
Oh... You're a Spike Steel
fan, aren't you, Probie?

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,810
What, the porn star?

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,410
No, the physicist.

33
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,970
Uh, no, not really.
Looks kind of sleazy.

34
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,890
Actually, he looks a
little bit like Tony.

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,370
Oh, you have no idea how
much he looks like me.

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,450
Kate, how do you know
what he looks like?

37
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,690
I saw him on the news when he
was arrested a few years ago.

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,730
Really?

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,548
Spike Steel's real name is Jay McMann, and according to
the National Crime Database, he's never been arrested, ever.

40
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,170
What're you waiting for, DiNozzo?

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,130
Uh...

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,650
Gas the truck.

43
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,530
I knew that.

44
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,770
McGee, get Ducky.

45
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,130
Uh, what am I telling him, boss?

46
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,970
We have a dead Marine in
Shenandoah River State Park.

47
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,930
Come on, let's go.

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,890
Sergeant William Moore.
Call came in from his wife.

49
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,410
The friend?

50
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,610
Sergeant Roger Caine.

51
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,010
All camping together.

52
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,010
This morning they were
gonna hike this trail.

53
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,890
Sergeant Moore went ahead
early to film the sunrise.

54
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,410
When they couldn't find
him, they called us.

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,810
Early in the morning, it's really slippery up
here. The Sergeant lost his traction and slipped.

56
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,410
You a trained investigator...

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,370
Ranger Kett?

58
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,530
Been working this park
five years, Agent Gibbs.

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,490
It's as treacherous as it comes up here.

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,450
Seen a lot of hikers go over.

61
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,210
This hiker was a Marine.

62
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,090
Yeah, well, this Marine
slipped and fell to his death.

63
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,950
You said he was filming.

64
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,210
That's what his wife said.

65
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,570
No sign of the camera.

66
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,450
Me and my team can take it from here.

67
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,490
Wonder what happened to McGee.

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,890
Probably passed out on the side
of the trail sucking his thumb.

69
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,290
He joined a gym, you know.

70
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,650
Is that right?

71
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,010
Wait up!

72
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,450
He should get his money back.

73
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
Where the hell you been?

74
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,650
It's another quarter of a mile.

75
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,810
Uphill.

76
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,690
Stamina, Probie- it's very
important in our profession.

77
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,410
As it is in Spike Steel's profession.

78
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,890
You relate to him, don't you Tony?

79
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,450
Oh, we have a lot in common.

80
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,450
Stamina?

81
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,530
For one.

82
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:21,530
What are your preliminary
findings, Mr. Palmer?

83
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,290
And?

84
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,850
And, uh...

85
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,330
I would imagine that the victim as
sustained fractures of several limbs.

86
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,530
Cause of death?

87
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,730
Impossible to say till we get him back,
but, uh, from the looks of this head wound...

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,530
... I would say that he
probably struck a rock.

89
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,850
Cause of death.

90
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,330
Shock.

91
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,890
That would be my supposition as well.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,770
What I don't get is the flesh trauma.
What kind of wounds are these, Doctor?

93
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:52,810
They're coyote

94
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,530
he would eat the exposed tissue first.

95
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,410
What's second?

96
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,570
Well, if what I suspect is true...

97
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,330
Here, the abdominal cavity
has been chewed open.

98
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,970
You know, the liver and kidney is a rich
source of nutrients for these creatures.

99
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,210
That's, uh, gross, Doctor.

100
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,610
Well, actually, Mr. Palmer,
we're quite lucky here.

101
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,090
In some cases, they chew off
the head and carry it away,

102
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,170
so they won't have to
fight other coyotes for it.

103
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,610
My coroner friend in Los Angeles
says coyotes "take it to go."

104
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,130
They're very strange in Los Angeles.

105
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,810
Anything unusual, Duck?

106
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,330
No, not really, Jethro.

107
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,130
I'll know more when I get
our Marine back on the table.

108
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,770
Boss!

109
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,890
Found the camcorder!

110
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,690
He was obsessed with the stupid camera.

111
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,650
I gave it to him on his birthday.

112
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,250
Maybe if he hadn't been filming
he wouldn't have slipped.

113
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,050
Anybody else at this
campsite while you were here?

114
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,130
No, sir, just the drunk.

115
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,090
Aw, he was nothing to worry about.

116
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,290
He was in a trailer over there.

117
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,850
Scruffy guy. He was drinking too much,
got loud. We asked him to keep it down.

118
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,970
He didn't keep it down?

119
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,170
No, sir. So we went over there,
tried to reason with him-

120
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,050
that's when he took a swing.

121
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,250
And you took a swing back.

122
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,650
No, ma'am.

123
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,730
Bill put him in a headlock
till he calmed down.

124
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,850
And then he just took off.

125
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,690
Don't suppose you got a license number?

126
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,850
No point, sir.

127
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,450
The guy was hass.

128
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,410
Bill spends eight months in Iraq, and
he dies filming a sunrise in Virginia.

129
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,370
That's not the way it works, Gibbs.

130
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,090
This thing has been in water for hours.

131
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,530
You don't just spray a little
409 on the tape and off you go.

132
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,250
Tape?

133
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,770
Yeah, it's digital videotape.

134
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,330
I thought everything
was a chip these days.

135
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,370
No. They kind of married
the old school with the new.

136
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,410
You know how, like, new hip-hop artists will go
back to old-school rappers like Sugar Hill Gang?

137
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,770
How long?

138
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,370
I have to separate the cartridge, I have to
submerge the wheels in a cleaning solution

139
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,210
cleaning solution with the heads up against it, I have to
remove the silt contaminants so ty don't shred the tape...

140
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:52,810
How long, Abby?

141
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,610
Um... three, maybe four hours.

142
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,090
Let me know when you got it.

143
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,130
Hey, Gibbs.

144
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,370
Do you have a camcorder?

145
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,530
Yeah.

146
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,090
Digital. Okay?

147
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,170
Good, Gibbs! Way to go!

148
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,010
Did you make the jump to CDs yet?

149
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,530
'Cause if you didn't, it's cool.

150
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,090
'Cause all the hot deejays, they
use vinyl these days, anyway.

151
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,330
Just get it to me.

152
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,690
Hey, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

153
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,530
Peace out, man.

154
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,010
Indiscriminate predators, cos.

155
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,170
Fish, cats, garbage. They'll
eat anything they can chew.

156
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,450
Unlike my mother, who can
no longer chew anything.

157
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,370
I assure you, Palmer,
it is beastly sight.

158
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,850
Yes, it is, Doctor.

159
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,570
I was speaking of my mother.

160
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,370
Right.

161
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,410
Have you ever seen a rib-eye steak that's
been reduced to baby food by a Cuisinart?

162
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,010
Not recently.

163
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,370
Uh... It's rkasir similar
to a... burritos aer pizzas.

164
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,770
Not to mention the Sunday dinner
treat:sushi's through a straw.

165
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,490
Give me a pair of tweezers, Mr.
Palmer. There's something peculiar here.

166
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:10,290
What is it, Doctor?

167
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,930
I haven't a clue. That's why you
will take it directly up to Abby.

168
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,610
I was thinking, Mr. Palmer...

169
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,330
Yes, Doctor?

170
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,490
Perhaps it's about time you came
over to the house one evening.

171
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,530
Came over?

172
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,330
Join us for dinner

173
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,770
Uh, that... that would be great.

174
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,090
Northern white ash.

175
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,615
Ash treee not indigeno to this area,

176
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,010
and even if they were, you know
of any that have kiln-dried wood?

177
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,090
And a lacquer coating?

178
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,050
Lacquer?

179
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,410
Yep. Clear coat.

180
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,410
Baseball bat.

181
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,575
Wooden bats are made out
of either maple or ash.

182
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,210
Ash is more popular, but it
tends to splinter more easily.

183
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,570
Especially when they come in
contact with somebody's skull.

184
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,650
Somebody did a Barry Bonds on
Sergeant Moore's head, Gibbs.

185
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,170
Sergeant William Moore,

186
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,810
transfer from Camp Lejeune
to Quantico two months ago.

187
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,570
He was serving as an E.I. for all
newly-commissioned Marine officers.

188
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,890
E.I.?

189
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,490
Enlisted Instructor, Probie.

190
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,890
Uh, what did he teach, Kate?

191
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,530
Well, according to
his records, uh, MOUT.

192
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,210
MOUT stands for Military Operation...

193
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,570
Yes, I know what it stands for, Tony.

194
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,650
Well, excuse me for trying
to help junior agents.

195
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,730
Trust me, when I, uh, need help,
you will be the first person I ask...

196
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,730
where Gibbs or Kate is.

197
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,370
You two done?

198
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:00,810
For the moment.

199
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,490
These... are the last two people
to have seen our Sergeant alive.

200
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,770
His best friend and his wife.

201
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:08,810
Hey!

202
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,410
Now I'm done. Continue.

203
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,770
Do you think that one or both of
them could have murdered the Sergeant?

204
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,370
Well,

205
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,050
it is kind of weird a single guy
hanging out with a married couple.

206
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,570
I agree.

207
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,010
Why is that?

208
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,290
Well, because he's a single guy
hanging out with married people.

209
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
I do that all the time.

210
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,130
Yeah, but you bring a date, right?

211
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,810
Not... always.

212
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,890
Are you related to them?

213
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,770
No.

214
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,530
What?

215
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,450
Well, who... usually invites
you? The man or the woman?

216
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,330
I don't know.

217
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,730
I guess usually the guy.

218
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,730
Okay, a lot of my friends are from the Secret
Service, and most of them happen to be men.

219
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,130
What about your, um, your girlfriend
who called yesterday morning?

220
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,730
Well... Deb is married to
one of my buddies, Rick.

221
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,512
Okay, so what you're trying to say

222
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:10,290
is that all of my married male
friends secretly want to sleep with me.

223
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,730
Pretty much, yeah.

224
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,692
That's very mature, Tony.

225
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,850
And for your information, men
and women can just be friends.

226
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,990
Right McGee?

227
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,528
Technically.

228
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,050
What do you mean, "technically"?

229
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,730
He means she'd have to
be pretty ugly first.

230
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,690
Wait, I-I didn't say that.

231
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,490
I swear, I do not get
paid enough for this.

232
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,330
For what, Kate?

233
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,730
Uh, nothing. We are just
discussing potential suspects.

234
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,890
Focusing on the Sergeant's
wife and best friend, boss.

235
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,490
Yeah, well, come on, we got one more.

236
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,650
You guys are four years old. Honestly.

237
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,850
Um, nice hat.

238
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,530
Attractive.

239
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,730
In a weird way.

240
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,570
Why?

241
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,090
Well, I had to set up a clean room in the
ballistics lab to work with the damaged videotape,

242
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,330
and just throwing the caps away seemed
sort of wasteful so I decided to recycle.

243
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,690
What do you think?

244
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,050
I think it suits you.

245
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,850
Now, what's on the tape?

246
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,490
Well, I haven't finished
cleaning it up yet,

247
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,410
but I have a P.O.I.

248
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,410
"Person of Interest".

249
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,330
Let's see it.

250
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,570
The following program has been
edited for time and content.

251
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,890
It may not be appropriate
for younger viewers.

252
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:30,587
Abby.

253
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,250
Right.

254
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,090
This isn't a good idea, Bill.

255
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,850
But I've asked this guy three
times to turn his music down.

256
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,610
Yeah. Now, we make him.

257
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,450
And if he has a gun
or something in there?

258
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,730
I film it and we get
the redneck arrested.

259
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,930
Way to encourage him, Roger.

260
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,130
Oh, come on, honey. It's not that
big of a deal. We'll be right back.

261
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,570
Okay, this next part is like
an outtake from Deliverance.

262
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,330
I thought I told you guys
to leave me the hell alone.

263
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,610
Sir, we will, once you
turn the music down.

264
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,210
What? You think I'm
afraid of you or something?

265
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,410
Sir, I'm not here to fight you.

266
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,930
We just want you to lower the music.

267
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,210
Why don't you just forget it, 'cause you
just assaulted me on camera, huh? See?

268
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,370
Either you leave, or we're
going to call the cops.

269
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,330
All right, just let me go. Huh?

270
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,090
Let me... All right.

271
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,530
We need to ID this guy.

272
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,050
Oh, I'm way ahead of you, Gibbs.

273
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,490
I got a shot of the license plate.

274
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,530
It is registered to a David Runion.

275
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,370
His last address is an RV campground
in Manassas. He's since moved.

276
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,130
Find him.

277
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,770
That's good work, Abby.

278
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,170
Tony, head back to Shenandoah
State Park. Take McGee.

279
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,130
For what exactly, boss?

280
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,170
I want to know where the Sergeant was
killed before he was tossed off that cliff.

281
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,370
Get the sedan ready, Probie.
I'll meet you out front.

282
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,970
So Kate, you really like my hat?

283
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,370
Uh... it's different.

284
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,210
Cool, because I made you one.

285
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,130
Oh... Abby, I-I, I
don't know what to say.

286
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,050
Put it on.

287
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,290
Okay.

288
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,370
She bet me 20 bucks that she
could make you wear that today.

289
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,090
Your cut.

290
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,610
Pleasure doing business with you, Abs.

291
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,450
Totally.

292
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,210
Hurry it up, McGee.

293
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,410
You could have helped.

294
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,130
I did. I carried the camera.

295
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,370
Moore was a Marine, a combat veteran, probably
not the easiest guy in the world to sneak up on.

296
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,090
Unless he knew his attacker.

297
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,050
Or was ambushed.

298
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,970
It's a pretty wide-open space.

299
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,250
Let's check out the tree line.

300
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,730
Blood drop.

301
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,850
Sure looks like it.

302
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,090
Okay, we're gonna have
to search in there.

303
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,050
You're gonna want to watch out for...

304
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,850
Yes, I know how to search
a wooded area, Tony.

305
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,010
I'm not an idiot.

306
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,210
Didn't say you were.

307
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,130
Then why do you always
treat me like one?

308
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,570
Just trying to impart
a little wisdom, McGee.

309
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,530
Look, I graduated top
of my class at FLETC.

310
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,930
So, I think I can handle it.

311
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,930
Be my guest. Give me a call
me if you find anything.

312
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,330
I will.

313
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,535
Found David Runion, Gibbs.

314
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,650
Checked into another campground 20
miles from Shenandoah State Park.

315
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,370
Also ran a background check
on him. He's served time.

316
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:24,930
For what?

317
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,490
Assault and battery. He nearly beat
a man to death with a pool cue in '93.

318
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,490
Looks like this time
he might have succeeded.

319
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,330
We getting a warrant?

320
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,370
We need evidence for a warrant, Kate.

321
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,930
Right now I just want to talk to him.

322
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,810
Tony!

323
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,170
Found it!

324
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,530
Not bad.

325
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,010
Not bad at all, McGee.

326
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,610
Thanks.

327
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,330
Hey, I'm, I'm sorry about back the.

328
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,450
Don't mention it.

329
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,290
Besides,

330
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,770
that was a pretty brave thing to do.

331
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,890
What do you mean, brave?

332
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,530
Well... crawling around back
here in all this poison ivy.

333
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,250
I don't know if I would have done it.

334
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,538
You, you're kidding, right?

335
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,890
"Leaves of three, let them be,"

336
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,410
McGee.

337
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,210
A little something I picked up during my
first year. Don't touch me, by the way.

338
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,050
Is that a rat or a dog?

339
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,650
Hey, buddy.

340
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,210
Hi!

341
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,410
Oh!

342
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,410
Sorry.

343
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,570
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you, Gibbs.

344
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,570
One day you're going to have
to tell me how you do that.

345
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,850
Easy.

346
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,930
They can sense sarcasm.

347
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,490
Runion!

348
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,490
Special Agents Gibbs and Todd, NCIS

349
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,330
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

350
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,930
Clear

351
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,610
What do you think?

352
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,410
The word "disgusting" comes to mind.

353
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,410
You smell that?

354
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,290
If you're referring to the urine? Yes.

355
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,370
No, I meant this.

356
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,210
Marijuana?

357
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,010
Yeah, it's recent, too.

358
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,050
Well, it's enough to bring him
in and hold him for a while.

359
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,730
Oh, yeah.

360
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,650
Runion! Federal agents! Stop!

361
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,810
Idiots.

362
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,850
Put your hands behind your head.

363
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,970
How did you...?

364
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,290
Sneak up on you like that?

365
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,410
Yeah.

366
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,010
Used to do it for a living.

367
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,010
Back then you'd be dead
instead of under arrest.

368
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,410
Any other questions?

369
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,850
Uh-uh.

370
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,490
Didn't think so.

371
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,550
I know you can hear me out there.

372
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,910
I'm telling you for the last time.

373
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,350
I gotta use the bathroom.

374
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,150
Okay, have it your way.

375
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,910
Won't be the first
time I had to do this.

376
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,390
Maybe we should.

377
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,190
He's bluffing.

378
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,390
Tony, you didn't see
the inside of his camper.

379
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,790
That bad, huh?

380
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:20,510
Picture the most disgusting public restroom
you've ever been in, covered in puss and vomit.

381
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,350
I would still rather live
there than this guy's place.

382
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,550
That's nice, Kate.

383
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,750
You should thank me. Eating
that crap will kill you.

384
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,910
I'm more concerned about what Gibbs'll do if
this redneck takes one in our interrogation room.

385
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,230
I got, I got to use a bathroom.

386
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,510
Hold it.

387
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,550
I can't!

388
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,630
Good, we can do this quick.

389
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,310
Why'd you murder Sergeant William Moore?

390
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,350
What?

391
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,230
Who the hell is that?

392
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,630
That's right, you probably
don't recall his name.

393
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,510
Sir, I'm not here to fight you. We
just want you to lower the mus...

394
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,470
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

395
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,110
Why don't you just forget it,
'cause you just assaulted...

396
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,950
He was found yesterday lying
at the bottom of a cliff.

397
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,270
Is that what this is all about?

398
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,270
You think I killed some jarhead?

399
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,350
No way, man. Nice try.

400
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,110
Why'd you run?

401
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,910
'Cause of the pot in my trailer.

402
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,430
I got a medical coition.

403
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,390
What?

404
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,550
Stupidity?

405
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,870
Oh, look, man, I was
really drunk that night.

406
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,190
I barely remember the guy.

407
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,830
I sure as hell didn't kill him.

408
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,310
Where were you yesterday
between 5:30 and 7:30 a.m.?

409
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,150
Sleeping?

410
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,590
Yeah. At the rest stop off 211.

411
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,150
I didn't even wake up until after 10:00.

412
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,150
Witnesses?

413
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,350
Well, sure.

414
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,990
I mean, there were lots of other
cars and trucks when I pulled in.

415
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,150
I need names.

416
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,390
I don't have any names.

417
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,270
There are two rest
stops on that road, Tony.

418
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,750
Check if they have any video
surveillance or attendants.

419
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,310
On it.

420
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,630
Running it, Boss.

421
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,230
So what happens now?

422
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,835
You've got a violent
past, your alibi is weak,

423
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,030
and I've got you on tape threatening
the victim. You tell me, Runion.

424
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,110
Oh, man, my whole life

425
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,750
it's always been like this.

426
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,670
One freaking nightmare after another,

427
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,590
but I, I swear to you, Agent Gibbs...

428
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,510
I didn't kill anybody.

429
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,750
We found your bat.

430
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,110
What bat?

431
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,550
Hey, Abby.

432
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,910
Got something?

433
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,270
I got good news and bad news.

434
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,670
This is definitely our bat.

435
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,310
The splinter from Sergeant
Moore's head fits perfectly.

436
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,670
Bad news?

437
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,710
It's been wiped clean of any prints.
The only thing on it is urushiol oil.

438
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,430
That's the stuff found in...

439
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,630
What?

440
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,401
You...

441
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,910
you have to see this for yourself.

442
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,830
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

443
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:41,590
Yes.

444
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,590
I'll look like a circus freak!

445
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,710
Tell me, what do I do?

446
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,470
Um, well... you could
use Calamine lotion. Or...

447
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,590
perhaps just wear some sort of mask.

448
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,590
And can you mark it
"Special Agent Todd"?

449
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,864
Thanks, Sheriff Lester.

450
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,750
Dinner?

451
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,390
Aren't you married?

452
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,590
Well, it does to me.

453
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,070
My mother wonders why I'm not married.

454
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,230
So does mine.

455
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,430
Could you stop doing that?

456
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,870
I'm practicing, Kate.

457
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,150
What? Annoying me?

458
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,910
No, the creepy way Gibbs
used to sneak up on us.

459
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,990
What do you mean "used to"?

460
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,030
The old man's been
wearing Ben-Gay lately.

461
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,550
I can smell him ming a mile away.

462
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,150
That a fact, DiNozzo?

463
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,270
Knee feeling better, boss?

464
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,190
Much.

465
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,870
Great.

466
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,590
What about Runion's alibi?

467
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,030
I've got the local Sheriff pulling the
security tapes from the rest stops on Route 211.

468
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:46,110
And we have a description
of his pickup and trailer

469
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,750
circulating with the state cops
who worked the area that night.

470
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,030
Do you think he did it, Gibbs?

471
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,030
Oh, yeah.

472
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,150
And Tony is cleaning it up.

473
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,030
Janitorial?

474
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,590
Don't worry about Interrogation.

475
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,150
DiNozzo's gonna handle it.

476
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,470
You still here?

477
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,510
You're serious?

478
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,550
You're serious?

479
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,390
In my defense, I did use the
word "creepy" in the most...

480
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,150
affectionate way.

481
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,870
Right.

482
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,350
You might want to use gloves.

483
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,110
Where's McGee?

484
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,630
Well,

485
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,824
let's see what we're
dealing with here, Timothy.

486
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,487
Ah, the dreaded
Toxicodendron radicans -

487
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,915
the poison ivy plant.

488
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,790
You seem to be
particularly allergic to it.

489
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,310
Usually it takes several days for
this sort of reaction to develop.

490
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,030
I'm lucky that way.

491
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,990
The last time I encountered
a case of this magnitude,

492
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,110
two young lovers fell asleep
naked in a field of it.

493
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,230
I don't think Sarah has ever
forgiven me for that one.

494
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,230
What I don't understand is how
did I get it all over my face?

495
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,750
It's the urushiol oil in the plant.

496
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,310
Yes. Once it gets on your
hands, it spreads by contact.

497
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,270
Um, then I have a major problem, Ducky.

498
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,750
When I was out there, I,
um, I had to, you know...?

499
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,630
No, I don't.

500
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,350
Relieve myself.

501
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,630
Oh.

502
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,430
Oh...

503
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,590
Well, uh...

504
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,510
let's take a look, then.

505
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,875
This is, uh, this is
kind of embarrassing.

506
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,190
I'm a doctor, McGee. I have seen everything there
is to see more times than I care to remember.

507
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,350
Good Lord.

508
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,670
What? Is it bad?!

509
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,270
No, no, it's fine, fine.
Nothing to worry about.

510
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,270
I didn't expect to see... quite so much

511
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,030
swelling.

512
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,830
If Tony finds out about this,
I'm going to have to quit.

513
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,910
Well, your secret is safe with me.

514
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,150
Doctor, I've got the new
inspection forms you reque...

515
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:02,790
I'll come back.

516
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,830
Him I'm not so sure about.

517
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,230
Runion's trailer pulled into the rest
stop around 1:00 a.m. that morning, Gibbs.

518
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,670
A little image enhancement.

519
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,230
Runion.

520
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,070
I can almost smell him from here.

521
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,030
How long did he stay?

522
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,110
All night.

523
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,110
Distance from Shenandoah
River State Park?

524
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,590
It's about two miles, boss.

525
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,230
I guess he was telling the truth.

526
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,670
We're going to have
to find a new suspect.

527
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,830
Yeah. Gibbs.

528
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,150
Maybe not. Come on.

529
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,590
How you feeling?

530
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,870
Like an idiot.

531
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,390
Tony tried to warn me. I didn't listen.

532
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,150
Aw, don't feel bad. The same thing
happened to him the first year he was here.

533
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,550
Really?

534
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,830
Not quite as spectacularly, but yeah.

535
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,590
So, honestly, how do I look?

536
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,550
Um...

537
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,870
do you want the truth, or
do you want me to lie to you

538
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,430
to ease the burden of
your own self-loathing?

539
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,750
I'd prefer the lie.

540
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,750
Me, too.

541
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,990
You're the fairest in the land, McGee.

542
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,390
Okay, what do you got for me, Ab...?

543
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,750
It-it looks worse than it is.

544
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,470
I'm not so sure about that.

545
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,670
She means you look like
the elephant man, Probie.

546
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,430
Tony!

547
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,030
It's true.

548
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,510
Can you still work, McGee?

549
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,950
Yeah. Sure, Boss.

550
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,070
Okay.

551
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,990
What do you got for me, Abby?

552
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,190
Um, I cleaned up more of
the Sergeant's videotape.

553
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,630
I need to see the last thing he shot.

554
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,270
Ooh, unfortunately, that's the part that
received the most damage from the impact.

555
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:48,190
It was in contact with the heads
and a lot of the data got...

556
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:48,870
When?

557
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,430
Um, I sent it to the Naval photo lab. I'm
hopefully going to have it back by tomorrow.

558
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,710
Well, what am I doing here, Abby?

559
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,030
Because of this.

560
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,550
This is from the beginning of the tape.

561
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,670
It's mostly them setting up
camp, and checking out the area.

562
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,590
And then there is this.

563
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,590
Looks like the widow and the best friend
don't know they're being videotaped.

564
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,030
And on the next shot...

565
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,470
oney, what's wrong?

566
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,670
You still think men and women
can just be friends, Kate?

567
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,870
I just... I can't be sure, Gibbs.

568
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,390
According to Gloria, lip-reading
was never my strong suit.

569
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,510
Gloria her deaf sister?

570
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,830
Mm-hmm. Mother.

571
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,950
I think Judy Moore's saying "We have
to..." something. Blank... "him."

572
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,170
"Kill?"

573
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:02,910
No.

574
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,470
"Murder?"

575
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,050
Nope.

576
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:04,550
"Love?"

577
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,630
No.

578
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,995
Really wish you'd stop doing that.

579
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,950
I will, Tony, once
you stop "blanking" up.

580
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,150
Okay, Abby, could you
pull the video back wider?

581
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,750
You see how she's touching his face?

582
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,910
It's very intimate. Clearly there's
more than a friendship going on here.

583
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,590
Which just goes to prove my
point about the sexes, Kate.

584
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,430
DiNozzo, you pick up
Sergeant Caine in the morning.

585
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,830
Kate, you pick up Judy
Moore. Don't tell her why.

586
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,910
Looks like we're going to
play Gibbs' favorite game.

587
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,150
Musical Interrogation Rooms.

588
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,630
People are staring at me.

589
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,870
Of course. You're hideously disfigured,
Probie. If you listened to me,

590
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,275
you wouldn't be in this mess.

591
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,510
If I listened to you, Gibbs would
have fired me six months ago.

592
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,190
You were going to whack
me, but you stopped. Why?

593
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,510
I remember what it was like being the new
guy; trying to fit in, never make mistakes.

594
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,070
And of course, the obvious.

595
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,790
You like me?

596
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,870
No, it would be like touching a leper.

597
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,270
Ladies and gentlemen, this way, please.

598
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,750
My favorite part of the tour.

599
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,270
The Marine Corps sniper.

600
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,830
One of the most feared
warriors in the world.

601
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,550
After a brief demonstration,

602
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,670
Corporal Cameron will be happy to
ansr any questions you may have.

603
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,390
I'll meet you by the command
center when he's done.

604
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,710
Any more information about
Sergeant Moore's accident, sir?

605
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,630
Sure, except it wasn't an accident.

606
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,630
It was murder, Sergeant Caine.

607
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,270
Murder?

608
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,030
How?

609
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,150
Baseball bat to the head.

610
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,110
50-foot fall from a cliff.

611
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,790
Coyotes probably didn't help.

612
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,150
That redneck must have overheard Bill saying
he was going to film up there in the morning.

613
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,550
We got to find him.

614
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,110
We did.

615
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,790
You need me to ID him?

616
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,670
Nope.

617
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,990
We do want to know what happened when Sergeant
Moore found out you were sleeping with his wife.

618
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,230
She told you that?

619
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,350
No,

620
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,310
he did.

621
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,910
Didn't know he was
videotaping you, did you?

622
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,870
It's not what you think.

623
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,350
Oh, so you weren't sleeping with her?

624
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,430
You're under arrest, Sergeant.

625
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:15,510
For what?

626
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,070
We'll start with adultery and
work our way up from there.

627
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,249
I don't mean to be rude, but couldn't you have just
sent me my husband's personal effects, Agent Todd?

628
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,790
Well, normally we would have, but that
camera you bought him is pretty expensive.

629
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,110
It, it still works?

630
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,710
Yeah, in a way.

631
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,070
Water?

632
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:33,870
Thank you.

633
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,670
So, Mrs. Moore, tell
us about your husband.

634
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,390
What kind of a man was he?

635
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,830
Loving...

636
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,350
gentle.

637
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,670
What about jealous?

638
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:44,990
Where do you want him, boss?

639
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,990
Interrogation One.

640
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,310
Roger?

641
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,670
Judy, what the hell did you tell them?

642
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,390
No talking, Marine!

643
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,950
What is going on here?

644
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,150
That's what you're going
to tell me, Mrs. Moore.

645
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,590
Take her to Interrogation Room Two.

646
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,510
Yeah. Gibbs.

647
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,670
I'll read you your rights on the way.

648
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,470
Did you get the last shot from my tape?

649
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,870
I'm just working on it now, Gibbs.

650
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,030
It's kind of like a nature documentary,

651
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,150
but with a riveting
murder mystery subplot.

652
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,830
This is where it gets interesting.

653
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,390
He slipped and fell?

654
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,070
In the original version.

655
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,670
But this movie comes
with an alternate ending-

656
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,510
in slo-mo- right when the
camera slams to the ground.

657
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,070
The killer recorded over it.

658
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,630
The impact caused the heads to lose contact with the
tape, preserving two frames from the original recording.

659
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,070
I've been working on cleaning them up.

660
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,030
Any way to recover the rest?

661
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,470
Well, since all recordings
leave a magnetic impression-

662
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,350
much like a computer
hard drive, by the way-

663
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,070
if I scan the data, then I'll
be able to separate out...

664
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,710
When?

665
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,190
You don't have to take the
fun out of everything, Gibbs.

666
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,510
A few hours.

667
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,710
Good job, Abby.

668
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,150
You have 20 minutes.

669
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,550
Gibbs...

670
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,830
Get McGee to help you.

671
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,710
As disturbing as this sounds,

672
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,630
I think you may have a
point about the sexes, Tony.

673
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,030
It's Biology 101.

674
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,910
Would you say I'm attractive?

675
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,990
Sure.

676
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,750
Then how come... you've never...?

677
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,950
I know you.

678
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,110
Something wrong with your arm, Sergeant?

679
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,590
Pied up some poison ivy in
the field last week, sir.

680
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,670
That a fact?

681
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,750
I didn't murder anyone, sir.

682
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,670
Yeah? Well, we'll get to that part.

683
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,710
How long were you and
Sergeant Moore friends?

684
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,390
Since boot camp, sir.

685
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,030
Parris Island or San Diego?

686
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,950
San Diego, sir.

687
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,590
Right.

688
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,710
A Hollywood Marine.

689
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,430
So how long after that
did you start... his wife?

690
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,950
I don't understand, Agent
Gibbs. Why am I in here?!

691
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,790
Don't you want to know who
murdered your husband, Mrs. Moore?

692
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,230
Yes. But I know it wasn't Roger.

693
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,190
He wouldn't.

694
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,630
There's no way.

695
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,510
Why is that?

696
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,790
Because...

697
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,470
he was with me that morning.

698
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,270
By "with me," you mean
in the same sleeping bag?

699
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,710
She actually said that? No way, sir.

700
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,270
Why would she lie?

701
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,510
I mean, besides
protecting you, Sergeant.

702
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,270
She's insane.

703
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,550
Look, right after Sergeant
Moore went to film the sunrise,

704
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,430
I went down to the campground showers.

705
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,030
I was gone for about an hour.

706
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,710
So she was there when you got back?

707
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,630
Yes, sir. She was making breakfast.

708
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,510
So what you're saying is she
had about an hour to kill him.

709
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,510
I... I didn't say that.

710
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,990
My mistake. You're saying you
had about an hour to kill him.

711
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,030
There's no way Roger would say that.

712
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,510
Agent Todd, play back.

713
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,910
I almost feel sorry for these two.

714
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,230
Why would she lie?

715
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,470
She's insane.

716
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,470
So what you're saying is she
had about an hour to kill him.

717
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,550
Let me guess.

718
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,550
You thought he loved you.

719
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:30,430
When Bill was in Iraq, Roger and I...

720
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,950
We grew close.

721
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,910
What now, Boss?

722
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,270
Put them both in the same room.

723
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,910
Going to need a refill for this.

724
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,710
We fooled around a few times,
Judy. It was a stupid mistake.

725
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,910
You said you loved me.

726
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,270
Are you nuts?

727
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,350
Bill was my best friend. It
should never have happened.

728
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:07,790
Then why did you kill him,
if it wasn't to be with me?

729
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,030
Stop saying that, you crazy...!

730
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,430
I didn't kill him! She's making it up!

731
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,550
I'm pregnant, Roger. It's yours.

732
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,230
Oh, this is better than cable.

733
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,830
Question is,

734
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,430
which one's telling the truth?

735
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,950
Okay.

736
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,990
Ready to try again, McGee?

737
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,190
Play it.

738
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,590
Ah, that's beautiful.

739
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,310
Just need to adjust the read
heads off track a little more.

740
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,310
Is that you, Roger?

741
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,750
His trailer never left the rest stop?

742
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,110
But Runion did.

743
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:15,390
Abby inverted the image, and at 0900, you can just make
out his shadow underneath the trailer as he's coming back.

744
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:17,190
It's only a four-mile
round-trip on foot.

745
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,350
Thanks, Sheriff.

746
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,390
Runion posted bail for
the pot charge an hour ago.

747
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,550
Let's roll.

748
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,230
What about Sergeant
Caine and Mrs. Moore?

749
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:25,595
Let 'em suffer for a while.

750
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,550
I think Sergeant Moore
would appreciate that.

751
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,510
Get back in the truck, you
miserable little piece of...

752
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,710
Put down your weapon, Runion!
You're not getting out of here alive!

753
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,550
I ain't goin' back to
prison, Gibbs, you hear me?!

754
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,190
I'd say we're outgunned, boss.

755
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,590
I'll circle around back.

756
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,790
I got a better idea.

757
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,870
You might want to cover our ears.

758
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,790
I think you got him, boss.

759
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,030
Well, what are we gonna
do with this thing?

760
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,510
No... way, Gibbs.

761
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,150
I'll take him. I always wanted a dog.

762
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,150
Good dog!

763
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,590
I think I'll call you Tony.

764
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,350
It's a bitch, Kate.

765
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,670
I know.

766
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,270
Is it just me, or do
you think Tony likes me?

767
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,030
I think it's more than
obvious Tony likes you.

768
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,230
Not my usual type, but kind of cute.

769
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,430
More like adorable.
Maybe we could share Tony.

770
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,510
What's wrong?

771
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,030
Aw, nothing. Good doggie.

772
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,070
You can come out now, DiNozzo.

773
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,310
Yeah, no, I'll just, uh, I'll
take care of that. Thanks.

774
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,710
Hey.

775
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,750
Did you bring the dog food?

776
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,190
Yeah, they didn't have
any bowls. Hey there.

777
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,110
That's okay. We got it covered.

778
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,070
Got a present for you, little Tony.

779
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,150
Good idea!

780
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,590
Now we can tell the two of them apart.

781
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,990
Well, at least I don't hang
out with married people, Kate.

782
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,150
Oh, will you please tell him that
men and women can just be friends?

783
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,510
Absolutely they can.

784
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,990
Without having sex?

785
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,670
Oh, no, they'll have sex.

786
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,750
Abby...

787
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,950
What, Kate? You never
slept with a friend?

788
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,390
What is wrong with you people?

789
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,310
Good question, Kate.

790
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,430
What'd you do to the dog?

791
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,870
Just taking care of
her. Unless you want to.

792
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,310
Here you go, girl.

793
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,190
Wow! She even eats like you, Tony.

794
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,310
Has anybody seen my ball cap?

795
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,230
No.

796
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,150
'Cause I... I could've sworn
I left it right on my desk.
