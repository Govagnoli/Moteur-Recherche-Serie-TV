1
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:16,013
 We're running late, let's get a move on, little lady.

2
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:17,842
 There's someone at the front door, Mom.

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,567
 Show-off. Let's go.

4
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:32,084
 Mrs. Watson?

5
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:32,472
 Yes?

6
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:36,612
 There's been an accident, ma'am. Your husband...he's wounded.

7
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:39,449
 I'm to escort you to the hospital.

8
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:45,815
 Good morning, Captain Watson.

9
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:46,911
 Good morning, Shirley.

10
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,210
 How'd the recital go last night?

11
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,456
 Well, would it be wrong for me to ay that I am the father

12
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,775
 of the most talented little girl in the e entire world?

13
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,417
 It'd be wrong if you didn't. Still on a diet,

14
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,070
 or should I put cream in your coffee?

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,351
 I ran ten miles yesterday.

16
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,732
 Cream coming right up.

17
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:07,251
 Captain Watson.

18
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:09,251
 Who’s that?

19
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:10,923
 Before Shirley returns with your coffee,

20
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,011
 know that we have your wife and daughter.

21
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:16,693
 If you want to see them alive again,

22
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,661
 you will do exactly as I say.

23
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:05,550
 Look in your briefcase's back compartment.

24
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:06,440
 Who are you?

25
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:12,362
 Now, Captain Watson. Plug it in and place

26
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:13,572
 it on top of your computer screen.

27
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,262
 You will go about your day in the usual way,

28
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,751
 only you will not leave your office.

29
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,360
 You will make no attempt to contact anyone.

30
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:23,060
 Who are you? What do you want?

31
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,151
 Two million dollars from the special operations fund.

32
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,961
 Are you crazy?I can't transfer two million dollars;

33
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:31,093
 the system won’t allow me to.

34
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:32,440
 You'll find a way, Captain 

35
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:35,693
 Or would you rather I shoot them both right now?

36
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:43,800
 Anyone? I mean, anyone know when the air conditioning's

37
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:46,040
 getting fixed? What about the name of

38
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:48,652
 the genius who invented windows that don't open?

39
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,512
 What are we, on a space ship? Windows should open!

40
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:52,793
 Oh, have you been working out?

41
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,010
 All summer long...thanks for noticing.

42
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,342
 No, I mean right now, 'cause you're sweating

43
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,660
 like a pig and it's not very attractive.

44
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,873
 Ah, morning, Agent Todd.

45
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:05,301
 McGee!

46
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,050
 Yeah?

47
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:08,013
 You have two seconds to tell me what you're doing down there.

48
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,483
 I'm, ah, upgrading the computer network and, ah...

49
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:12,512
 Time's up!

50
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:18,413
 Ah, ah, I wasn't looking, I swear, ow, ow, I wasn't looking, ow...

51
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:23,792
 Tony.

52
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,411
 Yeah?

53
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,400
 Did I just see what I thought I saw?

54
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,902
 Out of respect for my co-workers, boss, I'd have to say yes

55
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:32,353
 you did, and it's very disturbing.

56
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,343
 I agree, put your damn shirt back on, this is a federal

57
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:39,763
 office building, not a gym. Damn, McGee, why are you still here?

58
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:43,613
 Ah, the, the contractors, they won't wire the network until

59
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:46,080
 the air conditioning's fixed, it's a union thing, so...

60
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:50,032
 So you decided it's more important for an NCIS

61
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,880
 Special Agent to crawl around all day by yourself?

62
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,380
 Man asked you a question.

63
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:57,182
 Well, I just, I, I wanted it fixed, before I returned to Norfolk.

64
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:02,081
 yeah? You have any idea where thinking like this is gonna lead you?

65
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,242
 Yeah, do you, McGee?

66
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:09,321
 Promotion. You need any help, you ask Tony here.

67
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:10,601
 Looks like he could use a workout.

68
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,911
 I, he, he, he, eh, it's not that difficult.

69
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:16,460
 So, I, I guess I could do it myself.

70
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:17,943
 Good answer.

71
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,590
 Don't let him intimidate you, McGee.

72
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:23,943
 That's my job today. Agent Todd?

73
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:26,070
 I didn't look.

74
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,481
 Oh, no. I believe you. I just have a little question

75
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:31,670
 that I want to ask you. Is she a pantyhose or a thong girl,

76
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:32,952
 'cause I'm thinking thong...ah!

77
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,171
 We've got a problem, Gibbs.

78
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:40,460
 Dammit, I hate this thing. Piece of crap.

79
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,520
 There's a secretary from the Pentagon downstairs, and

80
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:46,460
 she claims her boss is being held hostage. By his computer.

81
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:50,541
 See? There's a reason I didn't trust these things.

82
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,571
 Here, reboot that or something. Send her up.

83
00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:58,203
 Reboot it?

84
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,642
 Or you can do what we always do.

85
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,323
 it's his third one this month.

86
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:12,761
 When I brought him his coffee, I heard the computer talking to him.

87
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:13,961
 You've got mail?

88
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,743
 No, it was this weird electronic voice and then it cut off

89
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:22,472
 the second I entered the room. Look, I know it sounds crazy,

90
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,713
 but I can't tell you the rest until

91
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:26,240
 you promise that you won't try to contact him.

92
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:31,003
 Whatever you're afraid of, Ms. Wilkes, we can handle it.

93
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:36,433
 He slipped this into a stack of folders and

94
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:37,962
 then told me to take the rest of the day off.

95
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:41,900
 Forget your glasses, boss?

96
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,380
 Office under electronic surveillance, can't leave.

97
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,281
 Jill and Sandy kidnapped.

98
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,042
 Must transfer two mil to overseas account by 1800 or they die.

99
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:56,571
 Contact NCIS, no one else.

100
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,092
 Finally, someone who appreciates us.

101
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,861
 If anything should happen to them, I...

102
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,483
 I mean, she's jut a little girl, Agent Gibbs.

103
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,893
 The Watsons live in MacLean. There's no answer at home,

104
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:16,301
 and their daughter Sandy didn't show up to school this morning.

105
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:17,772
 It says here she's blind.

106
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,300
 Tony.

107
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,762
 I can confirm he's the comptroller for JSOC,

108
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,550
 office is in the A-right of the Pentagon.

109
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:23,910
 I'm pulling up the schematic now.

110
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:24,863
 JSOC?

111
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:29,113
 Joint Services Operational Command. They fund SMU. SMU stands for -

112
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:32,413
 Special Military Units, I worked with a few of them when I was Secret Service.

113
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,940
 So he can really transfer this kind of money overseas?

114
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:36,250
 More, if he needs to.

115
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:39,730
 Our bad guy'd have to pass through five security checkpoints

116
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,403
 to get to Watson's office.

117
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,141
 Well, the Pentagon records all access.

118
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,320
 There's 25,000 people working there, Kate.

119
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,943
 By the time we're finished downloading that list,

120
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,470
 the government's out two million dollars.

121
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:48,811
 Or Watson's family's dead.

122
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:50,783
 Well, it has to be someone on the inside.

123
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:53,040
 The Pentagon is the most secure building in the world.

124
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,582
 They could be using a Trojan.

125
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,601
 Well, she said that they were using his computer.

126
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,101
 A Trojan would give them backdoor access.

127
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,742
 You kiss your mother with that mouth, McGee?

128
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:06,683
 No, Tony, a Trojan's a program. It's like a virus; it establishes a gateway

129
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,182
 to a computer and allows a hacker to control the system.

130
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,781
 That still doesn't explain how it got onto his machine.

131
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,431
 Well, if they're good they could've done it from anywhere.

132
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:14,910
 Wouldn't even have to set foot in the building.

133
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,211
 How're they watching him, then?

134
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:17,440
 Could be using a web cam.

135
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:23,122
 Or they're lying. Kate, take McGee and search the Watson's house. Dinozzo,

136
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:27,031
 I want everything there is on Watson and his family by the time I get back.

137
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,200
 Where're you going, boss?

138
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:29,500
 Talk to Watson.

139
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,961
 Wait, Gibbs, if you show up -

140
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,400
 I'd better hope they don't notice.

141
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,071
 That is not a good call.

142
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:40,143
 Relax; you think Gibbs keeps that haircut to save on shampoo?

143
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:43,900
 Morning, Gunny.

144
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:45,036
 Morning, Staff Sergeant.

145
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,995
 Moving those dollars around, Captain?

146
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,477
 I’m trying. Only way I can stay beneath the radar is

147
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,200
 not make a withdrawal that doesn't exceed

148
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,432
 ten thousand dollars form any single operational budget.

149
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,411
 What's that?

150
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,500
 Well, this is an office. People are going to be dropping

151
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:01,460
 by with request forms all day long.

152
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:03,183
 Not today. Send them away.

153
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,391
 I keep doing that, they're going to get suspicious.

154
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:08,891
 Okay. Just don't forget what's at stake here, Captain.

155
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:13,471
 I won't. Bastard.

156
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:17,582
 Sorry to have missed the budget meeting yesterday, sir,

157
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,062
 but you know how the Colonel gets when he's sick.

158
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:20,762
 How’s he doing, Gunny?

159
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:24,703
 Better, sir, thank you. Wanted me to check with you, see if you needed any extra help down here.

160
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,450
 Tell him I appreciate it, but we got things covered.

161
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:33,230
 Roger that, sir. Latest batch of requests for you. Most immediate priority's on top.

162
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:41,243
 This must be that daughter you're always talking about. She is a beauty,sir.

163
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,552
 She is that, Gunny. She is that.

164
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:48,853
 You change your mind,sir, you just call. Go plenty of people willing to help you.

165
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:50,642
 I will, Gunny. Thank you.

166
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,790
 Have a nice day, sir.

167
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:56,213
 He’s gone.

168
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:01,023
 He is right about one thing. She is a little beauty.

169
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,443
 Who - who's there?

170
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,662
 Well, no signs of anyone observing the place.

171
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,942
Let's roll.

172
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,461
 Let's roll. She either left in a hurry or was forced to.

173
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:33,873
 What makes you think she just didn't leave it there?

174
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,781
 Because she's a little girl, McGee. They're not typically slobs.

175
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:41,043
 Remind me to introduce you to my little sister.

176
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:41,853
 what was that?

177
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,211
 Nothing, Agent Todd.

178
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:52,562
 You still pushing to be a full time field agent?

179
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,193
 Very much so.

180
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,463
 Well, we need to get in. Suggestions?

181
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,981
 Last time I encountered a situation like this

182
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,971
 Tony threw a rock through the window.

183
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:05,143
 yet another glaring difference between boys and girls. Follow me.

184
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:12,233
 He was right about one thing. She is a little beauty.

185
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,810
 Okay, Gibbs, your mike is coming in loud and clear.

186
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:16,700
 Who's that in the office with him, the devil?

187
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,680
 You know, considering no one in this room is actually deaf,

188
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:26,710
 that's really annoying. Hey, was that about me?

189
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,172
 Patch in the video, Abs.

190
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:34,592
 Not a very flattering angle.

191
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,271
 Yeah, well, it was the best I could do.

192
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:37,943
 What can you tell me about the voice?

193
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,471
 It sounds like this particle physicist I used to date.

194
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,782
 He had these tiny little Chiclet teeth,

195
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,640
 and an Eiffel Tower tattoo right -

196
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:45,373
 You want this or not?

197
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:50,242
 Okay. Obviously, it's being disguised. I think I can filter

198
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,662
 it back to its original state.

199
00:10:55,008 --> 00:11:00,282
 Yeah. Okay, I'll get that APB out the Lollipop Guild right away.

200
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,552
 Patience, Tony. 

201
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,352
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Not bad.

202
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:18,910
 Next thing I want you to do is hack into Watson's computer.

203
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:20,570
 It's the only link we have to the kidnapper.

204
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:24,350
 Gibbs, we are talking about the Pentagon here.

205
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,441
 Even their encryptions have encryptions.

206
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,623
 yeah? That dirtbag sure managed it.

207
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,830
 It probably took him months! Our best bet is to ask

208
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,851
 the DOD for access to their system.

209
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:37,470
 And the first thing they'll do is disconnect the connection.

210
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,380
 That happens, we end up with two dead dependents.

211
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:44,141
 I don't know if I can do it.

212
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:47,570
 Dinozzo, get McGee on the phone.

213
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:51,291
 Wait. I'll get in.

214
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:52,281
 Yeah?

215
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:53,333
 Yeah.

216
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:55,531
 I believe you.

217
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,361
 Relax. when's the last time Gibbs was wrong?

218
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,241
 Discounting the whole marriage thing, of course.

219
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:09,720
 Okay. McGee, hold me steady.

220
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:10,780
 Okay.

221
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:11,700
 Go left.

222
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,111
 Okay.

223
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,242
 No, no, no, my left, your right.

224
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:15,410
 Oh. Sorry.

225
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:17,701
 McGee, what are you doing?

226
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,563
 I'm doing what you're telling me to doing.

227
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:20,913
 Are your eyes closed?

228
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:21,421
 yes!

229
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,343
 Well then open them before you kill us!

230
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:24,681
 But this morning you -

231
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,632
 McGee, can't you tell when someone's kidding with you?

232
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:28,362
 I used to, then I met you guys.

233
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:31,663
 If you want to work with Gibbs, hen you're gonna have to get over that.

234
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,483
 Trust me, I know.

235
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:35,853
 Eyes open it is.

236
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:47,052
 Dinozzo! I need a way to communicate with Captain Watson.

237
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:50,201
 Communication problem solved, boss. Earwig radio receiver,

238
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,281
 used them all the time undercover in Baltimore.

239
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,093
 How do we get it in his ear?

240
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:57,590
 Did I also mention there's one tiny flaw in my plan?

241
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:01,940
 Dinozzo, I show back up there as a Gunny, this guy's gonna get suspicious.

242
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,290
 Well, you think I could pass for a Marine?

243
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,270
 I don't know. Let's shave your head and find out.

244
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,072
 Actually, I was leaning more toward a Merchant Marine kind of thing.

245
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,653
 I got a better idea, don't eat that.

246
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,350
 well, no signs of forced entry or a struggle.

247
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,923
 They could've been taken at gunpoint.

248
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,633
 Well, it's possible, but I don't think so.

249
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:29,891
 Why's that?

250
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:33,563
 Well, why go to the trouble of locking the front door behind you?

251
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:37,172
 Not bad, McGee. Tony hasn't completely ruined you yet.

252
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,393
 Their daughter must be quite the pianist.

253
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:47,302
 Beautiful, too. There's nothing here. We're wasting our time.

254
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:56,521
 Let's go. Uh-uh. I use the door.

255
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,633
 You lock it and go back out the window.

256
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,413
 I get it. You're kidding, right?

257
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,301
 Five hours left, Captain. Read the total.

258
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,540
 I’ve managed to isolate 900,000.

259
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:26,661
 I'd work faster if I were you. You're learning. You may answer.

260
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,211
 Enter.

261
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:33,282
 Hey, Cap'n. Got your sweet 'n sour with extra pineapple.

262
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,402
 You might want to change your order tomorrow,

263
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:37,260
 heard we're gettin' in some fresh duck.

264
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:39,940
 I’ll just stick with the usual.

265
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:44,873
 All right. 8.75 today. How's the family going?

266
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,570
 Find. You?

267
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:48,403
 Still having trouble communicating with the girlfriend.

268
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:53,491
 I talk, she doesn't listen...what are you gonna do?

269
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:01,003
 Oh, yeah, sure - for you.

270
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:03,131
 Thanks, Cap'n. See you tomorrow.

271
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:16,613
 Freeze. Open your lunch, show it to the camera. Now!

272
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,661
Enjoy!!

273
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,962
 Delivery complete.

274
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,303
 That's good work, Tony.

275
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:34,892
 Thanks, boss, that means a lot.

276
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:37,610
 NCIS doesn't work out, I hear General

277
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,310
 Wee's Chinese Restaurant's hiring.

278
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:45,023
 Abs, get the Captain up on the feed.

280
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:52,603
 This is Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS. If you can hear me, cough once.

281
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:56,473
 We are changing the game plan, Skipper.

282
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,272
 If he contacts you again, tell him you want a good faith gesture on his part.

283
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,192
 Tell him that you want your daughter returned now.

284
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,393
 Tell him if you don't get her back,

285
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,963
 you're gonna take your chances with the FBI.

286
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:13,642
 He'll try to intimidate you. We have to call his bluff.

287
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:17,621
 Rub your brow if you have the courage to go this route.

288
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:24,363
 You are not alone, Cap'n. We're gonna get through his together.

289
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:26,593
 I will be in touch.

290
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,531
 All right, I want these feeds hardwired into MTAC.

291
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:34,622
 Done.

292
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:35,933
 You inside his computer yet?

293
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:40,512
 Oh, um...I think, um...

294
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:41,303
 need help?

295
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:43,311
 Yeah.

296
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:47,543
 All you had to do was ask. One of the smartest people

297
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:48,671
 I know told me that once.

298
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:49,702
 Who?

299
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:50,732
 You.

300
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:58,283
 Car's still in the driveway, no signs of a struggle inside.

301
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:00,140
 I think they may have known their kidnapper.

302
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:01,210
 Or been duped.

303
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,452
 Looks like you and Tony have been making some progress.

304
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,520
 Not enough.

305
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,473
 Time to update, Captain.

306
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:07,252
 I’m doing my best.

307
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,301
 Just make your deadline.

308
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,803
 McGee. Help Abby get into Watson's computer. Hey, c'mon!

309
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:17,401
 A little short on deodorant, Tony?

310
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,310
 I’ve isolated nearly 1.3 million. Now I want a gesture of good faith from you.

311
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,761
 What kind of gesture, Captain?

312
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,801
 I want you to release my daughter. Immediately.

313
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:33,383
 Not gonna happen.

314
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,631
 Why? 'Cause they're already dead?

315
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,210
 How do I know that's not just a tape?

316
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:39,901
 You listen to me.

317
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,951
 You let Sandy go right now, or it's over. I’m going to the FBI.

318
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,453
 You'd never forgive yourself, you know.

319
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,380
 This is the hard part, Captain. Don't back down.

320
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:52,703
 Tell him you want to talk to your daughter.

321
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,062
 I want to speak to her. Right now!

322
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:01,613
 Plays the piano. Gifted, I hear. You don't need eyes to play the piano,

323
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:02,730
 but you sure as hell need ears.

324
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,053
 Sandy!

325
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:12,630
 One move, pop, Waterworld. And the other ear, pop. Total silence and darkness.

326
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:15,922
 We can't risk that.

327
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,792
 He's bluffing, stand your ground.

328
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,573
 Tell him if he does that, he'll never see a penny.

329
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:28,013
 Let her go unharmed, or I swear you'll never see a dime.

330
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:35,360
 You know I never was any good at taking orders, Captain.

331
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,300
 I screwed up. I screwed it all up.

332
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,763
 It's only been forty minutes, captain.

333
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:58,681
 He will contact you soon. Until then, you have to stay strong.

334
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:02,162
 It's our best chance of getting your family back.

335
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,090
 You got something to say?

336
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,840
 We're taking a really big risk here, Gibbs.

337
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,152
 Yeah, Kate? What happens to the little girl and

338
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:15,840
 her mother once this dirtbag gets the money?

339
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:16,970
 What, you think he'll kill them?

340
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,413
 You're the profiler. You tell me.

341
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,952
 Answer your phone, Captain.

342
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:28,012
 Where is she? Where's my daughter?

343
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,642
 I said, answer the phone, Captain!

344
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:37,592
 Yes?

345
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:38,391
 Daddy?

346
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:42,100
 Sandy, sweetheart, where are you?

347
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:46,630
 I don't know. He let me go but he said, he said he'll kill

348
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,622
 Mom I told anybody what happened.

349
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,732
 You tell me where she is.

350
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:55,852
 Morton Amtrak Station. You got your good faith gesture.
              Now get back to work.

352
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,721
 My people are on the way, Captain.

353
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,401
 You tell her to stay where she is. Go get her.

354
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:01,002
 Sandy, sweetheart, just say right there,

355
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,771
 don't, don't go anywhere, and Daddy,

356
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:07,422
 Daddy'll be there to get you in just a little while.

357
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:13,273
 Hang up the phone now, Captain, and believe me when

358
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:15,590
 I say your wife's life depends on it.

359
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:20,820
 I have to hang up now, baby. Listen,

360
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,590
 I want you to be brave for me, baby.

361
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:24,782
 This'll be over before you know it.

362
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,440
 Daddy, help me! Daddy!

363
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:30,820
 God forgive me.

364
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:05,890
 Face it, McGee. We are doomed.

365
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,663
-Okay, we can try random password generators.
-Did it.

367
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,013
-How about an open port scan?
-Done it.

369
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:14,952
-There's an undocumented hole on the east side -
-Tried it.

371
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:16,973
 Gibbs can't honestly expect us to hack

372
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:18,283
 into the Pentagon in a single afternoon!

373
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,083
 Yeah.

374
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:21,101
 Oh, you're right, we are doomed.

375
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:26,772
 We have to call DOD and hope they'll let us

376
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:27,690
 in without severing the connection.

377
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,681
 Unless...what if the Trojan isn't system-wide?

378
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,180
 If it was, our bad guy...

379
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,172
 Could just steal the money himself. He wouldn't need...

380
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,002
 Watson to do it for him. That means

381
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,720
 he can't access the rest of the network.

382
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,663
 We've been trying to hack the wrong place.

383
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:48,153
 Yeah. Right, scan for open UDP and TCP connections

384
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:54,433
 on the Geosock VPN...yes, yes...got multiple incoming packets.

385
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,800
 Port 139, 445.

386
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,841
 Looks like a variant of the DMC Trojan.

387
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:03,401
-I love it when you talk geek.
-I love it that you love it.

389
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,223
 I'll be sure to mention that to Captain Watson,

390
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,251
 right after we're done burying his family.

391
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,603
I would hold off on those funeral arrangements, Gibbs.

392
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,062
 The reason we're so excited...

393
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,951
 Is we just hacked Captain Watson's computer...

394
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,913
 And we should be able to backtrace the connection...

395
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:25,651
 no! No, no, no! No! No! Aah! My baby just French fried.

396
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:27,331
 The system’s overheated.

397
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:28,260
 So? Reboot it.

398
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:32,562
 Believe it or not, Gibbs, not all computer problems

399
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,381
 can be solved by rebooting.

400
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:35,390
 Works for me.

401
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,701
 Even if it does, it's going to take

402
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,672
 at least an hour for mine to cool down.

403
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,413
 And without air conditioning, it'll happen again.

404
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:43,051
 So take it someplace cooler.

405
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:46,091
 Where? This whole building is like an illegal sweatshop.

406
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,011
 Not the whole building, Abs.

407
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,881
 May I trouble you for the left ear, Mr. Palmer?

408
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:54,940
 Ah, one left ear, coming right up.

409
00:22:55,955 --> 00:23:00,370
 When is the DNA analysis coming back on the right toe grouping?

410
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:03,172
 Oh, should be ten, twelve, ah...days.

411
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:05,553
 Well, that's interesting.

412
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:06,460
 What's that, doctor?

413
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,441
 Oh, dear.

414
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:14,191
 It's not the left ear?

415
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:18,311
 It's the left; it's just not the right left. So to speak.

416
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:20,522
 Well that would mean that, ah...

417
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,910
 Three bodies. Time to start another table.

418
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:28,851
 Hey, Ducky. My computer died, we need someplace cooler to set up shop.

419
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:31,160
 Yeah, well, we're a bit tight on space at the moment,

420
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:33,941
 but, ah, you could use 107. 

421
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:46,042
        Definitely not 107.
 His family was supposed to make arrangements

422
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:52,502
 to pick him up last week. Ah, there we are. How's that?

423
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:53,913
 Perfect. Thank you.

424
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:59,062
 Fascinating, isn't it? Parts of three separate bodies,

425
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,501
 carved up with almost surgical precision.

426
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:03,192
 Why?

427
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:07,680
 Haven't a clue. We found them in a 55 gallon tub of alcohol

428
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:10,421
 behind Bethesda Naval Hospital last month.

429
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:13,601
 McGee? We're kinda running short on time.

430
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:14,663
 Oh, can I give you a hand?

431
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:17,471
 Whoa...well, uh...I'm all right.

432
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,141
 When I'm a mother, I'm never letting my kids out of my sight.

433
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:22,862
 Yeah? Well how do you plan on doing that?

434
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:25,051
 GPS locator strapped to their ankle. Audio and

435
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:26,622
 video surveillance built into their clothes.

436
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,602
 No, I mean the part about becoming a mother.

437
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,612
 Haha. Funny. The area looks clear to me.

438
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:32,212
 Me too. Let's go get that kid.

439
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,403
 Sandy? My name's Kate.

440
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,990
 And my name's Tony. We're NCIS agents. It stands for -

441
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:49,033
 I know what it stands for. You spoke at my school.

442
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:52,951
 Well, then you know that we're here to help you. Your daddy sent us.

443
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:55,490
 We know what happened to you and your mom, but you're safe now, okay?

444
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:58,012
 I heard him.

445
00:24:58,778 --> 00:24:59,691
 Heard who, honey?

446
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:08,810
 He didn't know it, but I heard him. He told my mom...he...he...

447
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,382
 he's going to make my Dad suffer.

448
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:19,901
 What the hell is it?

449
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:22,773
 A; It's probably some leftover bodily fluid.

450
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:24,692
 Oh, is that all?

451
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:25,442
 Yeah.

452
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:26,192
 Disgusting.

453
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,902
 If you want to be a full time field agent, Timothy,

454
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:30,922
 you're going to have to get used to sights like that.

455
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:35,292
 Is this a common occurrence, Ducky, dismembered bodies in tubs of alcohol?

456
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:38,241
 Well, now that you mention it, I did have a great-uncle

457
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:41,370
 who drowned in a vat of alcohol.

458
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,293
 I'm sorry to hear that.

459
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:47,021
 Of course, he reportedly climbed out three times to go to the bathroom.

460
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,052
 Hey. What's the holdup?

461
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,653
 We are almost set here.

462
00:25:55,197 --> 00:26:01,520
 McGee, if I were you, I would spend more time working and less time cleaning.

463
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,790
 Yes. Yes, sorry, boss.

464
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,161
 Duck. Got a patient upstairs for you.

465
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:18,122
 There you go. Feel better now?

466
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,352
 Yes. Thank you.

467
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:23,691
 Well, you've been a very brave patient, so I think you deserve a surprise.

468
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:26,211
 A Hershey bar?

469
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:30,620
 Yes. Are you sure you're blind?

470
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:32,402
 I can smell it.

471
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,851
 Ah. I'll be right back, Sandy. I need a few moments to talk to my friends.

472
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:45,351
 It took him 45 to drop him off. You figure 22 minutes out, same back,

473
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:47,672
 gives you a fifteen mile radius where he could be located.

474
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:51,363
 Hundreds of square miles and what? We have two hours left.

475
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:55,011
 We also pulled tapes from the train station. 

476
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:57,230
 Might catch a shot of him dropping the kid off.

477
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:01,931
 Gibbs? It's, like, a hundred degrees in here. How can you drink that stuff?

478
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:05,293
 Keeps me cool. How's she doing, Duck?

479
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:07,900
 Remarkably well, considering the circumstances.

480
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,021
 What does she remember?

481
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:10,440
 Unfortunately, everything.

482
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:12,050
 Except for where she was.

483
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:14,452
 Maybe you haven't asked the right questions.

484
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:19,010
 Well, she's eight and blind, Ducky. It's not a great help in a situation like.

485
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:24,321
 Sandy - are you thirsty?

486
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:29,222
 A little bit. Can I have some water?

487
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:39,601
 Okay. I'm back in. Initiating a back trace from Watson's computer. ??

488
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:41,840
 on board encryption.

489
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,762
 It's commercial grade, so consider it cracked right...now.

490
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,772
 Yes, Team McGee does it again.

491
00:27:53,997 --> 00:27:54,811
 Why Team McGee?

492
00:27:55,785 --> 00:28:01,472
 Well, no offense, I am the special agent. Hm. Must have switched off the audio.

493
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:03,890
 Team Abby. I'm the smart one.

494
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:11,571
 You wanna scream? Scream. No one will hear you.

495
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:21,682
 Sandy. This is really important. Can you tell us anything

496
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:22,593
 about the car you were driven in?

497
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:28,413
 Well, it was a van and there were no windows in back.

498
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:30,172
 How could you tell?

499
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,253
 Because I couldn't feel the sun on my face.

500
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:39,540
 What about the place he was keeping you and your mom? Anything unusual about it?

501
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:45,901
 I don't know. I was real scared and I could hear him talking

502
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:51,782
 to my mo and she was crying and...he kept on pulling my hair.

503
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:54,191
 It's okay, Sandy, just tell us what you remember.

504
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:58,760
 Yeah, Gibbs. All right. We're on our way.

505
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:04,030
 I want you to stay here with Doctor Mallard. We have to check -

506
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:08,372
 I heard. You can see my mom on your computer now.

507
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:15,093
 I hear lots of things other kids can't. Can I help you?

508
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,650
 Your husband has less than two hours to make my deadline.

509
00:29:32,678 --> 00:29:34,083
 I'm engaging the audio filters right now.

510
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,240
 There'll be a slight delay with picture.

511
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:46,471
 But what he doesn't know is if he makes it or not, you're never going home.

512
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:57,711
 Time's running out, Captain.

513
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,630
Look, I've been able to isolate 1.8 million.

514
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:03,912
 If I send it now, will you release my wife?

515
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:10,031
 How about I send you back 1.8 of your wife? You want me to keep an arm or a leg?

516
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:13,863
 Captain, we need more time. You have to stall him.

517
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:18,110
 It’s getting harder to find open accounts.

518
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:20,480
 You're going to have to give me more time.

519
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,580
 You have ninety minutes. Make it, your wife lives.

520
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:26,120
 Don't, she dies. It's your call, Captain.

521
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:30,903
 Negotiate, Captain. Tell him you need at least three more hours.

522
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:37,230
 I repeat, tell him you need at least three hours.

523
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:39,923
 I’ll meet your deadline.

524
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:41,350
 ah, damn.

525
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:48,380
 Good news, boss. I found a shot of our bad guy's vehicle on the trains station tapes.

526
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:49,301
 The little girl was right.

527
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:50,820
 It's a white van with no windows.

528
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:51,402
 You run the plates?

529
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:52,593
 Came back stolen.

530
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,200
 And this helps me because, Dinozzo?

531
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:59,981
 I also ID'd our dirtbag. Pulled his prints from Sandy's hair, uh, thingies.

532
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:01,893
 Barrettes.

533
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:07,930
 Right. He's a former Petty Officer, name's Kyle Grayson.

534
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,440
 Did six years in Leavenworth for embezzling government

535
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:14,322
 funds and Captain Watson as responsible for putting him there.

536
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,220
 Good job.

537
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:24,242
 We're going to play some sounds from the room you were in, Sandy.

538
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:26,552
 We think it might help you remember better.

539
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,690
 Can you just play certain hertz if I want you to?

540
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,150
 Sure, how'd you know that?

541
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:35,902
 From the piano. I know the number of vibrations of every key.

542
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,590
 Like key number forty-four, E4.

543
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:47,842
 That's 329.63 hertz. A5 is 880. My mom says I'm half bat.

544
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:50,062
 Well, that's cool. I love bats.

545
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:54,630
 Me too. I like your voice, Abby. It's kinda gravelly.

546
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,870
 Thank you. All right, you ready to show off for us?

547
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:05,271
 Morton Amtrak Station. You got your good faith gesture, now get back to work.

548
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:15,662
 There's birds up kinda high. Try a G7 - the 83rd key. That's 3136 hertz.

549
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:23,031
 That is amazing, Sandy. I'll be right back. 

550
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:27,543
-Gibbs, she's incredible, you gotta see her 
-I want her listening to the live feed.

551
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,420
 Gibbs, she's been traumatized enough.

552
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:40,063
 Yeah? Howa bout growing up without a mother, Kate? Hey, Sandy. I need you to -

553
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:47,051
 Listen to the live feed. I want to help my mom, Agent Gibbs. I can take it.

554
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:51,212
 here.

555
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:52,662
 What's this?

556
00:32:53,168 --> 00:32:56,462
 Your very own NCIS badge. You ready?

557
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:57,581
 Yeah.

558
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:03,591
 McGee. Bring the live feed up on the speakers. Sandy.

559
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:09,783
 We need to know anything you can tell us about where he is keeping your mom.

560
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:16,123
 When I took this job, I was instructed not to hurt you or the little princess.

561
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:20,703
 But your husband cost me six years.

562
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:24,272
 Who hired you?

563
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:30,301
 I don't really care. The point is, I've decided your husband has to pay for that.

564
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:31,131
 Why?

565
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:33,680
 No more questions.

566
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:52,500
 Go in the area of A7. I mean, 4000 hertz. Bring it two keys down. I mean, 3800.

567
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:56,881
 Sounds like a train.

568
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:03,002
 It's getting closer. It's passing right...now.

569
00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:06,080
 1706. What time's the next train scheduled ??.

570
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:07,300
 I'm on it, boss.

571
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,611
 Can you remember anything else about the train sounds?

572
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:21,341
 We drove over a lot of tracks. My mom...she...she squeezed my hand every time.

573
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:24,262
 How many times?

574
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:30,620
 I don't know, a lot. What is he doing to her? Why is she crying?

575
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,103
 You did great, Sandy.

576
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:38,902
 Are you going to save my mom now?

577
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,840
 Oh yeah, you can count on that. Let's roll.

578
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:54,240
 Hey. The only train in the area's an Amtrak.

579
00:34:54,847 --> 00:35:00,371
 It left DC at 16:20 and arrived Lorton 17:30,

580
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:01,600
 average speed 65 miles an hour.

581
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:05,390
 Now, we know it passed our dirtbag at 17:06, right?

582
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:13,733
 So...dammit. I owe Mrs. Powers an apology.

583
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:14,360
 Who?

584
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:17,483
 My tenth grade math teacher. I told her I'd never be able

585
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:18,801
 to use anything she taught us in real life.

586
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:20,800
 It's here. Seven miles outside of Lorton.

587
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:26,341
 There's an abandoned train maintenance yard about half a mile north.

588
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:29,921
 That's the place. McGee, you tell Watson to delay sending the money.

589
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:30,833
 Well how?

590
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,380
 Any way you can, c'mon, let's go! Now!

591
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,960
 Five minutes left. Tell me you have the two million, Captain.

592
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,110
 I have it.

593
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:48,491
 Stand by to copy the ISP and routing number. ISP is CS.CN.ACN.

594
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:49,763
 Read it back to me.

595
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:58,170
 CS.CN.ACN. Beijing.

596
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,560
 Very good, Captain.

597
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:17,853
 McGee, talk to me.

598
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:20,910
 Okay, he's giving Watson the wire transfer code. Do you have a visual yet?

599
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:24,520
 Negative. Tell the Captain to stall for more time.

600
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,743
 Captain Watson, you have to buy us a few more minutes.

601
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:29,632
 I repeat, you have to buy us a few more minutes.

602
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:33,863
 He's not listening to me.

603
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:36,973
 Tell him the second he transfers that money, his wife is dead.

604
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:40,113
 Captain Watson, your wife is gonna be murdered - ow!

605
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:42,261
 Okay, Gibbs, he took out the earwig.

606
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:43,741
 I got nothing, boss.

607
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:52,152
 The routing number is A1213669B1. Read that back to me.

608
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:56,261
 A1213669B1

609
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:59,201
 That's correct. Now make me rich.

610
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,873
 And I have your word you're gonna release my wife?

611
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:11,413
 Yes. My word. Now send it.

612
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:21,570
 he's sending the money to Asia. If I can tag his transmission with a marker,

613
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:22,593
 we might be able to follow it.

614
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:25,432
 Gibbs, he sent it, I think he's gonna shoot her, what do I do?

615
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:27,360
 Something, McGee, anything!

616
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:38,780
 This is the FBI, Grayson. We have you surrounded.

617
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:39,552
 Come out with your hands in the air.

618
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:40,772
 The hell?

619
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,692
 You didn't really think you'd get away with this?

620
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:59,063
 You two inside. I'll cut him off. We take him alive.

621
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,591
 Come on, let's go. Come on. Go.

622
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:17,621
 Clear.

623
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:44,853
 C'mon! You come any closer and I'll shoot her!

624
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,461
 Come out where I can see you! Now!

625
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:50,952
 Just like in Colombia.

626
00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:56,652
 You're not getting out of here, Grayson. It's over.

627
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:01,423
 I know the FBI's SOP. I want a cell phone and negotiator, now!

628
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:03,660
 We're not the FBI, dirtbag.

629
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:08,922
 Drop the weapon.

630
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,082
 Everything does gonna be all right now, sweetheart. Everything.

631
00:39:26,716 --> 00:39:27,952
 Kinda makes you think.

632
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:30,333
 'Bout what?

633
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,050
 Having kids someday.

634
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:38,092
 Yeah. I don't think I could handle that.

635
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:42,832
 Don’t know how we can ever thank you, Agent Gibbs.

636
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:46,082
 We owe you so much.

637
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,452
 You can thank Special Agent Watson here.

638
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:53,421
 We couldn't have done without her. Thanks.

639
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:03,940
 We did good today, Gibbs.

640
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:10,642
 Did we, Special Agent Todd? Grayson doesn't have the smarts to be in this alone.

641
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:13,773
 We still have to find out who hired him.

642
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:15,042
 Not gonna get it from Grayson.

643
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:17,561
 Why not? Get him to roll for a deal.

644
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:20,482
 I don't deal.

645
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,581
 he doesn’t deal?

646
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:26,211
 Not when Grayson doesn't know who hired him.

647
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:31,081
 This guy's good. We lost the money for a little while in Hong Kong.

648
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:34,162
 But McGee's bots picked it up again on the way to Zurich.

649
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:36,740
 And with Abby's encryption algorithm embedded in the transaction -

650
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:38,881
 Okay, would you two, just for a sec, just pretend

651
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,611
 I don't know anything about computers?

652
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:41,431
 Pretend?

653
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,721
 Can we get this guy or not?

654
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,443
 Well, we've been following the money for the last eight hours,

655
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,233
 and if it transfers into a country

656
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:53,462
 where we have jurisdiction...wait. I don't believe this.

657
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:54,573
 What?

658
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:57,513
 It's headed back here.

659
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:00,661
 Washington, DC.

660
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:20,201
 Captain Watson.

661
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:23,830
 Agent Gibbs. This is not what you think.

662
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:26,513
 You're right. It wasn't.

663
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,702
 You did this to your own family?

664
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:31,380
 No, nobody was supposed to get hurt.

665
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,603
 That tight enough for you, Cap'n?

666
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:38,602
 I can't believe this is happening. The perfect plan.

667
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:41,140
 Even Grayson didn't know who hired him.

668
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:42,902
 How the hell'd you figure this out?

669
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:45,900
 Next time, you might want to send your note to the FBI.

670
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:51,422
 Look, you don't understand. I needed the money because -

671
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:59,193
 Don't you dare tell me that there's a reason for you throwing away what you had.

672
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:29,472
 Your network is up and operational now. so, uh, I'll be heading back to Norfolk.

673
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:34,890
 I'll take that as a thank you.

674
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,632
 McGee. Where're you going?

675
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:40,050
 Ah, Norfolk?

676
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:45,311
 Well, I got some good news, and some bad news for you. You've just been promoted.

677
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:47,520
 To a full time field agent.

678
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:51,573
 Really? That's incredible, what's -

679
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,440
 You belong to me now.

680
00:42:55,168 --> 00:42:55,801
 Congratulations.

681
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:57,573
 Yeah. What she said.

682
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:04,431
 Wha, so, uh, I'm one of you guys now? No more getting coffee, no more hazing?

683
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:05,700
 Sure.

684
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:10,823
 All right, well, I just want to say, I never took it personal,

685
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:12,780
 and I, I really look forward to...

686
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:19,220
 You know I could really get used to that.

687
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:35,001
