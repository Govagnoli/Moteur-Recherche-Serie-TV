1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,700
Keep screaming, honey.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,940
That way the monster
will never find you.

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,780
Shh! Don't want to wake
the neighbors now, do we?

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,940
No rough stuff... yet.

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,900
This is going to be good.

6
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:42,953
Whoa. Hey, easy now.

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,520
Easy.

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,580
Easy.

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,580
Please don't...!

10
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,260
Break out the gear.

11
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,380
I'll coordinate with the MPs.

12
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,500
You drink that, DiNozzo, you're dead.

13
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,620
Just my luck.

14
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,260
One more hour and we'd
have been off duty.

15
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,140
You got big plans today, Tony?

16
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,100
Well, it is Saturday, Kate.

17
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,780
What do you think?

18
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,300
You have a date with a girl
who can't spell her last name?

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,260
First name?

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,140
No, I'm supposed to volunteer at
the Eighth Street soup kitchen today.

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,900
Wait... You help feed the homeless?

22
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,740
Don't be so surprised.

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,740
Sorry, I just never pictured
you as a volunteer type.

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,500
Well, there's a lot about
me you don't know, Kate.

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,580
You're right.

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,060
I'm actually impressed for once.

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,340
Coffee, probie.

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,420
Looks like you could use it.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,460
Oh, thanks, Tony.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,660
Don't mention it.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,540
You know, I think he's finally
starting to warm up to me.

32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,700
He even invited me to
a party this afternoon.

33
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,860
Really? Where?

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,820
It's a soup kitchen in DC.

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
A bunch of Playboy centerfolds
hosting a fund-raiser there.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Seems pretty open and shut.

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,660
Perp broke in, tried to rape her.

38
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,300
She shot him.

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,460
Guy's in critical condition
at the base hospital.

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,740
I have a Marine standing guard.

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,580
You I.D. him yet, Sergeant?

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,620
No, and he's not exactly in
talking shape, either, sir.

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,220
This much blood loss, the
guy's lucky to be alive.

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,380
Where's Mrs. Rowans?

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,700
With the neighbor next door.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,380
We'll need her statement.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,220
This is Sergeant Hagerty.

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,540
Bring Mrs. Rowans home.

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,540
I'll meet you out front.

50
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,420
Where's the weapon?

51
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,460
It's over here, the
other side of the couch.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,900
You touch it?

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,860
Hell no, sir.

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,780
I did get the serial number, though.

55
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,620
It's registered with the Provost Marshal

56
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,340
under her husband's
name Major David Rowans.

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,220
He's deployed in Iraq.

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,740
Been gone for over five months.

59
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,420
We checked the exterior
of the house, Gibbs.

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,660
No sign of a forced entry.

61
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,500
They tend to leave their doors unlocked.

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,180
"They," Sergeant?

63
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,060
This is a military base, ma'am.

64
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,460
The women expect a certain level
of security in their own home.

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,900
I suspect that will change after today.

66
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,460
Kate, DiNozzo, I want you to
head over to the base hospital.

67
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,420
I want this dirtbag's personal
effects and his prints.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,420
Yeah.

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,980
Enjoying that coffee, McGee?

70
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,220
Uh, yeah.

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,820
It's not too hot?

72
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,340
It's your coffee.

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,900
I'm sorry, boss.

74
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,860
I'll get you another one.

75
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,420
Thanks.

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,100
Yeah, maybe next time, you
should remember rule 23.

77
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,620
Is the at one about not marrying

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,900
a woman who eats more than you do?

79
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,580
Never mess with a Marine's coffee
if you want to live, Agent DiNozzo.

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,460
That's right.

81
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,540
Dead man walking.

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,260
Let me guess you take
it black, Agent Gibbs?

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,020
Marines always do.

84
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,060
What about you, Agent McGee?

85
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,540
Cream and sugar?

86
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,180
Uh, you know what, I still have
to take some photos outside,

87
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,420
so maybe later, but thank you.

88
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,740
Is he old enough to be; an NCIS agent?

89
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,180
I ask myself that every day.

90
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,700
Thanks.

91
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,060
sorry this place is such a mess.

92
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,140
I wasn't expecting any company.

93
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,540
Am I in trouble, Agent Gibbs?

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,380
You did what you had to do, Mrs. Rowans.

95
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,220
Please call me Laura.

96
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,300
I just have a few questions
I need to ask you, Laura.

97
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,380
Is he going to die?

98
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,140
Maybe.

99
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,700
I just wanted him to go away.

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,140
I didn't want to kill him.

101
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,260
Did you know him?

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,460
I never saw him before in my life.

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,340
Any idea how he got in?

104
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,180
I usually leave the back door
unlocked when I'm downstairs.

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,500
My husband doesn't like me
to smoke inside the house.

106
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,180
Is he the one who
taught you how to shoot?

107
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,460
Yeah.

108
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,140
He's a smart guy.

109
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,620
How long have you two been married?

110
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,300
Civilian time...

111
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,820
four years.

112
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,820
Marine time is more like two.

113
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,220
He's been away a lot.

114
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,300
Must get lonely.

115
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,180
Um... we don't have
kids, so I don't really

116
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
fit in with the wives on base.

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,420
I manage, I guess.

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,620
Do you have a place to stay tonight?

119
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
My mom lives in Maryland.

120
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,900
Is it okay if I go there?

121
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,260
Just make sure we have her number.

122
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,100
You, uh...

123
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,380
you think of anything,
you want to talk...

124
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,700
give me a call.

125
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,660
Or you could e-mail me night or day.

126
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,860
I hate hospitals.

127
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,660
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he's already dead.

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,940
Hi.

129
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,220
I'm Special Agent Todd...

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,940
Tony DiNozzo, NCIS.

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,940
This is Special Agent Todd.

132
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,180
I'd love to ask you a few questions.

133
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,500
Say... over lunch, Lieutenant...?

134
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,100
Uh, Kim.

135
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,980
And this is my engagement
ring, Agent DiNozzo.

136
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,060
I brought my lunch.

137
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,540
How can I help you?

138
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,900
What can you tell us about the gunshot

139
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,860
victim brought in last night?

140
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,900
I already told the
MPs everything I know.

141
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,180
We're not MPs.

142
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
What kind of shape is he in?

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,500
Stable for the moment.

144
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,740
Well, we'll need to talk to him.

145
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,380
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

146
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,180
He's in ICU.

147
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,940
He might be dead tomorrow, and
we need answers now, Lieutenant.

148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,820
He's not conscious, and he won't
be until tomorrow, Agent Todd.

149
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,940
What about his personal effects?

150
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,100
Right here.

151
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
We had to cut off most of his clothing.

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,500
We'll need to get his
prints before we go.

153
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,220
That will also have to wait until...

154
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,220
Tomorrow. Right.

155
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,300
Lieutenant, this man tried
to rape someone, so...

156
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,020
We'll come back.

157
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,660
Agent Todd make sure the
MP guarding him doesn't

158
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,100
screw up the DD-932-A6 form
the way he did last time.

159
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,180
If he does, it's your ass.

160
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,100
We clear?

161
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,500
Crystal.

162
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,220
Crystal what?

163
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,540
Sir.

164
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,100
Better.

165
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,940
Now get moving. I don't have all day.

166
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,820
Your MP's outside room 107.

167
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,580
So wait... what were you saying
before about not being married?

168
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,420
Or you're almost married...

169
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,260
thinking about it...

170
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,020
on a fence.

171
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Every road with access into Quantico

172
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,500
is blocked by armed gate guards.

173
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,020
There's Marines everywhere.

174
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,740
So why would a rapist
choose a victim here?

175
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,780
Maybe he's got a death
wish, Agent McGee.

176
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,540
There's easier ways to die.

177
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,420
It doesn't make sense.

178
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,580
You about done here, sir?

179
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,700
Yeah, about, Sergeant.

180
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,980
Just one
thing--

181
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,420
How'd our dirtbag get on base?

182
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,060
I've been asking myself that
same question, Agent Gibbs.

183
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,980
I want you and your
Marines to check every car

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,260
within a five mile radius
of Laura Rowan's house.

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,580
For what specifically?

186
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,980
Make sure their military
decals are current.

187
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,260
They match up with
the plates on the car.

188
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,340
You got it.

189
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,860
(Sorry.)

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,380
(Watch where you're throwing.)

191
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
(You threw it, you go get it.)

192
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,580
Any cars don't check
out, you call me, okay?

193
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,500
Hey, man, throw it.

194
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,220
Whoa!

195
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,900
Yeah!

196
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,820
It was... was a game.

197
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,860
Laura invited me over...

198
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,140
I thought she loved me...

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
According to our rapist, he was
invited over by Laura Rowans.

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
Oh, what was that little tip that

201
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,840
I picked up as a cop in Baltimore?

202
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
Right on the...

203
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,840
Oh, yeah!

204
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,400
Rapists are liars, Kate.

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,240
I don't think we should
rule out anything, Tony.

206
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, really?

207
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Do you now, probie?

208
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,680
All we have is Mrs. Rowans' word
for what happened last night.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
So you want to drag her in here

210
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,280
and accuse her of
attempted murder, McGee?

211
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,200
No, I didn't say that.

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,200
No. Let's do it.

213
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
Not like she hasn't been
through enough crap already.

214
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
You would know, you're
the master at giving it.

215
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,200
Watch your lip, probie.

216
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey!

217
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,440
Your little quivering lip!

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,320
Hey!

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,560
My God.

220
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,840
I swear, the two of you are worse than

221
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,000
my brothers and they're
practically psychotic.

222
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,600
We have to I.D. this guy.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,880
If we find a connection
between the two of them,

224
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,600
we bring Laura Rowans
in for questioning.

225
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Agreed?

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,560
His name's Jeremy Davison.

227
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Sergeant Hagerty found his car

228
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,600
parked outside the Quantico rear gate.

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Keys, wallet,

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
I.D. all inside.

231
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,800
Run his phone records, see if

232
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,200
he ever communicated with Mrs. Rowans.

233
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,920
I am on it.

234
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,560
McGee.

235
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,160
Yeah, boss?

236
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Get a search warrant for that address.

237
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,840
On it.

238
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,200
Hey, Kate.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Your brothers really like that?

240
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,160
Sadly, yes.

241
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,640
Ah. Explains a lot.

242
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Jeremy Davison has no
criminal record, Gibbs.

243
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
He's a civilian, no
ties to the military,

244
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,320
his prints don't match
any open case files.

245
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,280
The boy doesn't even
have a speeding ticket.

246
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
We're talking cleaner than
clean, whiter than white.

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
You put him in a line-up with
snow, snow is going to jail.

248
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,720
Or it just means he's never been caught.

249
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
Or it just means he was never caught.

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
I want you to run the
DNA from his blood.

251
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,480
Cross reference it with every
database you can think of.

252
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Considering there's no
centralized DNA depository,

253
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,880
that could take months
and months and months...

254
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
Uh-huh. Then you better get started.

255
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,920
You think he did it?

256
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,520
Kind of depends on
your definition of "it."

257
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,640
Spoken like a true politician, Gibbs.

258
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
Still going through
his phone records, boss.

259
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Nothing so far to or from Quantico.

260
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,480
Home and office?

261
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,160
And cell.

262
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,600
Got the warrant to his apartment.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,720
It's in Alexandria.

264
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,000
Keys.

265
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,720
I'll get the sedan.

266
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,560
No, you stay on the phone records.

267
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
McGee, I want everything there is

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
on Davison by the time I get back.

269
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,040
Kate.

270
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,640
Come on, you're with me.

271
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,360
Let's go.

272
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,640
Clear.

273
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,480
Clear.

274
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,920
This is sort of how I
always pictured Tony's place.

275
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,560
Yeah, except DiNozzo
has better furniture.

276
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,880
All right, let's find out
who this guy really is.

277
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,000
You might want to come
take a look at this, Gibbs.

278
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,960
She had to have sent him that.

279
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,560
Yeah? How do you figure that?

280
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Let's just say theoretically,
I had a picture like this.

281
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,960
I wouldn't be handing them
out on a street corner.

282
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,760
Yeah, well, okay, since
we're being theoretical,

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,960
what about if the guy happens
to work in a photo shop?

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,040
Here's an e-mail from
Laura Rowans to Davison.

285
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,800
"The thought of us
possibly meeting, Niceguy,

286
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,800
"is both exhilarating and terrifying.

287
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,000
"On one hand, I can imagine
you throwing me down and..."

288
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,440
Whoa.

289
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,240
Whoa, what?

290
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,240
Whoa, it's, uh, it's
pretty specific, Gibbs.

291
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,080
Yeah?

292
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,400
Uh, by specific, I mean, uh, explicit.

293
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,160
In the truest, most
pornographic sense of the word.

294
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah, I'd say that's,
uh, specific, Kate.

295
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Bag it.

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Jeremy?

297
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,480
He's not here.

298
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,360
Who the hell are you?!

299
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
Special Agent Gibbs and Todd, NCIS.

300
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
NCI-what?

301
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,680
We're Federal agents
executing a search warrant.

302
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,560
Who are you?

303
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Michelle.

304
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,200
Michelle Davison.

305
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,880
Jeremy's sister.

306
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,680
Is he okay?

307
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
Your brother was shot last night

308
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,600
breaking into a home on a Marine base.

309
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,080
He's in critical condition.

310
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Oh, my God.

311
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,360
I knew it, I knew something
like this was going to happen.

312
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Something like what?

313
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,280
He went on a date last night with
some girl he met on the Internet.

314
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,120
Ooh, is it my birthday?

315
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
Yeah, you see a bow on top?

316
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
We think Laura Rowans was having

317
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,560
an online affair with Jeremy Davison.

318
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,600
Really?

319
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,600
I could have

320
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,600
told her, Internet
romances never work out.

321
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,800
They all end in attempted murder, Abby?

322
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Only the really hot ones, Tony.

323
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
I want proof it's true before

324
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,400
I drag Mrs. Rowans in here.

325
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,280
Is this Davison's computer?

326
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:43,920
Yep.

327
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,040
If I'm gonna find
something conclusive, Gibbs,

328
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm gonna have to have
the lady's as well.

329
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,760
McGee's on the way with it.

330
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,280
Then we're in business.

331
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,320
When do you need it by?

332
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,120
Now.

333
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,640
Wow! Laura Rowans wrote these?

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,880
Allegedly.

335
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,080
Okay, Abby, I'll of course need
copies of all of them, all right?

336
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,040
What?

337
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,840
Hey, McGee.

338
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
Ready to plunge into the seedy
side of the Internet with me?

339
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,360
I thought we agreed never

340
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
to discuss that at work.

341
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,800
McGee, I'm talking about the case.

342
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,760
Right, the case.

343
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay, we'll leave the two of you alone.

344
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
But Gibbs won't, so I'd get busy.

345
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,680
DiNozzo!

346
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm investigating here these letters

347
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
speak to the suspect's state of mind.

348
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,040
I've read them, and they're
all pretty much the same.

349
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,000
I've only read two, and if
you think they're all the same,

350
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,280
then we definitely need to talk, Kate.

351
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,720
12 years of Catholic school says
that ain't ever gonna happen.

352
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,880
Do you still have the pleated skirt?

353
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,640
Get that.

354
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,440
Yeah.

355
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,320
So, uh, what's going on?

356
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,000
Gibbs just said to bring
Laura Rowans' computer;

357
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,680
he didn't say why.

358
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,600
We've got a cybersex attempted
murder kill-thing going on, McGee.

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,440
Really?

360
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,400
Cool, huh?

361
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,240
Yeah.

362
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,400
Come on...

363
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,520
Let's say Laura did invite
Davison back to her house?

364
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,080
Thank you.

365
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
What would she gain from shooting him?

366
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,600
Maybe he was blackmailing her?

367
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,160
DiNozzo, he was lying on the
floor with two bullets in him.

368
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,640
She could havefinished him off.

369
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
Instead, she dialed 911.

370
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,040
She get cold feet?

371
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,280
Or Davison decided to surprise her,

372
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,400
take it to next step
from fantasy to reality.

373
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
Well, if they only communicated
online, there's a possibility

374
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,640
that she didn't even
know what he looked like.

375
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,360
So you're saying the whole thing
might have been an accident?

376
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,040
I don't believe in accidents.

377
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,320
Or Davison could be your
garden-variety psycho.

378
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,120
He latched on to Laura and
he didn't want to let go.

379
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
We're missing something here.

380
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
And I think we found it, boss.

381
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,040
Laura Rowans and Jeremy Davison
were definitely in contact.

382
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
We can trace their e-mail exchanges

383
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
back to the day they met online.

384
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Four months ago,

385
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,640
on a little Web site
called the Scarlet Secret.

386
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,840
This is their home page.

387
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
Oh, I got to get one of these.

388
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,400
DiNozzo.

389
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm talking about the
plasma screen, Kate.

390
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,640
What is this?

391
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Well, um, you know Friendster,
where people make web pages

392
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
with personal profiles to
connect with their friends online?

393
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,480
And their friends lead to their
friends and so on and so on.

394
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Okay... you know what
friends are, right?

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Abby.

396
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,280
Well, it's kind of like that,
only it's explicitly for sex.

397
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,440
Male, female, preferences, fetishes.

398
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,760
And you follow the chain of
pages, it should lead to somewhat

399
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,480
anonymous cybersex or a real
face-to-face meeting, if you want.

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,600
You're a member?

401
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,320
No.

402
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,200
No, she just created

403
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280
the page to look online.

404
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
I did a little trial and error,
with Laura Rowans' screen name--

405
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,600
HomeAlone325, and Jeremy
Davison's Niceguy653.

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,080
Care to guess which fetish
they have in common, Kate?

407
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,280
No, no, I'm going to hell
just listening to all of this.

408
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Rape fantasies.

409
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,320
What kind of a woman
is into rape fantasies?

410
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,080
Actually, it's not that uncommon, Kate.

411
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Actually, it's sick
and disturbing, McGee.

412
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,280
I dad a girl once who used
to wear my police uniform

413
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,680
and make me call her Detective Sipowicz.

414
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
What the hell's wrong with you?

415
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,280
It wasn't my idea.

416
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,360
Well, the police
uniform part was, but...

417
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,360
How long's Gibbs going
to make her sit there?

418
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
It's called brewing, probie.

419
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
She's scared, nervous,
imagining the worst.

420
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,560
You gotta give it time to percolate.

421
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,920
What's going on, Agent Gibbs?

422
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,640
I thought you said I
wasn't in any trouble.

423
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
What makes you think you're in trouble?

424
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm in an interrogation room.

425
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,800
Did the man die?

426
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,560
You mean Jeremy Davison?

427
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,400
Is that his name?

428
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,080
One of them.

429
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,160
He's still alive.

430
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Though, you might know
him better as Niceguy653.

431
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

432
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,400
No?

433
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,520
Where did you get that?

434
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,600
Off of Jeremy Davison's computer.

435
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,240
I don't understand? How?

436
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,840
You sent it to him.

437
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,720
No, I sent this to my husband in Iraq.

438
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,400
I told you, I never saw
that man before in my life.

439
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,000
How could I send this to him?

440
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
You spend a lot of time on the Internet,

441
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,200
Mrs. Rowans.

442
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
Why? What does that
have to do with anything?

443
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
It was an observation, not a question.

444
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, my God.

445
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
You think I wrote this.

446
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,440
Tell me about the
Scarlet Secret Web site.

447
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,120
Uh... I...

448
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,640
Where discriminating adults go to play.

449
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,640
Ring any bells?

450
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,520
It's not like that.

451
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
You and Jeremy decided to
have a little cyber fling.

452
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,080
One of you decided to
take it to the next level.

453
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
I want to know which one.

454
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,960
I've never cheated on
my husband; I wouldn't.

455
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,880
It was just supposed to be a game.

456
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,560
Does this feel like a game, Mrs. Rowans?

457
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:22,640
I, uh, I fooled around
a couple times online,

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,640
but I never gave anyone
my name or my picture.

459
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,280
It was harmless!

460
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,280
It was just a fantasy!

461
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,760
This is sounding like attempted murder.

462
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
I have to talk to Gibbs.

463
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,200
Uh, you're going to have to
wait, because the last time

464
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,800
I disturbed him in interrogation
was the last time...

465
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,160
No, McGee, this is an emergency.

466
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,520
We screwed up big time.

467
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
Then how do you explain this?

468
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
This is a copy of the
e-mail you sent Jeremy

469
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,840
inviting him to your house Friday night.

470
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,400
I did not write that.

471
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,440
I never talked to anyone
named "Mr. Nice Guy."

472
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
Agent Gibbs, I swear to you.

473
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,560
We have your computer.

474
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,160
You two were exchanging
e-mails for months.

475
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,480
Uh, Agent Gibbs,

476
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,200
we need a word with you.

477
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,153
What?

478
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Abby has something to tell you.

479
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
I was digging deeper into
Laura Rowan's clusters

480
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,040
mostly the slack space and the
log file alignment, it was off.

481
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
Not much, but enough.

482
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,000
So I imaged the sectors and I
found trace elements of corrupt...

483
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,800
English!

484
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
She's telling the truth, Gibbs.

485
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
She didn't write those e-mails.

486
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,720
Who did?

487
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,320
I don't know.

488
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,080
Sorry.

489
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,140
So she was set up?

490
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
It's more like Jeremy
Davison was set up.

491
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,020
His computer wasn't tampered with.

492
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,540
He thought he was communicating
with Mrs. Rowans the entire time.

493
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,460
And the reason for luring him on

494
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,420
to a Marine base to rape a Marine wife?

495
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,820
Well, closest thing to a death sentence

496
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,340
I can think of.

497
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,100
Abby's lab, now.

498
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,580
No dice, Gibbs.

499
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
The hacker left no back trace
on Laura Rowans' machine.

500
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,900
But we can tell when he
created the e-mail trail.

501
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,860
The files overwritten on her
computer show that it happened

502
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,620
right around the time
she shot Jeremy Davison.

503
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,100
Like I said, this guy's good.

504
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,540
The guy's a dirtbag, Abby.

505
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,140
I want him.

506
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,980
Well, unfortunately, we
can't find him from here.

507
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,460
We need access to the
Scarlet Secret Web servers.

508
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,260
And a warrant will take months.

509
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,620
They have a rep for
legally fighting any attempt

510
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,300
to breech the privacy of their members.

511
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,460
Can't we hack 'em?

512
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,780
Won't work, Tony.

513
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,020
We need core-level access with full

514
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,580
admin privileges to track this guy.

515
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,220
Which means we have to
be on the inside to do it.

516
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,780
Find another way.

517
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,340
Abby, can you pull up the home
page for the Scarlet Secret?

518
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,580
Really?

519
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,980
I thought I saw something
that we could use.

520
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,780
Okay, at the bottom here can you
click on employment opportunities.

521
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,780
Can we get a job there?

522
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,460
Abby, click "computer programming."

523
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,860
"We're looking for a computer
programmer"with experience in network

524
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,380
protocols "IDS, "firewalls, and
ultra high-speed network capabilities.

525
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,420
"Excellent communication
skills, "a professional attitude

526
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,780
and the desire to be challenged
"every day is required.

527
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,300
"Bachelor's degrees preferred.

528
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,780
Must be able to start immediately."

529
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,580
Way to go, Kate.

530
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,460
Finally, I get to do
some undercover work.

531
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,380
That's not going to work.

532
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,180
Uh, probie's got cop
written all over his face.

533
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,020
I, on the other hand...

534
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,700
He does have experience
with cyber... sex.

535
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,460
Yeah.

536
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,860
That true, DiNozzo?

537
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,260
I think what Kate meant to say was
that I met a very nice girl online once.

538
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,180
Yeah, what was her name?

539
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,580
Names aren't that important.

540
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,580
Hotjuggs24, but I think
she meant it as a metaphor.

541
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,620
Boss, Tony could never pass
as a computer programmer.

542
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,660
So McGee goes.

543
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,620
No.

544
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,900
Not McGee.

545
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,300
You make me really horny, baby.

546
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,460
Well, you're certainly qualified.

547
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,060
And from the look of things,
you'll fit right in around here.

548
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,700
So what do you think, Ms. Gibbs?

549
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,420
I'd say, when can I start, Mr. Kane?

550
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,060
You can call me Devon.

551
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,620
Right. Devon.

552
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,140
What am I wearing?

553
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,340
How do you like fishnets, baby?

554
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,220
You can start today.

555
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,900
I have a question for you, though.

556
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,620
Have you thought about
modeling yourself?

557
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,700
Oh, I prefer the computer programming
side of the business, Devon.

558
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,260
Okay, well, should you
change your mind we do offer

559
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,420
naked tech support to
a very select clientele.

560
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,300
And it pays double.

561
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,900
That's... very thoughtful,
but, um, I'll pass.

562
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,420
Okay, great.

563
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,060
Well, here's your work station.

564
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,540
And I think that's it.

565
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,020
So...

566
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
welcome to Scarlet Secret.

567
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,900
Good work, Abby.

568
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,980
Go.

569
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,380
Get Jeremy Davison's statement.

570
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,020
I want the name of anybody he's had an

571
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,420
altercation with in the past five years.

572
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,100
You got it.

573
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,380
I'm in, Gibbs.

574
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,620
Is McGee there?

575
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,340
Here, Abbs.

576
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,180
Hi, McGee.

577
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,060
Hey.

578
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,740
Okay, open port 618 on their
firewall, and I'll join you.

579
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,900
Done, and done.

580
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,260
Connected.

581
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,220
How long is this going to take?

582
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,420
There's a number of different variables.

583
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,020
Code complexity, accuracy
of the logs, the software...

584
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,900
You've got one hour.

585
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,860
Or one hour.

586
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,780
So... so if it wasn't Laura

587
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,380
I was talking to,

588
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,620
who was it?

589
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,980
Well, that's what we're trying
to find out, Mr. Davison.

590
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,620
No, I don't believe it.

591
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,620
We talked about everything.

592
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,140
It wasn't just about sex.

593
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,220
She loved me.

594
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,660
It can't be.

595
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,140
At this point, we're not
even sure if she is a she.

596
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,500
We exchanged hundreds of e-mails.

597
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,820
Why would someone do that?

598
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,660
You tell us.

599
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,260
Anyone holding a grudge
against you, Mr. Davison?

600
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,820
Anyone who might know
their way around a computer?

601
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,260
No, I don't socialize much off-line.

602
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,620
I kind of s-stutter when I'm nervous.

603
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,540
What about on-line?

604
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,340
I said no.

605
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,700
Maybe...

606
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
maybe she didn't recognize me.

607
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,020
Maybe it was just a mistake.

608
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,340
I-If I talk to her, we can...

609
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,660
She never even heard of you, Jeremy.

610
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,180
Whoever you were talking
to, it wasn't Laura Rowans.

611
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,180
So none of it was real?

612
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,660
The whole thing was just some sick joke?

613
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,460
Jeremy. Oh, God.

614
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,900
Are you okay?

615
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,580
Is this really necessary, Agent Todd?

616
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,020
Not anymore.

617
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,580
If you remember
anything, Jeremy, anything

618
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,820
that you think might
help us, please call me.

619
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
It's going to be all right now, okay?

620
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,420
It's going to be all right.

621
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,540
I got him.

622
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,540
It's custom code.

623
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,180
It matches the stuff
on Laura's computer.

624
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,100
He's got hooks all over the system.

625
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,020
I'm on it.

626
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,140
Okay, he's using a
router out of Fairfax.

627
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,380
Tracing it back now.

628
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Interesting.

629
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,940
He left his name in an encrypted file.

630
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,660

Zed-death-six.

631
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,580
The guy's arrogant.

632
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,020
He likes to sign his work.

633
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:22,860
What?

634
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,020
I talk to myself.

635
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,260
Got a problem with that?

636
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,260
Got him.

637
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,500
Name's Victor Grotinski.

638
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,020
He's in Woodbridge,
Virginia, off Davis Ford Road.

639
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,060
15 miles from Quantico.

640
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,780
That's a good job, McGee.

641
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,060
You get Abby back here.

642
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,740
Coffee's for you.

643
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,660
DiNozzo.

644
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,340
Yeah, boss.

645
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,980
Meet me at this address.

646
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,020
NCIS Federal agents!

647
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,700
We have a warrant for your arrest.

648
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,580
Hands in the air.

649
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,660
Now!

650
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,300
That's, uh...

651
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,220
That is just nasty.

652
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,660
Oh, my God.

653
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,220
You see anything interesting, Duck?

654
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,420
They say the eyes are
the window to the soul.

655
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,220
Yeah? They say anything
about when he died?

656
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,420
Perhaps.

657
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,020
Have we found them yet?

658
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:35,820
Nope.

659
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,020
They took the optic nerve.

660
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,260
Time of death...

661
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,140
...about 18 hours ago.

662
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,340
What do you think this is?

663
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,300
Tony, he was slaving
old systems together.

664
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,140
He was jerry-rigging
his own super computer.

665
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,660
I talking about this.

666
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,340
Some kind of solvent?

667
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,580
I don't think so.

668
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

669
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,460
You know what this is?

670
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,300
Hey!

671
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,020
Hi... guys.

672
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,380
No, I don't, but considering there's
no bathroom in this apartment...?

673
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,380
Uh, probie...

674
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,140
bag that.

675
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,940
And why don't you check
out those suspicious

676
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,220
looking containers while you're at it.

677
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,300
I think I'll throw up now.

678
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,220
DiNozzo...

679
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,060
find out what this operates.

680
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,660
You got it.

681
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,380
Kate, what do you
think about Oedipus here

682
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,540
Well, there's no
obvious defensive wounds.

683
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,260
He knew his attacker.

684
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,700
Or he was surprised.

685
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,540
Why take his eyes?

686
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,260
Some kind of a message?

687
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,860
Or a warning, Kate.

688
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,500
Several South American tribes were known

689
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,420
to ritualistically pluck
the eyes of their enemies...

690
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,060
...to discourage them
from being followed.

691
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,100
Of course, they were
cannibals, so they did...

692
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,300
You know, I don't think we're
dealing with cannibals here, Duck.

693
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,500
No, I should think not.

694
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,620
Well, not this far north.

695
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,300
Kate, could you come here for a second?

696
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
I need your help with something.

697
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,460
I had to wear a skirt today.

698
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,860
Did you say something?

699
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,580
Oh, you know, you
realize what would happen

700
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,580
if I dropped this knife, Tony?

701
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,140
Yep. I'm still deciding
whether it's worth it or not.

702
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,300
Now, why would somebody
hide a camcorder in a vent?

703
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,660
You're kidding, right?

704
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,940
Aw... You know, when this is
over, we really need to talk, Kate.

705
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,620
You scare me.

706
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,780
Well, he certainly isn't gonna
win any awards for cinematography.

707
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,500
And it didn't help that he was
shooting in almost no light.

708
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,220
Okay, here's where it gets interesting.

709
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,900
She's a black widow.

710
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
She killed him right after...

711
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,140
that special moment.

712
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,700
Any close-ups of her face?

713
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,740
One glimpse, but I mean it's a glimpse.

714
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,740
It's digital, so...

715
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,980
I might be able to pull
out more information.

716
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
I'll do my best to pull
out more information...?

717
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,580
I will pull out more information.

718
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,340
Hey, McGee...

719
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,780
Yeah.

720
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,420
I need to know who hired Grotinski

721
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,820
create the e-mail trail
between Rowans and Davison.

722
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,020
Well, there's about 150 gigabytes
of data on several hard drives, boss.

723
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,580
Only 150?

724
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,500
Hell!

725
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
That shouldn't take much time at all!

726
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,900
He has no idea what a
gigabyte is, does he, Abby?

727
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,700
I don't think he knows

728
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,940
what a hard drive is, McGee.

729
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,620
I mean, the policy
they have at that beach

730
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,700
isn't strictly nudist, it's
more of like, uh, it's optional.

731
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,700
Uh-huh. Yeah.

732
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,820
Ooh! Changed!

733
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,180
We're dealing with a
sociopath here, Tony.

734
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,860
Yeah, the missing eye part
would be the dead giveaway, Kate.

735
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,860
Who likes to manipulate people.

736
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,780
But the question is: why
Jeremy Davison and Laura Rowans?

737
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,140
Two lonely people pouring their
hearts out into cyberspace?

738
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,660
Instead they find a psycho lurking
on the Scarlet Secret Web site.

739
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,940
Works for me.

740
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,740
Not me.

741
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,340
We're being played.

742
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,020
By who, Gibbs?

743
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,580
Kate, Grotinski was murdered
by the woman on the tape.

744
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,300
She hired him?

745
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,260
I don't know yet.

746
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,180
We should bring Laura
Rowans back for questioning.

747
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Yeah. Gibbs.

748
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,940
On our way.

749
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,460
Let's go.

750
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,620
Ducky's got something.

751
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,300
To Abby please, Mr. Palmer.

752
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,660
Sure thing, Doctor.

753
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,420
Uh, what is it exactly?

754
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Our young man was killed during coitus.

755
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,300
That may be our black widow's DNA.

756
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,820
You know, the Romans
considered dying during

757
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,260
the act of love to be a
great honor, Mr. Grotinski.

758
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,380
Yeah? What would they
think about videotaping it?

759
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,420
From some of the murals

760
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,060
I've seen in Pompeii, I
think they'd rather enjoy it.

761
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,860
It's an Italian thing, Ducky.

762
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,860
We're passionate people;
it runs in our blood.

763
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,580
The only thing running through
your blood, Tony, is cholesterol.

764
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,500
And possibly chlamydia.

765
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,140
It's curable.

766
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,940
What do we got, Duck?

767
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,940
Well, I sent some fluids up to Abby.

768
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,580
The DNA may be our killers.

769
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,820
But what really interests me is the
manner in which his throat was cut.

770
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,100
The knife was inserted into

771
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,660
the side of the neck
and then ripped forward,

772
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,020
severing both the
arteries and the windpipe.

773
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,140
Very professional.

774
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,260
Yeah.

775
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,460
And very familiar.

776
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,460
Yeah.

777
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,860
Thanks, Duck.

778
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,380
You track down Laura Rowans.

779
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,700
Tell her we need to talk.

780
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,180
Duck...?

781
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,540
Oh, it's the technique
Marines are taught

782
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,460
to kill enemy sentries.

783
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,620
Her hubby taught her how to
do a lot more than just shoot.

784
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,980
I'm picking up some highlights
off the baseball cap.

785
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,420
No, that's not good enough.

786
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:13,900
I need a face.

787
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,500
How much longer, Abby?

788
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,180
Maybe another hour to filter.

789
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,820
What about the fluid Ducky sent up?

790
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,740
I've isolated several female cells.

791
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,100
I'm sequencing the DNA now.

792
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,140
Like... ten hours.

793
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,260
You think that's Laura Rowans, boss?

794
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,660
Well, considering I've seen better
pictures of a UFO, you tell me, McGee.

795
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,660
Check her home; if she's
there, hold her, Sergeant.

796
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,700
Yes, ma'am.

797
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,620
Talked to Laura's mother, boss.

798
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,380
She claims she hasn't
seen her since yesterday

799
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,500
and she's not answering her cell.

800
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,340
She's not answering at home, either.

801
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,540
I have Sergeant Hagerty
heading over there.

802
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,180
You try the hospital?

803
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,060
No, but if she's at the
plucking eyeball stage...?

804
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,700
She might take another shot at Jeremy.

805
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,300
We're going to Quantico.

806
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,740
Let's roll.

807
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,660
ICU. Lieutenant Kim.

808
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,540
Hi. It's Tony.

809
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,420
Tony!

810
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,820
I was hoping you'd call.

811
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,340
What's Jeremy Davison's condition?

812
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,340
Resting comfortably.

813
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:05,820
What's up?

814
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,300
All right.

815
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,100
Anyone comes to visit him, tell them

816
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,260
he's been transferred
to another hospital.

817
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,300
Is there a problem, Tony?

818
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,780
No. No problem, Pam.

819
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,420
We'll be on base in about 15 minutes.

820
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,140
Make that ten.

821
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,740
You going to tell us what's up, Gibbs?

822
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,140
My gut.

823
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,100
Agent Todd.

824
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,500
Yeah, we've got a serious
situation here, ma'am.

825
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,940
Hands in the air!

826
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,500
Now!

827
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,060
Sergeant Hagerty has Laura
Rowans in custody, Gibbs.

828
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,460
And he also found Grotinski's
eyes in her kitchen.

829
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,300
She hired him to make it look like

830
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
a third party set them both up?

831
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,380
Yeah. It's not a bad plan.

832
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,460
It almost worked.

833
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,940
Almost.

834
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,180
Mrs. Rowans didn't seem like

835
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,100
the murdering type to me.

836
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,580
The smart ones never do.

837
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,460
I thought you told Gibbs

838
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,380
the DNA would take ten hours.

839
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,140
I did.

840
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,900
This doesn't make any sense.

841
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,180
I didn't even send it.

842
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,140
Oh, my God.

843
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,820
You have ten minutes, and make
sure all your cell phones are off.

844
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,700
You'll be moved to a civilian
hospital tomorrow, Mr. Davison.

845
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,300
Finally.

846
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,140
Any idea why this woman
fixated on my brother?

847
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,660
I was hoping he could tell me.

848
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,660
Jeremy?

849
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,540
She wasn't happy, but she
wouldn't leave her husband.

850
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,700
I was going to tell...

851
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,260
him about us.

852
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,780
Well, you're lucky.

853
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,100
We have her on tape slashing
another guy's throat.

854
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,060
Y... You do?

855
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,660
The picture's damaged, but
once our lab cleans it up...

856
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,300
We should be able to
positively I.D. her.

857
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,060
She won't be bothering
you again, Mr. Davison.

858
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,420
I... I loved her.

859
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,340
Let's go.

860
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:24,740
Come on,

861
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,700
answer, answer, answer.

862
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,500
Pick up, damn it!

863
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,060
Pick up!

864
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,780
If they're at the
hospital, they probably

865
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,780
have their phones turned off, Abby.

866
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,660
We're about to let a murderer go free!

867
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,420
We have to get going, baby.

868
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
ICU! I need to speak to Special
Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs now!

869
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
It's a matter of life and death.

870
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,460
Those first two Navy cops were
dumb, but their boss wasn't.

871
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,860
Did you see the way
he was looking at me?

872
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,580
Hey...

873
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,660
that sound harsh to you, Kate?

874
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,180
Very.

875
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,460
Go for it, honey.

876
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
My first round's going through
your right eye socket, lady.

877
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,340
Yeah. Gibbs.

878
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,700
Don't you pick up your phone anymore?!

879
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,260
The DNA we ran on Jeremy
Davison two days ago

880
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,060
matches five open investigations.

881
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,460
He's a serial rapist and murderer!

882
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,260
We know.

883
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,100
And the woman that he's
with is his accomplice,

884
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,780
it's not his...

885
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,940
You know?!

886
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,380
Got it covered, Abby.

887
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,140
They know.

888
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,500
Did you know?

889
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,820
No.

890
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,620
If I find out that you
knew, I will kill you.

891
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,220
I can't believe we
almost let those two walk.

892
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,620
And Davison isn't even their real names.

893
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,940
Grotinski created those
identities for them.

894
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,220
Yeah, it's amazing what you can
do with computers these days, Kate.

895
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,940
Sure is, Tony.

896
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,540
Hey, I've got a little something
