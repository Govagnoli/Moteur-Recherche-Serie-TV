1
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,740
Most people tend to their
personal hygiene at home.

2
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,380
This bothers you?

3
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,300
No, what bothers me is that
it doesn't bother me anymore.

4
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
I'm an acquired taste.

5
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,220
Actually, it's more like
the Stockholm syndrome.

6
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,740
The emotional attachment

7
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,780
to a captor formed by
hostages are result of

8
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,940
continuous stress and a need
to cooperate for survival.

9
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,660
Nice shot.

10
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,540
Get the truck.

11
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,300
Where we going, boss?

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,060
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,220
Marine helo was found abandoned.

14
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,740
- Crew's missing.
- Any leads?

15
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,660
You tell me.

16
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,780
It's sitting in the
middle of a crop circle.

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,940
Abby's going to make us crazy.

18
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,700
Come on, let's go.

19
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,860
I don't believe it.

20
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
They never make it easy.

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,180
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague.

22
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,740
Squadron CO. HMLA 167.

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,260
Gibbs. NCIS.

24
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,500
Colonel, your people have
contaminated the scene.

25
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.

26
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,740
Wasn't going to sit on my ass and wait

27
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
for NCIS to drive out from Washington.

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,740
elimination prints from all your people.

30
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,980
Let NCIS do their job.

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,100
Stand down.

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,980
Any damage to the aircraft?

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,420
No.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,340
The engine checks out.

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,420
Hydraulic and avionics
gear are operative.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,940
Fuel load's at 60 percent.

37
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,140
When was your last
contact with the crew?

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,460
They took off from New River at 2300

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,980
on a routine night proficiency flight.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,620
Were cleared to a practice
area over Chesapeake Bay.

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,940
Flight controller lost the
transponder signal ten minutes out.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,260
Tried to make radio contact,
never got a response.

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,460
I was notified a half hour later.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,540
How'd you find it?

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,260
We were organizing to launch
a search and rescue mission

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
when I got a call
from the local sheriff.

47
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,700
The farmer that owns this field
discovered it just after sunrise.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,020
DiNozzo.

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,740
Yeah, boss?

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,860
Sketch and shoot.

51
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Kate, the cockpit.

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,420
Trace evidence, bag and tag.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,300
- McGee, the field. Lay out a grid.
- Got it.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,220
We just started the air search.

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,660
Hopefully we'll find them.

56
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,620
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft

57
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,980
is in the middle of a crop circle.

58
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,580
What about you, Agent Gibbs,
what are your thoughts?

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,780
Do I think your men were

60
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,660
abducted by aliens, Colonel? No.

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,340
I don't, but I'm not
going to ignore anything.

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,780
I need an overhead view of the field.

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,500
Already took digital photos.

64
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,300
Sergeant Ramos!

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,700
Sir.

66
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,500
Camera.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,940
Who are the missing men?

68
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,020
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,180
Co-pilot Captain Patrick Barnett.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,740
Good marines.

71
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,180
But they're young pilots.

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,260
Hot shots.

73
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,580
The two are close.

74
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,700
They share an apartment off base.

75
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,060
I need their Officer Qualification
Records and NATOPS jackets.

76
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,220
McGee!

77
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,140
Yeah, boss?

78
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,900
Shots of the crop circle.

79
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,860
E- mail them to Abby.

80
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,140
Abby?

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,100
You certain you want to do that?

82
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,780
You know, she's obsessed
with the paranormal and...

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,940
Right. I'm on it.

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,100
I do not want UFO freaks
crawling around here, Colonel.

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,740
Let's keep a lid on this.

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,740
No releases to the media.

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,500
Agreed.

88
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,940
I should've been an aviator.

89
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,300
These things are chick magnets.

90
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,100
I hate helicopters.

91
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,820
They're loud,
uncomfortable and dangerous.

92
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,980
Used to dread getting on
Marine One with the President.

93
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,380
Ew. Tony...

94
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,340
What?

95
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,980
You're getting way too
comfortable around me.

96
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,820
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing,

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,460
but that, that is crossing the line.

98
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,260
Come on.

99
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,340
No, I'm serious.

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,500
I've had enough of your
locker room mentality.

101
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,420
I would be upset if someone I was dating

102
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,460
dating took such familiarities.

103
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,100
Well, we work together.

104
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,540
So feel free to scratch or adjust

105
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,060
anything you like in front of me.

106
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,980
I'm always up before the sun.

107
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,660
It's only 30 acres,
but it's a lot of work.

108
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,540
You didn't hear anything last night?

109
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,300
Nothing.

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,500
So how long you think it's gonna be

111
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,940
before they get that thing out of here?

112
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,540
I got work to do.

113
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,580
What do you think
happened to your field?

114
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,980
You're asking me?

115
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,500
Ask the Air Force.

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,780
This isn't the first crop circle here.

117
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,140
We had one in 1994.

118
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,500
The Air Force investigated,
but we never did get no answers.

119
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,540
There were lights back then, too.

120
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,180
Lights?

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,700
Lit up the sky last night.

122
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,500
Woke me up.

123
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,420
It wasn't lightning.

124
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,460
There was no thunder.

125
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.

126
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,900
Just tried to put it out of
my mind till I discovered this.

127
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,700
We may have more questions
for you, Mr. Clay.

128
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,300
I ain't going nowhere.

129
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,060
Well, guess I should ask around.

130
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,100
See if anybody else seen something.

131
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,620
How long you been sheriff?

132
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,620
Couple years now.

133
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
Your full-time job?

134
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,620
I also run the grain and feed store.

135
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,780
Whoa.

136
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,540
McGee, you are turning me on.

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,700
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,420
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate,

139
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,860
but it's a fascinating pictogram.

140
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.

141
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,260
Southern England?

142
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,860
Where most of the crop
circles were found?

143
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,940
Abby, they're hoaxes.

144
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,420
You have to admit they are interesting.

145
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Yeah, I put them right up there

146
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,300
with tarot cards and telephone psychics.

147
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,540
Thought two farmers
admitted to creating them.

148
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,660
Yeah, but there's been over
10,000 reported all over the world.

149
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,340
There's no way those two did them all.

150
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,900
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.

151
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,820
Yeah, there was no
damage to the helicopter,

152
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,260
yet the entire crew vanished.

153
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,860
You can't take crop circles
seriously, you're a scientist.

154
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,380
There's a logical explanation.

155
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,300
Listen to me, McGee.

156
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,100
I need pictures, and lots of them.

157
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,220
And specimens of the
stalks down to the roots.

158
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,500
And a core sample of
soil, at least 12 inches.

159
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,900
Make sure you get a control sample

160
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,900
from outside the circle.

161
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,540
Abby, we're looking
for two missing marines.

162
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,460
Come on, McGee.

163
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,460
Do it for me, please?

164
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,020
I'll show you my new tat.

165
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,460
The replacement crew is ready to
fly the Cobra back to New River.

166
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,300
Go ahead,

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,220
we got everything we need.

168
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,060
Clear to go.

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,740
Do we really need all this stuff?

170
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,340
Just following instructions.

171
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,900
Ask Abby.

172
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,660
All right, McGee and I
will take the truck back.

173
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,900
You two, check out
the pilots' apartment.

174
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,380
Right.

175
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll try not to be
too familiar, Ms. Todd.

176
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,620
Hey, get the scent
articles for the search dog.

177
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,220
Okay.

178
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,260
What is it, boss?

179
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
I was worried about
keeping a lid on this thing.

180
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,580
Where are the gawkers?

181
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,980
You see any locals other than the farmer

182
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,780
who owns this field and the sheriff?

183
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,420
Special Agent Gibbs.

184
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,700
The Huey spotted a burnt-out
area just north of here.

185
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,140
You might want to come with us.

186
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,060
You think this has
something to do with my crew?

187
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,260
I don't know, but
we're going to find out.

188
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,620
We've got another scene to process.

189
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,740
So, we're looking for
anything that suggests

190
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,300
they didn't just leave
on a routine flight.

191
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,420
Thanks for explaining,
Special Agent DiNozzo.

192
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,380
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.

193
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,020
Do you know what this is?

194
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
This is a classic.

195
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,940
December '92.

196
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,660
Pamela's debut.

197
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,460
I lost my copy.

198
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,460
Lost it or wore it out?

199
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,380
We need to get scent
articles for the dogs.

200
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,940
What the hell are you
doing in my apartment?

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,220
NCIS.

202
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,980
Let her go.

203
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,700
I understand you're not
cooperating, Captain Barnett.

204
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,500
I don't know anything.

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,420
It's Saturday night.

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,580
I was at my girlfriend's.

207
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,620
Got home, just getting out of the shower

208
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,900
and I heard someone in my apartment.

209
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,660
Where's Captain Newell?

210
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,100
I don't know.

211
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,900
You were scheduled for
a proficiency flight

212
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,740
at 2300 last night.

213
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,220
Did you take it?

214
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,740
What's the flight schedule say, sir?

215
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,740
Well, it says right here Newell
and you took off from New River.

216
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,060
Then we did.

217
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Here's how it works, ace.

218
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,900
I ask the questions,
you give direct answers.

219
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,820
Did you take the flight?

220
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,260
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.

221
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,660
That would explain the three wives.

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,940
Your Cobra was found
abandoned 150 miles from where

223
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,740
it was supposed to be
and Newell is missing.

224
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,260
What is Gibbs doing?

225
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,100
TBI.

226
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,860
Excuse me?

227
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,620
Truth by intimidation.

228
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,140
In five...

229
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,740
four... three...

230
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,700
two... one.

231
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,860
We were leaving for the base
when Todd got a call on his cell.

232
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,340
He took it into the bedroom.

233
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,020
When he came out...

234
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,460
he was messed up.

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,780
He said he wasn't feeling well

236
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,020
and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy

237
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,820
Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.

238
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,940
Who made the call?

239
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,820
I don't know.

240
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,380
I don't believe you, Barnett.

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,980
You live together, you fly together,

242
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,700
you fight together,
you share everything.

243
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,860
I thought we did.

244
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,700
Look, I rode his ass to figure out

245
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,260
what was going on, but
Todd, he got really pissed.

246
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,340
Told me to lay low for
the rest of the night.

247
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,580
He didn't want me getting in trouble.

248
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
And you let it go at that?

249
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,980
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.

250
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,660
I believe him.

251
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,140
Sign it.

252
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,020
What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?

253
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,300
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.

254
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,020
I'm gonna go pull Captain
Newell's cell records.

255
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,060
Did you feel an energy when you
were inside the circle, McGee?

256
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,140
Did you get a tingling
sensation or start to vibrate?

257
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,220
You're gonna vibrate if you
don't do what Gibbs wants.

258
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,380
I'm running tests on
the molecular structure

259
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,860
of plants from within
and outside the circle.

260
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,140
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear
the priority is the cabin fire.

261
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,180
You know, people try to
imitate the real thing,

262
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,900
but the notion that
all recorded formations

263
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,420
were man-made with
simple flattening tools

264
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,420
does not explain the well-documented

265
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,620
plant alterations by
electromagnetic effect.

266
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,420
I warned you.

267
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,900
Operation Duty Officer at New River

268
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,780
said that Captain Newell signed the log.

269
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,100
When I pressed, he admitted that
he never really saw Captain Barnett.

270
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,100
He just assumed he was on
the flight line, preflighting.

271
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,740
So Newell took off alone.

272
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,140
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?

273
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,260
Oh, yes.

274
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,620
Yeah, I'm still here.

275
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,460
Anything unusual in Newell's
OQR or his NATOPS jacket?

276
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,340
He's an only child.

277
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,780
Grew up in Florida,
just outside Orlando.

278
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,540
Any connection to West Virginia?

279
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,980
No. His parents died in an
auto accident two years ago.

280
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,020
His father sold insurance, and mother
was an accountant at Disney World.

281
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,420
Yeah, Gibbs.

282
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,500
You can see Barnett
anytime you'd like, Colonel.

283
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,020
Teague?

284
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,460
Good C.O.

285
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,180
Newell went through NROTC at the
University of Florida before flight school.

286
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,340
His impulsiveness has
gotten him in some trouble.

287
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,660
A fight cost him a
non-punitive letter of caution.

288
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,780
That's great.

289
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,660
Last call Captain Newell got on
his cell was at 2130 last night.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,580
Hasn't made or received a call since.

291
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,220
His phone is currently off.

292
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Where was the call from?

293
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
A pay phone in Smoky
Corners, West Virginia.

294
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,180
According to the phone company,
this thing hardly ever gets used.

295
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,860
Well, I guess even people
out here have cell phones.

296
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,060
We're being watched.

297
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,500
Mm-hmm. I see.

298
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,700
Sheriff Thompson.

299
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,380
You better get over here.

300
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,860
Find anything?

301
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,740
It's clean.

302
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,140
Too clean.

303
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,220
Not even a smudge.

304
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,620
Yeah, looks like the only thing out
here that has been cleaned recently.

305
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,180
Let me have a whack at it.

306
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,340
What's he doing?

307
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,540
Okay. Get those to Abby for prints.

308
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,780
What are you doing to the phone?

309
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,100
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

310
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,900
Who are you?

311
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,020
Ritt Everett.

312
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,780
This is my store.

313
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,340
Seen anyone using the
phone Tuesday night?

314
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,220
Well, let's see.

315
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,220
Nope.

316
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,220
This have anything to do about
that helicopter in the crop circle?

317
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,660
Hello, Sheriff.

318
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,460
Special Agent Gibbs.

319
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,220
Any luck?

320
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,380
Well, sir, luck doesn't
have much to do with it.

321
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,660
I've been asking around.

322
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,580
Lot of folks seen them lights and are

323
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,420
complaining their animals
are acting out of sorts.

324
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,940
How?

325
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,500
Chickens stopped laying eggs.

326
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,660
Cows ain't producing,
and stuff like that.

327
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,340
Either of you two seen him around?

328
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,420
No.

329
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,780
Name's Newell.

330
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,860
Captain Todd Newell.

331
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,740
Sorry, ain't seen him.

332
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,380
Newell? Ain't nobody by
that name in the Corners.

333
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,420
I'll keep an eye out for him.

334
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,540
Was he the one flying that helicopter?

335
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,220
Yeah, Gibbs.

336
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,340
Gibbs, I am getting stonewalled here.

337
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:42,940
By who?

338
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,980
The Air Force.

339
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,940
I requested their file on the
1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners,

340
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,260
you'd thought I'd asked them
for their missile-launch codes.

341
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,780
Okay, I'll make a call.

342
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
No, you don't understand.

343
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,940
They're not going to
tell you anything either.

344
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,900
This is like Area 51; it is
conspiracy at the highest level.

345
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,380
Abby, stop yourself.

346
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,820
What about the cabin fire?

347
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,220
Gibbs, this is big!

348
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,060
The fire.

349
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,860
Unfortunately, nothing
extraterrestrial there;

350
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,060
arson, plain old gasoline
was used as an accelerant.

351
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,660
I'm still working on the debris.

352
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,380
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.

353
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,940
Hi.

354
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,420
You all right?

355
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah, fine.

356
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,020
Ever see him around here?

357
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,980
Your gal going to be okay?

358
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
Don't you worry about her.

359
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,500
As long as both sides stick to
the story, we'll get through this.

360
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,500
I can't talk right now.

361
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,620
But if you come back at noon, my daddy
will be at the VFW in Potterville.

362
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:52,860
Okay.

363
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,260
Who's that?

364
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,300
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.

365
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,780
I think she wanted
to talk, but couldn't.

366
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,300
Her father's having
lunch with his buddies

367
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,940
at the VFW in Potterville around noon.

368
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,140
She'll be alone.

369
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,500
The dogs are a no-go.

370
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,860
The handlers say something
screwed up the dogs.

371
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,900
As soon as they stepped into the woods,

372
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,740
they started acting up.

373
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,620
Do not tell Abby.

374
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,900
She's going to make something out of it.

375
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,340
We should start checking the back
of their necks for little red Xs.

376
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,540
What are you talking about?

377
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,460
Invaders From Mars.

378
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,060
Wait. I take it that's a film?

379
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,460
Original 1953 version, not the remake.

380
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,420
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.

381
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,820
Aliens landed in a
field just like this one.

382
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Took over the locals' minds, leaving

383
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,460
a little red "X" on
the back of the necks.

384
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,620
Sounds lame.

385
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,180
Oh, no.

386
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
Scariest movie I ever saw.

387
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,100
Especially when this kid tries to
tell his mom and dad what's going on,

388
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,580
the camera slowly comes around, reveals
Xs on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.

389
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,500
Whew. Scared of my parents
for years after that.

390
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,060
I'm sure the feeling was mutual.

391
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,980
Find anything?

392
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,700
Uh, yeah, interviewed
half a dozen locals.

393
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.

394
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,460
Everyone has the same story.

395
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,420
B.O.L.s.

396
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,260
"Balls of light."

397
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,140
According to Abby, they're created by

398
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,700
Manipulating the atomic
particles in the atmosphere.

399
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,020
Mm. And who does the
manipulating, McGee?

400
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,060
I really don't know, sir.

401
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,580
I'm just relating what Abby told me.

402
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,940
I need you to run a tox
screen on this tissue sample.

403
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,260
Where'd you get it?

404
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,940
A body exhumed from Arlington.

405
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
You look overwhelmed.

406
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,660
I am.

407
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,580
And this just came in from the field.

408
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,460
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.

409
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,940
It appears to be to be $1.65.

410
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,660
This poor soul's been dead for 36 years.

411
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
I doubt if a few more days will matter.

412
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,900
Thank you, Ducky.

413
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,180
Door handle?

414
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,020
Yeah, it came from a cabin fire.

415
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,780
I found traces of something in it.

416
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,180
I can use a second opinion.

417
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm flattered.

418
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,620
Mammalian cells.

419
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,020
Most likely human flesh.

420
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,380
Someone was trapped I that fire.

421
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,180
A missing Marine aviator?

422
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,620
I need to call Gibbs.

423
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,220
Could be his missing aviator is dead.

424
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,060
If he died, where are his remains?

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,080
We know the fire was arson.

426
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,960
It started around the same time
Newell and his helo disappeared.

427
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
Abby was pretty certain
somebody was in the cabin.

428
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,760
But we didn't find any remains.

429
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,920
Maybe they got out.

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Or someone removed the body.

431
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,560
Until we find remains, I'm
not going to connect the dots.

432
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,800
Time to get the cadaver
dogs up to aid the search.

433
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,600
Cadaver dogs coming up.

434
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,160
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?

435
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
Nope. No.

436
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,600
My land stops right over
there at the treeline there.

437
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,320
Who's it belong to?

438
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,360
Well, nobody, really.

439
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,520
Went to the county after Monroe died.

440
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Who was Monroe?

441
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,600
A farmer from the east side.

442
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,680
Tried working this parcel.

443
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,960
Didn't have no chance, though.

444
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
Too hard to clear.

445
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,880
How'd Monroe die?

446
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,800
Hunting. Accident.

447
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,840
Shack's been abandoned ever since.

448
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,360
I ain't sorry it burned, though.

449
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Kids was always using the
place, causing trouble.

450
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
Something wrong?

451
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,520
Bet his rk's worse than his bite, huh?

452
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,760
Uh, the bite's actually much worse.

453
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,840
Daphne?

454
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,960
Whatcha lookin' fer?

455
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,440
I need gas.

456
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,280
This way, Missy.

457
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
That'll be $6.00.

458
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,840
That's ten.

459
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
That's two, that's three, four dollars.

460
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
Sure that's all you want?

461
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,360
So, uh...

462
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,840
what can State Police do for NCIS?

463
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,240
Well, we're investigating a
helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.

464
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,120
Yeah, I heard.

465
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,240
You, uh...?

466
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,160
Sure.

467
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,040
Have a seat.

468
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,600
Met the sheriff.

469
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,240
Oh, Miller Thompson?

470
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah, he wasn't much help.

471
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,040
Well, he doesn't know about enem

472
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
But he sure loves wearing that uniform.

473
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,520
You get to Smoky Corners much?

474
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Well, not ss they call.

475
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,040
And they don't.

476
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Hmm. No crime?

477
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,600
Nothing we get involin.

478
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,080
There's a fights.

479
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,920
Got some kind of feud going on up there.

480
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,760
Goes back decades.

481
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,120
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?

482
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,320
Yeah, something like that.

483
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,040
I honestly donhiny remembers itrted,
but it split the valley right down

484
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,200
the middle, east versus west, and I was
told by my predecessor to stay clear.

485
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,040
Tris, they take careof
their own problems.

486
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,720
Have they ever had a
murder in Smoky Corners?

487
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,560
I mean, people just di
natural causes or, you know,

488
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
the occasional farm or hunting accident.

489
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
Things may have changed.

490
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
What's McGee doing out there?

491
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,640
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.

492
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,720
Let me guess Abby?

493
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,280
Her every wish is his command.

494
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,240
She promiso shim her new tattoo.

495
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
Wail finds or it ankle.

496
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,560
What did gas station girl tell you?

497
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,480
She was a no-show.

498
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
looks like magnet.

499
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
You are such a child.

500
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,720
Come on.

501
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Just taking a sip.

502
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
It's yours.

503
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,560
Hey, boss.

504
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
Abby needs to talk to you.

505
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,080
Abs, you get any sleep?

506
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
I am overworked and not paid enough.

507
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,880
Quit.

508
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,840
What do you got?

509
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,160
Two partial prints on the
coins from the phone booth.

510
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,120
Any match?

511
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
You need to send a thank
you to the West Virginia DMV.

512
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,720
The got right index prints
from two licensed drivers.

513
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,840
One was the trucker
that delivered gasoline

514
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,160
to the station, the second
was a local, Greg Sikes.

515
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:04,760
On it.

516
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,160
You get any DNA off the doorknob?

517
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,640
"Nice work on those prints, Abs."

518
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,520
Thank you.

519
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,440
"I know you haven't had
a break in two days."

520
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,400
Oh, that's okay.

521
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,400
I don't need much sleep.

522
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,200
Anything for the team.

523
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,800
I assume you'll let me
know if you find something.

524
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,040
Don't I always?

525
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,160
Yeah, Abby, you do.

526
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,280
Thank you.

527
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,720
Agent Gibbs.

528
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
The cadaver dogs have found something.

529
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Get Ducky.

530
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,040
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.

531
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,760
Something to be said
for living in a trailer.

532
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,120
Get tired of the view, you
just roll it to a new location.

533
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,520
Come on, McGee.

534
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,760
What, are you never
going to talk to me again?

535
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,600
How long am I going to be
the butt of your practical

536
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,880
jokes, snide innuendos
and juvenile put-downs?

537
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,200
I will always outrank you, probie.

538
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,880
Come on.

539
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.

540
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,960
Whoa.

541
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Come on in.

542
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Someone left in a hurry.

543
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,760
Huh, no phone.

544
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,760
Ah, nice...

545
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,040
teeth.

546
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,000
Duck, what can you tell me?

547
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,200
Uh, not much.

548
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,600
Male, roughly six feet.

549
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,400
Tests I did on femur,
clavicle, suggest not that old.

550
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,320
Give me a range.

551
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
Mid 20's to 30's.

552
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,640
Oh, this distinctive
fracture on the inferior

553
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,240
left scapula is consistent
with a bullet wound.

554
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,480
Cause of death?

555
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
Well, maybe.

556
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,040
Or it could be trauma or asphyxiation.

557
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.

558
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,920
There's not much to work with, Jethro.

559
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,160
Gibbs!

560
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,920
Yeah?

561
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,480
I used nonisotopic
chemiluminescent method

562
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,960
to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.

563
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,920
Uh-huh, and?

564
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
And it's not his DNA.

565
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,600
But it's damn close.

566
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,520
Oh, come on, Abs.

567
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,480
We're not playing horseshoes.

568
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,240
There's a 99% probability that the
fire victim is Newell's male sibling.

569
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,160
That can't be.

570
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,440
Newell's record of emergency
data doesn't list a brother.

571
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,360
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.

572
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,000
People do.

573
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,160
The crispy critter was
Captain Newell's brother.

574
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,560
His OQR was wrong?

575
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,600
Recruits lie about things all
the timeespecially their age.

576
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,360
Why lie about having a brother?

577
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,440
Is Abby sure?

578
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,800
Yeah, she double checked.

579
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
Obviously you two didn't.

580
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,760
We assumed his family history was right.

581
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,320
NCIS agents don't assume
anything, Agent Todd.

582
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,360
They check and re-check.

583
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,160
Verify, everything, independently.

584
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,240
We are on it.

585
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
There's a definite difference.

586
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,200
I don't see it.

587
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,680
Look at the elongated node.

588
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,560
It's undamaged.

589
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,640
The plants inside the crop circle were

590
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,560
changed in a way that
is beyond human ability.

591
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find

592
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,240
anomalous molecular change to
the stalks within the circle.

593
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm betting they were
subjected to a very short

594
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,960
blast of high energy heat,
possibly microwave generated.

595
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,720
Rerunning because you came up empty.

596
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
Abby, you're looking for
something that isn't there.

597
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,760
You've been here for two days straight.

598
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,440
You're tired, you've
done everything that

599
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,240
Gibbs has asked, so go
home, get some sleep.

600
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:53,800
I can't sleep.

601
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,120
What are you doing?

602
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,880
You're guilty of confirmation bias.

603
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,640
It's not there, Abs.

604
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
You're ignoring the obvious
and you're searching for

605
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
microscopic proof of
something that doesn't exist.

606
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,960
Maybe I should join the CIA.

607
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,520
Look at the big picture.

608
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,480
The design of the smaller

609
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,800
outer circles was created
by bending the corn

610
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,760
stalks down in a clockwise direction.

611
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,280
Now look under the helicopter.

612
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Those pants were forced outward from the
center by the downdraft of the blades.

613
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,840
The corn was still standing

614
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
and was forced down by
the landing of the Cobra.

615
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,200
Crop circle's a hoax, Abby.

616
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,600
Created, created around
a parked helicopter.

617
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,200
Why would anyone do that?

618
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,880
Orange County clerk faxed us
his parents marriage certificate.

619
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,320
Todd Newell was nine years
old when his mother remarried.

620
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,960
he was legally adopted, that's
how he got the Newell name.

621
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,560
His mother's maiden name was Stelling,
which is common in Smoky Corners.

622
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,640
First husband's a guy named Sikes.

623
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,600
They had two boys Greg and Todd.

624
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,520
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.

625
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,880
His co-pilot, Captain
Barnett, swears that he never

626
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
Mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.

627
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,440
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell

628
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
ever mentioning anything
about his childhood.

629
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,560
We need to find his biological father.

630
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,880
Can't, he died several years ago...

631
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,880
in a hunting accident.

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,840
Aw, gee, where have I
heard that one before?

633
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
So we got a dead civilian
in Ducky's cooler.

634
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,000
We going to turn it over
to the local authorities?

635
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,760
Nope, not yet.

636
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,880
I want to know more, first.

637
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,320
Greg Sikes was involved with
the girl at the gas station.

638
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,800
She seemed willing to talk.

639
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,560
Maybe I should go back
there and try to find her.

640
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Go with her.

641
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,840
All right, so we're on
the same page, right?

642
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,280
I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.

643
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,080
Tell me what?

644
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,120
The crop circle was a hoax, created
around the helicopter after it landed.

645
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,200
You don't sound convincing, Abs.

646
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,400
Yeah, well, there's still a lot
of stuff that can't be explained.

647
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Like what?

648
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,280
Balls of light in the sky, the animals
acting weird, like, a missing pilot.

649
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,960
Everyone's story is exactly the same.

650
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
It's too rehearsed.

651
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,400
It's what they want us to hear.

652
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
That's exactly what I told her.

653
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,080
But what about the search dogs?

654
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,960
I heard they were acting
all confused and disoriented.

655
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,880
Only the first day.

656
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,560
The cadaver dogs had no problem
finding the body this morning.

657
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,280
I know why we haven't been
able to find Captain Newell.

658
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,760
Thanks, guys.

659
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
How do you know?

660
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Because I'm a Marine.

661
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,920
Newell is alive?

662
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,720
Yeah.

663
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,520
Well, who's body did we find?

664
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,320
His brother.

665
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
Captain Newell's still out there.

666
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
How do you know that?

667
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,040
He received SERE training, Colonel.

668
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,040
He's evading us.

669
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,800
As part of his training he was taught
a technique to negate enemy dogs.

670
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant
used in gas mask simulations.

671
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
I keep a couple of capsules
in my survival vest.

672
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,080
Dogs get a whiff of that,
they're useless for days.

673
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,600
He used it on the search dogs.

674
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,400
Now he also has pilot's
night-vision goggles

675
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,040
and a survival radio to
monitor our search frequencies.

676
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,040
Colonel, he's using his Marine
Corps training to evade us.

677
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,000
Will you stop that?

678
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,880
You're driving me crazy.

679
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,120
Sorry.

680
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
Do I detect a little PMS?

681
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
I didn't think that was till next week.

682
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,000
Hey, it's a high-stress job.

683
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,960
You carry a gun.

684
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,640
I need to know when
you're not your best.

685
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,120
Sike's trailer is coming up.

686
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,840
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.

687
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
If she's not there, I don't
know where else to look.

688
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,920
That's Daphne's truck.

689
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

690
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

691
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

692
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Hey! Hey!

693
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
Daphne, why are you running?

694
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
I thought you wanted
to talk to us, Daphne.

695
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Daphne, talk to us.

696
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,960
What happened?

697
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,920
What happened?

698
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Are you looking for Greg?

699
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,280
We know he's your boyfriend, that's
why we're here looking for you, okay?

700
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,960
Where is he?

701
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Daphne, are you pregnant?

702
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,280
Five months.

703
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,480
Greg's hiding from my daddy.

704
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,560
You know where he is?

705
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,000
Greg's dead, isn't he?

706
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
Whatever Newell's brother said to
him on the phone got him upset enough

707
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,360
to risk his entire careerwith an
unauthorized flight in a Cobra.

708
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,800
Boss, you sure you don't
want me to drive for a while?

709
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,040
But why land in the farmer's field?

710
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,560
Um, well...

711
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,600
My guess, McGee...

712
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,880
it was the closest clearing to the cabin

713
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,320
where is brother was hiding,
only Newell was too late.

714
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,360
Wh-What?

715
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,160
Focus on the case, McGee.

716
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,840
Sorry, uh, yes, Sir.

717
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,680
Why the crop circle?

718
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,600
Well, uh, I have a theory on that.

719
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,080
You care to share?

720
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,520
Yeah, uh, okay.

721
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
Spit it out, McGee.

722
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay, uh...

723
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,280
Whoever killed Greg Sikes
thought that they could

724
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,240
cover it up as another
farm or hunting accident.

725
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,520
But they couldn't cover up an attack
helicopter abandoned in a corn field.

726
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,680
Conspiracy, huh?

727
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,280
Makes sense.

728
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
Take a lot of people to form
that pattern in a few hours.

729
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,400
Right, and they knew that there would
be an outside investigation, so they

730
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,960
created the circle hoping that we'd
do exactly what the Air Force did

731
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,920
ten years ago back off and cover
up what couldn't be explained.

732
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Not bad, McGee.

733
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,840
Not bad.

734
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,000
Where is she?

735
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
Inside, she seemed to
relate better to Kate.

736
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
joy the ride, McGee?

737
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,480
Daphne's father threatened
to kill Greg because...

738
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,200
She's pregnant.

739
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,400
Greg and me from different
corners of the valley.

740
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,560
God, I hate this rotten place.

741
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,600
This stupid feud.

742
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,080
When'd you last see him?

743
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
At the gas station.

744
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,920
Using the payphone to
call his brother for help.

745
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,320
Was Greg close to his brother?

746
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,680
He hadn't seen him since they was kids.

747
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,800
About a year ago he got a call
telling him their mother died.

748
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,600
It reunited them.

749
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,600
They're the only family
either of them have left.

750
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,920
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's
been drawn back into the feud.

751
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.

752
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,640
Kate, you and McGee
get Daphne out of here.

753
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,560
What's up, boss?

754
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,880
Go for Teague.

755
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,560
Colonel, call off the search.

756
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,200
Pull your men out.

757
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
Why? You said Newell's still out there.

758
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,800
He is. He wants revenge.

759
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,840
But he's not going to make his
move until he thinks we're gone.

760
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,440
They're leaving.

761
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
Ritt, we pulled it off.

762
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,680
The Marines have backed off.

763
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,920
This thing's going away.

764
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,800
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.

765
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,160
My problem...

766
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,600
is Greg Sikes' brother.

767
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
See, I got to get him, 'for he gets me.

768
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
This is White Hawk 3-4.

769
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,520
Terminating search.

770
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,480
Returning to base.

771
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,480
3-4 out.

772
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,320
Ritt, think twice about
what you're fixing to do.

773
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,840
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.

774
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,280
Just stick to the story.

775
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,120
What's going on?

776
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
Looks like y'all are pulling out.

777
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,520
The Marines are, we aren't.

778
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,520
Do you get a kick out of
smacking your daughter around?

779
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,960
Why don't you just get out of here?

780
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
DiNozzo, read him his rights.

781
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,400
What are you talking about?

782
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,640
The murder of Greg Sikes.

783
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,520
Greg Sikes is dead?

784
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,160
I thought he went hunting.

785
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,400
We found his remains.

786
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
You have the right to remain silent.

787
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,320
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

788
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?

789
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,920
You're the law here, Miller.

790
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,240
Yeah, I am.

791
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,600
Don't get excited, Sheriff.

792
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,840
The West Virginia State Police
are on their way, but I do have

793
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,040
the authority to detain both
of you until they arrive.

794
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,760
We, too, have guns.

795
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,840
White man has more
guns and more warriors.

796
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,000
We need one of your people to
guide us through the mountains.

797
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,640
Gibbs, I have a bogey.

798
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
In the trees, closing
in from the northwest.

799
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,440
Everybody copy.

800
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,040
Yeah, boss.

801
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,640
Got it.

802
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
He slipped behind the old cars.

803
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,560
Let him get closer.

804
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,520
Roger that.

805
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,920
Oh, man.

806
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,160
He made me.

807
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,880
Hit the lights!

808
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,120
NCIS! Lower your weapon,

809
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,880
Captain Newell!

810
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,400
It's over.

811
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,160
It's not over till Ritt Everett's dead.

812
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,400
He's in the custody of the State Police.

813
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,960
That's not going to change anything.

814
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
It's an eye-for-an-eye
here, always has been.

815
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Is that why your mother took you away?

816
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,280
Put down your weapon.

817
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,560
Why? I'm never going to fly again.

818
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,920
No, your career's probably over,
but you haven't hurt anybody yet.

819
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,240
Keep it that way, and I'll do
everything I can to help you.

820
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,040
There is a young girl
carrying your brother's baby

821
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,120
and they could sure use your help.

822
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,120
Once we left, it was like
Smoky Corners never existed.

823
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,800
My mother erased it from our lives.

824
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,800
I always felt guilty she
had to leave Greg behind,

825
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,760
but our father wouldn't
let her have both of us.

826
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,440
Why'd you take the Cobra?

827
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,040
It's fierce, intimidating.

828
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,480
I hoped it would scare the crap out
of those hicks, save Greg's life.

829
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,240
And I was too late.

830
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,520
The cabin was in flames,
Greg trapped inside.

831
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,160
Everett and the others started
shooting at me and I got hit.

832
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
And they had hunting
rifles, I only had my pistol.

833
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,200
I was cut off from the helo,
couldn't get back to the base.

834
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,560
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.

835
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,040
All that was left for me was revenge.

836
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,160
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.

837
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,880
Where are they from?

838
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,200
Tony.

839
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,240
We had a tough couple of days.

840
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,960
Kate pointed out that I'd
taken one too many liberties.

841
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,440
The flowers are a mea culpa.

842
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Tony, I'm blown away.

843
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,480
They're gorgeous.

844
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,960
And they're from Martha's
Garden, my favorite florist.

845
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,600
How'd you know?

846
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,480
Lucky guess.

847
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,600
He went through your purse and
got the phone number off your PDA.
