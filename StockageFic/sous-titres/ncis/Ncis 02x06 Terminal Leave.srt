1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,680
Micki.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
Hey, Sara.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,640
How are you?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,760
Look at you.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,640
I missed you at the Parents' Potluck.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,840
Oh, Becca had a dance recital.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,920
Oh, your turn for snack?

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,640
My turn for snack.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,840
Can you believe this?

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,240
If he would concentrate a little less on snacking, a
little more on the game, we wouldn't be O and four, but...

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
Oh, your cart. Isn't that your SUV?

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,080
Oh. Well what's another ding?

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,480
See you at practice.

14
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,480
Where the hell are you going?

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,920
Gibbs.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
Oh, you must be Gibbs.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Fornells mentioned you.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:46,960
Did he?

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
Agent Lina Reyes, FBI.

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
Your driver has a lead foot.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Well, we tend to hurry
when we suspect terrorism.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Well, so do we when the target's
a naval aviator, Agent Reyes.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
Lieutenant Commander Micki Shields.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,640
She bombed civilians in Afghanistan.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Accidentally. Article 32 hearing
cleared her of all charges.

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Yeah. By us.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Not the psychos overseas issuing jihadist
threats against her and her family.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Have you spoken to your director?

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
I did.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,760
Good. Then we're clear.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,960
FBI handles the investigation,
NCIS protects the intended target.

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,080
We want copies of everything you find.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,960
Kate, check with Commander Shields.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
Track down the rest of her family.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,125
On it.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
DiNozzo, secure her home.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,200
I want a full surveillance perimeter.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,720
McGee, coordinate all feeds with MTAC.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
All right, boss.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
Oh, sounds like we're goin to need
the infrared scope on this one, McGee.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,925
That one that can see
through walls at night.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Better than pay-TV, and,
the best part, it's free.

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,160
And that's the reason why, Tony.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
Why what, Kate?

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
You'll never get my home address.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm okay, Jen, I promise you.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,040
Look. See?

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,320
I got worse scrapes in
ejection-seat training.

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Honestly, honey, I'm fine.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
I got to go.

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll see you soon.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm going to make you cha-cha
chicken for dinner, okay? Okay.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,320
NCIS. So I take it
this wasn't an accident?

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
We're not jumping to any conclusions,
but considering all the recent threats...

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
I thought I left that war behind me.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
My kids could have been in that car.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
One mistake.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,640
One horrible mistake.

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,320
I read the report.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,840
What happened in Afghanistan
wasn't your fault.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah, right or wrong, it's still
something I have to live with.

62
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,600
And fog of war just doesn't cut it when
you're looking at ten dead civilians.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Micki!

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
Aw, honey.

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,680
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,360
Yeah. I'm fine, sweetheart.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank God.

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,280
You'd never think you'd be happy you
ran into Sara Turcott in a parking lot!

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
So... So, what, do we know who did this?

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Not yet, Mr. Shields.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay, so what, they can try it again?

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
Well, if they do, we'll stop them.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,440
NCIS will be providing
protection for your family.

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,320
Too bad you weren't
around to save Libby.

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,200
Are you kidding?

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,800
Libby?

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Who's Libby?

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
Oh, our dog, Agent Todd.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,840
A nasty little thing,
but the kids loved her.

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll need copies of the surveillance
tapes from the security camera.

81
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,320
You'll get them.

82
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,640
Today.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
I'll see what I can do.

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,720
You know what "terminal
leave" is, Agent Reyes?

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,680
No.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
That's what Commander Shields is on.

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,560
In four days she'll be a civilian, which
means I won't be around to protect her.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
That's how long you
have to solve this case.

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Yore giving me a deadline?

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Don't screw up.

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,640
I see something.

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
You see speckling, Gibbs.

93
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,360
No. I see a guy planting
a bomb under her SUV.

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,280
Do you know how many times
this has been taped over?

95
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,400
The VCR heads have scraped
it down to the plastic.

96
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
And let's not forget taken through a lens
that's caked with years of bird droppings.

97
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
I think you can make a positive ID.

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
I'll try Starwitness.

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,560
What's that?

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,960
It's an enhancement program.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Do a little homomorphic filtering... deinterlacing...
algorithmic enhancement... unsharp masking.

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah. We're getting somewhere now.

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
I am. Straight into a brick wall.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Whoever it is, he's
blocked by the vehicle.

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
No. The reflection.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,680
What reflection?

107
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
Abbs, look at the finish
on the car next to it.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
You're serious.

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
Abbs, look at the door panel.

110
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,960
Dark and shiny.

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
You can see a reflection.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,920
A reflection of whoever
planted the bomb.

113
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,960
Gibbs... you're hired!

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,200
When you walked into a room, I
bet you must have turned heads.

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,640
Just back from the salon,
with your hair all done up.

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,360
Doctor, I'm looking at a
blood type they sent over.

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,920
It doesn't match Lieutenant
Commander Shields.

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
Is that so?

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah. They said the only one
injured in the explosion was Shields.

120
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
They did indeed.

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,240
There's someone unaccounted for.

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Mr. Palmer, what I'm about to show you
may force you to reevaluate your theory.

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,640
French-fried poodle.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,600
The family pet.

125
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,800
Who was, tragically, inside the car.

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,440
I can just see those FBI forensic weasels
sitting around, laughing, picturing what

127
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm going to look like performing a
forensic autopsy on this poor creature.

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,120
What are you going to do?

129
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,520
Oh, let them laugh.

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,880
Alexander the Great had a dog...
a mastiff named... Peritas.

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
Yeah. Nobody laughed about her.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,080
When she died, he led
the funeral procession.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Built monuments to her.

134
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,680
Ordered yearly
celebrations in her memory.

135
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,440
Yeah. When I was a kid, I used to bury our
pets under our porch till my mom found out.

136
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
She was pretty upset.

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,200
They didn't want you to bury your pets?

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,440
No. We lived on the tenth
floor of an apartment building.

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
Right.

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,880
What is it, Doctor?

141
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you see that?

142
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm going to take a look.

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Just open this up...
Get that up to Abby.

144
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,800
Get that up to Abby

145
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh, you poor thing.

146
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,520
This would never have
happened to Peritas.

147
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,560
I would like for everyone to go about
their normal lives as much as possible.

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
McGee?

149
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,240
McGee, systems check.

150
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Hey!

151
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Okay, camera one is up.

152
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
Camera two and three, give me
infrared, full spectrum sweep.

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,400
(Number two. Camera three.)

154
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,720
Okay, punch up camera four.

155
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
We're up and operational, Tony.

156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Boss.

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,920
We will try to keep a low profile,
but we need your cooperation.

158
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,640
You see anything
suspicious, you tell us.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't believe this.

160
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,960
Can I sleep at Amy's house?

161
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,440
Not a good idea.

162
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,160
We'll need advance notice to clear it.

163
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
So it's be kind of stressfull.

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
It an expression. Bed.

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,480
Hey, listen. You..

166
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,775
You and me, we're
kinda gonna be hanging.

167
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:56,077
You are kidding?

168
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,680
It's gonna be great.

169
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,920
It's already sucks.

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,160
Hey, eah.

171
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,905
I remember how I felt
when my dog died, Willy.

172
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,654
Bite me.

173
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,560
Well, I guess we'll turn in, too.

174
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,720
It's been kind of stressful.

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,480
Good night.

176
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,600
Good night.

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll take the front door.

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Then I demand to take the rear.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,720
Tony...

180
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,240
Yes, Kate, dear?

181
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
There's only one bathroom downstairs.

182
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,480
And your point is?

183
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,200
The seat stays down.

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,920
Unless it's up.

185
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah. Gibbs.

186
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,960
The item Ducky retrieve from the dog
I put it through X-ray chromatography.

187
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,160
There's traces of C-4.

188
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,040
It was a bomb.

189
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
Yeah. Also the presence of mercury
used as a vibration trigger.

190
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
It's the exact same chemical signature as the bomb
that killed that naval attache in Morocco last month.

191
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:59,280
- You're dealing with...
- Al Qae assassination team.

192
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,660
Tony!

193
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,620
Out of here. Now!

194
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,420
What? I'm just brushing my teeth.

195
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,700
Oh, hey, don't use up the hot water,
'cause you've been in there forever.

196
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,260
Tony, how long have you been in here?

197
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,580
Long enough to know you can't sing...
and haven't shaved your legs in a week.

198
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,980
Outrageous.

199
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,380
The bomb was C-Four.

200
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,820
Mercury detonator.

201
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Shaped charge.

202
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,860
We ran the identifying taggants
on it, and it turns out that it...

203
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,380
Stolen from a military base in Kuwait.

204
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
And how do you know that?

205
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,420
Our French poodle told me.

206
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,180
It's linked to Al Qaeda units overseas.

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,100
We've identified three individuals in the
country who may have links to their cells.

208
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,740
Do you know how to use this?

209
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,300
Sure.

210
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,820
You have no idea what that is, do you?

211
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,380
Not really.

212
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,580
Didn't figure you for
a tech type, Gibbs.

213
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,700
Khalid Hasan.

214
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,100
Suspected in planning three
bombings in North Africa.

215
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,540
He was spotted by a Virginia traffic
control camera in D.C. last week.

216
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,460
Roland Al...

217
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
Roland Alan Moore.

218
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,420
Former Petty Officer.

219
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,500
Medically discharged when he lost two
fingers in an engine room accident.

220
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,020
Put in jail for bombing
a recruiting office.

221
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,460
Converted to Islam in prison.

222
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,980
And escaped a work
detail three months ago.

223
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,060
Well, our computer geeks suspect that he is one of the people
posting threats to Commander Shields on the Islamic Web sites.

224
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,060
Fernando Patroya.

225
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,980
He owns five ice cream parlors
in Montgomery and Charles County.

226
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,220
We believe they are money-laundering fronts
for Al Qaeda linked to the Philippines.

227
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,020
What's his connection with
Lieutenant Commander Shields?

228
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,220
Well, he was sighted in the vicinity of the bombing
ten days ago and may could just be a coincidence.

229
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,380
Okay, bring him in for questioning.

230
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,340
I can't do that.

231
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,940
If I do, it will tip him
off that we're on to him,

232
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,260
and we are hoping that he will lead us
to some of his contacts in the States.

233
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,740
While you are hoping,

234
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,580
I have a Navy family living in fear
they'll be executed on the way to the Mall.

235
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,900
If we bring him in, all we're gonna get
is his name and some B.S. cover story.

236
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,620
Not if you put him in a room with me.

237
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,740
It's not gonna happen.

238
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Sorry.

239
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,220
Hey, don't forget your,
uh, your thingamagig stick..

240
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,180
Hold on. It needs to be
dis... connected first.

241
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,260
You did that on purpose.

242
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,700
I don't believe this.

243
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,540
I bought tickets.

244
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,100
It's Green Day!

245
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,500
You're acting like it's my fault.

246
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,740
Just tell me, are you going
with me or not? Yes or no.

247
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,740
What's it gonna be, Jen?

248
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,380
Lyle... don't.

249
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,540
Half the school's not here today.

250
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,740
Is that so?

251
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
Because of you.

252
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,140
Thanks.

253
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,860
Twenty-four... fourteen... two.

254
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,580
No.

255
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,020
Twenty-two...

256
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,220
fourteen...

257
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,540
twenty.

258
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,340
No.

259
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,060
Where are you going?

260
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,740
Bathroom.

261
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,460
Why, you want to watch me
pee, Special agent Todd?

262
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,740
Yod o really bad, huh?

263
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,940
My parents tme you had
to follow me around.

264
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,300
Doesn't mean that I have to talk to you.

265
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,380
Do your parents know that you smoke?

266
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:49,940
No.

267
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,060
Well, you going to tell them?

268
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,460
Not if you promise to quit.

269
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,100
Whatever.

270
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,100
You know, you should be flattered.

271
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,860
I used to protect the President.

272
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,020
Of what?

273
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,340
The United States.

274
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,100
Really? And now you're protecting me.

275
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,580
And your whole family.

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,220
What a waste.

277
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Might be four people...

278
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,060
but it's not a family.

279
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,900
It hasn't been in a long time.

280
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,300
Not this week.

281
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,500
You strapped in?

282
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh, a Sig!

283
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Dude, you got a Sig.

284
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,700
Dude's g S Want to help me warm up?

285
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,820
Yeah. What do yo want me to do?

286
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,860
Just, uh, stand there and don't move.

287
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,740
Okay. I can do that.

288
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,580
All right.

289
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,380
Don't move.

290
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,620
I'm good at that.

291
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,740
Goal!

292
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,700
Hey, touch me, it's child abuse.

293
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,140
Shoot Shoot it! Nice shot

294
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,260
It's just plain stupid.

295
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,820
Oh, okay, here we go.

296
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,700
He's getting better, all oe matter
he is if he c reach the damn ball!

297
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,100
Why's the coach keep playing him?

298
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,100
'Cause he's the coach's kid.

299
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,740
I agree with you, we need a new keeper.

300
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,100
- Honey...
- Look at...

301
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,860
Okay, you know It's supposed to be fun.

302
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,260
Winning is fun, honey, trust me.

303
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,060
Well, it isn't everything, Micki.

304
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Well, it should be.

305
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,220
Come on, Greta. Let's, uh, let's go set up the snacks
while our spouses pretend they're watching the Olympics.

306
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,580
waouovertime foisss
That kid's a nightmare.

307
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,100
He reminds me of you.

308
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,700
No goal! No goal.

309
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,700
Sorry about that!

310
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,380
Sorry.

311
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:49,940
Sorry!

312
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:00,340
What's happened?

313
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,860
I don't know. Something
don't feel right.

314
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,060
He's good.

315
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,300
Told you I knew someone
who could beat you.

316
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,980
Not sure about this, DiNozzo.

317
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,660
Keep the faith, McGee.

318
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,140
You're winning.

319
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Playing Unreal Tournament in the Multiple Threat
Assessment Center is not what they had in mind when...

320
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,060
Focus, Probie.

321
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,420
If Gibbs sees me playing this...

322
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:36,914
Hey.

323
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,500
McGee

324
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,220
Yeah boss?

325
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:43,900
Status report.

326
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,940
McGee.

327
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,700
Uh... girl is-is in a room.

328
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,500
Um their parents are-are in the kitchen with
Kate and, uh, I guess you know where the boy is.

329
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,780
Yup.

330
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,180
Won't happen again.

331
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,220
I know.

332
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,660
twenty-two, forteen, twenty two

333
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:26,940
Women, Willy.

334
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:28,980
Can't live with them...

335
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,180
Can't think of a reason
why you'd want to.

336
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,020
We've got news?

337
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,700
You've got mail from the FBI.

338
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,740
I think agent has the hots for you.

339
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,500
Okay, you're right, she's
really not your type.

340
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,180
She sent me a highly encrypted jpegs.

341
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,780
Public key's got 64 numbers.

342
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,220
It took me longer to input the password than
it took the program to decrypt the ciphertext.

343
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,780
Um, machine making pretty pictures now.

344
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah, Gibbs.

345
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,700
You got the stills?

346
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,300
Yeah.

347
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,100
We, um, took them off the
ice cream man's computer-

348
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,020
Fernando Patroya.

349
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,620
We extracted his hard drive,
cloned it and returned it.

350
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,060
He doesn't even know.

351
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,980
He had Commander Shields
under surveillance.

352
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,580
Yeah.

353
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,460
I want him brought in.

354
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,420
Look, I told you

355
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,980
I can't. Not yet.

356
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,140
We need his whole cell.

357
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,900
We are running out of
time here, Agent Reyes.

358
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,900
Look, you've got your people
on the family. They'll be fine.

359
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
For a few more days.

360
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,580
Don't worry,

361
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,860
okay? After that, the FBI
will pick up protection

362
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,340
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

363
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,180
Boss, I need you up here.

364
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,540
Someone in the backyard.

365
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,980
Kate and Tony are intercepting.

366
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,580
No! No! Wait!

367
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,940
- It's-it's-it's...
- Freeze!

368
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,220
Don't shoot him!

369
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Jen! Get out! Get out! Jen, go now!

370
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm sorry!

371
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Please don't kill me!

372
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,940
Stand down, Tony.

373
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,100
It's her boyfriend.

374
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,700
Not real bright, kid.

375
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,980
You're lucky you don't have
two holes in that face of yours.

376
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,300
Boyfriend?!

377
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,780
Gibbs? Kate. False alarm.

378
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,980
One of the kids?

379
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,100
Daughter's boyfriend.

380
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,100
Probably not the first time he's
snuck in, but I guarantee, the last.

381
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,380
Mom packs a Glock.

382
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,260
Where is Romeo now?

383
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,620
On his way home to change his pants.

384
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,180
And Juliet is getting her
butt reamed by the Capulets.

385
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,940
Roger that.

386
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,900
Standing down. Keep us informed.

387
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:02,060
You got it.

388
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,580
What are you doing?!

389
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,980
Uh... listening.

390
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,860
That is just wrong.

391
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,540
Sneaking your horny boyfriend into a house filled
with armed federal agents who are on the lookout

392
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,060
for Al Qaeda assassins-
that's wrong, Kate.

393
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,340
Me? I'm just trying to gather some
valuable intel so I can do my job better.

394
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,166
...but sneaking him in like this...

395
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,220
I mean, Jen, what the
hell were you thinking?

396
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,380
We weren't going to have sex, if
that's what you're worried about.

397
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,020
That's not the point.

398
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,340
That boy could've been killed!

399
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,740
You don't even know his name!

400
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,220
Look, why don't we all just calm down?

401
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,860
We've been dating for six months, Mom.

402
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,460
His name is Lyle, Lyle Chambers.

403
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,100
Let's stay on target, young lady.

404
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,460
This is not about names.

405
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,020
On target?! Do you think
I'm one of your sailors?

406
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,400
That's enough, Jennifer.

407
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:47,020
She doesn't know anything
about my life, Dad.

408
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,180
And why do you think that is, Commander?

409
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,780
I'm warning you.

410
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,020
Do not speak to your mom like that.

411
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,620
Oh, all of a sudden, you're
concerned with Mom's feelings?

412
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,260
What is that supposed to mean?

413
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,780
What a joke.

414
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:00,660
Something I should know here?

415
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,580
Forget it. Just forget it.

416
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,060
Can I go to bed now?

417
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,860
We've got a face.

418
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,060
I think.

419
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,740
I've seen better pictures of Sasquatch.

420
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,100
Well, the fact that it's a
reflection limits the details.

421
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,580
Well, yeah, I can see that, Abby.

422
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,900
And their face-if it is a face-
looks like it's turned away.

423
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,700
Okay, so let's focus
on something smaller.

424
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,460
Like what?

425
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,220
Like a hand.

426
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,848
If you were placing a bomb underneath a car,
your other hand would be on the side panel.

427
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:39,140
That might actually work.

428
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,900
Ooh, I can see the paper now.

429
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,380
"Digital Optical Enhancement of Reflective
Surfaces with Scattered Refractive Properties."

430
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,780
Sounds like a bestseller.

431
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,540
I need the answers soon, Abbs.

432
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,420
Those were happier times.

433
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,900
Thank you.

434
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,900
I'm sorry about last night.

435
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,980
I- I don't know what
that girl was thinking.

436
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,180
It happens.

437
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,980
Teenagers, right?

438
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,460
It just feels like
yesterday that she was, uh...

439
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,820
playing with dolls and
following me around the house.

440
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,700
But now...

441
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,740
Well, raising a family and having
a full-time military career-

442
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
I don't know how you've managed it.

443
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,540
I didn't.

444
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,980
That's why I'm getting out.

445
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,740
It had nothing to do with Afghanistan.

446
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
But you could retire in five years.

447
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,620
Full pension, medical.

448
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,220
My last deployment
lasted for over a year.

449
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,580
When I came home, my babies,
my little boy and girl...

450
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,140
Willy wouldn't even speak to me.

451
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,700
And Jen was... five inches
taller and practically a stranger.

452
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,420
The constant moving, the
uncertainty, the-the time away...

453
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,260
David does a great job, but it's
too much for him, for-for all of us.

454
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,940
Have you thought about what you're
going to do when you get out?

455
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,940
Learn how to be a mother?

456
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,140
I certainly couldn't do any worse.

457
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,540
You're being too hard
on yourself, Commander.

458
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,140
From where I stand, you're a role model.

459
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,220
You know what was my
biggest fear in the Navy?

460
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,820
This feeling that... everything that I was
fighting for, everything that I wanted to protect...

461
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,220
wouldn't be here when I got back.

462
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,180
And now I've brought
the war home with me.

463
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,900
Check this out, Gibbs.

464
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,540
We got a hand.

465
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,020
That's a hand?

466
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,540
That's the best I could do.

467
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,100
Maybe not good enough.

468
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,220
How so?

469
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,940
Well, for some reason there's one area that
none of the enhancement programs will work on.

470
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,220
Can you tell if he's Middle Eastern?

471
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,140
That or African-American.

472
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,780
He's only got three fingers.

473
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,380
I know. I think the program screwed up.

474
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,460
Sorry, Gibbs.

475
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,380
He didn't.

476
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,940
He didn't what...?

477
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,100
Have fingers there.

478
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
So, it worked?

479
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,700
Cool.

480
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,660
So, what is he?

481
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,300
Some sort of killer shop teacher?

482
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,060
Killer squid.

483
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,500
Thanks, Abbs.

484
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:26,980
Yup.

485
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,140
This is insane, Micki.

486
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,460
Well, when you're
stressed, you eat. I run.

487
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,300
Look, why don't you
just use the treadmill?

488
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,540
It's not the same.

489
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,900
Okay, you know what?

490
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,060
Why don't you just do whatever you want?

491
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,900
Okay? You always do, anyway.

492
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,420
Agents DiNozzo and Todd are
going to be with me. It's a run.

493
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,500
What's the worst that could happen?

494
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,540
Uh, you could get shot by a sniper.

495
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,500
That would solve a lot
of problems, wouldn't it?

496
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,780
I can't even believe that you said that.

497
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,220
What is wrong with you?

498
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,820
I can't believe a lot
of things lately, David.

499
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,300
Running out in the open?

500
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
This is not a good idea.

501
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,500
Well, she's stubborn, won't listen to reason
and is definitely used to getting her own way.

502
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,740
Kind of reminds me of someone.

503
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,860
Yeah, like a female Gibbs.

504
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,020
See, I was thinking you.

505
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,420
Nice you could make it, Probie.

506
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,820
Traffic was a nightmare.

507
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,380
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,260
In the real world of real agents, we
account for things like traffic, McGee.

509
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,860
We'll be back in about an hour.

510
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,820
The monster's up in his room.

511
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,860
Listen, don't take it personally
if he completely ignores you.

512
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,060
Which... he will.

513
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,220
Right.

514
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,220
McGee!

515
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,140
Hey.

516
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,500
Come on!

517
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,180
Yeah.

518
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,580
Reflected image?

519
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,100
So, our bomber is Roland Alan Moore.

520
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,100
You don't sound surprised, Agent Reyes.

521
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,460
Well, he was a suspect.

522
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,780
That's true.

523
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,340
Eh, it's a nice office.

524
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,380
Thanks.

525
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,180
That a surveillance request form?

526
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,260
I am pretty busy here, Gibbs, so
you got something to say, say it.

527
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,340
It's direct.

528
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,060
I like that.

529
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,740
Where is he?

530
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,660
Who?

531
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
My former Petty Officer,
Roland Alan Moore.

532
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,700
How would I know?

533
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,420
You're lying.

534
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,900
Know how I can tell?

535
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:33,220
Your pupils just contracted,
and your heart rate's increasing.

536
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,540
Maybe I'm just attracted to you.

537
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,620
You're hoping Moore will try it again.

538
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,820
You want to roll up his entire network.

539
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,340
So, what if I am?

540
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,100
My people are protecting that family.

541
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,620
If they have to, they will die doing it.

542
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,820
If that happens... ask
Fornell what I'd do.

543
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,700
I run this route every day.

544
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,940
It's exactly six miles.

545
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,780
You up for an eight-minute pace?

546
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,540
I am. Let me check with my partner.

547
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,260
You up for an eight-minute pace?

548
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,980
Behind us, white panel van.
Been with us the last two turns.

549
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,460
If he makes this turn, we abort.

550
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,980
McGee, we might have a situation here.

551
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,180
12:00. At the intersection.

552
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,220
I see him.

553
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,820
Ambush?

554
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,780
Take cover!

555
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,900
Break left!

556
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,880
How's the commander?

557
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,400
She's fine, except for a few bruises
she got when she hit the deck.

558
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,350
Tony has her and the entire
clan locked down at the house.

559
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:54,160
No more runs, Kate.

560
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,720
You don't have to tell me twice, Gibbs.

561
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,360
We got lucky today.

562
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,400
The blast was mostly
contained inside the vehicle.

563
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,000
Of course there's also the
matter of the five FBI agents

564
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,160
that Tony and I almost shot.

565
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,520
They were there for your protection.

566
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
In unmarked vans and
without our knowledge?

567
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,680
Our operation's need to
know, Agent Todd. You didn't.

568
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,800
I've run presidential
protection details, Reyes.

569
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,160
You don't assign two undercover
units without coordination.

570
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,920
She's not interested
in protection, Kate.

571
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,920
You wanted them to try again.

572
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,560
The FBI thinks the assassination team after the
commander is part of a much larger operation.

573
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,240
And we're the bait to draw them out.

574
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,360
Our Intel indicates that they were
planning something catastrophic.

575
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
We were hoping by observing this team

576
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,080
that they would lead us
to the rest of the network.

577
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
And if the commander and her family
just happen to die in the process?

578
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,120
Wow. And I thought
Fornell was a bastard.

579
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,120
It was your people that were
lucky today, Agent Reyes.

580
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh, yeah? How do you figure that?

581
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Because my people shoot to kill.

582
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,680
You stay here.

583
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Make sure you get copies
of everything the FBI finds.

584
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,920
I don't trust her.

585
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,960
Good. You'

586
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,160
Excuse me?

587
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,325
Um, hi.

588
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,600
My name is Greta Boyen.

589
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,560
I'm a friend of the Shields.

590
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Is Micki okay?

591
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,680
She's fine.

592
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,040
'Cause I actually just
live right over there

593
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,720
and we heard the explosion and I saw
her being carried away and I thought...

594
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,960
She was just a little dazed, that's all.

595
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,920
Thank God.

596
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,920
Uh, listen, do you think it'd be all
right if we went over and visited?

597
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,720
The best thing you can do for her
right now, Mrs. Boyen, is go home.

598
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,440
I got that coffee for you, Agent Reyes.

599
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Not as strong as mine,
but if you don't want it...

600
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,840
No, I've been waiting 20 minutes, Gibbs.

601
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,200
I am not used to waiting.

602
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't like waiting.

603
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
Well, yeah, that's why I got you coffee.

604
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
You sure you don't want to try?

605
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,240
What the hell do you want?

606
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,560
Roland Alan Moore.

607
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
In my chat
room- one hour.

608
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Not going to happen until he
leads us to everyone in his cell.

609
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,800
I'll get their names.

610
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,760
Oh? How?

611
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
You going to force feed him your coffee?

612
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,680
You see, DiNozzo was wrong about you.

613
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,000
You do have a sense of humor.

614
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,720
Don't miss the 6:00 new, Agent Reyes.

615
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,120
What the hell have you done?

616
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,400
Nothing yet.

617
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,960
But isn't our FBI using an American
family as terrorist bait news?

618
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,520
You'll blow our operation.

619
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,800
Sure. But I'll also get
Moore in my chat room.

620
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,320
Look, even an agent as
arrogant as you are has to know

621
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
that what you're threatening
is a career ender.

622
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
Only if he doesn't talk.

623
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,160
If he does it's a career maker.

624
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,120
Suzanne McRoberts, please.

625
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,440
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

626
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,440
You've seen Suzanne on TV.

627
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
She's cute, blonde, does
the anchor on the news.

628
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,240
That had better mean we have a deal
or you're going to lose a finger.

629
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,920
You don't crack Moore, the
appendage that I'll cut off

630
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,360
will mean so much more
to you than a finger.

631
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
Oh, wow, you're reading Moonstone.

632
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,480
Hey, you know, Dorothy Sayers thought it
was the best detective story ever written.

633
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
And T.S. Eliot, he called Moon...

634
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,160
Where the hell is Gibbs?

635
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,480
the first true English detective novel.

636
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,240
Uh, Gibbs is prepping Roland
Alan Moore for interrogation.

637
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,600
Prepping?

638
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
You mean, like, physically abusing him?

639
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,240
No, no, no.

640
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,240
No. Gibbs never lays
a finger on a suspect,

641
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,400
at least not after we
have him in custody.

642
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,160
So, what the hell is it, exactly,
that he does to... "prep" them?

643
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
Well, it varies from suspect to suspect.

644
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,400
And, um, I really
can't say what he does.

645
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,440
Because it's illegal.

646
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,640
No, I don't think so.

647
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,960
Uh, no. It's usually
just a quiet conversation.

648
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,120
... after you hang yourself.

649
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,240
By the way, do you
prefer Roland or Mohammed?

650
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm not going to hang myself.

651
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,800
Oh, yeah, I know that.

652
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,000
That's just what my report's going say.

653
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,880
Anyway, after you hang yourself, your
body will be autopsied hereby Dr. Mallard.

654
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,160
Hey, Duck, where will you
start to cut on Roland?

655
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,920
He's going to hang himself?

656
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,960
Oh, well...

657
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,840
You're not going to do this.

658
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,360
He doesn't know me very well, does he?

659
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,800
Obviously not. I remember
one terrorist we had...

660
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,040
Ah, Duck, come on... no war stories.

661
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,040
Oh, right.

662
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,040
Well, I might start
with his head, Jethro.

663
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,360
I'd make a cut here behind the ear,
around the back to the other one.

664
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,160
And then I'd pull the
skin down over your face

665
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,120
so I could take the striker saw
to take the top of your skull off.

666
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,920
Get away from me.

667
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
All right, I don't think he
wants you to start there, Duck.

668
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,160
Oh, no matter.

669
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,400
I can always use a
"Y" cut to begin with.

670
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,880
Let me show you.

671
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,240
It's quite simple, really.

672
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:28,400
We take the scalpel and
we cut here and here.

673
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,520
There we go.

674
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,840
And then we make a cut all the way
down to just above the pubic bone.

675
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,640
Now, we separate the skin
from the muscle and tissue.

676
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:48,720
And then we take these and we... we cut.

677
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,280
Now, once I've...
opened you up-

678
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:57,920
Jethro-

679
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,760
I take this... from here...

680
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,800
and then I can take out... your heart.

681
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
...tubes down here.

682
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,640
Cut away...

683
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,160
there, what do you know, a lung.

684
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,440
And now we go up to the trachea
and I use this to pull it out...

685
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,680
along with your tongue.

686
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,120
The FBI announced the arrest of
four alleged terrorists today.

687
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,440
They are believed to be an Al Qaeda cell responsible
for the bombing of Navy Lieutenant Commander

688
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,280
Micki Shields' car at
a Tacoma supermarket

689
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,200
on Wednesday and a second
car bombing yesterday

690
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,640
on a street where she was jogging.

691
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,160
An FBI spokesperson said a
suspect they had under surveillance

692
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,080
led them to a Silver Springs apartment
where they captured the entire

693
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,640
cell without firing a shot.

694
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,000
Lieutenant Commander Shields
was the naval aviator...

695
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:16,920
The news is really epressing these days.

696
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,680
You have no idea, Commander Shields.

697
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,520
Actually not commander anymore.

698
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,960
Terminal leave is up.

699
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,440
I am just Mrs. Micki Shields now.

700
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,400
I kind of like the sound of it.

701
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,200
That's good.

702
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,720
We going to let these people
get on with their lives

703
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,440
or we going to stand here
and stare them to death?

704
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,120
Uh, the equipment is loaded and stored.

705
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,880
Ready to move, boss.

706
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,360
Well, then move, McGee.

707
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,640
You tell anyone where you got
it, I will deny under oath.

708
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:46,880
A blank hall pass.

709
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,720
Signed by the principal.

710
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,160
Undated.

711
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,440
Erasable ink is the key.

712
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,160
It's always worked for me.

713
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,240
Thank you.

714
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,880
Well, here you go.

715
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,240
Thanks.

716
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah, I wouldn't wear
it unless I had to.

717
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,440
Cool. If there's anything
you can think of...

718
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,320
Shades.

719
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,720
What?

720
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,760
I like your sunglasses.

721
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,720
Yeah, well, that's not surprising,
because, uh, they're super cool, Willy,

722
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,560
but see, the thing about these is that

723
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,920
these are really grownup shades.

724
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,520
We're out of here.

725
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,080
Thanks.

726
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,960
Sweet.

727
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,160
Polarized lenses.

728
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,160
Impact protected.

729
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,680
Raked-back curvature.

730
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,480
They were special order, boss.

731
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
I never special order.

732
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,720
Isn't that funny.

733
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,600
Neither do I.

734
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,760
There's nothing funny about this, McGee.

735
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,840
And what part of this
conversation's about you anyway?

736
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,840
Only the part about special ordering.

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,840
I always special order.

738
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,720
Bright day out today.

739
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,160
Yeah, Abbs?

740
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,120
So, the FBI finally sent copies

741
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,920
of the evidence from the second bombing.

742
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,360
The patterns don't match the first.

743
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
The second's more boom than bomb.

744
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,120
There was no shrapnel.

745
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,480
Um, fertilizer and oil instead of C-4.

746
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,760
And placement inside the
car limited the spread.

747
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,920
Amateur night.

748
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,920
Sounds like.

749
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,080
Oh, something else, my hero.

750
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,520
It was triggered by some
sort of crude remote control.

751
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,640
Like a garage door opener.

752
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,720
Couldn't have had a range
of more th a hundred feet.

753
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,440
Anything we should know, boss?

754
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
The second bomb wasn't Al Qaeda.

755
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,320
Somebody else wants the commander dead.

756
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
We're finished. It's over.

757
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,920
No, you're just confused, David.

758
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,240
And it's understandable, I would be too

759
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,040
if Al Qaeda were targeting my family.

760
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,680
Greta, what we did was a big mistake.

761
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,880
No. What we did was right.

762
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,880
She's brought all this on, herself.

763
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
She's put your family in harm's way.

764
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,640
David, everything's gonna
be better once she's gone.

765
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
Do you hear what you're saying?

766
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,240
What? You'll see.

767
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,520
You'll see.

768
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,280
We could go back to how we
were before she came home.

769
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
No, no, no.

770
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,720
Greta, that's not going to happen, okay?

771
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,400
We were lonely.

772
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,280
That's all it was.

773
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
I love my wife.

774
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,800
No!

775
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,680
Don't say that, okay?

776
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,680
That doesn't-
that's not true.

777
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Yes, it is.

778
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,480
Well, then, I'm going
to tell her, David.

779
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,120
If you won't, I will.

780
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
You just did, Greta.

781
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
Now get out of our life.

782
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,480
Oh, God.

783
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,600
Whoa. Whoa. Gre...

784
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,240
Greta! Put it away!

785
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,760
He made love to me, Micki.

786
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,840
He made love to me like
he's never made love to you.

787
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,640
He told me that.

788
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,360
Greta, look...

789
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,000
just give me the gun.

790
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,720
No!

791
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,200
Everything's going to
be fine when she's gone.

792
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,680
You'll see.

793
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,200
Drop your weapon, Greta.

794
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,320
Leave and I'll forget all about this.

795
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,320
I won't.

796
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,040
Please.

797
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,130
It was self-defense.

798
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,480
She was just trying to protect herself.

799
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,960
At least time it wasn't
an innocent civilian.

800
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,942
Actually, I did special order once.
