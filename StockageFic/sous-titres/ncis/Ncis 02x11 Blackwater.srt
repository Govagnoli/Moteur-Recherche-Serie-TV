1
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,460
No, for the 23rd time.

2
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,780
You going to answer that?

3
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm in hell, Kate.

4
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,540
Well, do they have money there?

5
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,660
'Cause you owe me $43.86
for lunch this week.

6
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,780
I will gladly pay you today

7
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,940
if you'll answer this call for me.

8
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,300
Yeah? Who is it?

9
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,060
A crazy ex-girlfriend. I
haven't seen her since college.

10
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,220
Stalker?

11
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,380
More like a stalk-him.

12
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,500
What do you want me to say to her?

13
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,300
I don't know.

14
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
Tell her you're my wife or something.

15
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,620
She's been calling me
nonstop for two days.

16
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm begging you here, Kate, please?

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,060
You pay me back today.

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,860
Sure.

19
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,860
Thank you.

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,340
Hello?

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,060
Me? Oh, uh...

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,260
I am Tony's wife.

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,620
Uh, yes, we got married a few years ago.

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,180
Do we have kids?

25
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,020
No.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,420
Two.

27
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,140
Yes, and we're very, very happy.

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,260
So, please, don't call back again.

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,740
Ugh. I feel like I need a shower.

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,980
Pay the lady, probie.

31
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,260
He bet me $40 that he could get you

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,340
to say you're his wife today.

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,380
Tony, I'm going to kill you.

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,220
DiNozzo! Pull the case file
on Lieutenant Brian McAllister.

35
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,940
McAllister? We going after
more treasure hunters, boss?

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,860
Treasure hunters?

37
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,460
Before your time, probie.

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,865
McAllister disappeared two years ago.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,220
His family offered a million-dollar
reward for anyone who could find him.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,740
I had a few friends
in the Secret Service

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,340
who used to work that
case on the weekends.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,580
It was the Holy Grail for every amateur

43
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,860
detective on the East Coast, Kate.

44
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,180
So what happened?

45
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
Nothing. Cold case.

46
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,460
Not anymore.

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,740
For the past two years,
thousands have searched

48
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,580
for the heir to the
McAllister Industries fortune.

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,020
Each hoping to collect
the $1 million reward

50
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,660
offered by his famous family.

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,865
Today, private
investigator, Monroe Cooper,

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,460
believes he's one step
closer to solving the mystery.

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,620
Mr. Cooper, is it true that you
have finally found Brian McAllister?

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,220
Whoa, boss.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,420
That was Monroe Cooper.

56
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,500
The man who can solve the unsolvable?

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,540
He's a famous detective.

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,580
Do I look like I care, McGee?

59
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,340
No.

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,620
Grab your gear.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,940
We're going to Black Lake.

62
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,540
"Lieutenant Brian McAllister graduated

63
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,260
Annapolis "in '97, third in his class.

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,580
"He vanished somewhere between October 4

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,740
and the 7th, 2002. No leads."

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,060
Thing I don't get is
why a guy worth millions

67
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
would join the military
in the first place.

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,580
You think money has anything

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,980
to do with patriotism, DiNozzo?

70
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,700
No, I'm just saying if I were rich,

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,540
you know, I would do nothing.

72
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
I thought your parents were loaded.

73
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,180
They are.

74
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,940
So why do you work for
the government then?

75
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,780
Because they know what their
son would do with the money.

76
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,580
I can't even get an
advance on the will, Kate.

77
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,980
Hey, McGee!

78
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,340
Yeah, boss?

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,140
Tell me about that private dick, Cooper.

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,300
Yeah, uh, he's a former
NYPD detective, works mostly

81
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,500
for insurance companies
and celebrities now.

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,140
He makes a lot of money
solving cases like this.

83
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,100
The guy's a...

84
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,660
He's kind of a cross between
Columbo and Sherlock Holmes.

85
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,900
You know, we really should
get a seat belt back there.

86
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,620
Hey!

87
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,380
What the hell are you doing?!

88
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,940
Looking for my fork.

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Well, I can guarantee
you it is not there.

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,900
Tony, grab the gear and
see if McGee's still alive.

91
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,220
Special Agent Gibbs, Todd, NCIS.

92
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,140
Been waiting for you all to show up.

93
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,500
Sheriff Deke Lester.

94
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,140
That Detective fella, Cooper, he thinks

95
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,020
that missing McAllister
kid's in there somewhere.

96
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:25,900
Yeah?

97
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,980
Is he?

98
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,260
I can't say, but my divers found

99
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,500
a Chrysler convertible
sitting on the bottom.

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,820
Lieutenant McAllister owned
a Chrysler convertible.

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,220
It disappeared with him, Gibbs.

102
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,580
Fixing to pull it out.

103
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,700
Once we I.D. the vehicle, we can
decide on who's got jurisdiction.

104
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,980
Works for me, Sheriff.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,300
Where's Cooper?

106
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,020
I don't rightly know.

107
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
I imagine he's off
detecting or something.

108
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,660
Hey, Deke, we've got
the chains set here.

109
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,740
Let's haul her up.

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,580
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,020
You ready to see what
we caught, Agent Gibbs?

112
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,220
Hurry it up, probie.

113
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,900
You sure this is necessary?

114
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,900
I kind of feel like a dork.

115
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,860
You are a dork.

116
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,380
No, no, no. Bad move.

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:05,820
What?

118
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,820
Gibbs catches you reading instead
of working, you're history.

119
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,220
It's not for reading.

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,140
I'm hoping I can get
Detective Cooper to sign it.

121
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,780
The lead character in
the book is based on him.

122
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,300
Celebrity P.I.?

123
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,220
Never heard of it.

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,620
No.

125
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,700
I'm not surprised you
haven't heard of it.

126
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,900
There's no pictures in it.

127
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,220
You say something, probie?

128
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,780
Yeah. I'm not a dork.

129
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,780
Whatever you say, SpongeBob.

130
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,940
Take it slow now, Charlie!

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,340
I think it's safe to say that
car's not gonna run again.

132
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,140
All right, hold it right there.

133
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,740
All right, Kate.

134
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,780
The lieutenant's tags, Gibbs.

135
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,500
Congratulations.

136
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,420
Looks like you found
your missing sailor.

137
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,580
Eh, not yet.

138
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,060
I think you'll find that pile of bones
is McAllister, Special Agent, uh...

139
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,700
Gibbs.

140
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,660
And I'll wait for my
M.E. to determine that.

141
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,460
Oh, of course.

142
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,700
Monroe Cooper.

143
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,060
"The man who solves the unsolvable."

144
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,940
So you've heard of me?

145
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,300
No. It's on your card.

146
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,660
My publicist's idea.

147
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Works great with the yokels.

148
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,940
How'd you track his
vehicle to Black Lake?

149
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,140
Leg work, luck, my gut.

150
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
It say that on your card, too?

151
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,580
I have a policy, Agent Gibbs.

152
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,740
You share information with
me, and I share it with you.

153
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,460
We have a deal?

154
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,780
That kind of goes
against my policy, Cooper.

155
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,820
Which is?

156
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,860
Throw people in jail who
obstruct my investigations.

157
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,980
I'll try to keep that in mind.

158
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,020
The dental records
are conclusive, Jethro.

159
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,020
This is our missing lieutenant.

160
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,860
Any idea how he died?

161
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,420
After two years in the water?

162
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,060
Difficult to say.

163
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,180
Do you suspect foul play?

164
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,140
You know me, Duck.

165
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,900
I suspect everything.

166
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,740
That's an admirable
trait in an investigator.

167
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,940
And also the reason your three
marriages ended in divorce.

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,460
Oh yeah?

169
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,700
All these years I thought it
was because I was a bastard.

170
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,300
Well, of course, that didn't help.

171
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,620
Oh, there's evidence
of a hairline fracture

172
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,700
on the frontal lobe of the skull.

173
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,020
Cause?

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
It's consistent with
most vehicle accidents,

175
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,020
quite possibly from contact
with the steering column.

176
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,780
What about drugs?

177
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,140
Well, in this state, a toxicological
screen would be useless.

178
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,580
However, drugs are a possibility.

179
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,180
Too many of those, Duck; too many.

180
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Well, my current opinion
is that Lieutenant

181
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,460
McAllister met with a tragic accident.

182
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,220
Most likely, he drowned.

183
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,460
Keep looking.

184
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,580
Alas, poor Yorick.

185
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,220
Did you meet any of his wives?

186
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,340
I introduced him to the last one.

187
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,860
Really.

188
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,460
What went wrong?

189
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh, t's difficult to say, Mr. Palmer.

190
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,380
She doesn't talk to me anymore.

191
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
You know what movie
this reminds me of, Kate?

192
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,900
The Wizard of Oz?

193
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,500
I'll get you, my pretty!

194
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,260
No. I meant the one they
make you watch in high school.

195
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,500
30 minutes of cops pulling dead
teenagers out of car wrecks.

196
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,660
Oh, my God!

197
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,980
I loved those!

198
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,260
Blood on the Highway...

199
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,900
Drink, Drive, Die.

200
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,700
I keep hoping they're
gonna release them on DVD.

201
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,980
Yeah, me too.

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,660
Yeah.

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,220
What do we have?

204
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,420
Ah, hey, boss.

205
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
I found a suitcase in the back.

206
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,340
Looks like he packed
enough for about a weekend.

207
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,780
Dive team will be back
with the rest of the stuff

208
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,660
from the debris field in a few hours.

209
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,220
Abbs?

210
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,940
The brake lines are
corroded but they're intact.

211
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,500
Something's stuck.

212
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,140
Hey, Kate?

213
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,900
I got a present for ya.

214
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,300
I think it's one of your ex-boyfriends.

215
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,260
It's a cold fish.

216
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,340
You get it, Kate?

217
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,740
I don't think this was an accident!

218
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,740
It's a bullet.

219
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,420
McAllister was murdered.

220
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
Your speakers are broken.

221
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,420
Oh, Gibbs.

222
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,540
That was the best part of the song.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,300
Correction, your ears are broken.

224
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,860
What'd the divers find?

225
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,380
Actually, it's more like
what didn't they find.

226
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,700
My theory is they're
getting paid by the piece.

227
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,220
They recovered everything within

228
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,060
a 20-meter radius of the vehicle.

229
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,940
Sunglasses, golf balls, Rick
James 8-track, typewriter...

230
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,820
I didn't see any point in bringing

231
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,340
the Maytag up from
the evidence lock-up.

232
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,260
Anything to do with the case?

233
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,420
As a matter of fact, found
directly beneath the vehicle...

234
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,500
Can you hear me now?

235
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,140
I might be able to recover
some data from the memory chip.

236
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,580
What about the bullet we brought
up from the wreck last night?

237
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,140
45 caliber.

238
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,340
230-grain hardball.

239
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,940
Lots and lots of stopping power.

240
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,580
The grooving matches a Colt
.45, old-school military version.

241
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,980
Did you work up a trajectory yet?

242
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,060
Of course.

243
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,700
The bullet's entry angle
into the side of the door

244
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,860
is as obvious as Anna Nicole's implants.

245
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,900
Who?

246
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,540
You know, married to that
old guy, had a TV show,

247
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,460
- got fat, got thin, got fat, got thin, fat...
- Stop

248
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Right, so...

249
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,580
using that angle,

250
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,540
I back-traced the trajectory.

251
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,700
The bullet traveled on this path.

252
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,540
So unless he was driving with
his feet from the backseat,

253
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,020
which is something that I have
tried, but do not recommend...

254
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,500
Abby.

255
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,340
...the round had to have gone
through McAllister's body.

256
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,460
It's entirely possible,
Jethro, but if Abby's

257
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,180
animation is correct, the bullet passed

258
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,100
clean through the thoracic
cavity unfortunately,

259
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,300
without leaving any
evidence of its passing.

260
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,380
Hell of a shot.

261
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,620
Yeah.

262
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
The vehicle had to be going

263
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,180
over 70 to end up where
we found it in the lake.

264
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,300
Well, at that speed, a bullet
passing through the rib cage

265
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,540
without so much as glancing
a single bone... ha!

266
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,300
Hell of a shot indeed.

267
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,820
More like impossible.

268
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,020
Thank you, Duck.

269
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,180
Doctor?

270
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,260
He means the vehicle was stationary

271
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,740
when Lieutenant McAllister
was shot, Mr. Palmer.

272
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,180
Lieutenant McAllister was last
seen in Norfolk on a Friday,

273
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,020
then found 300 miles away
in Black Lake, Virginia.

274
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,300
Which would make sense
if he was heading here.

275
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,140
The McAllister family
compound in Shenandoah.

276
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,660
So he was heading home for the weekend?

277
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,100
Another 20 miles and he
would have made it, McGee.

278
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,780
DiNozzo.

279
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,660
McAllister's military
records are spotless, boss.

280
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,020
Been running background on his family.

281
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,700
Mother died in '93.

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,940
Father passed away in 2002,

283
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
three months after the
lieutenant disappeared.

284
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,380
The only surviving
next of kin is this guy:

285
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,380
Thomas McAllister, his younger brother.

286
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,740
Washed out of Annapolis freshman year.

287
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,500
Arrested a bunch of times for suspected

288
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,100
DWI and marijuana possession.

289
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,220
Never convicted.

290
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,740
Figures. The rich never are.

291
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,940
Even richer now, Kate.

292
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,780
He inherited everything.

293
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,340
He's currently the
CEO of his own airline.

294
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,460
The Good Son and the Bad Seed.

295
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,420
Very biblical.

296
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,420
Navy notified him last
night about his brother.

297
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
CACO said he took it pretty well.

298
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,300
Lunch.

299
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,420
Oh! Thank you.

300
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,860
I took the liberty of
ordering lunch today.

301
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,500
Something healthy, for once.

302
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,340
There you are.

303
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,340
They're tofu veggie wraps.

304
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,740
They're good, Tony.

305
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,300
Abby and I eat them all the time.

306
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,380
DiNozzo, track down the bad seed.

307
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,620
I want to know what he was doing

308
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,260
around the time his brother disappeared.

309
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,740
Already set up an interview
for later this afternoon, boss.

310
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,420
Take Kate.

311
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,540
McGee.

312
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,060
Contact Cooper.

313
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,220
I want to know how
he found that vehicle.

314
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,260
So we're going to cooperate with him?

315
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,060
No, McGee, he's going
to cooperate with me.

316
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,060
Okay, I'll be right back,

317
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm just going to run this down to Abby.

318
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Enjoy.

319
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,940
"Beyond First Class"?!

320
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,420
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

321
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,020
Might as well call it
Rich Jackass Airways.

322
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,780
I think it sounds cool.

323
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:54,860
You would.

324
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,340
What's that supposed to mean?

325
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,460
Nothing, Rockefeller.

326
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,100
Oh, I get it.

327
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,300
So because I grew up with
money, that somehow makes me bad.

328
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,860
Very deep.

329
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,140
Well, it's better than having
to work every day, like I had to.

330
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,460
Listen, you think money
makes life easier, huh?

331
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,340
Everything was just a big old

332
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,780
cakewalk for little Anthony DiNozzo?

333
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,300
You tell me, Kate, 'cause
I really want to know.

334
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,740
I'm sorry, Tony.

335
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,380
I didn't mean anything by it.

336
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,300
'Cause you want to know
the answer to your question?

337
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,220
Yes, money makes a
huge difference, huge.

338
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,340
I miss it every single day of my life,

339
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,900
so much it makes me want to cry.

340
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,540
You're pathetic.

341
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,460
- It's part of my charm.
- Yeah.

342
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,620
All right, let's find this
little twiddle toes candy pants.

343
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,980
Hey, there, we're looking for your boss,

344
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,260
Thomas McAllister is he around?

345
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
You'll have to hold on a second.

346
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Could you pass me that
socket wrench please, miss?

347
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,460
Is he even here or should we stop
by a country club or something?

348
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,980
I'm Tom McAllister.

349
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,220
Agents Todd, DiNozzo, NCIS.

350
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,620
Do you always work on your
own planes, Mr. McAllister?

351
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,220
Whenever I can find time
in my busy social schedule

352
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,140
down at the club, Agent Todd.

353
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,820
I'm sorry about that.

354
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,340
I didn't...

355
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,100
It's fine.

356
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,860
You would have been right
a couple of years ago.

357
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,900
And please, call me Tom.

358
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,260
Kate.

359
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,980
So, do you own all these planes?

360
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,780
Yeah, me and the bank.

361
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,260
That's my new one out there.

362
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Plan on taking it for a test
flight today, if you're interested.

363
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,980
You don't seem too broken up for

364
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,300
a guy who just lost his brother, Tom.

365
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,940
I've known he's been dead for
quite some time, Agent DiNozzo.

366
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,460
The first week you expect a ransom note.

367
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,300
After a month, you pray.

368
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,780
A year?

369
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,740
You just know.

370
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,860
When's the last time you
talked to your brother?

371
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,140
About three months before the accident.

372
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,860
Would you believe we grew
up fishing at Black Lake?

373
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,060
Thing is, it wasn't an accident.

374
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,220
- But the Navy, they said...
- Your brother was murdered.

375
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,220
Are you absolutely positive about that?

376
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,340
He was shot on the
weekend of October 4, 2002.

377
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,380
Considering his body was found dumped

379
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,140
20 miles from your house,
we'd like to know where

380
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,300
you were the weekend he disappeared.

381
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,180
Me... I was at home.

382
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,900
Anyone who can verify that?

383
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
I was with my father.

384
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,500
Let me rephrase.

385
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,300
Is there anyone who can
verify that who's still alive.

386
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,580
No.

387
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
You're saying you think I did it?

388
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,780
We're just following up
any leads we can, Tom.

389
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,460
Of course.

390
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,420
Whatever I can do to help.

391
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,220
I can't tell you what
an honor this is, sir.

392
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,740
Thank you.

393
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,300
Don't believe everything
you read in the book, kid.

394
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
It's called fiction for a reason.

395
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,660
I actually write a little myself.

396
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,580
Ah.

397
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,820
Is there any truth to the rumor

398
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
that S.E. Eckhart is, in fact, you?

399
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,900
If I was a best-selling
author, would I be

400
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
crawling through the swamps of Virginia

401
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,260
searching for reward money?

402
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,940
No, I guess not.

403
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,980
Damn straight.

404
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,460
Now tell me about your boss.

405
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,380
Is he always such a hard-ass?

406
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,740
Agent Gibbs?

407
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,060
Yeah.

408
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,860
He's a lot like you, actually.

409
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,940
Oh...?

410
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,460
Yeah.

411
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,260
In fact, the main character
in my book is based on him.

412
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,340
I hope he got a better deal than I got.

413
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,380
Well, he doesn't know it yet.

414
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,500
Don't know what, McGee?

415
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,500
What a great guy I am, Gibbs.

416
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,380
You ready to tell me
how you found McAllister?

417
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,540
You ready to tell me what you pulled

418
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,580
out of his car and his corpse?

419
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,100
Depends.

420
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:07,900
On what?

421
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,980
How bad you want that
million-dollar reward.

422
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,260
Ah... considering how I don't collect

423
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,980
till you put the murderer behind bars,

424
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,580
you got me by the short
hairs there, Gibbs.

425
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,780
Here.

426
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,180
I figured the lieutenant
headed home that weekend.

427
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,500
But the back road
that he liked to drive,

428
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,900
I think it was washed out.

429
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,380
Here, take a look at
these weather patterns.

430
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,060
Now, I spent nine weeks
getting these from the

431
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,780
National Weather Service.

432
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,380
Every Doppler readout, every

433
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,980
satellite image I could find.

434
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,820
Pocket of storms, real
tight, near the road.

435
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,940
Enough to swell that creek alongside?

436
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,740
Yeah, but only on that
side of the mountain, kid.

437
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,980
My educated guess?

438
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,700
I think McAllister doubled
back, took this road

439
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,940
to the other side, where
the storm hadn't reached yet.

440
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,300
See, the locals only use that
road when there are bad storms.

441
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,980
That's right along Black Lake, boss.

442
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,260
I figure that if somebody
wanted to kill him, they had

443
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,740
to know the roads and the
weather the way McAllister did.

444
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,380
And they'd have to know
he was coming, am I right?

445
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,900
I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

446
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,620
What?

447
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,900
Kate Todd acting like a high
school girl with a crush.

448
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,220
He's not a murderer, Tony.

449
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,940
I'm sorry, were you using the new NCIS

450
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,300
magical murderer detector back there?

451
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,980
My gut.

452
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,100
If you were a guy, I'd
say you were using your...

453
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,980
Don't even say it, if you want to live.

454
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,060
What did Thomas McAllister have to say?

455
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,580
He hadn't heard from his
brother in three months.

456
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,060
Definitely hiding something, boss.

457
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
My best guess, it was grief.

458
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,340
There's no way he's involved, Gibbs.

459
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,340
Abbs, what do you have?

460
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,820
The last three calls
that came in on the phone

461
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,460
from the lake were all
made on Friday, October 4.

462
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,940
Yeah?

463
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
And they were all from his
brother, Thomas McAllister.

464
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,620
Sorry, Kate.

465
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:07,586
This McAllister family's
got more skeletons

466
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,416
than a North Korean prison camp, Gibbs.

467
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,000
Here.

468
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,320
That's everything I've turned up.

469
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Six months of leg work.

470
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,480
It's okay to smoke in here, sweetheart?

471
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,000
Uh, it's Agent Todd,
and, no, Detective Cooper.

472
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,280
It's a federal office building.

473
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
Oh. It's a wonder you
guys catch anybody working

474
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,400
under these conditions.

475
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,720
We manage.

476
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,840
This supposed to be
in some sort of order?

477
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
The order's up here, Gibbs.

478
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,280
And I'll be glad to lay it out for you,

479
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,200
once you tell me what
you found in that wreck.

480
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Lieutenant McAllister was shot.

481
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,600
Hmm. How many times?

482
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,440
At least once.

483
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,760
You got the round?

484
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
It's recovered from
the passenger-side door.

485
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Pistol, uh, huh?

486
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,640
Rifle would go clear through.

487
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,360
Forty-five.

488
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,040
Car must have been stopped.

489
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
He was approached, but not alarmed.

490
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,320
Know his attacker?

491
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
One shot, point blank.

492
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,520
Blam.

493
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,200
Poor sap never saw it coming.

494
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,760
You know how, Gibbs.

495
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,320
Want to know why?

496
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
Angle your end down, probie.

497
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,320
I told you we should
have taken the legs off.

498
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,880
I said down.

499
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay.

500
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,640
What does Cooper need
this thing for anyway?

501
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,480
He's old school.

502
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
It's part of his process.

503
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,840
He has solved every
case he's taken on, Tony.

504
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
How many detectives you know
with 100% batting average?

505
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,400
You mean besides Gibbs?

506
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,480
Finally.

507
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,120
Change of plans.

508
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm doing this upstairs.

509
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Maybe we should take the stairs.

510
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,760
Maybe you should take the
legs off, like I told you to.

511
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm gonna take the stairs.

512
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,040
Hey, I'm the one who said that...

513
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,240
Elaine McAllister, the mother.

514
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,800
Into the occult in a big way.

515
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Psychics, seances, all that weird sh...

516
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,400
Stuff. She dies in
'93, family falls apart.

517
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,160
How?

518
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,360
The old man.

519
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Took it pretty hard.

520
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,080
He decided he was gonna
contact the dead wife.

521
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
Starts neglecting the family business.

522
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
What do you mean by make contact?

523
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,320
He consults this space
cadet, Saleena Lockhart.

524
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Claimed to be a psychic.

525
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,400
I've heard of her.

526
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,480
She used to have that, um...

527
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,040
the tabloid astrology column.

528
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,160
No, I don't buy it.

529
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,720
Astrology?

530
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
No, you reading tabloids.

531
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,800
She weasels her way
into the old man's life.

532
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,560
Next thing you know, she's
practically running it.

533
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,120
McAllister Avionics starts to slide

534
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,920
till it's almost bankrupt by 2000.

535
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,120
How much money did he leave her?

536
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,040
You're quick, Gibbs.

537
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,400
Almost ten million.

538
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
He changed his will two weeks after

539
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,920
the lieutenant went missing.

540
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,560
The surviving brother
still fighting it in court.

541
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
This is kind of like Anna Nicole.

542
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,040
Who?

543
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,240
That's what I said.

544
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
McGee, run a background
on this wack job.

545
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,680
I want to know where she is right now.

546
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,080
On it, boss.

547
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
Now, I know what you're thinking.

548
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
She didn't do it, Gibbs.

549
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,160
This is the smoking gun.

550
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,840
Thomas McAllister had a plan
to save the family's fortune.

551
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,200
He wanted to get out of avionics
and into his own airline.

552
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,720
And it's a good plan,
but it involved leveraging

553
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,360
every remaining asset
the McAllisters had.

554
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,880
The brother didn't agree.

555
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,560
Lieutenant was cashing
out of the company?

556
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,640
And going his own way.

557
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,760
This is the contract divesting
them of all family business.

558
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,480
Where'd you get this?

559
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
Oh, you don't want to know.

560
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
What you want to do is look at the date.

561
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,200
"October 5, 2002."

562
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,560
The weekend he vanished.

563
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Luckily for the little brother,
he didn't sign the contract.

564
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,760
I don't believe in luck.

565
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,000
Neither do I.

566
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,280
So, when you bringing McAllister in?

567
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm not.

568
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,760
W- What?!

569
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,160
But-But it's all there.

570
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,240
Motive, opportunity the calls
on the lieutenant's cell phone?

571
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,600
When you were a cop, did
you let civilians lay out

572
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,800
your cases, or did
you work them yourself?

573
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,000
NCIS has had this case for two years.

574
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,240
How long am I supposed to wait?

575
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,400
Till I'm done.

576
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,080
You are looking for the reward.

577
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,520
I am looking for a killer.

578
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,560
Thomas McAllister is your man, trust me.

579
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,360
I don't trust anyone, either.

580
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Kate,

581
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,120
how is your rapport with McAllister?

582
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
She's got more than a rapport, boss.

583
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,840
Well, good.

584
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
Call him.

585
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,760
You're having dinner with him tonight.

586
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,280
What if he says no?

587
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,960
Oh, the way he was looking at you,

588
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
I think you're gonna
be the one saying no.

589
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,480
McGee, you find my psychic yet?

590
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,240
I have her business address.

591
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,000
It's a TV talk show set in D.C.

592
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,800
She's there now.

593
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,720
DiNozzo, you're with me.

594
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,320
Hey, Cooper.

595
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,320
I trust you can find your way out.

596
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
Do you believe in any
of this psychic stuff?

597
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,920
No. You?

598
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
Ah, used one on a, uh,
case in Baltimore once.

599
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Led us right to this
kidnapped five-year-old girl.

600
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,880
That a fact?

601
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah. How do you explain that?

602
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,800
Simple. She was probably in on it.

603
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
Rolling.

604
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo, NCIS.

605
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
Looking to find Saleena Lockhart.

606
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,960
Yeah, she's inside.

607
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,200
But you can't go in.

608
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,040
Hey. Hey wait.

609
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,560
They're still shooting!

610
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,760
Man.

611
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,120
And your grandfather wants you to know

612
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,040
that he will always be with you, Sally.

613
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Always.

614
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
Thank you so much, Saleena.

615
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,280
And remember, look and you shall see,

616
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,320
listen and you will hear.

617
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Our departed loved ones
still have much to teach us.

618
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,320
You think this is how they
do it on the Oprah show?

619
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
Never believe what you see on TV.

620
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
Until next time, I'm Saleena Lockhart.

621
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,440
And cut!

622
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,480
Cutting!

623
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,480
"Look and you shall
sea," spelled s-e-a?

624
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,000
What kind of third-grader
is writing these cue cards?

625
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,760
Just give us ten minutes,
and we'll shoot it again.

626
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
I am financing this
pilot with my own money.

627
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,640
I can't afford another
of your ten minutes.

628
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,320
If anybody needs me,
I'll be in craft service.

629
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,280
Well, make sure you save
some for the rest of the crew.

630
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,440
Okay. What?!

631
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
There are two guys here to see you.

632
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,480
I tried to stop them.

633
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
Sorry.

634
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,000
Special Agents...

635
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,640
Gibbs and DiNozzo.

636
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
From, uh, NCIS.

637
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,320
How may I help you?

638
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
You're the psychic, you tell me.

639
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,560
Brian McAllister.

640
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,840
You found his remains in Black Lake.

641
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
Wow, she's good, boss.

642
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
It's on the news, DiNozzo.

643
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,880
No, I-I told Brian's
father that I-I felt

644
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,600
Brian was in a cold, dark place.

645
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,200
You could say that.

646
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,880
He was murdered.

647
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,640
Yes.

648
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes, he told me.

649
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,520
Who?

650
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Brian.

651
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,600
We connected through a
passage on the other side.

652
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,680
Passage?

653
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,400
That's what you call it?

654
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,280
You look skeptical.

655
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,400
But it's okay.

656
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,840
You don't have to believe.

657
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,360
So, uh, he tell you who did it?

658
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,920
It doesn't work that way, Agent DiNozzo.

659
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,840
Can I get a green tea, please?

660
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,960
How does it work?

661
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,840
Well, I-I get impressions, feelings.

662
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't get specific details.

663
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,840
You have any feeling about his
father including you in his will?

664
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,160
I didn't ask him.

665
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,560
I'm not a psychic, but considering
he's a Navy fighter pilot

666
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,600
I'd say he'd be pretty
pissed off about it.

667
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,280
Your point, Agent Gibbs?

668
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,320
Where were you the weekend
Lieutenant McAllister was murdered?

669
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,640
Luray.

670
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,720
Luray Caverns. I was
hosting a spiritual retreat.

671
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Luray? Hey, boss, isn't that about
15 miles from, uh, Black Lake?

672
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,400
Can you tell me what I'm
thinking now, Miss Lockhart?

673
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,600
You don't have to be
a psychic to tell that.

674
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,120
Could we discuss this outside, please?

675
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,720
Your...

676
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,040
energy is disrupting my set.

677
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,560
Thank you.

678
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,040
Look, I had nothing to do
with Brian's disappearance.

679
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,640
You should talk to his brother.

680
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah? Why is that?

681
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Thomas was the black sheep.

682
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Oh, and he hated Brian.

683
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,600
I may be many things, Agent
Gibbs, but I am not a murderer.

684
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,960
But you talk to dead people.

685
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,760
I have over a dozen people who can

686
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,120
verify my whereabouts on that weekend.

687
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,520
One of them is a senator.

688
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,640
We'll need their names.

689
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,160
My lawyer will get them to you.

690
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,720
Now, is there anything
else I can do for you?

691
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

692
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,160
Son of a bitch.

693
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
Did you get a license number?

694
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,400
Yeah, I got one.

695
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,440
That's a good job, Tony.

696
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,360
It's definitely from a.45 round, guys.

697
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,800
Just give me a sec to line
up the rifling patterns.

698
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,720
You run the plates?

699
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,600
Came back stolen.

700
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,480
Figures.

701
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,600
The markings match.

702
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,640
It's from the same pistol that killed

703
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,280
Lieutenant McAllister two years ago.

704
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,560
Why don't we just drag McAllister
in for questioning, boss?

705
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,720
Because his lawyers
make more in one hour

706
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,520
than you make all week.

707
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,400
That's an excellent point so
you're saying I deserve a raise?

708
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,560
Or not.

709
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,720
We need more than circumstantial

710
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,160
evidence to take McAllister down.

711
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,920
I agree, but what do we get

712
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
out of Kate going on a date with him?

713
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,240
I get to search his house for that

714
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,960
Colt.45 without him knowing about it.

715
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,040
And if it turns out he's our murderer?

716
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,920
That's why you're going with her.

717
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,620
I'm meeting him at the
airport in 20 minutes, Gibbs.

718
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,100
Hey, you need to
distract him for at least

719
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,540
two hours so we can search his house.

720
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,780
Shouldn't be a problem.

721
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
He already invited me to dinner.

722
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:51,100
So... how do I look?

723
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,420
What do you mean, "eh"?

724
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,940
I mean, eh, you look fine.

725
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,020
What's wrong with fine?

726
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,477
I'm going for hot here, Tony.

727
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,380
Well, in that case, do you mind?

728
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,380
Boss...

729
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,380
...got the search warrant.

730
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,540
Yeah. You're with me.

731
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,180
Get your things.

732
00:30:20,971 --> 00:30:21,500
Yeah, now that...

733
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
that is hot.

734
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,460
You two done playing dress-up?

735
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,380
Done.

736
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,180
All right.

737
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,340
Get moving; I want a
comm check in 15 minutes.

738
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:29,860
On it.

739
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,260
Hey, Kate, it looked
better the other way.

740
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,460
How you reading me, Kate?

741
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,540
Say again?

742
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,540
I said, loud and clear.

743
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,460
Slide the mic closer
to your throat, please.

744
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,060
How's that?

745
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,020
Crystal.

746
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,540
Hello?

747
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,140
Hello?

748
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,140
Kate.

749
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:05,300
Whoa.

750
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,180
Do I feel underdressed.

751
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Well, when you said dinner...

752
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,060
Hey, I'm not complaining.

753
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,100
You look fantastic.

754
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,100
Thank you.

755
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,500
So, where we going?

756
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,300
Actually, I thought we might stay here.

757
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,380
If you survive my cooking,
there's a few things

758
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,020
I'd like to tell you
about my big brother.

759
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,860
Uh, boss, where we going?

760
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,140
Going around back, McGee.

761
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
It's locked, boss.

762
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,020
Well, yeah, McGee that's kind
of the point of having doors.

763
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,380
Well, the last two times I encountered

764
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,420
a situation like this, Tony threw a rock

765
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,820
through a window, Kate climbed
in a second-story window.

766
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,260
You don't say.

767
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,140
Let's go.

768
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
I wasn't entirely truthful
this afternoon, Kate.

769
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,980
When you come from the
type of family I did,

770
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
you get used to keeping secrets.

771
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,900
What kind of secrets?

772
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,300
My parents were always a bit eccentric.

773
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,740
When my mom died, my
dad pretty much lost it.

774
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,500
He started talking to dead people?

775
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,500
You been checking up on me.

776
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,900
It's my job, Tom.

777
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,140
At first, I thought it was harmless,

778
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,700
but this psychic he was seeing

779
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,220
she started manipulating him,

780
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,900
really cutting him off
from the rest of the family.

781
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,100
Saleena Lockhart.

782
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,220
Really checking up on me.

783
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,940
What did your brother think of her?

784
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,580
He didn't. Brian was too
busy with his naval career.

785
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,980
He wasn't around to see
the damage she was doing.

786
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,420
Somebody tried to kill her today.

787
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,580
Thought of it myself, more than once.

788
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,540
A lot of people think it was you.

789
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,860
What do you think, Kate?

790
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,020
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

791
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,940
NCIS!

792
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,180
Guys, do you mind?

793
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,780
Cooper...

794
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,620
...what are you doing here?

795
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:37,980
Same thing you are.

796
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,220
I have a warrant.

797
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,940
You gonna arrest me?

798
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,980
It depends.

799
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,220
On what?

800
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,460
What you found.

801
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
I'm hoping a million dollars.

802
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,060
I checked all the local counties.

803
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,620
Thomas McAllister doesn't
own any handguns, but...

804
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,100
his old man?

805
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Bit of a gun nut.

806
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,020
Even owns a Colt.45.

807
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Recently fired.

808
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,620
- DiNozzo.
- Tony.

809
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,300
Yeah, boss?

810
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
- Take him down.
- I'm on it.

811
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,940
I called Brian the
weekend he went missing.

812
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,820
I was trying to get him to come home,

813
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,020
talk some sense into Dad.

814
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,500
He said he'd think about it.

815
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,100
Why would you lie to us about it?

816
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,980
Because I thought that...

817
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,100
I was responsible for his death.

818
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,140
Were you?

819
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,220
When they found his car in Black Lake,

820
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,340
I thought he finally decided
to listen to me for once.

821
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,220
The roads in Hastings are
deathtraps in the daytime.

822
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,180
At night, when you're tired...

823
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
You thought it was an accident.

824
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,460
Until you told me he was murdered.

825
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,260
Only one person stood
to gain from his death:

826
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,140
Saleena Lockhart.

827
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,820
Unfortunately, there is one more.

828
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,900
He never would've signed this.

829
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,620
Thomas McAllister.

830
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,700
You're under arrest for
the murder of your brother.

831
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,780
So I guess dessert is
out of the question.

832
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,620
You okay?

833
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:40,980
I'm fine.

834
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,260
You don't look fine.

835
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,140
I hope I'm getting
overtime for this, Gibbs,

836
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,780
because I'm missing
my cousin's birthday.

837
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,460
Were they a match?

838
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,700
It's the same weapon
that killed the lieutenant

839
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,140
and shot up the makeup trailer today.

840
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,740
Thanks, Abbs.

841
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,180
Mm, figures.

842
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,060
I finally meet a nice guy,

843
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,220
and he turns out to be a murderer.

844
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,460
Happens to Tony all the time.

845
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,100
Hey, do me a favor, Kate.

846
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,900
What?

847
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
My back is killing me.

848
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,020
I'm waiting.

849
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,860
And don't shortchange me this time.

850
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
You know, your muscles
wouldn't be so tight

851
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,380
if you'd stop drinking
all that caffeine crap

852
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,660
that Gibbs is always bringing you.

853
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,460
Oh, but I love the caffeine crap, Kate.

854
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,020
Abby!

855
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,060
Need you out here.

856
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,620
Now!

857
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,620
How much time did you
spend on this door?

858
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,660
Um, enough to get the
bullet's trajectory.

859
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
I was going to test for metal
fatigue and age in the morning.

860
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,420
Do it tonight.

861
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,220
Why?

862
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,860
I mean, I'll have it for
you in 30 minutes, sir.

863
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,540
Kate'll help.

864
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,900
Well, looks like you
did it again, Mr. Cooper.

865
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,420
I'm getting old, kid.

866
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,900
Think I'm going to
retire after this one.

867
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,180
You ask me, we should
get 50% of that million.

868
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,220
Too bad life ain't fair, DiNozzo.

869
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,780
Oh, it's about time.

870
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,660
In my day, we didn't wait

871
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,940
two hours to interrogate someone.

872
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,140
Let me guess you just
beat it out of 'em?

873
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:08,940
Yeah, something like that.

874
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,860
I'm sure you hear this a lot.

875
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,340
I'm innocent, Agent Gibbs.

876
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,900
I know.

877
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,700
What the hell kind of
interrogation is that?

878
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,740
You're free to go, Mr. McAllister.

879
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,820
It's not enough I do your job for you?

880
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,340
Now you want to arrest me for it?

881
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,180
Ah, we do owe you for finding
the lieutenant for us, Cooper.

882
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,780
The problem is...

883
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,620
it isn't murder.

884
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,860
Oh, give me a break, Gibbs.

885
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,940
You saw the evidence.

886
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:46,860
I did.

887
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,580
Brian McAllister died in a car accident.

888
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,580
The bullet fired into his
car wasn't from two years ago.

889
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,180
The metal around the impact was
only recently exposed to water.

890
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,220
Two weeks sound about right to you?

891
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,620
What's this got to do with me?

892
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,260
The reward was offered for
finding the lieutenant's killer.

893
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,460
In order to collect, you
had to manufacture one.

894
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,580
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

895
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,620
Oh, it might've worked.

896
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,220
I mean, we would've
found that gun eventually,

897
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,620
but you just couldn't wait.

898
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,060
What were you going to
do with the money, Cooper?

899
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,500
Hmm? Gambling debts?

900
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,460
Retirement?

901
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,060
Taking those shots at Saleena
Lockhart that was overkill.

902
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,940
Too bad we caught you putting it back.

903
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,220
Yeah?

904
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,500
Good luck proving it.

905
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,060
Oh, I will.

906
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,940
This is an Instant Shooter I.D. Kit.

907
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,460
It'll tell me if you
fired a gun recently.

908
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,420
Swab away, Gibbs.

909
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,740
There's no gun residue on these hands.

910
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,260
Aw, a private dick like you

911
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,460
I bet you were wearing rubber gloves.

912
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,460
I figure any man who solves the
unsolvable needs a trademark,

913
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,140
and I'm betting yours is
that tacky trench coat.

914
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,140
You probably never take it off, huh?

915
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,940
This comes up blue, I've
got you for attempted murder.

916
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,500
Good luck trying to collect
that million dollars.

917
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,100
Get up.

918
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,340
I don't believe it.

919
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,140
Sorry, probie.

920
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,500
I felt the same way when I found out

921
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,580
Professional wrestling was fake.

922
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,060
But he was going to frame

923
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,740
an innocent man just for the reward?

924
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,780
It's all about the Benjamins.

925
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,820
Sometimes.

926
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,260
Not always.

927
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
You up for that dessert now?

928
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,860
At 2:30 in the morning?

929
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,780
I think I might know a
place that's still open.

930
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,980
And where would that be?

931
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,060
New York.

932
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,060
Sometimes it's good to
own your own airline.

933
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,460
New York? I love New York.

934
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,020
It's a small plane, Tony.

935
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,180
Maybe next time.

936
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,420
So, you're Catholic, right?
