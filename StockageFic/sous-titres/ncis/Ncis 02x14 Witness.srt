1
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,780
Come on.

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
Yeah, 'cause I always get that confused.

3
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,560
No, no, it's simple.

4
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,680
If the groundhog sees his
shadow, six more weeks of winter.

5
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
If he doesn't, spring's
right around the corner.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,360
Are you sure that it's
not the other way around.

7
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,120
See you later.

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,480
Thanks.

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,080
All right-
Thursday, 11:00 a.m.

11
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Sharp.

12
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
I'll be there.

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
You'll make it this time?

14
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,360
Huh... I promise.

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,400
See you then.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,720
You okay?

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,120
Yeah.

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,480
No.

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
I hate going to the dentist.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,400
I've had a phobia since I was a child

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
and now I need a root canal.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Mm... That doesn't sound like fun.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
No, I've canceled my
appointment three times.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,440
What's not fun?

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,680
Nothing.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Who's Dr. Jackson?

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,880
You read that upside down?

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
A talent that serves me
well. What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
Uh... he-he's a dentist.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Ooh, and our Ms. Todd
is afraid of dentists.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,085
Who told you that?

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
Ethically, I can't reveal my source.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,240
It's the same person who told me probie
wasn't potty-trained till he was six.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,280
Get the sedan, McGee.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Uh, where we going, boss?

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
Not we... You.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Apartment building in Georgetown.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,080
A woman reported seeing
a sailor being strangled.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,045
Me, uh, alone?

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Metro police don't think it's
anything, but the woman's insistent.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,360
Um, what do you want me to do?

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
Investigate, McGee. It's what we do.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,760
If there's anything, call in.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,320
Right.

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,720
Our little boy's growing up.

46
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:03,760
Cut it out, DiNozzo.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,160
It's a vote of confidence.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
Really?

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,960
You think so?

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,600
It's a test.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Don't listen to him.

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
Excuse me, sir.

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah?

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,160
NCIS.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Special Agent McGee.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
So you're what they sent me.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,800
Geez, I'm feelin' old.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,640
NCIS is here.

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Say good-bye to the little lady.

60
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:43,680
Copy that.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
Uh, so, uh... what have you got?

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
There's no need to write it down, kid.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,520
Woman up there says that she saw a
sailor being strangled across the way.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Never happened.

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,200
You checked it out?

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Yeah, the apartment manager let us in.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
No sign of struggle,
nobody was even there.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,485
No forcible entry.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Neighbors didn't see or hear anything.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,160
So why did you call us?

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,760
She wouldn't let it go.

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,880
I think she was up a
little bit too late.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
Had a little too much
to drink, you know?

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
Look, I got some other
real cases to investigate.

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,500
Her name is Erin
Kendall. Apartment 2-B.

76
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,840
Make sure you ask her
to show you the video.

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,360
Hi.

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,880
Hi.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
Uh, you're the cop from NCIS?

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
Special Agent McGee.

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
Come on in. Maybe I can
get somewhere with you.

82
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,605
Well, by the time I started
to record, they were gone.

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,960
And, yes, I'd had a few glasses of
wine, but I saw a sailor being strangled.

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,605
You're sure it was a sailor?

85
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,960
Yes, he was wearing
his service dress blues.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,600
I work for DOD. I
know military uniforms.

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Infinite-Dimensional Homological
Algebra for Binary Systems.

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
You read this?

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh, yeah. I had the author,
Sidnitski, in graduate school.

90
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
You went to MIT?

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes.

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
Me, too.

93
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,080
The root canal?

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
I have an appointment with
the dentist in the morning.

95
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
You gonna keep it this time?

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I can help you.

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
I have a friend who
had a fear of flying.

98
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,440
He was cured by a hypnotist.

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
A hypnotist. I don't think so.

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah, Gibbs.

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,520
Boss, it's McGee.

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,800
Yeah?

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
I think there may be something here.

104
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
You think?

105
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Well, uh...

106
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,320
Do we roll or not, McGee?

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
Roll, boss.

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,840
DiNozzo. Get the truck

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,240
Ah, is that the witness?

110
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,080
Yeah, Tony.

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Crime scene?

112
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,720
Uh, second floor of this
apartment building here.

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,120
Occupant is a civilian
named Thorne. Robert J.

114
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,480
He's not at home.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Let's check it out.

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,960
I hope you have more to
go on than her sweet smile.

117
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
The police already checked this out.

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,600
Thorne's one of my best tenants.
I don't want to lose him.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,560
This gonna take you guys long?

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
I got a meeting with my
doctoral committee, here.

121
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:14,000
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Thorne?

122
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,885
I don't know.

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,040
About a week ago? He travels a lot.

124
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,840
We can let ourselves out.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,480
You made the call.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
What were you basing your decision on?

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,320
The credibility of the witness.

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,600
MIT graduate. Phi Beta Kappa.
Builds computer models for DOD.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,560
We've all seen the credentials.

130
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:36,520
That's it?

131
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
No, no, uh,

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,840
to get a closer look at the assault, Erin
used a camcorder with a 200-to-one zoom lens.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
Let's see the video.

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Well, she didn't actually, uh, start recording
until after the men had moved away from the window,

135
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,840
but it does show that the lights were on.
When the Metro Police got here, they were off.

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,000
That would do it for me.

137
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,440
Boss, the truth?

138
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,680
That would be good.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,280
If there's one thing I've learned from you, it's
that sometimes an agent has to go with their gut.

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,920
Okay.

141
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
What would you do now, McGee?

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll dust for prints.

143
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,520
I'll shoot.

144
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
We're not going to spend
a lot of time on this.

145
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,940
I can't work like this,
McGee. Get off my back.

146
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,380
Sorry.

147
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,660
It's just, everything is riding on you finding
something that places a sailor in that apartment.

148
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,340
I wish I were a magician.

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,500
DiNozzo says the boss is testing me.

150
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,300
DiNozzo says a lot of things.

151
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,620
Actually, this time he's probably right.

152
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,820
Gibbs tested me.

153
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,820
Really?

154
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,900
Yeah.

155
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,380
What happened?

156
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,660
Nothing. I passed.

157
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,660
Your problem is, the crime scene - if it
really is a crime scene - is too clean.

158
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,700
It didn't produce any quality prints.

159
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,460
Abby, it is a crime scene.

160
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,740
Then it is.

161
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,580
Now get out of here and
let me finish my work.

162
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,823
Thank you, Abs.

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,780
Photos from the scene of the crime.

164
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,860
Annual performance
reviews are next week.

165
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,940
Two sailors in the National Capital
Region were reported UA today.

166
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,740
One female.

167
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm getting the
particulars on the other.

168
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,780
McGee.

169
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
Good news, I think.

170
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,140
Did you get a match?

171
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,380
Put her on the speaker.

172
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,100
I ran the only clean print
from the apartment through AFIS.

173
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,420
It belongs to Petty Officer
First Class Keith Dillon, USN.

174
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,780
He your missing sailor, Kate?

175
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,180
Dillon comma Keith.

176
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,180
Sure is.

177
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,940
Boss...

178
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,660
boss, Erin was right.

179
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,980
What does that mean, McGee?

180
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,740
Well, she wasn't imagining it.

181
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
It also means a sailor may be dead.

182
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,160
Keith Dillon, 32, single, never married.

183
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,160
Lives in Anacostia.
Assigned to Pax River.

184
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
What's he do?

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Motor pool. Driver.

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
I talked to Dillon's
CO. He's still a no-show.

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
We're going back to Thorne's apartment.

188
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,040
I'll get the truck.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
You did want me to get the truck, yes?

190
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm going to enjoy this.

191
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,200
The attacker's back was
to me most of the time.

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,160
Like this?

193
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah, and then he pulled the
sailor off, to your right.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Gosh, I can't tell you how may
times I've thought of doing this.

195
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,720
I dare you, DiNozzo.

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh, yeah?

197
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
DiNozzo!

198
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
That's just what it looked like.

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,400
There are so many things
I could say right now.

200
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,560
Probie.

201
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
Get the ALS up here.

202
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,720
Yeah, it's urine.

203
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Boss...

204
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
Tenant does not appear to have a pet.

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,680
Have Abby do a DNA analysis.

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,280
In the meantime, we go over
this place, top to bottom.

207
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll get the equipment.

208
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Excuse me.

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,045
I want all the information you
have on your tenant, Thorne.

210
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Contact numbers, place of employment,
apartment lease, everything.

211
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
Gone. I'm just the manager. I call
a plumber when the toilet backs up.

212
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,840
The building's owned by Hawley Street
Holding in Boston. They got all that.

213
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Get it for me.

214
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,840
Did you find anything?

215
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
Urine. On the carpet.

216
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Urine?!

217
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,040
Evacuation. When somebody dies,
their sphincter and bladder relax.

218
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,560
Probably more than she
wants to know, McGee.

219
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,520
Special Agent Gibbs believe me now?

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,880
More than he did before.

221
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
McGee!

222
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,680
I'll... I'll... let you
know what's going on, okay?

223
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:49,560
Okay.

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,840
Clear.

225
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Boss, I already vacuumed
the couch for fibers.

226
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
It's a convertible sofa, McGee.

227
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
Slept on one for seven months.

228
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
That would be after the third wife?

229
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,040
That would be none of my business.

230
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
The missing Mr. Thorne
is even more mysterious.

231
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,560
And dangerous.

232
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,880
What do you think was in there?

233
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,360
Drugs?

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh, um, Hawley Street Holding faxed over a copy
of Thorne's lease agreement and rental application.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,200
You're gonna need Thorne's permission
if you want to remove property.

236
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,640
When he shows up, tell him to call me.

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,080
Well, I'm gonna need a receipt.

238
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
You can handle something that big?

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
You'd be surprised at what I can handle.

240
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Really!

241
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
Now, you think I could
drive a truck like this?

242
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Not much I can tell you.

243
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Petty Officer Dillon did
his job and that's about it.

244
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,960
Didn't hang around. Didn't socialize.

245
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,040
He ever been late before?

246
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,600
No, this is a first.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,320
I waited till noon to report him UA.

248
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,680
He ever mention a man named Thorne?

249
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,480
Not that I remember.

250
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
What's happened? Dillon's only been UA
a couple hours, and NCIS is involved?

251
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,640
According to his service records, Petty
Officer Dillon washed out of SEAL training.

252
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
Yeah, I heard he rang the bell.

253
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,240
Agent Gibbs, I'm his CO. I
want to know what's going on.

254
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
We have a report of a
sailor being straled.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,480
And you think it was
Petty Officer Dillon?

256
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,960
We found his prints at the scene.

257
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
No body. That's all I can tell you.

258
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Hey! DiNozzo!

259
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
I gotta go. Check you later.

260
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,600
You'll find me.

261
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Get her number?

262
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,960
I wasn't hitting on her, and
neither was Petty Officer Dillon.

263
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,880
She was interested in him,
but uh, he has a girlfriend.

264
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Did you get her name?

265
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Meg. Fits a hot chick like that.

266
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,520
You meant Dillon's girlfriend.

267
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,420
Check out his place in Anacostia.

268
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,240
I enjoy going to the dentist.

269
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
What could you possibly enjoy?

270
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
A little pain is a good thing, Kate.

271
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,280
That's why people put
hot sauce on tacos.

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,040
What'd the urine tell you, Abby?

273
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,280
Oh, all kinds of stuff.
We had a really good talk.

274
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
I was able to extract epithelial cells.

275
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,880
It's human urine, Boss.

276
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,280
What else?

277
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,160
No recreational drugs. Not diabetic.

278
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,280
Male or female?

279
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,040
Wasn't pregnant.

280
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:13,880
DNA?

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
You're never satisfied, are you?

282
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm working on it and the
ballistics from Thorne's gun.

283
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,320
But I found something interesting in the
mattress cutout- Do you wanna come see?

284
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,200
I'll be down in a minute.

285
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,160
Okay.

286
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,680
I need an assistant.

287
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
It's not in the budget.

288
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,640
The name Robert J.
Thorne has to be an alias.

289
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,160
Nothing on his apartment
rental application checks out.

290
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,400
His driver's license, social,
references are all phony.

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
He lists his occupation as a "sales
representative" but the company doesn't exist.

292
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,800
The owners of the building
didn't verify anything?

293
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,280
He paid the first month, last month,
and every payment since in cash.

294
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,160
Apparently, dead presidents are
the only reference they needed.

295
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,360
Ran the serial number on
Thorne's Sig by the manufacturer.

296
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
It was sold, 15 months
ago, to a Virginia dealer.

297
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
He works gun shows.
Trying to track him down.

298
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
What'd you find?

299
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,120
Couldn't tell when Petty Officer
Dillon was last in his apartment.

300
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,320
The bed wasn't made, but from the
looks of the place, it never is.

301
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,440
What about the girlfriend?

302
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,200
Ah. Indications are they're in
the not-ready-to-commit stage.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
Indications...?

304
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Yeah, she keeps her cosmetics and
her toothbrush there, but no clothes.

305
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,400
And they are intimate...
but not at the moment

306
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay, now how would you know that?

307
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,680
Gyne-Lotrimin.

308
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,080
Jill Meyers has a yeast infection.

309
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm gonna call the pharmacy
and get her address.

310
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,680
You may not admire his methods,
but you gotta love the results.

311
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm with Abby.

312
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,280
Uh, boss, can I come?

313
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,080
Come on.

314
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,240
What do you got, Abbs?

315
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,840
Do I have to answer the newbie?

316
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,760
Humor him.

317
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,240
There were traces of
cocaine found inside the box.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,840
So, Tony was right.
He was dealing drugs.

319
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,400
Maybe not. The traces were microscopic.

320
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
So it could just be from hiding money.

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,360
He calls himself a federal agent.

322
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,720
The U.S. money supply is
contaminated with traces of cocaine.

323
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,320
I thought that was an urban myth.

324
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,440
Give me a bill.

325
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,640
Huh?

326
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,680
Give me a bill.

327
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,320
A hundred?

328
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,560
Yeah. I like... like to be
prepared, for any emergency.

329
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,880
You're such a Boy Scout.

330
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,360
Money is a great receptor.

331
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Because the ink never really dries.

332
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,600
One bill used to snort cocaine,
and then going through an ATM

333
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,240
leaves minute traces of the
drug on thousands of others.

334
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,120
Four out of five bills in circulation are contaminated
to a level that can be detected by drug dogs.

335
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,320
Um, Abs?

336
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,880
Yeah?

337
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,080
Forgetting something?

338
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,880
No.

339
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
Hey, McGee!

340
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,440
One sec.

341
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Special Agent McGee.

342
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
Hey, kid. This is Detective Floyd.

343
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,440
We found something you
might be interested in.

344
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
Step out of there.

345
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
I knew Erin saw what she saw.

346
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
That feeling in my gut...

347
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,720
...was right.

348
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
That feeling you experienced
was lower than your gut, probie.

349
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,920
Whew! All right, Ducky, you're up.

350
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,920
Thanks, Caitlin.

351
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,440
I'd have to be really desperate
to use one of these things.

352
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah. Wretched, aren't they?

353
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,480
Looks like your missing sailor
was dumped here over the weekend.

354
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,280
His watch and his wallet are missing.

355
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,800
Killer didn't know he was seen strangling Petty
Officer Dillon. He made it look like a mugging.

356
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,920
Makes sense.

357
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,400
Any luck tracking Thorne down?

358
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,960
Name's an alias.

359
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
The kid's got good instincts, you know.

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,920
Yeah, you think so, huh?

361
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,680
McGee

362
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah!

363
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,920
You leave my coffee in the truck?

364
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,720
Oh, uh, I'm getting it now, boss.

365
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
Keep me posted.

366
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,760
Duck?

367
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
Well, based on lividity and blood-pooling
the body was most definitely moved.

368
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:27,920
The ligature marks indicate
strangulation as the cause of death.

369
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,160
These parallel lines
suggest an electrical cord.

370
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,760
Time of death...

371
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
...12 to 14 hours ago.

372
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,360
That would confirm the witness' story.

373
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,360
Yeah.

374
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
Bag his head and hands, Mr. Palmer.

375
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,440
Hey, you want to help me with the grid?

376
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,680
Give me the hypnotist's number.

377
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,360
Here you go, boss.

378
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
What's next?

379
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,840
What?

380
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
How do we proceed, McGee?

381
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,720
Right.

382
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,880
Well, uh, we've got to
figure out who Thorne is

383
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
and find the connection between
him and Petty Officer Dillon.

384
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,840
Probably the money.

385
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,360
And I think it would be a smart move
to keep an eye on Thorne's apartment.

386
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
If he doesn't know we're
on to him, he'll be back.

387
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,040
What else?

388
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,680
I think Erinand the building manager
should work on a composite sketch.

389
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
Am I forgetting anything?

390
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
Just to keep my coffee hot, McGee.

391
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Would you bring me an evidence
vial, please, Mr. Palmer?

392
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,120
This fiber appears synthetic.

393
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,160
Most likely the petty officer didn't
pick it up from the portable loo.

394
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,320
You know, making your
death appear a robbery

395
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,480
was a very amateurish
attempt at a red herring.

396
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,880
I've always found that a
very curious expression.

397
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,160
Yes, it is, isn't it?

398
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,680
You know the derivation? Fox and hounds.

399
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:09,000
How's that, Dr. Mallard?

400
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,640
Well, the only practical way to cure
a herring is by smoking and salting

401
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Yes, it turns the fish a crimson red
and gives it a very distinctive smell.

402
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,840
In the early 15th century, they used
to train their hounds to hunt foxes

403
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,640
by dragging a red herring along
the ground on a piece of string

404
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,320
to leave a trail of scent
for the dogs to follow.

405
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,960
Then, later on, they would drag a red
herring across the scent trail of a real fox

406
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,360
to test the dog's ability to
ignore a false scent or false clue.

407
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,280
Hence the term "red herring" became to mean
"a false clue designed to fool one's opponent."

408
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
That's fascinating.

409
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,680
Yeah.

410
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you.

411
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you know the etymology of
the phrase "white elephant"?

412
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:02,400
I should really get this up to Abby...

413
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
Because of its rarity, the King of
Siam declared all white elephants

414
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
his personal property.

415
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,720
How's that?

416
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,040
Yes. Excellent.

417
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
This is as far as you've gotten?

418
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,360
Uh, yeah, that's as far
as we're going to get.

419
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm sorry. I just can't
remember what he looks like.

420
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,800
Show her the composite the manager did.

421
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,720
I did. It's a waste of time.
It could've been anyone.

422
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,200
Let me try something.

423
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,960
Okay.

424
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,160
What are you doing?

425
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,520
Erin is incredible.

426
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,400
She has rewritten the software code to the
MAU program to incorporate hyper-threading.

427
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,240
But I thought you were
working on the composite.

428
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
It's not going to happen.

429
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
Erin, any idea on how to
over-clock the processors?

430
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,400
Yeah, um, you got two options.
Changing either the FSB

431
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,240
or the multiplier locks.

432
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,440
Oh. A gift from Dr. Mallard.

433
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,680
There it is.

434
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,720
That's amazing.

435
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Jill Meyers?

436
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,600
NCIS.Special Agent Todd, DiNozzo.

437
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,160
We'd like to talk to you about
a Petty Officer Keith Dillon.

438
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,520
When's the last time you saw him?

439
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
A couple days ago.

440
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,520
So how did you find
out that I know Keith?

441
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,640
Did he... he tell you?

442
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,200
Petty Officer Dillon has been murdered.

443
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,920
What?

444
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,080
What happened?

445
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

446
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,840
How long have you and Petty Officer
Dillon been seeing each other?

447
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,040
Keith came in a couple months ago.

448
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,160
So he's dead?

449
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,640
Yeah.

450
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,440
You're married.

451
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,000
Uh, yeah.

452
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,960
Your husband know about Keith?

453
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,440
Uh-uh.

454
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,160
He's, uh, he's in Iraq.
Been there eight months.

455
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,800
Any way he could've found out?

456
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,280
Uh-uh.

457
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,240
re things getting serious with Keith?

458
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,280
I was going to send
my husband an e-mail...

459
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,840
breaking up.

460
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,880
Good thing I didn't.

461
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,240
Keith wanted me to quit my job

462
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and move in with him.

463
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,520
He was going to support you?

464
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah.

465
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,840
He was coming into a lot of money.

466
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,000
Guess I'm stuck here, now.

467
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,440
Keith ever talk about a
guy named Robert Thorne?

468
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,600
Keith didn't talk about anything.

469
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,680
Our relationship was more, mm...
physical than anything else.

470
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I do know he was pissed. He
didn't make it as a Navy SEAL.

471
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,360
Anything else?

472
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Mm... My husband doesn't need
to find out about Keith, right?

473
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
A "Dear John" by e-mail?!

474
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,440
What a calculating witch. She
gives all women a bad name.

475
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:28,120
I'm never getting married.
There's no upside to it.

476
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,520
That's not true. Statistically,
married men live longer.

477
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,720
They don't actually live
longer - it just seems longer.

478
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
You're so cynical.

479
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,640
Am I? Marriage was never intended
to last more than a few years.

480
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,240
Where did you get that?

481
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,440
Anthropology 101.

482
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,720
The concept was invented by cavemen
with a life expectancy of 25 years.

483
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,560
"Till death do us part" meant
four or five years, tops.

484
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
That was very enlightening, DiNozzo.

485
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,200
And I do understand now.

486
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,040
You think like a Neanderthal.

487
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,120
Hey!

488
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,280
Geez!

489
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,600
Don't mess with my music.

490
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:12,560
How do you work with that?

491
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
It helps me to concentrate.

492
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,200
On what?

493
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Fibers that Ducky found on Dillon.

494
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,400
Definitely from the
trunk lining of a car.

495
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm going to run them through the FBI's MAU database
and try to narrow it down to make, model and year.

496
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:27,720
Thorne's original Virginia
gun-purchase application for his Sig.

497
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
See if you can lift a print off it.

498
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,880
As soon as I am finished with this.

499
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,040
No, Abby,

500
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,800
do it now.

501
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,440
I have a dentist
appointment tomorrow morning.

502
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,760
You see the hypnotist?

503
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,440
You weren't going to tell me.

504
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,600
I don't like crutches.

505
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,280
I hope you never break a leg.

506
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
Who's sitting Thorne's apartment?

507
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,480
Special Agent Balboa. I'm
on my way to relieve him.

508
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:57,640
Did you find the girlfriend?

509
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
She's a piece of work,
but we did find...

510
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,480
It's all about the money, boss.

511
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,400
Petty Officer Dillon told his
girlfriend he was gonna be rich.

512
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,640
A career E-6? It wasn't
coming from the Navy.

513
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,960
We figure Thorne killed
him for the money.

514
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,880
You think?

515
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,680
What are you thinking?

516
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Where's the money?

517
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,040
Thorne took it.

518
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Why'd he leave his weapon?

519
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
He's coming back.

520
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,040
Well, I am fascinated.

521
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
You have multiple degrees,

522
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,040
including computer science from MIT.

523
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,000
How did you end up a federal agent?

524
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,280
It was, uh, by design.

525
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,040
I always wanted to
be in law enforcement.

526
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,920
I never thought I'd be talking like
this with someone who carries a gun.

527
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,160
Erin?

528
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,420
Hold on.

529
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:55,280
What is it?

530
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,840
I'll be right back.

531
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:01,760
Okay.

532
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,040
There's... somebody's trying
to break into my apartment.

533
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I'll be right there.

534
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Don't hang up. I'm coming.

535
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,280
The boy witnessed the murder?

536
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,280
He was staked-out in
Thorne's apartment.

537
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,040
Could he peek the
killer out of a line-up?

538
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:31,800
You have a suspect?

539
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,040
No.

540
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,520
But if I did, I'd like
to find out if your boy...

541
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:36,600
His name is Special Agent McGee.

542
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,000
If Special Agent McGee

543
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,760
could make a positive I.D.

544
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,320
Get a suspect and we'll find out.

545
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
I'll secure the crime scene.

546
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,200
My M.E. will be here in about ten min...

547
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,040
She was my witness.

548
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
This is still my case.

549
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,160
A civilian kills another civilian?

550
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,080
I do not think so.

551
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,840
Nobody gets in here
but our forensic team.

552
00:30:58,875 --> 00:30:59,520
Mm-hmm. Right.

553
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,400
Hey.

554
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
I should have been watching
from Erin's apartment.

555
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,920
No. You were exactly where
you were supposed to be, McGee.

556
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,920
I saw Erin lying there,

557
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,480
and I rushed in without
clearing the room.

558
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,000
He hit me from behind with something.

559
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,160
A lamp.

560
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,360
I should have got him.

561
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,720
You tried.

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,960
I tried to save Erin, and I
didn't. I tried to shoot her killer,

563
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,520
and I missed.

564
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Her death is not your fault, Tim.

565
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,880
All I can see is Erin
lying on the floor.

566
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,000
A shot woke me up,

567
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,680
and...

568
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,560
I looked out the window, and I saw a
guy in a dark jumpsuit running towards...

569
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,360
uh, "S" Street.

570
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,360
I'll take over here.

571
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,680
So, what happened?

572
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,725
What?

573
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,160
I got a match on the slug that I fired
from the gun found in Thorne's apartment.

574
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,640
Yeah...?

575
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,720
I ran it through ATF. It was
used in two unsolved murders.

576
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
What's up, boss?

577
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,000
Cancel Ducky.

578
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,960
Let's get out of here.

579
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,560
Bowers.

580
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,360
B- O-W-E-R-S.

581
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
Can you fax me a copy of the files?

582
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,040
Great.

583
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,880
Thanks, Lieutenant.

584
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,920
Some advice.

585
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,480
You can sit there and second-guess
what you should or shouldn't have done

586
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,720
and never get the answer.

587
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,920
Or you can get back on the
job and catch the bastard.

588
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,720
The Sig in Thorne's sofa bed was used to murder
a Carole Anne VanBuren in suburban Raleigh

589
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
and a Thomas Roy Bowers in Baltimore.

590
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,880
Any tie between them?

591
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,120
Just the Sig.

592
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,600
VanBuren was involved in a messy divorce.
Husband's a lot richer with her dead.

593
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,000
Bowers was a tough union
steward leading a long strike.

594
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,685
Both hits?

595
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,800
Sounds like it.

596
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,920
Have the local LEOs in
Raleigh and Baltimore...

597
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:40,120
Fax the files? Already did, boss.

598
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,440
How was the root canal?

599
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,920
Nothing to it.

600
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Thanks to...?

601
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:47,880
You, Tony.

602
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,480
I have to give you credit,

603
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
the hypnotist really worked.

604
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,600
Thank you.

605
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,720
You know, Gibbs, this hypnotist
consults with police departments

606
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
on cases of repressed memory.

607
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,880
She might be able to
help McGee recall details.

608
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Yeah?

609
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,360
Why don't we just use a Ouija board?

610
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,840
Hypnotism isn't a parlor game, Gibbs.

611
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
Could have fooled me.

612
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Can we at least try?

613
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,600
No.

614
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,800
Ah, hell, why not?

615
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,080
Boss...

616
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,840
I don't think I can be hypnotized.

617
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,760
He's ready.

618
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,680
Now, traumatic memories are permanent.

619
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,040
The biggest barrier to
recalling them is stress.

620
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,720
Well, McGee was certainly under
a lot of stress last night.

621
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,360
Probie's always under stress, Kate.

622
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,080
Well, with hypnosis, we bypass the stress, go
into the subconscious, where the memories are.

623
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,560
Being here, where the
incident occurred, will help.

624
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,680
So does a good whack to the head.

625
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,920
May I continue, Agent Gibbs?

626
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
Agent McGee,

627
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,600
when I touch your forehead, you will
open your eyes and remain fully relaxed.

628
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,960
It'll be last night, when you were
talking to Erin on your cell phone.

629
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,120
You will see and hear
everything clearly.

630
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,240
What is it?

631
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,760
What's happening?

632
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,000
She's heard a sound.

633
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,520
She's scared.

634
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,960
What is she saying?

635
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,480
She's talking low.

636
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Sounds frightened.

637
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
Her exact words.

638
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
"Someone's trying to
break into my apartment."

639
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,920
What did you do?

640
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,640
Went to the window.

641
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,960
Do it.

642
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,400
What do you see?

643
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,560
Erin's being assaulted.

644
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,680
I have to help her.

645
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,560
Just stay with this feeling.

646
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,720
Now, you're looking
at the attacker's face.

647
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,880
Describe it.

648
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I can't see it.

649
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,160
How is he dressed?

650
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,280
Jumpsuit.

651
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,960
Hooded jacket.

652
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,920
What else can you see?

653
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
His hands...

654
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,920
putting something around her throat.

655
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,640
Gibbs.

656
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,280
Hold on.

657
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,960
A watch.

658
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,960
Describe the watch.

659
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,120
Large.

660
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,520
It's on his right wrist.

661
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,120
I've got to help her!

662
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,320
It's all right. You're
going to sit down.

663
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
When I touch your forehead,

664
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
you will be fully aware.

665
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
Your memory sharp and clear.

666
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
Yeah, go ahead.

667
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,760
I don't know what you're doing, but it
can't be more important that what I've got.

668
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,040
Eh, just say it, will you, Abbs?

669
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
You asked, I lifted.

670
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:14,165
It wasn't easy,

671
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,520
but got a partial off
Thorne's gun application.

672
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
You ran it through AFIS?

673
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:18,840
I didn't have to.

674
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Why not?

675
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,200
Because I already know everything
that you need to know about him.

676
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,760
The fingerprint belongs to Dillon...

677
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,280
Good work, Abbs.

678
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,360
Can you give us a minute, please?

679
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,600
Sure. No problem.

680
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,760
Abby found Thorne.

681
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,960
Where?

682
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,320
In Ducky's cold storage vault.

683
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,080
He's dead?

684
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,200
I don't, I don't understand.

685
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,200
Abby matched a print taken from Dillon's corpse
to one taken from Thorne's gun application.

686
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,360
Petty Officer Dillon and
Thorne are the same guy.

687
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,805
Dillon was the hit man?

688
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,800
Probably used the name Thorne

689
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,600
when he was hired to
kill those two people.

690
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,320
A macho, washed-out SEAL,

691
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,125
trying to prove his worth.

692
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,080
Creates a fictitious persona, Thorne,

693
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,880
to freelance as a killer.

694
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,800
If there's no Thorne,

695
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
who murdered Erin and Dillon?

696
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,240
Whoever stole the money from the sofa.

697
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,080
Boss...

698
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
the killer was wearing

699
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,960
his watch on his right wrist.

700
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,440
Hey, what's going on?

701
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Hey, you guys find Thorne?

702
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,440
Yeah.

703
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,400
We found him.

704
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,120
You bastard. You wear your
watch on your right hand.

705
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,240
A lot of people do.

706
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,080
You have a keys to Thorne's apartment.

707
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm the manager. I got
keys to all the apartments.

708
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,200
Detective Floyd tell you that the young
woman across the street witnessed the murder

709
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,960
in Thorne's apartment?

710
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,400
We're gonna match the fibers found on
Dillon's body to the trunk fibers in your car.

711
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,560
What do you think about that?

712
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
No, no, no, don't, don't! Don't, don't!

713
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,600
McGee!

714
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,680
If you're gonna shoot him, you
should've done it while he was running.

715
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,320
Turn over.

716
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,720
You are so...

717
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,720
Coordinated?

718
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,000
Adolescent.

719
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,680
I prefer the term "fun-loving."

720
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,080
Food fight!

721
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
Guys.

722
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,000
Guys! Guys!

723
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,560
Please, I'm trying to write.

724
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,880
Sorry, McGee.

725
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,400
Need any help?

726
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
No, thank you. Just some quiet.

727
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,240
No problema.

728
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,640
Remember your fir...

729
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,920
Remember your first report, Kate?

730
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
Yes. Gibbs made me rewrite it. Twice.

731
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,960
Felt like I was in grammar school again.

732
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,600
Are you going to pick
up those carrot sticks?

733
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,240
I didn't throw any carrot sticks.

734
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,680
I can't stand working in a pig sty.

735
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,840
He only made you redo it twice?

736
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,560
I forgot to spell-check.

737
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,800
How many times, Tony?

738
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,440
Can I catch a peanut in
my mouth without missing?

739
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,440
Ha. Did you have to redo
your first report for Gibbs?

740
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,165
A few.

741
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,960
What's a few?

742
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,360
Five. Would have been more,

743
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:18,920
but I took pity on him.

744
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,640
McGee.

745
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Good job.

746
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,200
Send it up to the director.

747
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,360
Will do, boss.

748
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,200
Any more food fights
in here, I'm joining in

749
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,760
with peas.

750
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,080
Frozen peas?

751
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,125
Nope.

752
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,800
In the can.

753
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,960
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Kendall."

754
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,640
It's a sympathy note.

755
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,880
That's nice, McGee.

756
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,840
It's very nice.
