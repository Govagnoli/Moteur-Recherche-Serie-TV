1
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,131
What an adorable child, Yoon.

2
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,885
She's like a little doll.

3
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,487
How come l have never met
this little munchkin before?

4
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:33,248
She usually stays with the sitter
while we go shopping.

5
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,404
She's such a cutie.

6
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,485
Well, we're running a little late today,
so if you'll excuse us.

7
00:00:38,653 --> 00:00:40,484
Oh, here, let me help you, dear.

8
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:42,765
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

9
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:48,242
l doubt they'll hear us.

10
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:50,483
They've been playing
that Chinese stuff all morning.

11
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,686
Actually, it's Korean.

12
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,286
Oh, right, sorry.

13
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:58,446
You know, Sun usually leaves
the back door open. Come on.

14
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,246
My aunt burned down
her house like this.

15
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,643
She really should be more careful.

16
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:20,568
Oh, now that's better.
l'm not usually one to complain.

17
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,723
l don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?

18
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,771
A seminar on the basics
of communication

19
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,447
- and understanding in the workplace.
- l know what sensitivity is.

20
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:25,685
l'm asking why we have to spend
the whole afternoon studying it.

21
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:26,968
Professional development?

22
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,330
lf it were survival training,
advanced demolitions, perhaps--

23
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,882
l don't think that Sympathetic
Seminars, lnc. offers those classes

24
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,170
Skilled investigators should already be
well-versed in the subtleties

25
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,211
- of inter-human communication.
- l like ltalian women.

26
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:42,922
You're ltalian, right?
l like lrish women, too.

27
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,723
- l stand corrected.
- You two better hurry up.

28
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:48,453
- You don't wanna miss out on the fun.
- Where are you going?

29
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,251
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.

30
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,803
You do understand the meaning
of the word ''mandatory,'' don't you?

31
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:58,883
l have been ordered to inspect
the secure-file room, probie.

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,011
Sadly, that conflicts
with your exciting seminar today.

33
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,448
No, it doesn't.
This order is for next Wednesday.

34
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:07,291
- What?
- Look on the bright side, Tony.

35
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,205
lt should only take
about five to seven hours.

36
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:12,485
There's gotta be some way out of this.
Maybe l could injure myself.

37
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,402
- What? l was only trying to help.
- l was only kidding.

38
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,051
Sensitivity training
is gonna have to wait.

39
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,692
We got a double homicide
at Quantico.

40
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:21,525
Marine wives. Grab your gear.

41
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,451
Yes.

42
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,012
- lnappropriate?
- A bit.

43
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,602
You're probably the reason
we have to take these classes.

44
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,843
- Today.
- On your six, boss.

45
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,084
You know, this kind of reminds me
of my cousin's house,

46
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:37,692
minus all the blood.

47
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,330
Unless you count
that Thanksgiving back in '98.

48
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,166
Family does have a way
of fraying one's nerves.

49
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,607
Take my mother, for instance.

50
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:49,527
She insists on watching <i>Jeopardy</i>
every night on the television.

51
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,206
What's wrong with that, Duck?

52
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,284
The same episode,
over and over again.

53
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:56,007
l made the mistake of taping it
for her once.

54
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,932
l always say, you can pick your nose,
but you can't pick your family.

55
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:02,732
There's a touch of the poet in you,
Mr. Palmer.

56
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:04,929
l'd say you're just more touched.

57
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:06,962
DiNozzo.

58
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,930
House belongs to
a Sergeant Malcolm Porter

59
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:12,005
and his wife, Sun, boss.
She's the one on the left.

60
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,482
Sergeant's still on liberty
trying to track him down.

61
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,052
The other vic is Min Crane.

62
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,130
She's married
to a Sergeant Floyd Crane,

63
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:21,205
currently deployed in lraq.

64
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,165
Sign of an unhappy marriage.

65
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:38,171
Funny, l thought it looked like
a hole in the wall.

66
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:40,892
lt's about fist size.

67
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,613
Husband probably hit the wall
instead of hitting his wife.

68
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:47,526
- What else do you see?
- Judging by the position of the body

69
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:50,526
- l'd say they were taken by surprise.
- Yeah? Why?

70
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,724
Body posture. They're too relaxed.

71
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,491
They didn't fight back.

72
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,042
That could also mean
they knew the identity of their attacker.

73
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,612
Search the rest of the house.

74
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:05,329
Little girl's becoming quite the crime
scene investigator, isn't she, boss?

75
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,372
l'll go help McGee
talk to the women who found them.

76
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,001
- You got a TOD yet, Duck?
- Very recent.

77
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:15,609
Both liver probes indicate
about two and a half hours ago.

78
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,689
Triple tap, all in the heart.

79
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:23,290
Yeah, but notice these burn marks
around the entry wounds

80
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,609
here and on this one.

81
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,522
So both of those, the weapon
was in direct contact with the body

82
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,412
- when fired.
- Two from across the room.

83
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,524
Then one each up close,
just to be sure.

84
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,126
l don't believe the term ''overkill''

85
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,563
would be inappropriate,
under these circumstances.

86
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,724
- Bullets didn't penetrate.
- Maybe they were small-calibre.

87
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,366
Did you find any casings?

88
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,051
The shooter policed his brass, Duck.

89
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,162
Policed, sir?

90
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,932
Yes, it's military terminology
for cleaning up after one's self.

91
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,442
We may be dealing
with a professional.

92
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:03,571
- Professional what?
- Killer, Mr. Palmer.

93
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:08,083
These poor women
weren't so much murdered

94
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:09,772
as executed.

95
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:19,245
She just needs her bottle.
l know l packed it.

96
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,211
Look, look, look. Your mom's
right there. She's right there.

97
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:25,529
Did you ever hold
a baby before, McGee?

98
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:28,682
- No.
- l didn't think so.

99
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,051
Boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.

100
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,568
She found the body along
with the next-door neighbours.

101
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:44,004
We were going into Koreatown,
shopping.

102
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,726
l'm the only one with a car.

103
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,766
Sun asked me
to come pick them up.

104
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,089
lf we'd been on time--

105
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,205
You need some help?

106
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,326
Any idea where Sun's husband is,
Mrs. Dawson?

107
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,082
No, he's never here
when we come over.

108
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:07,763
l don't think he likes Sun
having friends.

109
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,850
What makes you think that?

110
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:11,964
He's very controlling.

111
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:15,885
- Sergeant Porter abused her?
- Sun wouldn't admit it.

112
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,924
But we suspected.

113
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:19,890
He drinks.

114
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,244
Says mean things to her.

115
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:24,091
Wouldn't let her speak Korean
in the house.

116
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,443
We tried to reason with her but--

117
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:28,809
- She wouldn't leave him?
- She was ashamed.

118
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,732
lt's hard for a Korean woman
to ask for help.

119
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,888
- Find Porter.
- l'd start at the ''E'' Club.

120
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,964
- James.
- l'm Yoon's husband.

121
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,686
Listen, if you don't find Porter there,

122
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,731
you might wanna check some
of the bars outside the front gate.

123
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,332
l'm on it, boss.

124
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,725
Everything's gonna be okay now,
honey, okay?

125
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,366
Gibbs. A word, please?

126
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,723
l just talked to her a few hours ago.

127
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:57,409
Gun safe.
l found it in the master bedroom.

128
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,047
Open and empty
except for a handful of shells.

129
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,771
.40 calibre.

130
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,447
Thinking maybe
the husband did this, yes?

131
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,685
l guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo,
would be ''bastard.''

132
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,202
He was always borrowing
my husband's tools

133
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:15,046
and never returning them.
l should've known this would happen.

134
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,291
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite
for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.

135
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,327
All l'm saying is the two of them
had one hell of a marriage.

136
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,445
You wouldn't know it to look at her,
but Sun's got a set of lungs.

137
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:25,682
Or at least she did.

138
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,803
- So they fought a lot?
- Oh, hardly a night went by

139
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,806
you didn't hear all sorts of screaming
coming from this house.

140
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,925
- You ever think to make a complaint?
- l don't like to stick my nose in.

141
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,561
Good thing, too. lt could have been me
that got slaughtered.

142
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,768
On our way, McGee.

143
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,652
Sergeant Porter was spotted
30 minutes ago at the "E'' Club.

144
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,486
- McGee's almost there.
- Thanks.

145
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,883
Probie's not gonna make a move
on his own, is he, boss?

146
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,005
McGee can take care of himself,
DiNozzo.

147
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,045
You're on the hump.

148
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,003
- He's gone.
- Nice job, probie.

149
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,602
The bartender turned around,
Sgt. Porter wasn't there anymore.

150
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,207
- You let him get past you?
- lt was before l got here, Tony.

151
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,892
What's Sergeant Porter driving?

152
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,610
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A black 2004 Ford F-1 50, boss.

153
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,284
Hey, come on.

154
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,366
Boss, we got a weapon
in the front seat.

155
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,050
l think he's dead, boss.

156
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,487
NClS. Don't move.
Get your hands on the wheel.

157
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,411
l wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not DUl

158
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,524
if l don't have the key
in the ignition, look.

159
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,207
- What's he talking about?
- l think he thinks we're busting him

160
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,250
- for driving drunk.
- Well, you're not?

161
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:06,688
No.

162
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,605
- lt's for double homicide.
- McGee.

163
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,491
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

164
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,526
l knew he was alive.

165
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:17,445
Precision, Mr. Palmer.

166
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:20,525
lt's what separates the professional
from the dilettante.

167
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,930
Thank you, doctor.

168
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,772
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.

169
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,410
But not too little either.

170
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,805
All right, come on,
come on, come on.

171
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,207
Let's see. Yes, very good.

172
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,722
Not bad. Not bad at all.

173
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,406
Keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.

174
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,167
You never know
which element of the enigma,

175
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:46,724
however minuscule,
can lead you to the solution.

176
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:49,771
Palmer just got some of your elements
on his plastic thing.

177
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:54,005
- Occupational hazard, l'm afraid.
- What can you tell me, Duck?

178
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:56,687
Both women were shot
three times in the chest.

179
00:10:56,893 --> 00:11:01,171
lt's hard to say which of these six
was the fatal wound.

180
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,166
Suffice to say,
neither woman died of old age.

181
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,563
- Anything else?
- Yes. Mrs. Porter

182
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:10,643
has some swelling and fissures
on her fingers and knuckles.

183
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,925
- Defensive wounds.
- Possibly.

184
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,527
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.

185
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,888
There are also bruises on her wrists.

186
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,011
l'd say they were at least a week old.

187
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:22,847
She was abused?

188
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,926
Yeah.

189
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,605
- Thanks, Duck.
- You have the man in custody now?

190
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,967
Yeah.

191
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:35,091
There's no need
to be gentle with him, Jethro.

192
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,964
You missed a spot.

193
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,813
We're looking at
a Beretta Cougar 8040, Gibbs.

194
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,248
lt was registered
to Sergeant Porter in 2003

195
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,529
- and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
- Bullets?

196
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,287
Cross-point .40 calibre
Smith and Wesson.

197
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:54,643
Also called a "Short and Wimpy,''
although l do not know why.

198
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,804
They lack the power
of a 1 0-millimeter auto-load.

199
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,362
You don't need that stopping power
when you gun down housewives.

200
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,411
- What about gunshot residue?
- lnstant Shooter Kit came negative

201
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,768
- on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
- Could've worn gloves--

202
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,889
Or he could've changed clothes.
l'm way ahead of you.

203
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:10,045
That's why l'm doing a full analysis
on all of Porter's wardrobe.

204
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:12,249
''How long, Abby?''
Well, it's gonna take some time.

205
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,085
And since this stuff
doesn't smell very good

206
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,005
l don't think laundry was a priority.
''Abs.''

207
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,687
Two hours. Whenever l know
something, you'll know something.

208
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,128
''You got one. Anything else?''
Yes, as a matter of fact.

209
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,602
This is for you.

210
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:26,241
- Why?
- For getting me out

211
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,641
of sensitivity training.

212
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,373
We were about to do trust falls
and those guys in administration

213
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,886
have wandering hands.

214
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,283
''Just give me their names, Abs,
and l'll break them for you.''

215
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,092
l know you will, Gibbs.
And that is why l love you.

216
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,769
Boss, l'm sorry. l didn't see you.

217
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,651
What did l say
about apologising, McGee?

218
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,012
Sign of weakness.

219
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:55,726
So is barfing on your tie.

220
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,807
This isn't mine.

221
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,568
We've got Sergeant Porter
in interrogation.

222
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,042
l actually managed
to dodge most of it.

223
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,250
Good news is
that he is sober enough to talk now.

224
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,210
l got some on you, here,
let me get this.

225
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,567
- Don't.
- Sorry.

226
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,371
l mean, it won't happen again.

227
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,888
- Who's watching him?
- Tony and Ziva.

228
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,691
l was actually just gonna go
change my shirt.

229
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:19,321
No, you won't. You're gonna follow up
on other leads.

230
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:22,161
We found Sergeant Porter with the
murder weapon. What other leads?

231
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,972
A good investigator
doesn't sit back and wait.

232
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,283
You run down every angle,
every lead.

233
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,126
Assume everything you've been told
is a lie until it checks out.

234
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,842
Got it.

235
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,004
There's only one time
l want you to stop, McGee.

236
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:38,249
- When you tell me.
- When you're satisfied.

237
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,004
When you're satisfied.

238
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,367
Okay.

239
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,091
- Hey!
- Yeah?

240
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:49,130
Get me another cup of coffee.

241
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:56,326
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs will rip this guy apart.

242
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,043
l don't know if that's the right tactic
in this case, Tony.

243
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,403
What, are you an expert
on suspect interviews, now?

244
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,849
lnterviews, no.
lnterrogation techniques, yes.

245
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:07,243
Like hooking a car battery
up to a guy's privates?

246
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,689
l'm sure it's effective,
but judges tend to frown on it.

247
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:13,287
l've learned from Gibbs
that in certain cases

248
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,683
you can attract
far more bees with honey.

249
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,127
Flies.

250
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:22,606
- What do flies have to do with honey?
- Flies don't like vinegar.

251
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,046
Vinegar?

252
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,363
lt's complicated. Here he comes.

253
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,971
Here you go.

254
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,527
There.

255
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,603
You look like you could use it.

256
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,850
My wife's really dead, sir?

257
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:48,528
How?

258
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:50,763
Drink your coffee, sergeant.

259
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:54,285
When you're ready
we'll work our way up to it.

260
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:55,966
What's he doing?

261
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,202
Where's his strong-arming?
The intimidation?

262
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,409
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?

263
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,768
<i>Bad marriage, huh?</i>

264
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,250
lt's okay.

265
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,728
l've had a few myself.

266
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,770
lt wasn't perfect,

267
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,491
but l loved her, sir.

268
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,484
Problem was...

269
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:18,884
l don't think--

270
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,363
l don't think she ever loved me.

271
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,444
l'll bet she loved that paycheque,
though, right?

272
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,321
Yeah.

273
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,245
l should have known it.

274
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,245
Just look at me.

275
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,650
She was way out of my league,
you know?

276
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,849
She just married me
to get to the States.

277
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,252
lt happens.

278
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,085
Thing is...

279
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,370
l guess l always thought she
might change her mind, you know?

280
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:47,332
Then she started
sneaking out to the "O'' Club,

281
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,491
hanging out with officers.

282
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:51,803
l've seen it before.

283
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,167
She thought she could trade up.

284
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,164
She didn't want me.

285
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,085
No matter what l did.

286
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,369
lt just got to the point--

287
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:05,444
l just wanted her to disappear.

288
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,763
Yeah, when you get pushed,
you want to push back.

289
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,485
That why you decide
to blow her away?

290
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,365
Excuse me, sir?

291
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:19,492
ls that the reason you shot Min Crane
and your wife to death today?

292
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,566
Okay, here we go.

293
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,768
He hasn't confessed yet.

294
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,446
- He will.
- Maybe.

295
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:28,282
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How about nothing?

296
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,125
- Twenty bucks?
- Deal.

297
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,972
l'm telling you
l didn't kill them, sir.

298
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,522
The murder weapon
was in your truck, sergeant.

299
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,285
Someone must have put it there.

300
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,932
Your fingerprints are all over it.

301
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:41,288
l didn't shoot my wife, sir.

302
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,364
Did you use your fists
on her, sergeant?

303
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,251
Knock her around a little bit,
or maybe

304
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,210
or maybe
that just wasn't cutting it anymore.

305
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,206
l never laid a hand on Sun.

306
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,202
<i>Your neighbour heard the fights,</i>
<i>sergeant.</i>

307
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:55,522
l saw the hole you punched.

308
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:58,253
l only punched the hole in the wall
so l wouldn't hit her, sir.

309
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,005
Her hands were all bruised
and cut

310
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:02,084
from where she fought you off
all the time.

311
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,845
- That's not how it happened.
- Really?

312
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,765
How did l get it wrong?
How'd it happen?

313
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,412
She was the--

314
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,723
She the one who was abusing me.

315
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:14,371
You don't believe me?

316
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,889
Take a look at this.

317
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,051
Sit down.

318
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:26,241
Sun was violent, sir.

319
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:30,201
She hit me. She called me names.
She threw things.

320
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,284
l tried to hold her off

321
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:36,446
but l never--
l never once laid a hand on her.

322
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:40,047
l just wanted it to stop.

323
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,645
- Pay up.
- He didn't confess.

324
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,809
- lt was damn close.
- Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.

325
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,088
Well, we got enough evidence

326
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,131
even if you didn't break him
in interrogation, boss.

327
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,809
Not to say that
you couldn't have broken him

328
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:54,964
if you wanted to.
l really like that shirt.

329
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,564
Tony's right. we have Sgt. Porter's gun
with his fingerprints in his car.

330
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,452
He blows away his wife and her friend
in a rage. Gets drunk. Passes out

331
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:05,286
- before he can commit suicide.
- Why did he police his brass?

332
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,842
- Habit of a well-trained Marine.
- He worked the motor pool.

333
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:10,568
According to his records,
he failed to qualify twice

334
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,644
on the pistol range last year.

335
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,602
Abby get the results of the GSR tests
on his clothing yet?

336
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,610
- All negative, boss.
- He could have worn gloves

337
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:20,333
- or got rid of the clothes he's wearing.
- But he leaves his pistol

338
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:21,721
in full view on the front seat.

339
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,326
Boss, l think l've got something here.

340
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,404
l just spoke with the director
of the Officers' Club.

341
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,529
Apparently Sun Porter
was a regular fixture there.

342
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,890
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.

343
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,843
- For what, McGee?
- One of their husbands showed up,

344
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,685
made a scene, had to be carried out.

345
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,650
Another nail
in Sergeant Porter's coffin.

346
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,849
lt wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.

347
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:45,922
Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.

348
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:52,285
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at
the "E'' Club with the murder weapon.

349
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,768
l knew they were having troubles,
but never expected this.

350
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,566
Where's your wife,
Sergeant Dawson?

351
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,691
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why? ls something wrong, sir?

352
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,363
What happened at the Officer's Club
last month?

353
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,207
Let me refresh your memory.

354
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,204
You had an altercation
with two Marine captains.

355
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,523
Yeah, it was nothing.
lt was just a misunderstanding.

356
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,088
Big enough for a Letter of Reprimand
in your SRB.

357
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,448
Maybe we should ask your wife
about it, sergeant?

358
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,808
- She had a rough day. l'd rather not--
- Down the hall?

359
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,452
Yeah, but l'd rather not disturb her.

360
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:22,372
- We'll see if she's still breathing.
- You think l killed Sun and Min

361
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,331
because they had a couple of drinks
with my wife at the "O'' Club?

362
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:28,405
Mrs. Dawson, NClS.
We're gonna ask you a few questions.

363
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,173
Yoon. lt's me. Please.
Yoon, open up.

364
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,801
- Do you have a key?
- lt's locked from the inside. Yoon.

365
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,406
Yoon.

366
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:47,848
lt's okay. lt's okay.

367
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,686
lt doesn't make sense, sir.

368
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:57,764
Someone kills
my wife's two best friends,

369
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,286
then they decide to kidnap her?

370
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,009
When's the last time
you saw her, sergeant?

371
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,652
About an hour
before you showed up.

372
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,969
She was putting the baby to sleep
in our room.

373
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:09,362
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

374
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,251
Can we stop standing around
and do something?

375
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,732
We are.

376
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,724
We are. Sit down.

377
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:16,842
And what exactly is that, sir?

378
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:19,447
Figuring out if you're a suspect
or a victim.

379
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:21,205
The window was broken
from the outside.

380
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:23,643
Whoever did this slipped in,
grabbed her and slipped out.

381
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:27,692
None of the neighbours heard
or saw anything unusual, boss.

382
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,252
MP's are searching the area.

383
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:31,244
Also checking every vehicle
leaving the base.

384
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,166
- You think she still might be on base?
- lt's possible.

385
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:36,125
We need to be out there
looking for her.

386
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:38,011
lf she's still on base we'll find her.

387
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,722
Someone put a lot of effort into taking
her away without alerting you.

388
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,804
There's a good chance
she's not dead yet.

389
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:45,846
Yet?

390
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,045
Oh, God,
why would someone do this?

391
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,044
For the same reason
someone killed her friends.

392
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,044
You think l had something
to do with this?

393
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,766
Sit down.

394
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:58,048
What happened
at the Officer's Club, sergeant?

395
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,647
lt was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.

396
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:01,962
Yoon just drops them off.

397
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,328
This one time she went in
and had a couple of drinks.

398
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:07,053
She couldn't drive home
so she called me.

399
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:08,682
- Gibbs.
- <i>Boss</i>--

400
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,321
When did you get into a verbal
altercation with the Marine captains?

401
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:13,484
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.

402
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,524
They tried to stop me
from taking her home.

403
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,929
What would you do, sir?

404
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:21,210
You think one of these captains might
have had something to do with this?

405
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:23,967
We're wasting our time. l'm telling you,
l had nothing to do with this.

406
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,806
l know that.
Your alibi just checked out.

407
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:29,288
The sergeant was on duty
at the time of the shootings.

408
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:31,367
So what now, sir?

409
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:36,731
Three Korean women met
and married Marines in Seoul

410
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,327
at roughly the same time.
Two of them are dead.

411
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:42,371
Our prime suspect was locked up here
when the third went missing.

412
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,603
Think it's a racial thing?

413
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:46,964
No. Definitely do not think
that it's a hate crime.

414
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,971
ln my experience there's only
one colour in the Marines.

415
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,567
What l've seen of your Marine Corps,
it's very ethnically diverse.

416
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,689
He means green, Ziva.
And l think he's right.

417
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,771
Well, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.

418
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:01,133
Like some kind of blood feud.

419
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,882
Competing villages, ancient oaths,
revenge from across the ocean.

420
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:07,527
This is not one
of your stupid action movies, Tony.

421
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,729
No, it isn't.
lf it was, you'd be dressed differently.

422
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,849
And you'd be far better looking.

423
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:14,884
You'd be dead
by the opening credits.

424
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:18,046
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
l am the plucky comic relief?

425
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,450
You find out what the hell happened
to Yoon Dawson yet?

426
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,926
Plucky?

427
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,688
- Well, Ziva and Tony and l--
- Were just working on that, boss.

428
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,532
We're going through a list of anyone
who had access to the base

429
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:32,490
in the last two days.
So far, no solid leads.

430
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,724
What about the Marines
Sergeant Dawson fought with?

431
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,884
Both transferred
out of Quantico last month.

432
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,771
One at Camp Pendleton,
the other is in Okinawa.

433
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,651
The two dead women lived
insular lives.

434
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:43,202
They spent most of their time together
with other Koreans.

435
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,046
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only
one who embraced American life.

436
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:49,171
Any reason to believe that Sergeant
Porter isn't still involved in this?

437
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:50,852
He could have had
an accomplice, probie.

438
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,726
He could have had three, DiNozzo.
We need more information.

439
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,291
Actually, boss, Abby and l,
we have been working on something.

440
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:00,331
We got the women's phone records,
credit card receipts, address books.

441
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,364
Abby is referencing to see
if there's a pattern.

442
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:04,643
DiNozzo, l want to know
about anybody in the area

443
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:07,413
who's made threats against Koreans,
foreign Marine wives, or women.

444
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:08,767
Oh, is that all?

445
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,929
- On it, boss.
- Find out about their lives

446
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,287
before they married Marines.

447
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:15,206
Come on, you're with me, Elf Lord.

448
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,648
lt's amazing how much you can find
out about someone

449
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:20,166
without actually meeting them.

450
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,723
For instance, me and these women
have absolutely nothing in common.

451
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,172
They web-browse
for cake recipes, gardening tips

452
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,291
and Min Crane has some weird
obsession with stained glass.

453
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:33,684
That's not even mentioning their
music downloads. One word: Yanni.

454
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,486
Good point. Who cares?

455
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:38,445
Their schedules
were pretty regulated.

456
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:41,366
On Wednesdays and Fridays
they trekked to Koreatown.

457
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,643
They'd shop for a couple of hours,
then they'd have tea

458
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,724
at Lee's Neighbourhood Market.

459
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,766
They alternated paying.
lt was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.

460
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,764
Not exactly groundbreaking
police work there.

461
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,089
- She's not done yet, McGee.
- Thank you, Gibbs.

462
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:57,123
Within the last month, all three of them
received regular phone calls

463
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,807
from a pay phone located just outside
Lee's Neighbourhood Market.

464
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,923
lt is owned and operated
by Lee Sung.

465
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,328
He sells Korean delicacies,
fruits and vegetables

466
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,808
and those cute little anime figurines
with the funny faces.

467
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,122
Oh, l love those.

468
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:13,084
He also has a catering business,
Lee's Delights.

469
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,204
lt's authentic Korean food.
Very high end.

470
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,364
All three women have worked
for him as hostesses

471
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:20,326
and they were scheduled to work
an event for him tomorrow afternoon.

472
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,091
- How do you know?
- Because.

473
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,329
Lee's Sung e-mailed them
the instructions.

474
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,605
lt's a Korean diplomatic event
at the Pacific Rim Society.

475
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,202
Tell me l didn't just smack McGee
for no good reason.

476
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:32,404
You didn't smack McGee
for no good reason.

477
00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:36,003
Last night, Yoon Dawson
used her cell phone

478
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,970
to call the pay phone
outside Lee's Market.

479
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,733
Two hours later...she's missing.

480
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,008
Why is this important?

481
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:46,684
Because someone is still using
her cell phone to call that pay phone.

482
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,969
- Can we get a fix on the phone?
- Negatory, McGee.

483
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:53,404
l know it's somewhere in Annandale,
Virginia, but they turn it off

484
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:56,525
before l can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.

485
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,803
McGee, l want a tap
on that damn pay phone.

486
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,129
Abby, l wanna know who answers it.

487
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:02,762
That's good work, Abs.

488
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:05,402
What was that for?

489
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,325
For mocking my groundbreaking
police work.

490
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,086
l was not mocking you--

491
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:11,642
Won't happen again.

492
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,812
Damn, l can't believe this.

493
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,483
l don't really like waiting
here either, Tony.

494
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:24,288
No, Nick and Jessica broke up.
l'm always the last to know.

495
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:26,002
<i>Hey, DiNozzo.</i>

496
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:27,925
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, boss.

497
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:34,967
Hey, probie, you getting this?

498
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,885
Yeah, got it, Tony.

499
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,252
lt's Yoon Dawson's
cell phone again.

500
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:44,926
l want a location, McGee.

501
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:49,201
Whoever it is, they disabled
the onboard GPS chip.

502
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,011
We'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

503
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:54,768
Just take a moment to get a bead on
the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.

504
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:57,248
We got someone headed
to the phone, boss.

505
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,929
- You want us to take him down now?
- <i>Negative.</i>

506
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,407
Wait until we trace the call.

507
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:08,285
Okay, l've got
the cell phone grid located.

508
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:11,124
lt's coming from this neighbourhood.

509
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,726
Somewhere on this street.

510
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:14,087
<i>You copy that, DiNozzo?</i>

511
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:17,569
Well, we're scanning for targets now.
There are a lot of possibles.

512
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,212
lf you don't respond,
l'm gonna hang up.

513
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:21,204
<i>Don't, l have information for you.</i>

514
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:25,607
Wool cap, head down,
heading towards the pay phone.

515
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,087
Got him.

516
00:26:32,613 --> 00:26:33,648
Drop your weapon.

517
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:37,006
Federal agents, move!

518
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,885
lt's Yoon Dawson, boss.
She's rabitting.

519
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:41,089
We're cutting her off, DiNozzo.

520
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,131
l know she didn't pass us.

521
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,612
Well, where the hell did she go?

522
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:11,844
lt's like she disappeared.

523
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:15,365
She didn't disappear.

524
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:24,363
lt's her hat.
She climbed her way out.

525
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:39,412
lf l am here, l answer the pay phone,
Agent McGee.

526
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:41,804
Many people in this community
are poor.

527
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,806
Can't afford phone service,
so l take messages for them.

528
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,292
You see, it helps them

529
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:49,286
and it is good for my business
when they come to pick up.

530
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,685
Boss, did you find her?

531
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,083
Yeah, McGee.
She's hiding in my coffee cup.

532
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,643
We didn't find her.
Just give us one second, please.

533
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,605
Has he calmed down yet?

534
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,885
Well, he's a little shaky
but l think he's ready to talk.

535
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,131
Min and Sun.

536
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,931
They are dead?

537
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,326
lt's my fault.

538
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:13,290
l take responsibility.

539
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:15,728
l try to help people new
to this country.

540
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:18,282
Find jobs for them,
get them training, classes.

541
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,887
Sometimes even loan money.

542
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:22,567
You hired all three of them
to work for your catering company?

543
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,166
l did.

544
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,211
l would notice when Yoon was tired,
her accent would change.

545
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,445
Sometimes she would use words not
common in my country since the war.

546
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,492
Yoon-Sook Dawson
wasn't South Korean.

547
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:36,804
l began to believe
that she was from the North.

548
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,966
Perhaps a spy?

549
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:41,926
Why didn't you go to the police?

550
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:44,766
Well, l couldn't be sure.
What if l was wrong?

551
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,533
l asked Min and Sun to find out
where she grew up,

552
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,052
what schools she go to.

553
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:50,771
Then l check her answers

554
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:54,130
and try to locate relatives
from Korea.

555
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,126
- Nothing.
- Who else knew

556
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,888
- you were checking up on her?
- Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.

557
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:01,806
She was trying to protect her cover?

558
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,406
She failed.

559
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:05,723
We're taking you
into protective custody, Mr. Sung.

560
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,082
No.

561
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,322
l will not hide.

562
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:12,005
- Mr. Sung, she could come back.
- Let her.

563
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,492
l am ready this time.

564
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:16,121
l won't stop living my life
because of people like her.

565
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:19,091
- Sir, l really don't think that this--
- Mr. Sung.

566
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,972
Thank you for your help.

567
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,805
lf you think of anything else,
give me a call.

568
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,043
Yes, l will.
And please thank your agents for me.

569
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,251
Boss, you're not really
gonna let him just--

570
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,564
McGee, you know the FBl
does not exist only to piss me off.

571
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,611
Sometimes they can actually
be useful.

572
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,282
Hey, Fornell.

573
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:39,726
l got one right up
your jurisdiction.

574
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,372
Like my father always said,
''Be careful who you marry, Anthony.

575
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,489
She may end up
being a homicidal maniac.''

576
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,531
- Your father actually said that to you?
- No, but l'm sure he thought it.

577
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:50,445
Probably he knew
your taste in women.

578
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,452
Abby's got active taps
on Sergeant Dawson's cell,

579
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:56,046
home and work phones, boss.

580
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,169
- lf she calls her husband, we'll know.
- She won't.

581
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:02,162
The FBl team shadowing Mr. Sung
is tied directly into MTAC.

582
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,484
They're last report had him
loading up a catering truck for a job.

583
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:07,006
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.

584
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:09,443
lt's highly doubtful she'd make
another attempt on his life.

585
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:12,525
We've got four agents providing
surveillance on Dawson's house.

586
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,604
She definitely won't be
returning home.

587
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,045
And how do you know this,
Officer David?

588
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:19,044
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.

589
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:21,652
Now tell us what you'd do.

590
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,971
lf l was Yoon, everything l've done up
to this point was to protect my cover.

591
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,289
l've dealt with the two
possible threats on base and--

592
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,092
lf by ''dealt'' you mean gunning down
two defenceless housewives...

593
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:34,762
l attempted to deal with the third,
but my cover was blown.

594
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,685
l'm now only left
with a few possibilities.

595
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:38,252
You rush back to your country?

596
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:42,611
Or carry out whatever mission l was
assigned before l'm captured or killed.

597
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,286
She's been in the States
for three years.

598
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,489
lf you had a mission,
wouldn't you have carried it out?

599
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:48,366
Not if l'm a sleeper, McGee.

600
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:50,923
She could be here for decades
before being activated.

601
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,891
So tell us, Jane Bond,
how do we track you down, huh?

602
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:55,242
You don't, Tony.

603
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:58,086
By now l've changed my appearance,
l've replaced my identity

604
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:00,050
with backup documents
and l've relocated.

605
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:01,602
Promise?

606
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:05,490
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?

607
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:07,291
You might think about this,
l'm gonna pay.

608
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,644
No one's eating until we find
Yoon Dawson.

609
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:11,923
lt's not that Tony couldn't stand
to lose a little weight

610
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:15,093
but we'd all starve to death
before that happened.

611
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:17,323
She's playing it like l would.
She's gone.

612
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:19,404
There's one difference
between the two of you, Ziva.

613
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,245
You don't have a baby girl.

614
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:23,887
Most likely part of her cover
or an occupational accident.

615
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:26,211
- lt's more than that.
- How can you tell?

616
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:29,492
My gut. Come on.
You're with me. Let's go.

617
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:34,282
Hey, probie.
Let me ask you a question.

618
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:37,923
You don't think she was serious about
the whole losing a few pounds thing?

619
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,363
Are you gonna hit me
if l tell you the truth?

620
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,484
No, man. We're buds.

621
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,487
Yeah.

622
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,725
My wife is not a spy, sir.

623
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:56,924
Her South Korean passport's
a forgery.

624
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,367
lt's not possible, okay?

625
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,649
Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than me.

626
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,605
She was trained to,
it's called a honey trap.

627
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:04,968
Her assignment was to meet
an eligible serviceman,

628
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,765
seduce him and gain access
into this country.

629
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,764
Oh, yeah? Then why was she
trying to convince me

630
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:10,764
to leave the Marine Corps
and go to college?

631
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,844
Most likely you were not part
of the assignment.

632
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,924
- You were a means to an end.
- Listen. Okay,

633
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,766
l've lived with her for five years.
She's the mother of my child.

634
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,730
l'm telling you, there's no way.

635
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:26,931
- What's this?
- Your wife.

636
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,165
No, that can't be real.

637
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,846
lt's real.

638
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,285
Min Crane and Sun Porter?

639
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,171
She killed them?

640
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,248
- Oh, my God.
- Has she tried to contact you?

641
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,324
- No.
- She's a foreign agent, Marine.

642
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,290
You lie about this, it's treason.

643
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:51,683
She hasn't. She hasn't tried
to contact me, sir.

644
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,002
Okay, we think she might.

645
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,892
lf she does and you confront her,
she will most likely kill you.

646
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,129
l just can't believe this.

647
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:08,006
Go ahead.

648
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:24,691
- Hello?
- <i>lt's me, James.</i>

649
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,890
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NClS is here.

650
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,408
- They're telling me all sorts of things.
- <i>Don't speak.</i>

651
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,161
Just listen to me, okay?

652
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:33,931
You need to come home now.

653
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:37,448
lt's too late for that.

654
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,285
l've done things.

655
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,171
- Terrible things.
- <i>l don't care, all right?</i>

656
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,085
Tell me where you are
and l'll come and get you.

657
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:44,971
<i>There's one more thing</i>
<i>that l need to do.</i>

658
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,403
l don't have a choice.

659
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,962
- l never had a choice.
- <i>Just tell me why.</i>

660
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:52,363
- Please, sweetheart.
- <i>No matter what they say,</i>

661
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,842
what they tell you about me,

662
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:57,846
know that l loved you
with all my heart.

663
00:33:58,013 --> 00:34:00,368
That it was for real.

664
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,763
And tell Rebecca--

665
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:07,003
Tell her Mommy is sorry for this.
All of it.

666
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,090
This is insane.
Yoon, you can't do--

667
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:12,529
<i>l love you both so much,</i>
<i>more than you can imagine</i>

668
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,405
but l can't let it happen.

669
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:17,525
<i>Yoon, don't. Yoon, don't hang up.</i>

670
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:21,891
l got her, Tony. She's at a pay phone
in Annandale, Virginia.

671
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,527
The corner of Raven Road
and Lancaster Drive.

672
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:27,651
- Way to go, Abs.
- Kind of a weird place to be hiding out.

673
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:29,644
There's nothing there
except country clubs.

674
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:31,884
Lee Sung's catering job?

675
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,566
The Pacific Rim Society.

676
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,648
lt's in Annandale!

677
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,646
Either that's a coincidence or she
really, really wants to kill this guy.

678
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:43,761
- l don't believe in coincidence.
- ''l don't believe in coincidence.''

679
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,167
No. No, Yoon.

680
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:43,366
Where is it, Lee Sung?

681
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:46,931
Have you no honour left, woman?

682
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,524
More than you.

683
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,365
Scream and l kill you.

684
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:01,811
Found out why the FBl
isn't responding, boss.

685
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:03,850
- She's definitely here.
- <i>Keep looking, DiNozzo.</i>

686
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:05,287
l'm right behind you.

687
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:14,331
l will kill you
if you don't answer this time.

688
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,566
Where?

689
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:20,961
ln the truck.

690
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,166
Drop the weapon.

691
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:28,367
There's a bomb set
to go off in this building.

692
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,130
lf you kill me now, we all die.

693
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,772
Put your weapon down.

694
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:37,846
l was a North Korean operative.

695
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,689
We kind of figured that part out
on our own.

696
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:44,044
The part that you don't know
is that my cell included Sun Porter,

697
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,647
- Min Crane and this man.
- She's lying.

698
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:50,966
l swear on the life of my daughter
that l'm trying to prevent this attack.

699
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,966
And l swear if you don't release
your weapon, l will kill you.

700
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,048
The bomb is in his truck.

701
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,531
Please, we may
only have minutes left.

702
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:23,723
- Now do you believe me?
- Can you disarm it?

703
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,246
lf l had a couple of days,
maybe. You?

704
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,931
l could try.

705
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,326
But l suggest not standing within
five miles of here while l attempt it.

706
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:41,523
- l can.
- She put it there.

707
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:42,921
She's trying to kill us all.

708
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,046
They're evacuating the building, boss.

709
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,130
And the--

710
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:50,012
- That's a really big bomb.
- You think, DiNozzo?

711
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:53,370
l didn't kill them to maintain my cover,
Agent Gibbs.

712
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,251
l did it to keep my family.

713
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,242
- l failed.
- She's a North Korean spy.

714
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:01,971
Not anymore.

715
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,563
At least let me prevent this.

716
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:11,928
McGee, get Sung out of here.

717
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,765
- Get the cuffs off her.
- Gibbs.

718
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,889
lt's not a debate, Officer David. Go.

719
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:17,771
Go on. Get out of here.
All of you.

720
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,444
Get a clear distance away.
l'll handle it from here.

721
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:22,205
l don't care
how hard you whack me, boss.

722
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:23,931
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Nor am l.

723
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:27,043
lf we survive this,
you're both fired.

724
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:48,727
lt's supposed to do that, right?

725
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:15,482
lt's done.

726
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,291
The bomb is no longer armed.

727
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,441
So what happens now, sir?

728
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:48,450
The FBl will take her
into custody, sergeant.

729
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,887
And then prison?

730
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,449
Your wife is an agent
of a hostile power.

731
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,690
lt all depends what kind
of a deal she can make.

732
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,408
She was also responsible for bringing
down an entire North Korean cell

733
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:01,052
and saving hundreds of lives,
sergeant.

734
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,889
l'm sure that will be taken into
consideration. Right, Officer David?

735
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:06,962
Yes, of course.

736
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,966
Her knowledge of the inner workings
of North Korean lntelligence

737
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,488
should proved to be invaluable.

738
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,924
Guys, give her a minute.

739
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:46,651
l'm

740
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:48,963
so sorry.

741
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:53,569
l was trying to do the right thing.

742
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,932
Everything you said to me
on the phone,

743
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,603
l believe in you.

744
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:07,446
l'll always believe it,
no matter what happens.

745
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,612
Come here.

746
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:15,321
lt's okay.

747
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:20,450
- l'm so sorry.
- l know.

748
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:22,132
Let's go.

749
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,685
Tony,

750
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,605
Ziva, what happened back there
with the bomb,

751
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:33,765
- l want you both to know--
- You don't have to say it, boss.

752
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,571
We know how you feel about us.

753
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:36,848
Gibbs, we're a team.

754
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:38,566
That's what we do.

755
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:42,731
l was going to say,
if either one of you two wing nuts

756
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,885
ever disobey a direct order again,
l'll kill you myself.

757
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:53,169
That's our boss.
