1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,182
Good God almighty,
get me out of here.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,863
My head is about to explode.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,945
That was the longest three hours
of my entire freaking life.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,748
You're the one who said no
to the muzzle.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,060
l wanted to shut his pothole
two hours ago.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,825
lt's ''pie-hole.'' And by the way,
we went to the Arby's drive-thru.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,550
No such thing as a ride-thru.
How long have you lived here anyway?

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,786
- Man, get off me.
- l'll pay you to take him upstairs.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,020
- Just name your price.
- My rock beat your scissors.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,023
Besides, l've got 5 million in heroin.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,425
- That's nothing.
- Really?

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,662
l have a feeling your South African
suppliers won't feel the same way.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,628
Considering how much you owe them,
be thankful you're in our custody.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,825
We're your new best friends.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,345
l don't care what you do to me.
l'm not talking.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,742
l find that really hard to believe.
All yours, Agent David.

17
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,901
- Come on, man. Take off the cuffs.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,549
Yeah, what's his problem, huh?

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,100
You. You're insulting, you're crude and
most of all you are extremely annoying.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,785
l'm annoying? He's the one
rambling on and on about <i>Top Gun,</i>

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,383
giving me a freaking migraine.

22
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,780
l didn't realise l had to sit in silence
the entire trip.

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,668
Last l checked,
the First Amendment guaranteed--

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,819
Enough!

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,743
- Get in.
- No.

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,705
- He's a newbie.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,223
He's dead.

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,141
l've been travelling to crime scenes
for many years,

29
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,062
but l can say with
complete confidence,

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,869
this is the shortest commute
l have ever had.

31
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,907
And one of the first times
l didn't get us lost.

32
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,344
True.

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,989
All yours, Duck.

34
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,343
Sure appreciate all the help, Tony.

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,824
That's a nice outfit, probie.

36
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,545
Okay, the handbook says
that we are required

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,702
to wear this outfit at all active
crime scenes. You know that.

38
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,428
Yeah, but not in our own building.

39
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,343
That's like wearing a nametag
in your own apartment.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,182
Tony?

41
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,824
Come here.

42
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,263
How's she holding up?

43
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,546
Oh, l-- l don't know.
l haven't talked to her yet.

44
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,109
May l ask why?

45
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,306
Because l told him not to, Ducky.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,108
Excuse me.

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,500
Right now, she's a suspect,
not an investigator.

48
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,626
Boss, you don't think Ziva's
capable of this, do you?

49
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,226
Well, l mean she's capable of it,

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,984
but you don't really think
that she would just--

51
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,583
Kill someone?

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,980
Not without a good reason.

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,064
Look, we all know that Ziva
has crazy ninja skills,

54
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,425
but, l mean,
she's got some self-control, right?

55
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,865
Not a lot, some?

56
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,983
Never mind.

57
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,623
Forgive me for overstepping,
Jethro, but you and l both know that

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,022
this is far beyond
Officer David's character.

59
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,068
lt's not me or you l'm worried
about right now, Duck.

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,743
We have a cause of death?

61
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,980
Well, at this point
l'd only be speculating.

62
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,706
We won't know anything specific
until l get him back--

63
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,987
Well, downstairs, l suppose.

64
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,139
No bruising?

65
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,382
Yeah, well, the only injury
l've been able to find

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,747
is this on the top of his head here.

67
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,942
Sorry.

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,623
l'll zig.

69
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,542
You zag.

70
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,020
Here, allow me.

71
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,944
lt looks recent.

72
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,182
Yeah, well, based on its location,

73
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,219
it appears that he struck his head
on one of these rails when he fell.

74
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,381
Oh, come on, Jethro, l mean,

75
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,940
there's no sign
of any physical altercation.

76
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,307
Duck, with her training,
there wouldn't be.

77
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,299
Hey.

78
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,302
- Ready to hear my side of the story?
- Well, we're not gonna hear his.

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,869
l didn't touch him.

80
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,429
Hardly at all.

81
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,865
When the elevator doors opened,
he refused to get in.

82
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,100
lf this was a year ago,
l would have snapped his neck,

83
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,379
but it's not and l didn't.

84
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,223
l asked him several times to step
into the elevator.

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,825
He wouldn't cooperate.

86
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,745
- And that's when l struck him.
- How?

87
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,945
- With my fist.
- Where?

88
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,623
ln the jugular.

89
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,027
Can you believe l'm about to go
to my first crime scene?

90
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,508
lt's not a good time.

91
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,383
lt was just a little love tap.

92
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,381
Choked him up for
a couple of seconds, that's all.

93
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,142
Look, l know this looks bad.

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,149
l also know with
Brian Dempsey dead,

95
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,905
it's nearly impossible to bring down
his South African distributors,

96
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,462
much less prosecute his brother.

97
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,860
That's not our biggest problem here,
Ziva.

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,581
lt appears there's only one way
to fix this.

99
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,621
l've seen it in
your American movies.

100
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,063
This is where l resign.

101
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,189
Next time you hand me your badge,

102
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,622
you had better be prepared to lose it.

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,860
After all these years, l'm finally
losing my crime scene virginity.

104
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,908
Wow, l don't think
that's ever been said before.

105
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,098
l think we've got enough
crime scene pictures.

106
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,703
Sorry, McGee. l just--

107
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,386
Maybe your hat is turning me
into some sort of super agent.

108
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,144
That's weird, because it never had
that affect on McGee.

109
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,541
Why do l feel like everyone's
staring at me?

110
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,302
Because they are.

111
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,468
Did l do something wrong?

112
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,501
Have you ever been to Disneyland,
Abby?

113
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,822
- Every summer.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,550
You know those camera-toting tourists
with the tall white socks

115
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,428
up to their knees,
wearing fanny packs?

116
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,741
Well, yeah. We spend half the time
laughing at them...

117
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,902
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,822
l've turned into my Uncle Larry.

119
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,901
This man doesn't look a day
over 30, doctor.

120
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,630
According to his arrest report,

121
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,260
he would have been 25 next month.

122
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,218
So assuming Ziva didn't kill him,
that means he just dropped dead?

123
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,987
lt would appear that way,
wouldn't it?

124
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,265
He's so young.

125
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,182
Yes, my father used to say:

126
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,423
''We must live for today,
because yesterday is gone,

127
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,820
and tomorrow may never come.''

128
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,708
You know,
that's really beautiful, doctor.

129
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,146
Yes, unfortunately,
he never practised what he preached.

130
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,382
He was always a bit
of a penny-pincher.

131
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,420
A Papa Scrooge, if you like.

132
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,626
That was one reason that he and
my mother went their separate ways.

133
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,783
Yeah, most people don't know this,

134
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,908
but financial disputes are
the second leading cause of divorce.

135
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,868
- Really? What's number one?
- Marriage.

136
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,543
Actually, l'm pretty sure it's infidelity.

137
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,019
See, the study l read said that--
Never mind.

138
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,750
l understand your sense of urgency,
Jethro,

139
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,821
but my examination
is still under way.

140
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,264
Just tell me what you know, Duck.

141
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,900
Well, so far l found
no life-threatening abnormalities.

142
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,708
What about his throat?

143
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,309
We did, in our internal examination,

144
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,746
find a slight irritation
of the anterior jugular,

145
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,461
perhaps caused by a physical blow.

146
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,108
Was the blow fatal?

147
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,541
lt didn't appear to be.

148
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,463
Look, l won't know the cause
of this man's death

149
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,143
until l've completed my work.

150
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,228
MRls, Abby's tox screen,
and they're all forthcoming.

151
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,142
l know what you want to hear,
Jethro,

152
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,382
but Officer David is not
off the hook yet.

153
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,147
Hey. Will you stop doing that?
You're making me nervous.

154
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,187
How long can it possibly take?

155
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,100
Well, l don't know, Ziva.
lt's an autopsy, not an oil change.

156
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,819
You know, l don't think we're supposed
to be talking about the case with her.

157
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,787
lt's a simple conversation, you know?

158
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,099
''What do you have, Ducky?''

159
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,907
''Well, Jethro, this reminds me of
a time back at Scotland Yard when l--''

160
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,503
''To the point, Ducky.''

161
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,267
''Well, based on my preliminary
findings, Ziva did not kill this man.''

162
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,188
What?

163
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,383
What?

164
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,299
So?

165
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,345
Did you talk to Ducky?

166
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,541
- Yeah.
- And?

167
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,144
And now l have to
go talk to the director.

168
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,180
Maybe she really did kill that guy.

169
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,582
Hey, Gibbs, what did Ducky say?

170
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,419
Gibbs.

171
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,229
Hey, are you going to tell me anything,
or not?

172
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,500
There's nothing to tell yet, Ziva.

173
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,260
Stan, it's Cynthia again.

174
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,022
l'm really starting to get worried.

175
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,658
Please call me as soon
as you get this.

176
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,582
- ls she in?
- Still not back from lunch.

177
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,661
And he's been waiting
for a half an hour.

178
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,745
He'll survive.

179
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,822
lt's not like her, Agent Gibbs.
She's never been late for a meeting.

180
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,025
You try her driver?

181
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,226
Stan's not answering his cell or pager.

182
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,743
l've left him four messages.

183
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,186
l really don't know what else to do.
l've been calling her cell--

184
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,308
- Agent Gibbs.
- <i>Director.</i>

185
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,222
We've got a major problem here.

186
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,099
Sorry to hear that, Jethro.
l have quite a serious problem myself.

187
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,988
l'm sure you're gonna
wanna hear mine first.

188
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,426
l'm not entirely sure that's true.

189
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,220
You really should be listening
to her problem, Jethro.

190
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,261
<i>You're holding my heroin</i>
<i>and my little brother.</i>

191
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,698
lf l don't get both back in two hours,
she dies.

192
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,223
l'll call back with the details.

193
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,905
She called in at 1 1 :45 when she
arrived at the Whitmore Hotel.

194
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,745
According to the senator's assistant,
lunch was over at 1 2:50,

195
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,821
ten minutes ahead of schedule.

196
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,902
- She never checked in again.
- l need to see her itinerary.

197
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,026
l can't do that, Agent Gibbs.

198
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,700
l'm not trying to be difficult,
but the director's been very clear.

199
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,542
Her schedule is confidential.
Even to you.

200
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,825
Are you done?

201
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,028
Director Shepard
has been kidnapped.

202
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,750
l need to know where she was
when it happened.

203
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,899
Okay.

204
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,058
Here's everything.
Nine a.m., the GAO.

205
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,266
1 0:30 with the ATCC.

206
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,945
And after lunch
a meeting with the B.O.B.

207
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,429
That's Congressman Bob Sommers.

208
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,702
He's a friend.

209
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,906
lt doesn't say
where she's meeting him.

210
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,949
l'm not sure. She has the car wait
at the hotel, gets coffee nearby.

211
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,658
- You think Bob's involved?
- No. lt'll give me a search radius.

212
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,149
Give me a copy of this, will you?

213
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,342
- What else can l do?
- Keep quiet.

214
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,900
She's gonna be okay, right?

215
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,269
lf you have a question, ask it.

216
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,661
l'm afraid you'll put
the Vulcan death grip on me.

217
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,661
l'm considering it.

218
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,784
Where did you learn
to do that anyway?

219
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,819
Years of training on a
secluded desert island?

220
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,139
Blind Master Po always one step
ahead of you.

221
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,945
''When you take the pebble
from my hand,

222
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,585
then it will be time--''

223
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,469
Do that again. Show me--

224
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,262
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss. l was just--

225
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,227
Shut up. Get over here.

226
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,030
James Dempsey
has taken Director Shepard hostage.

227
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,539
He wants his drugs
and his brother back or she dies.

228
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,859
We have two hours.

229
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,180
Last contact was at
the Whitmore Hotel.

230
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,227
- Driver's not responding. DiNozzo.
- On it.

231
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,664
Dempsey used
the director's phone.

232
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,104
l'll start a trace.

233
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,862
What about me?

234
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,349
This is the director's schedule.

235
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,262
Start making calls.

236
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,988
Desk work?

237
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,782
- Put me in the field.
- No, not happening.

238
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,510
- You need me out there.
- Not happening.

239
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,548
l need you at your desk making calls.
Go.

240
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,066
Hey. Clock's ticking, people.

241
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,664
Jenny can take care of herself,
Gibbs.

242
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,226
- She was a good agent.
- Still is.

243
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,988
<i>l've been investigating James</i>
<i>Dempsey for nine months, Gibbs.</i>

244
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,266
<i>Seems like a frat boy on the surface,</i>
<i>but the guy's brutal.</i>

245
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,386
<i>We've linked him to half a dozen</i>
<i>unsolved homicides.</i>

246
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,820
<i>Still, kidnapping the director of NClS</i>
<i>takes guts l didn't know he had.</i>

247
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,424
He's gonna kill her, Cassie.
Nothing to be impressed by.

248
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,104
<i>l'm not impressed. l'm worried.</i>

249
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,147
Any intel from those squids
you busted?

250
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,380
<i>They're just mules moving product</i>
<i>for the South Africans.</i>

251
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,063
<i>Didn't even know</i>
<i>who they were working for.</i>

252
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,186
- Get down here.
- <i>Be there in a couple of hours.</i>

253
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,786
Hold on. Base commander
has got a chopper waiting.

254
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,022
<i>The only thing James Dempsey loves</i>
<i>more than money is his baby brother.</i>

255
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,589
<i>As long as you've got</i>
<i>Brian in custody,</i>

256
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,263
<i>James should be</i>
<i>easy to manipulate.</i>

257
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,624
Brian Dempsey's dead.

258
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,265
You still think he'll be
easy to manipulate, Cassie?

259
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,302
<i>l'm on my way.</i>

260
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,784
- This is totally disturbing.
- Yes, it is.

261
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,622
l mean, who would
treat their feet like that?

262
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,141
- Feet?
- Yeah, look at these soles.

263
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,902
You know what that does
to somebody's arches?

264
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,221
Heel spurs, torn ligaments, not to
mention the effect on spinal alignment.

265
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,789
Abby, he was a drug dealer.

266
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,781
McGee, there is no excuse
for poor foot care.

267
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,545
You wear platforms,
and l'm trying to work here.

268
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,540
Are you still tracking
the director's cell phone?

269
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,349
Well, l tracked it to half a dozen
different cell towers.

270
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,545
He called from a car.

271
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,588
- Driving down the 395.
- Were there any other calls?

272
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,820
Phone was turned off.
Probably tossed it.

273
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,060
l pinpointed the GPS
to its last location.

274
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,743
Great.

275
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,623
Not great?

276
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,782
lt's a major interchange. He could
have taken any of the four highways.

277
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,225
- So much for plan A.
- Better have a plan B.

278
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,665
Gibbs. Are you okay?

279
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,821
l was worried about you
because of the director and all.

280
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,423
l know you guys are really close.

281
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,865
Plan B. l'm running samples
on Brian Dempsey's clothing

282
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,498
and personal effects to Sherlock,
where he's been hanging out.

283
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,820
- And?
- lt's going to take some time.

284
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,867
Which we don't have,
so l'll hurry up now.

285
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,383
l'm working a different angle.

286
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,223
Collecting Brian Dempsey's
credit cards and phone records.

287
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,382
By creating a simple algorithm
using his personal data,

288
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,064
l constructed a computer model
of his buying patterns

289
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,629
juxtaposed with his calling patterns.

290
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,429
l don't care. Get it done.

291
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,143
- Get out.
- Easy there, Rudd.

292
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,909
She's not one of your dates.

293
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,868
She wouldn't even be here
if your idiot brother didn't get caught.

294
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,909
l apologise for Alex.
He takes some getting used to.

295
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,544
Once you get to know him,
you'll really learn to hate him.

296
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,062
On your knees.

297
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,702
Please.

298
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,829
You're wasting your time.

299
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,743
l'm just trying to make you
more comfortable.

300
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,423
l meant taking me hostage.

301
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,828
They're never going to negotiate.

302
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,629
Well, don't sell yourself so short.

303
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,386
- They're not allowed to.
- l don't know.

304
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,906
Agent Gibbs seems fond of you.

305
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,304
Maybe he'll make an exception.

306
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,861
Gibbs thinks of me like a wife.

307
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,579
See?

308
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,222
He's had three.

309
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,382
We busted your brother
with 5 million in pure heroin.

310
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,223
You think the Navy's
just going to give him back?

311
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,263
Stand up.

312
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,668
Now.

313
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,143
On the chair.

314
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,268
Lean back.

315
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,020
l'm sorry about this.

316
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,662
My brother's always had a way
of getting us in trouble.

317
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,867
l'm the one who bails us out.

318
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,940
You didn't break someone's window
with a baseball.

319
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,829
You kidnapped the head
of a federal agency.

320
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,550
Yeah. You got a point.

321
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,148
But look on the bright side.

322
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,309
This will be over soon.

323
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,141
- One way or the other.
- Stanley.

324
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,383
Excuse me?

325
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,100
- My driver.
- He's fine.

326
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,661
Might be a little uncomfortable.

327
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,060
We stuck him in
the trunk of your car.

328
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,587
See? l'm not a bad guy.

329
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,864
l just want the drugs you stole from me
and my brother back.

330
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,340
Yes, l know
it's confidential information

331
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,580
but please don't put me on hold.

332
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,105
- You all right?
- l'm doing desk work.

333
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,625
Could be worse.

334
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,623
What part of ''desk work''
don't you understand?

335
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,701
- <i>Agent David, are you there?</i>
- Yes, hello.

336
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,869
Hello, yes. Yes, all l want is--
No, no. Don't.

337
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,502
l know what you're going through.

338
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,944
Really?

339
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,422
Are you making pointless phone calls
and following up dead leads?

340
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,625
That's not what l mean.

341
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,389
When l shot that cop,

342
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,104
l felt like everyone doubted me.

343
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,143
But after a while...

344
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,502
Are you trying to
make me feel better?

345
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,740
ls it not working?

346
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,502
lt's not necessary, McGee.

347
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,030
Our only concern
should be the director.

348
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,904
You're right.

349
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,781
Put me on hold again
and l'll jump through this phone

350
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,589
- and l will strangle you.
- <i>Hold, please.</i>

351
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,581
Hey, McGee.

352
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,260
Nobody ever doubted you.

353
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,582
Just like those calls you're making
aren't pointless.

354
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,621
We're looking for a black Town Car.

355
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,587
You're going to have to be
more specific.

356
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,308
lt's got federal plates.

357
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,222
You just described
half our clientele.

358
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,584
Look, the car belongs
to the director of NClS.

359
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,380
She comes with a driver.
She's here twice a week.

360
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,302
- Director Shepard.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,823
Why didn't you say so?

362
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,709
- l was trying to be discreet.
- ls she all right?

363
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,508
She's just peachy.

364
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,945
She just left her keys in her car.

365
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,429
Here we are.

366
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,228
Looks like the door is open.

367
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,664
Hold on.

368
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,145
ls this a crime scene,
Agent DiNozzo?

369
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,979
lt is now.

370
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,342
The director's driver was taken
by surprise,

371
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,909
then shot in the back of the head.

372
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,389
Dempsey then kidnapped the director

373
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,427
and is demanding the return
of his drugs,

374
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,945
his brother or she dies.

375
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,465
Let's hope we find him
before that happens, Officer David.

376
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,985
Here's everything l've got
on the Dempseys.

377
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,425
Nine months of surveillance,
wiretaps, buy-busts.

378
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,421
Where do l sit?

379
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,428
Any of this gonna help
me find the director?

380
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,548
Probably not. Wish l could tell you
l had someone inside his organization.

381
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,063
You never flipped an informant?

382
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,028
l was hoping to flip his brother,
obviously that's never gonna happen.

383
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,947
Officer David.

384
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,869
Got it, Tony.

385
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,508
Tony's uploading the Whitmore Hotel
security footage right now.

386
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,103
He's got Dempsey
leaving the garage.

387
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,022
He's had less than a day
to target the director.

388
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,067
He'll have been sloppy.
Left a trail.

389
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,221
James Dempsey's
in the passenger seat.

390
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,948
The director must be in the back.

391
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,146
- Who's driving?
- Alex Rudd.

392
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,145
Point man for the cartels running
drugs through South Africa.

393
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,663
Guy's a serious psychopath, Gibbs.

394
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,783
l didn't know he was in the country.

395
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,340
But l know 50 places
he likes to hang out.

396
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,580
- l'll start knocking down doors.
- No, l need you here.

397
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,388
- Get somebody else to do it.
- l'll start--

398
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,905
No, you're not going anywhere.
You sit down.

399
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,425
Run a BOLO on that car.

400
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,786
We'll get her back, Gibbs.

401
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,421
You think she's already dead.

402
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,981
l think today's a real bad day to be
the director of NClS, Officer David.

403
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,467
That's a nice plane out there.

404
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,662
G-Three, right?

405
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,225
l wouldn't know.

406
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,260
Range, 41 00 nautical miles,

407
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,181
unless you risk refuelling.

408
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,625
But you don't look like
the European type to me.

409
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,219
l'm thinking more Mexico
or the Caribbean.

410
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,582
Yeah, Mexico would be great.

411
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,469
My baby brother's always wanted
to see Cabo.

412
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,860
Maybe you can take him there...

413
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,344
...in 30 to 40 years.

414
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,548
Where's your pilot, Dempsey?

415
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,780
l told you. He's on his way.

416
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,464
What the hell? You've got her
in full view of the window, mate.

417
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,426
- l tried to tell him.
- No one's gonna see her.

418
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,342
That's a dangerous assumption.

419
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,628
Who knows how many people saw you
stuff me in your car?

420
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,099
You've kidnapped the head
of a federal agency.

421
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,500
They take that very seriously.

422
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,820
Look, l know you're tight
with your brother, mate,

423
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,309
but you are not thinking.

424
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,621
- She's just messing with you.
- Well, she's doing a good job of it.

425
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,300
How exactly do you see this thing
working out?

426
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,825
We should have just shot her
like her damn driver.

427
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,821
l gave NClS two hours.

428
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,060
They've only got 58 minutes left.
Just relax.

429
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,983
We're gone as soon as
your fly-boy shows up.

430
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,629
We're not leaving
without my brother.

431
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,621
lt's your brother who screwed up.

432
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,020
Now l've got to explain to my bosses
how you lost our product

433
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,748
and you don't have the money
to pay for it.

434
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,628
- l'm getting it back.
- Yeah?

435
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,385
Good luck with that

436
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,825
because l'm not sticking around
to find out.

437
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,979
Looks like you have a difficult decision,
James.

438
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,663
lt's either him or your brother.

439
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,504
l trust you remembered my tea
this time, Mr. Palmer.

440
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,539
lt's only me, Ducky.
And l'm empty-handed.

441
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,899
Well, the coffee stand
is unable to master the art

442
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,186
of brewing a decent cup
of Earl Grey.

443
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,578
Those are from Brian Dempsey?

444
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,469
Yeah. l cannot discuss it with you,
my dear. l don't mean to be rude.

445
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,699
No, l understand, Ducky.

446
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,747
And you probably shouldn't be
down here.

447
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,783
l shouldn't be here.
l shouldn't be in the field.

448
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,418
Can you please,
please tell me where l should be?

449
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,263
Well, l can understand
your feelings of alienation.

450
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,467
Everyone's avoiding me.
Do they think l'm going to lose control,

451
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,348
just enter the building
and massacre everyone?

452
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,466
l mean,
l'm being treated like a leopard.

453
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,825
l believe the phrase is ''like a leper.''

454
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,748
Look, Ziva, you mustn't start
blaming yourself.

455
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,343
l don't.

456
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,866
l know where l hit Brian Dempsey.

457
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,543
l know how severely l hit him.

458
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,301
And, Ducky, l know.
l know l didn't kill him.

459
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,585
Then why are you here?

460
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,981
Because l need for you
to tell Gibbs that.

461
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,746
Tell me what, Ziva?

462
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,623
That the BOLO came back on the car
the director was kidnapped in.

463
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,065
lt was abandoned three miles
from the hotel.

464
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,141
lt's en route to NClS.

465
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,141
lt should be here--

466
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,065
Back to your desk.

467
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,178
l am of no use chained to a computer,
Gibbs.

468
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,908
l should be out looking for her. l--

469
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,460
lt wasn't a suggestion,
Officer David.

470
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,306
- l--
- l don't care.

471
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,428
Don't you think you're being hard
on her?

472
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,864
Not the time to hold hands, Ducky.

473
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,429
Even though you feel
she's blameless?

474
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,818
You have anything to back that up?

475
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,629
l found blood on Mr. Dempsey's
brain tissue.

476
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,146
He may have died
of an intracranial haemorrhage.

477
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,345
May have?

478
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,104
Yes, well, l sent the tissue up
for a full neural report.

479
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,306
lf that turns out to be the case,

480
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,463
the haemorrhaging could be the result
of a pre-existing condition.

481
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,349
Or a well-placed strike to the jugular.

482
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,341
Yeah. At this point, Jethro,
the truth is anybody's guess.

483
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,263
l thought you didn't believe
in voodoo.

484
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,384
This isn't voodoo, McGee.
lt's tarot.

485
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,824
The ancient art of divination.

486
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,345
So you're using tarot cards to find
the director?

487
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,104
Of course not.
lt just helps me think.

488
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,061
We have less than an hour,
so l mean, you could be working.

489
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,790
l am identifying the mystery goo
from Brian Dempsey's sneaker.

490
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,302
And don't forget the old saying:
''A watched G.C. mass spec--''

491
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,108
Never boils.

492
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,181
Well, l was going to say
never compares well

493
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,739
to the concentration of atomic mass,
but where's my CAF-POW?

494
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,104
We're in a time crunch here.

495
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,949
- You have to do this one caffeine free.
- Bite your tongue.

496
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,065
Rule number nine,
always keep a spare.

497
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,949
l thought Gibbs said nine was
always carry a knife.

498
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,499
Not Gibbs' rules. Mine.

499
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,301
l got the physical evidence
from the director's car.

500
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,785
Cigarette butts, empty coffee cup

501
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,623
and a half-sucked breath mint.

502
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,666
Nothing that gets us closer
to James Dempsey's location.

503
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,584
Ah, tarot. The ancient art
of divination.

504
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,662
Guys, l've got something.

505
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,908
l've got something here.

506
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,105
l've plotted on the map
the locations where Brian Dempsey

507
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,226
made credit-card purchases
in the last six months.

508
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,268
That's gas, ATM withdrawals,
motel rooms, everything.

509
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,308
Then l cross-referenced the cell
towers that his phone interfaced with.

510
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,983
l can literally map out his life.

511
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,142
Strip clubs, escort services,
off-track betting.

512
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,902
The guy had so much to live for.

513
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,105
According to my programme,

514
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,058
Brian Dempsey spent the majority
of his time in this 50-square-mile area.

515
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,790
And this helps us
find the director how?

516
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,461
lt helps us narrow down
the search radius.

517
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,066
Do you have any idea how long it takes
to search 50 square miles, McGee?

518
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,822
Too long.

519
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,225
His name was Stanley.

520
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,939
The man you murdered
in the parking garage, James.

521
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,582
l didn't kill your driver.

522
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,107
l tried to stop it.

523
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,343
Good.

524
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,469
Then you still have a chance
of getting out of it.

525
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,542
lt's more than l can say
for your boss out there.

526
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,507
He's not my boss.

527
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,102
He's a business partner.

528
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,225
Well, l'd keep an eye on
your business partner if l were you.

529
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,786
Yeah? Why's that?

530
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,180
Because it sounds like
he's about to take off without you.

531
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,578
- What are you doing?.
- The pilot's here. We're leaving.

532
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,342
l'm about to make the call.

533
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,786
You really think the feds are going
to negotiate with you, mate?

534
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,939
Yeah, l do.

535
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,862
Than you're even dumber
than your kid brother.

536
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,179
They'll bring him and our drugs

537
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,818
if they wanna see
their director alive again.

538
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,220
That's what's
holding you back, huh?

539
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,621
Easy to fix.

540
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,822
l just shot him
to get my brother back.

541
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,859
What do you think
l'll do to you?

542
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,783
Tick-tock, McGee.

543
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,941
James Dempsey should be calling
any second.

544
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,586
Tactical's pre-positioned
in the search grid.

545
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,103
Okay, trace programme's
almost ready.

546
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,022
Just need another computer
for backup.

547
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,182
Oh, Ziva. You're not using this,
are you?

548
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,942
Thanks.

549
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,101
l'm being wasted here.

550
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,830
You'll need me when James Dempsey
finds out his brother's dead.

551
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,105
We don't need the brother.

552
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,022
Once we have a location,
we take him out.

553
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,623
All the more reason why
l should be--

554
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,944
Okay, we're connected.
Trace starts when you pick up, boss.

555
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,225
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Listen carefully.</i>

556
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,109
- One car, one agent in the back.
- Put Director Shepard on.

557
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,262
You're wasting time, Agent Gibbs.
Time you don't have.

558
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,500
Put her on or the deal's off.

559
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,379
He wants to know if you're still alive.

560
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,619
Play nice and you'll stay that way.

561
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,468
- l'm fine, Jethro. Wish l had my coat.
- Enough.

562
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,064
<i>One car. One agent in the back.</i>

563
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,266
Drugs in the trunk. Brian drives.

564
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,862
<i>See you in 45 minutes.</i>

565
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,383
<i>Where are we driving?</i>

566
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,830
Leave that to my brother.
He knows where.

567
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,863
<i>Don't be late.</i>

568
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,905
Boss, Dempsey made the call
over a VOlP system.

569
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,389
That's voice-over lnternet protocol.

570
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,939
lt's a wireless signal
converted to analogue.

571
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,748
How long to trace it, McGee?

572
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,343
Three hours,
maybe two if l'm lucky.

573
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,149
- He said 45 minutes, probie.
- Find another way.

574
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,540
How, Gibbs? The only person
who knows where they are is dead.

575
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,065
Did Brian Dempsey say anything
to you before you killed him?

576
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,380
l mean, before he collapsed and died
while in your custody?

577
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,348
l told you once, l did not kill that man,
so stop making accusations that--

578
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,468
Hey. She said she wanted her coat.

579
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,621
ls she trying to tell us something?

580
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,781
Maybe she's cold.

581
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,502
- Someplace cold.
- She left something in her coat?

582
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,709
She left it on the plane.

583
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,024
- She's at an airport.
- How do you know she's at an air--?

584
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,980
Of course. She's at an airport.

585
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,062
Pulling up every airport
in a 45-minute drive from here.

586
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,458
Gibbs.

587
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,949
There's gotta be at least a dozen.

588
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,941
We'll never have time
to sweep them all.

589
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,340
Maybe we won't have to.
DiNozzo, McGee, with me.

590
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,421
On your six, boss.

591
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,187
l got the results back
from Brian Dempsey's shoe goo.

592
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,066
lt's a smorgasbord of Juicy Fruit,
chewing tobacco, dog poo--

593
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,709
What's the point, Abby?

594
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,419
There are also trace elements
of diolane and hexylene glycol.

595
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,069
lt's fire suppression foam.

596
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,461
So l'm thinking a manufacturing plant
or a firehouse--

597
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,827
- Abby, they're at an airport.
- Or an airport.

598
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,550
Because they use it on the runway
for emergency landings.

599
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,348
You remember a few weeks ago,

600
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,229
there was a commuter plane
with faulty landing gear?

601
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,462
Yeah, we watched it on ZNN waiting
to see if it was gonna crash and burn.

602
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,781
- lt was diverted to a small airfield.
- Which one, McGee?

603
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,183
lt's Potomac Air--

604
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,420
The Potomac Airfield.

605
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,261
Got the airport layout, Gibbs.

606
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,424
l recommend we seal it off,

607
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,023
go through with tactical assault.

608
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,545
lt's an airfield.
Do you expect to sneak up on him?

609
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,428
We don't exactly have a choice.
lf his brother--

610
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,387
Wasn't dead?
l think we've established that.

611
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,541
David's right. We go in small.

612
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,508
Cassie, McGee, find out what building
they're holding the director in.

613
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,423
- How?
- l don't care, McGee. Trace the call.

614
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,740
Find out what planes are scheduled
to take off. Just find it.

615
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,423
On it.

616
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,023
Hey.

617
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,063
Hey. Come on.

618
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,901
One problem, boss.
He's expecting his brother to drive.

619
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,789
Well, then we give him what he wants.
We give him his brother.

620
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,378
- Well l guess l should thank you.
- For what?

621
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,583
Him.

622
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,500
Friends are important, but in the end,
family's all we really have.

623
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,661
Alex never understood that.

624
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,707
You did me a favour.

625
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,987
Well, let me do you another one.

626
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,900
You're a smart guy, James.
You know this isn't gonna end well.

627
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,386
They are going to kill you.

628
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,427
Maybe even your brother.

629
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,707
Are you willing to risk Brian's life?

630
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,303
Well, that all depends.

631
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,065
ls NClS willing to risk yours?

632
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,378
You try something like that
with me again,

633
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,381
l will send you back in little pieces.

634
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,224
This is the second stupidest thing
l've ever done.

635
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,584
Want to know what the first was?

636
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,864
No. Less talking.

637
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,386
Right. We should just tape the dead
guy's hands to the steering wheel.

638
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,824
On it, boss.

639
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,141
Here we go. lt's showtime, Bernie.

640
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,103
lt's 3 and 1 1 .

641
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,028
2 and 1 0.

642
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,859
And that explains a lot.
Okay, all right.

643
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,863
l need you to hold his head up here,
all right?

644
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,699
- McGee?
- <i>Yeah, boss.</i>

645
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,622
We're at the airport.
Got my location yet?

646
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,668
l'm still working on the trace, boss.
We've localised the DNS servers.

647
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,027
Having a little bit of trouble matching
the computer's profile to the subnet's.

648
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,305
<i>Cassie. What about you?</i>

649
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,426
l need every scheduled flight--

650
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,348
No, today's flight plans.

651
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,228
Boss, she's still working
on the flight plans.

652
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,267
Work faster.

653
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,660
They never had this much trouble
with Bernie.

654
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,343
Who the hell is Bernie?

655
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,228
<i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>.
A cinematic masterpiece.

656
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,139
lt's, you know, blend of the comedic
and the--

657
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,028
Thumbs down from the boss man.

658
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,464
We're out of time.

659
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,622
Gibbs, the only non-commercial aircraft
cleared to leave Potomac is from--

660
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,623
- Hangar number three.
- We're sending out the coordinates.

661
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,342
Are you sure this isn't the stupidest
thing you've ever done, DiNozzo?

662
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,943
We're ready to go.

663
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,459
Time's up.

664
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,099
You were right.

665
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,064
Looks like your people don't care
about you after all.

666
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,108
l told you.

667
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,740
NClS does not negotiate
with criminals, James.

668
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,708
Well, you better hope they're willing
to make an exception for you.

669
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,184
Are you trying to make me sick
or something, Tony?

670
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,022
You know what,
l can't see out the windshield.

671
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,586
l'm driving with my hands and
l still think l'm driving better than you.

672
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,785
To the left.

673
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,305
The other left.

674
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,029
lt's hard to concentrate when your
head is three inches from a guy's--

675
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,384
- Watch out!
- Which way?

676
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,427
You're driving straight into
an airplane hangar.

677
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,387
Could you be a little more specific?
Which way?

678
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,824
Make a left.

679
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,622
Now go straight.

680
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,269
Tony, straight.

681
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,224
Looks like your people came through
for you after all.

682
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,221
So you're home free.

683
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,142
l'm not stupid.

684
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,266
l know they'll have people following.

685
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,059
But in five minutes, l'll be 25,000 feet
over the Atlantic. Get up.

686
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,783
- You see him?
- Not yet.

687
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,225
Just remember,
Gibbs doesn't want you taking a shot

688
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,620
until the director's clear.

689
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,583
You, out of the car.

690
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,544
Hands on your head.

691
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,542
Cuff yourself.
Hands behind your back.

692
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,429
l said, cuff yourself.

693
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,388
Now lie down.

694
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,299
Very clever.

695
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,627
Brian, get the drugs
and take them on the plane.

696
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,064
They're right behind you.

697
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,740
Get the damn drugs, Brian.

698
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,863
Brian.

699
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,738
They killed him.
You killed my baby brother.

700
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,947
lt's actually a pretty interesting story.

701
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,228
l'm fine, Jethro.

702
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,302
Really.

703
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,619
lt's a probie mistake.
l should have known better.

704
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,587
Never should have let my guard down.

705
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,139
How many times have we said that?

706
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,262
Stanley was a hell of an agent.

707
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,182
He didn't deserve this.

708
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,499
And l know what you're gonna say.

709
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,343
l'm the director now,
it comes with the territory.

710
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,580
But l hope to God
l never get used to it.

711
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,666
Are you ever gonna say anything?

712
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,183
Have a drink.

713
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,865
l have the results of Brian Dempsey's
neuropath report.

714
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,545
The haemorrhaging was caused
by a congenital defect

715
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,270
in the subarachnoid artery.

716
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,022
He died of a brain aneurism?

717
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,703
Present since birth.

718
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,542
The young man
was a walking time bomb.

719
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,587
Every time bomb
has a trigger, Duck.

720
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,100
Well, anything could have
precipitated his death.

721
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,862
A cough, a sneeze.

722
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,225
A blow to the throat?

723
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,541
Sounds like natural causes to me.

724
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,706
Exactly the way l ruled it.
