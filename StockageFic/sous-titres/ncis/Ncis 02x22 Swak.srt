1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,200
Wow. What'd you do, spend
the night sake-bombing?

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,840
It's a cold, Tony.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
"Sake-bombing"?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Oh, come on, Kate, don't tell me
you've never heard of sake-bombing.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,280
Would I ask if...?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,440
Forget it.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,680
I don't want to know.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,120
You take a cup of hot sake, you drop
it in a beer, you toss it back, and...

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,520
Sake-bombing.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,760
Great for a cold.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,960
I'll stick to honey and hot tea, thanks.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,240
McGee, Kate's never been sake-bombing.

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Yeah, I don't think I have, either.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
I work with a pair of wankers.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,560
And you make three, DiNozzo.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,240
Morning, boss.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,120
Morning.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,960
Cold or flu?

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Just plain cold.

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,880
Don't worry, I will
sneeze into my tissues...

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,680
unlike some people.

22
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,600
I have allergies, Kate.

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,680
Never had allergies.

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,640
Never had a cold.

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,440
Never had a cold?

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,480
Nope. Never had the flu, either.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Why do I believe that?

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,720
If you were a bug,
would you attack Gibbs?

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
I get colds all the time.

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
Of course you do, Probie.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,480
This one is just addressed
to "NCIS Special Agent."

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I think that's mine, McGee.

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,000
Huh? How do you know?

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
I recognize the lips.

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
And the scent.

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
Gummy bears?

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,440
We've opened a letter with white powder.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,600
Use the southeast corridor
to the holding room.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,840
You all know the drill.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,360
Tony.

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,960
Letter opened in Special Agent Gibbs's
office dispersed a fine white powder.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Initiating bio attack procedures.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,440
Third floor is evacuating.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,880
McGee, you up on procedures?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,080
Yeah, we, uh, we shower, burn
our clothes, get our blood tested.

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,760
Nobody leaves the building until
the substance is identified except...

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
Lucky me.

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,680
I win a free trip to Bethesda
to be pricked like a pincushion.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,640
They've shut down the air.

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
Let's hit the showers, Tony.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,160
Thought you'd never ask.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,920
Sorry, boss.

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Who would send me a letter with anthrax?

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,560
Pick a girl, Tony any girl.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
That's not funny, Kate.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,840
Yeah, I know.

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
This is serious.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,840
I know, Tony; I'm sorry.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,360
At this very instant, someone is
incinerating my Ermenegildo Zegna suit,

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
my Armani tie, my Dolce Gabbana
shirt and my Gucci shoes.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,760
Hey, you know, it might not be anthrax.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
I like the sound of that, Probie

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,840
Yeah, it could be smallpox,
bubonic plague, cholera...

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,680
Probie!

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,080
...foot powder, face
powder, talcum powder...

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,360
Honey dust!

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,560
"Honey dust"?

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Honey dust.

69
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,640
I give it to girls.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Women-
sorry, Kate.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,040
I give it to women at Christmastime.

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Very sensuous.

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
You apply it with a feather.

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,800
You don't use the whole chicken?

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
I never heard oney dust.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
Yeah, that's because your mother
raised you to respect women, McGee.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,120
It makes a woman's skin feel silky sh.

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,880
When kissed, it tastes like honey.

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,480
Got a box of Honey dust last Christmas.

80
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,040
No card.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,280
Think the post office screwed up, Boss.

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
Someone else gotr bottle
of Jack and you got their...

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,880
Doesn't the post office
irradiate our mail?

84
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,880
Yeah, that's right!

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,280
All Federal mail is funneled
through the Ion Beam facility

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,760
at Bridgeport, New Jersey.

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
If it has DNA, it dies.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,720
The diseases that you
name, they have DNA?

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,640
They do.

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
Oh, you should have let him squirm.

91
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,200
Then, it's no worries!

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,080
Unless the post office screwed up again.

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
You should have given
the letter to me, McGee.

94
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,760
I know, boss.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
It's not McGee's fault.

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,960
Tony snatched it out of his hands.

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,120
So, it ad?

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
You did grab it, Tony.

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,760
Lame excuse, Probie.

100
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,760
You should have stopped me.

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
Where do you t you're going?

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Find out who sent the letter.

103
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,960
You cannot leave autopsy!

104
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,720
It's negative-pressured so
airborne pathogens can't contaminate

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
e the building.

106
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,280
y, e scrubbed, sanitized...

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,960
for all I know, sterilized.

108
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,720
I have an investigation to open.

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,440
I have a possible contagion to contain.

110
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,240
Until your blood test clears you, I
cannot permit you to leave this room.

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,320
Who opened the envelope?

112
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,480
He did.

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,240
No, no, no... it wasn't me!

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm just kidding.

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
I'm your pincushion.

116
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,200
Did you inhale any powder?

117
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,040
I might have.

118
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
We took blood.

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,960
Jimmy.

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
have four blood vials on ice, to go.

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,480
It's a c I had it be
I came in this morning.

122
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,440
Which makes you even more
susceptible to airborne pathogens.

123
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,320
You should go to hospital, too.

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
no

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Kate, play it safe.

126
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,480
Go with Tony.

127
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,160
That's safe?

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,200
How long are we going to
have to stay in isolation?

129
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,400
At least overnight.

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,400
Yavubeds au hitwhen you
that creasewhen you push...

131
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,280
get anthrax, how will you feel?

132
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
Not as bad as you, DiNozzo.

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,040
t'

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
I'm warning you, DiNo

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
I do not feel well.

136
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
You need to x.

137
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,800
You need a foot massage.

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want you anywhere near my feet.

139
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,200
:You py.

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
:I don’t want you touchiy mattress.

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
If you don't el well...

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,160
arguing contin in dista electr
rock playin So how long to Atlanta?

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
Um, less than an hour.

144
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Your music's sweet.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,840
So are you... ooh!

146
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Talk to Mama.

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,400
I didn't take you for the
cheerleader type, Abby.

148
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, I'm not.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
Grammy taught me that.

150
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,520
She was an Olympic swimmer.

151
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,000
Won the silver in the
200-meter butterfly.

152
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,360
What does swimming have
to do with cartwheeling?

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,720
Nothing.

154
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,680
I don't understand.

155
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,120
You can't think logically with Abby.

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
Her mind operates like
a pachinko machine.

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
What was the powder, Abby?

158
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,040
White.

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,520
With a hint of tan.

160
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Abs...

161
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
That's all I know until
my baby speaks to me.

162
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm auto-sampling for anthrax,
botulism, plague, cholera...

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
all those nasty little bio-buggers.

164
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,160
How long?

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,320
A couple of hours.

166
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,200
I thought you said
these tests were fast.

167
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
It's not a pregnancy test, Gibbs.

168
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
You should drink more water.

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,360
Tony!

170
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
Your urine's too dark.

171
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,000
I have a cold.

172
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't believe you're
commenting on my... ew!

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Neither do I.

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
Dr. Brad Pitt.

175
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes, it's my real name
and no, we're not related.

176
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,680
Wish we were... I'd love
to meet Angelina Jolie.

177
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
If I said what he said, you'd...

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
...elbow me.

179
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,200
It's not the Four Seasons, but
let's hope you're not here long.

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Negative pressure?

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,840
Mm-hmm.

182
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
Air can flow in, but not out.

183
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,600
I'd like to meet Lieutenant Emma
Ingham, your duty nurse for tonight.

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,320
Hi, guys. How are you?

185
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
As a precaution, I'm starting
your prophylaxis with streptomycin.

186
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
Prophylaxis is a measure taken for
the prevention of disease, Tony.

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
That's why I use them.

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
Oh, you don't want to encourage him.

189
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Sorry.

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
Take any bed you want, you guys.

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Thank you, Nurse Emma.

192
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,000
But it's prudent to keep some separation
in case one of you has beeinfected.

193
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Thank you, Doctor.

194
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,960
Brad. We're informal here.

195
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Kate.

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Using sun lamps...

197
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,240
Brad?

198
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,240
UV... kills bacteria in the air...

199
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,840
although I can arrange
for a sun lamp if you wish.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, not for me.

201
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,320
It's for Kate.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,560
What?

203
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,360
Yeah, a little nude sunbathing
might get rid of those tan lines.

204
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Doctor, could you put
him to sleep? Please.

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,560
Bye, Nurse Emma.

206
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,280
Bye.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,560
SWAK?

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
It's "Sealed With a Kiss," Gibbs.

209
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Didn't you ever get a love letter?

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
Does a "Dear John" count?

211
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
I feel sorry for you, Gibbs.

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
Is there a return address?

213
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
"27 Old Mill Bottom Road,
Annapolis, Maryland."

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,920
McGee, got that?

215
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Got it.

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
Wish I had my PDA.

217
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,840
Use Ducky's.

218
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,840
Ah... Agent Gibbs, sir...

219
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,600
Dr. Mallard doesn't have...

220
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,960
Requisition replacement cell
phones and weapons for my team. Go!

221
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,240
Pistols?

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
Well, no, Palmer, crossbows, if
you think they might work better.

223
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Canceled stamp?

224
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Noon yesterday, Annapolis.

225
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,000
Open it.

226
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Normally I'd request a "please,"

227
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,600
but considering the situation...

228
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,680
Boss, I can't find Ducky's PDA.

229
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
McGee, it's a pad and a pencil.

230
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,840
Ah, beautiful calligraphy.

231
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
Beautiful paper.

232
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,480
Must be 32-pound cotton rag.

233
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
Abby, does that mean you can trace it?

234
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,560
The watermark will tell
me where it was made,

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,920
when it was made and who sold it.

236
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,440
The person that sent this
may as well have signed it.

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
You know, there was a time when
every young woman of breeding

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
was taught calligraphy.

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,920
My mother still tries,
but her hand shakes

240
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,840
so that even I can't
read all her missives.

241
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
Can you read this missive, Ducky?

242
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,520
Oh, yes.

243
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,520
It's perfectly legible.

244
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,360
I think he means read it out loud.

245
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, sorry.

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Of course.

247
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,680
Uh... "If you are reading
this "and have not initiated

248
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,360
"biological attack procedures,
"I suggest you do so immediately,

249
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,920
"since the powder dispersed
"by opening this envelope

250
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,880
"contains genetically altered...

251
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:48,720
...Y. pestis!"

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Which is Latin for what...?

253
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:55,960
Plague.

254
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,100
The powder in that envelope
carries bubonic plague?

255
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,860
Pneumonic is me likely.

256
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,860
There's more than one?

257
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,860
Oh, there are three, actually.

258
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,900
But pneumonic is by far the most
dangerous since it can be spread

259
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,340
simply by breathing
the Y. Pestis particles.

260
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
Tony must have breathed in some of it.

261
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,220
It may not be alive.

262
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,140
Y. Pestis needs a host or moisture for
it to survive more than a few hours.

263
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,780
Plus, it was irradiated when
it when through the mail, boss.

264
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,300
I got Honey Dust for Christmas, McGee!

265
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,060
I'll narrow my test
to pneumonic Y. Pestis.

266
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,380
If I can isolate the
strain, then Bethesda

267
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:39,060
can hit it with a specific antibiotic.

268
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Yeah, well, that may not help.

269
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,020
It says here, "I have
genetically altered the Y. Pestis

270
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,660
to render it impervious
to antimicrobials."

271
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,340
That bitch!

272
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,980
She created a strain that
antibiotics can't whack!

273
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,540
Ducky, give Bethesda a heads up.

274
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,100
Right.

275
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,580
A SWAK does not mean that this
bitch couldn't be a bastard.

276
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,340
You're so right, Gibbs.

277
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,220
I have this friend who's a transvestite.

278
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,820
Her lips could out-SWAK
Angelina Jolie's.

279
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,940
Remember, McGee?

280
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,140
You met her at my birthday party.

281
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,420
Yeah. The, uh, low-cut red dress
with the built-in plastic...

282
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,060
I saw that, Gibbs!

283
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,420
Read, or you'll feel it!

284
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,220
Not while you're down there.

285
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,020
What?

286
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,260
"However, there is an antidote..."

287
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,700
She made a magic bullet!

288
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,260
"...which, if administered within 32 of
infection, "will eradicate the disease.

289
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,660
"To procure the antidote, "NCIS
must make public the true results

290
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,660
reported in dossier
R- Zero Three-Seven-Seven."

291
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,500
McGee, pull up the file.

292
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,060
Yeah. Romeo Zero
Three-Seven-Seven.

293
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,700
On it, boss!

294
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,380
That it?

295
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,620
That's all she wrote.

296
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,460
It's gilded inside.

297
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,740
I can see the SWAK through...

298
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,300
We have a moisture strip in here!

299
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,780
Yeah, keeping the bug alive
until the letter is opened.

300
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,620
Afraid so, Gibbs.

301
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,100
Check that canceled stamp, Abs!

302
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,540
One way to get around postal irradiation
to not to use the post office!

303
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,620
I- I spoke with a Doctor Brad Pitt.

304
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,540
You're kidding.

305
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,620
No, that's his name.

306
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,860
He made a point of stressing he is
not related in any way to the actor.

307
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,660
Hey, did you hear when,
um, Brad and Jen split up...

308
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,180
Abby!

309
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,300
Gibbs, I can't until I can
put this under a microscope.

310
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,900
And I can't do until NCID
gives me approval to irradiate.

311
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,260
Okay. Which will be when?

312
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,380
The Navy is sending a sample to Atlanta.

313
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,300
It should be there...

314
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,460
well, now.

315
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,900
And then it'll be 12
hours for DNA confirmation.

316
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
Duck, what's the incubation period?

317
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,700
A day at most.

318
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,300
How long until it kills?

319
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,020
Oh, not very long, I'm afraid.

320
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,820
In the fourteenth century, the
novelist Boccaccio wrote that plague

321
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,940
victims had lunch with
their friends and dinner

322
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,140
with their ancestors in paradise.

323
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,460
McGee, where's the file?!

324
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,700
Boss, I cannot access it...

325
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,100
Ducky, e're coming up!

326
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,860
No, we've already been
through this, Gibbs.

327
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,540
You can't!

328
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,500
Know what this feels like?

329
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,100
I'm afraid to ask.

330
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,900
Like I'm the King of Cool.

331
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,180
Elvis?

332
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,700
Elvis was the King of Rock and Roll.

333
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,340
Travolta is the King of Cool.

334
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,460
Well, thanks for the clarification.

335
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
And do you know why
I feel like Travolta?

336
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,100
I feel a movie coming on.

337
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.

338
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,540
Travolta plays this boy born
with an immune deficiency.

339
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,980
This was before AIDS.

340
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,380
He lives in this giant plastic bubble.

341
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,620
Tony...

342
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,980
Tony, please.

343
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,740
We're stuck here together.

344
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,420
Could we just make a pact?

345
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Until we're out, I won't make fun
of all the stupid things you say,

346
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,620
and you won't tell me
any more film scenarios.

347
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,900
Deal?

348
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,900
Deal.

349
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,260
Thank you.

350
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,020
Emma.

351
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,740
Yes?

352
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,380
You may find this of interest.

353
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,100
You look pretty without
the mask, by the way.

354
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,940
Ralph Bellamy plays the doctor.

355
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,220
Now, Ralph Bellamy was
this great old-time actor-

356
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,500
he was in His Girl Friday with
Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.

357
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,660
I cannot believe that
Gibbs broke protocol!

358
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:09,420
He didn't.

359
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,420
He left autopsy.

360
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,020
But not isolation.

361
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:15,820
McGee.

362
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,460
Yeah?

363
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,420
You use Abby's computer
to access that case file.

364
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,940
On it.

365
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,460
Okay.

366
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,020
Abby.

367
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,260
Pull surveillance videos
from the squad room-

368
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,580
everything from 2300
last night, when I left,

369
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,940
until McGee came in this morning.

370
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,500
You got to get a life, Gibbs.

371
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,820
Last thing I need is another wife.

372
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,300
Life. You got to get a life.

373
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,100
Boss! Boss, I found the file.

374
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,860
It's a rape case.

375
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Get the investigating agent down here.

376
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,300
I- I can't. It was Pacci.

377
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,220
Put it up on the plasma, McGee.

378
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,780
Okay.

379
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,860
Sarah Lowell, age 21.

380
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,100
Senior at Vassar.

381
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,140
Raped February 10, '01, at the
Admiral's Bay Hotel in Annapolis.

382
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,860
Surely you remember the case, Jethro.

383
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,980
The maid found the poor
girl naked, tied to the bed

384
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,740
two days after she was raped.

385
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,980
Duck, contact Cassie Yates in Norfolk.

386
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,020
Tell her what happened.

387
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,980
I need her help.

388
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,940
Yeah, good idea.

389
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,780
Gibbs, I thought Cassie was
working narcotics suppression?

390
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,940
Four years ago, Cassie
was Pacci's probie.

391
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,100
The victim was visiting
Annapolis to register

392
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,660
for an advanced study
program at Saint John's.

393
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,060
Police had the case for three
days before they called us in.

394
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,500
They found a Navy suspect?

395
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,260
A dozen of them firsties were partying
at the hotel the night of the assault.

396
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,780
Firsties?

397
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Academy seniors.

398
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,420
They'd just got their
fleet assignments, and...

399
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,780
Are you scanning?

400
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,700
Gibbs, I can multitask:
I can listen to you;

401
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,860
I can scan the video;
I can rub my tummy...

402
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,380
DNA testing cleared them.

403
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,820
Closed our investigation.

404
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,420
But someone wants it reopened.

405
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,460
McGee!

406
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,780
Call Annapolis PD.

407
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
I want their file on this case.

408
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,740
I spoke to Cassie.

409
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
She remembers the case.

410
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,580
She'll be here in 15 minutes.

411
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
From Norfolk?

412
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,660
No, Anacostia.

413
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,140
She's working a drug sting.

414
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,980
Boss... Boss, I can't call.

415
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,460
They're not gonna be able to hear me.

416
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm gonna use the computer.

417
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,740
Gibbs!

418
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,020
Look who else doesn't have a life.

419
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,820
Tony came back around midnight.

420
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,940
He does his best work at night.

421
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,500
So he tells us.

422
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,700
Here's Tony leaving.

423
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,460
That's Ben, the mail boy.

424
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,980
He didn't do it.

425
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,900
Why not?

426
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,100
He's a vegan.

427
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,820
Hitler was a vegan.

428
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,460
Hitler was a vegetarian.

429
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,700
Big difference.

430
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,860
Vegans are so against cruelty, they won't
even use cosmetics tested on animals.

431
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,940
Abigail?

432
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,260
Could...

433
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,980
Y. Pestis be altered to
withstand irradiation?

434
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,700
No way.

435
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Altered or not, it's
still a living organism.

436
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,140
Could the gilding in
the envelope protect it?

437
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,820
It would have to be at
least ten mils thick.

438
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,340
This is barely one.

439
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,340
Abby, I do not want to
hear any more uh-ohs.

440
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,220
Sorry.

441
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,300
But this SWAK didn't bleed through.

442
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,420
There's another one inside.

443
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,460
Get that letter out here
where you can examine it!

444
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,740
Gibbs, I told you, I have
to wait for Atlanta to...

445
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,740
Any doubt it's pneumonic plague?

446
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,660
No, but...

447
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
Then no buts, okay?

448
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
We're losing time.

449
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,140
Kill those bugs!

450
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,380
Now!

451
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,960
Think they really zap bugs?

452
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
What?

453
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
These blue lights.

454
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
Are you serious?

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
Ever heard of a placebo, Kate?

456
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,680
Tony...

457
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
placebos are administered
for a psychological effect.

458
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,720
Precisely. How do you know these lamps

459
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,440
aren't there to make us
think they're helping, hmm?

460
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,560
Maybe because they're there to kill
whatever bugs we breathe into the air.

461
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,240
You may have a point.

462
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,800
You're afraid, aren't you?

463
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,200
Kate, come on.

464
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
Me afraid?

465
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,680
You ever seen me afraid?

466
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,840
Well, not when the danger's
something that we can confront.

467
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,200
But all we can do here is lie around
and hope that we're not infected.

468
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
Now who's afraid?

469
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,920
Anyone with half a brain.

470
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,240
I take that back.

471
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,320
You're not afraid.

472
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,680
All the blood cultures came back negative
except for Special Agent DiNozzo's.

473
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,360
He's infected with Y. Pestis.

474
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,480
Damn it, Abby.

475
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,240
How much longer?

476
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:41,760
Gibbs.

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,480
Patience is not your virtue, is it?

478
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:45,000
Look at the plasma.

479
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,560
Moldy bread?

480
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,360
It's a Y. pestis microbe
from the powder in the letter.

481
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,000
This the Y. Pestis as
the human race has known

482
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,920
it for half the millennium the strain
of the plague to fight with antibiotics.

483
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,760
The one in the letter has blue tips.

484
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,480
It's been genetically
altered to resist antibiotics.

485
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
You catch that, you're
stuck in the dark ages,

486
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,760
which personally I wouldn't
mind, until it killed me.

487
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160
This wasn't whipped up
in your local meth house.

488
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
No, this took a hot molecular biologist

489
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,400
and a big-bucks lab to
make this bio-weapon.

490
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,200
Oh, my baby's calling.

491
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,440
I ran a mass spec on the SWAK.

492
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
You're analyzing lipstick
instead of the letter?

493
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Well, I figured anyone who's into
calligraphy has got to wear esoteric lipstick.

494
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
And since all lipsticks
are tested by the FDA...

495
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,680
You'll identify the brand.

496
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,800
Yeah. If it's as rare as I think
it is, I can find out who sold it.

497
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,280
Oh, yeah, that's good thinking, Abbs.

498
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,120
What?

499
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,200
Good thinking, Abby!

500
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,920
I don't know, Gibbs, I can't hear you.

501
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,640
It must be the helmet on your head.

502
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,760
Good thinking.

503
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:43,800
Not nice, Gibbs.

504
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,680
Not nice.

505
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,320
This is weird.

506
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,040
All the basics are there
wax, oil, eosin dye,

507
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
titanium dioxide, but
they're at such low levels...

508
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,800
Whoa.

509
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,360
What is that?

510
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,440
The reason the Y. Pestis
survived postal irradiation.

511
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,160
72 percent of the lipstick is pure lead.

512
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,640
A lead SWAK on the
outside of the envelope.

513
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,440
Lead SWAK on the inside.

514
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,560
In between?

515
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,560
Y. pestis on a moisture pad.

516
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,520
This is one smart bitch.

517
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,160
Wash your mouth out with purple soap.

518
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,520
Cassie.

519
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,560
Well, are you suppressing
drugs or selling them?

520
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,560
Working undercover.

521
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,920
Everything I'm wearing's confiscated,

522
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,080
even the La Perla underwear.

523
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,760
Nice.

524
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,640
Gibbs, is that you playing Teletubby?

525
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,800
This the anthrax letter?

526
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
It's not anthrax, it's plague.

527
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,600
Thank God.

528
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Anthrax scares the
hell out of me. May I?

529
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Yeah.

530
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
I know this return address.

531
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,080
Back-tracked it to the Admiral's Bay
Hotel, Annapolis, where the girl was raped.

532
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Gibbs. Gibbs.

533
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,640
All the blood tests came
back negative except...

534
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,280
Tony.

535
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,120
Yeah.

536
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,600
Get it off, Duck.

537
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,960
Is he sick yet?

538
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,120
Not outwardly, but the doctor
says his temperature's elevating.

539
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,560
The Y. pestis is attacking
his pulmonary system.

540
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,880
Hi, Cassie.

541
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,520
Hey, Ducky.

542
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,480
How far are we into
this 32-hour window?

543
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,280
Too far.

544
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,880
Tony will begin coughi soon.

545
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,840
When his sputum becomes bloody,
he'll only have a few hours to live.

546
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,360
Abby, get that damn letter out of there.

547
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm getting it.

548
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,720
This is too easy, Gibbs.

549
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,640
Custom paper and
calligraphy that's traceable.

550
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,120
A gene-altering
bio-attack.

551
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,320
You know who sent it.

552
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,160
No.

553
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,120
But I know who they
want us to think sent it.

554
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,560
Bedtime snack, Brad?

555
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,120
Mm. I.V. drip increases the
efficacy of streptomycin.

556
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,440
They teach you "efficacy"
at Harvard Medical?

557
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,400
Michigan.

558
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,440
Can't be.

559
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
It's too weird.

560
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,120
Why, you a Wolverine, too?

561
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
Buckeye.

562
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,160
Wait.

563
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,960
You're that DiNozzo?

564
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
'92. Columbus.

565
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,000
We kissed our sisters.

566
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,560
13-13 tie.

567
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,000
You broke your leg
in the fourth quarter.

568
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,920
You broke my leg in the fourth quarter.

569
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,120
Oh, my God.

570
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,720
They're gonna start bonging beers next.

571
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,720
I don't think so.

572
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,680
Oh, no, you don't know, Tony.

573
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,600
He epitomizes sophomoric.

574
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,920
His blood test came back positive.

575
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,320
Positive...

576
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,200
You're okay.

577
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,800
He's the only one infected.

578
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,200
So you didn't feel like
an old man at spring break?

579
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,360
You kidding?

580
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,600
Coeds love a... mature man who can
bong a beer in under six seconds.

581
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,960
Leaves me out.

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,560
So tell me, Doc, what have I got?

583
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
Pneumonic plague.

584
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,640
Plague?

585
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,960
Plague.

586
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, Tony, plague.

587
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
'Cause only you would go off and
get a disease from the Dark Ages.

588
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,880
I didn't put plague in the letter.

589
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,440
You opened it.

590
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
Yeah, so I opened it.

591
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,200
What are you so upset about?

592
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
It's not like you're lying...

593
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,440
Yeah.

594
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,440
That's right, Travolta.

595
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
I'm infected, too.

596
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
Oh, Kate, I'm sorry.

597
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,640
Well, you're going to be sorrier.

598
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
No. Don't tell me Gibbs got it?

599
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,360
No, no. Just us.

600
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,080
But I am going to make your life hell.

601
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,080
How? You can't be worse than plague.

602
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,360
Maybe you can.

603
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,720
Maybe she can.

604
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,960
I'm warning you, DiNozzo.

605
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,440
You know, I recall a
couple of plague flicks.

606
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm going to tell Emma
all of your dating tricks.

607
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,600
Flesh and Blood comes to mind.

608
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,800
Paul Verhoeven directed.

609
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Rutger Hauer starred.

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,200
Tony thinks speaking
Italian turns women on.

611
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,840
Obviously you never saw Jamie
Lee Curtis in A Fish called Wanda.

612
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,360
Kate...

613
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,320
I know.

614
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,800
You want to start my I.V.

615
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,160
I catch your cold, I'm
gonna be very pissed.

616
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,640
She'll be okay, right?

617
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,840
Hey, McGee.

618
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,720
Yeah?!

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,240
Special Agent Yates needs your computer.

620
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,280
Cassie.

621
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,920
Hey, McGee.

622
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,520
Can I sit in?

623
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

624
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,640
Boss...

625
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,480
Cassie and I had parking spaces
next to each other at Norfolk.

626
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
Why are you yelling at me, McGee?

627
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,200
So you can hear me
through your... helmet.

628
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,160
The blood tests were negative.

629
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,680
Sweet.

630
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,720
Not for DiNozzo.

631
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,440
Positive?

632
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Is he going to be okay?

633
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
If hisn't, he'll be answering to me.

634
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,040
Almost there.

635
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,880
No, Cassie, I already downloaded the
NCIS report from the rape investigation.

636
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
My notes are in my training file.

637
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,360
I was only a Probie, but
Pacci had me interview Sarah.

638
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah, you're a female
about the same age.

639
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,800
Easier to talk to you
than it is a male agent.

640
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,840
Didn't help.

641
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
She couldn't remember a thing.

642
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,000
Traumatic amnesia.

643
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,440
Not unusual for rape cases.

644
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,400
If she had amnesia, who
accused the midshipmen?

645
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,840
Her mother.

646
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,640
Recognize her?

647
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
Vaguely familiar.

648
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
How about in this photo?

649
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,800
Good God, yes.

650
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,160
That photo was on every
front page in the world.

651
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,440
She was more famous than Hanoi Jane.

652
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,520
Blow that up.

653
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,720
Get closer on the headband.

654
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
Oh, my God, that's a SWAK.

655
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,600
She a microbiologist?

656
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,720
No. But the best in
the world work for her.

657
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,960
Hanna's CEO of Lowell Pharmaceuticals.

658
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,640
McGee, I want a search warrant.

659
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,440
On it, boss.

660
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,680
Grab a change of clothes,
meet me downstairs in five.

661
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,640
Go to Bethesda, keep me
updated on Tony's condition.

662
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,280
Of course.

663
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,320
Find out why Kate hasn't checked in.

664
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,920
You got it.

665
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,600
I got the phones, but they
wouldn't trust me with a weapon.

666
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,920
I wouldn't either, Jimmy.

667
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,200
That's Agent DiNozzo's cell phone, sir.

668
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,440
Gibbs.

669
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,930
Why are you doing this, Kate?

670
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,210
Damned if I know.

671
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,086
But I'm doing it.

672
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,410
You're not going to tell Tony.

673
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,090
Well, I've already informed
Dr. Mallard you're not infected.

674
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,450
Ducky will understand.

675
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,850
Gibbs will be the problem.

676
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,930
No, the problem is is
that Tony can infect you.

677
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,650
What, with all the UV
lights and air scrubbers...

678
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,650
or are they just here
for patient morale?

679
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,890
I cannot permit you to stay.

680
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,290
This strain has been genetically
altered to resist antibiotics.

681
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,970
You realize what that means?

682
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,370
That the I.V. in Tony's arm is useless.

683
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,810
So why do it?

684
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,770
Well, it can't hurt.

685
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,170
And it gives him...

686
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,410
Hope?

687
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,050
Yeah.

688
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,530
Kate.

689
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,330
Tell Dr. Brad about the
wet T-shirt contest you won.

690
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,730
Tell Emma about the
transsexual you tongued.

691
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,290
That never happened.

692
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,850
That never happened...

693
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,210
Thanks for passing along the cold, Kate.

694
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,640
How do you want to handle this?

695
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,840
The subtle approach.

696
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,560
You serve the warrant.

697
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,440
I'll shove my Sig in her face.

698
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,600
Gibbs, Hanna Lowell's been arrested
at more protests than Jesse Jackson.

699
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,560
She won't be intimidated.

700
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Okay, then I'll shoot her and I'll go
after whoever made the damn bug for her.

701
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,720
You're not going to kill her.

702
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
I said shoot, not kill.

703
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
There are dozens of
microbiologists here.

704
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,800
It would take days to interrogate them.

705
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,680
Tony doesn't have days.

706
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,080
Do you know where her office is,
or should I ask the receptionist?

707
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
Boss always has the top floor office.

708
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,760
Excuse me. Excuse me!

709
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,520
You have to check in
with the receptionist.

710
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,160
Do you have an appointment?

711
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,600
No. We have a federal warrant.

712
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,320
Security alert.

713
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,280
Federal agents coming up...

714
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,960
They're here.

715
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,120
Okay.

716
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,680
It's about time you got here.

717
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,000
I left enough cookie crumbs.

718
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
You left more than cookie crumbs, lady.

719
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,280
I regret I resorted
to such a dramatic act,

720
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,240
but you people at NCIS left me no choice
when you lied to protect the Academy.

721
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,400
Now, you admit that a midshipman raped
my daughter and this will all be over.

722
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,360
The DNA testing cleared...

723
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,040
Oh, stop it.

724
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,440
I know how easy it
is to dope a DNA test.

725
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
You love dramatic acts.

726
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,360
They can be very effective.

727
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,200
The effect of this one is
going to imprison you for life.

728
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,680
That long, hmm?

729
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,160
You're dying.

730
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,800
Rather rapidly.

731
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,440
Which makes incarceration
highly unlikely.

732
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,120
From the looks of it, you want to
protect just about every living thing

733
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
on the planet except for federal agents.

734
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,520
My daughter never recovered
from the horror of that weekend.

735
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,760
The truth will help her heal.

736
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,440
Please, please give it to her.

737
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,520
You won't get that antidote
until that midshipman...

738
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,120
We don't need it.

739
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,960
The Post Office went
postal on your plague.

740
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Zapped it right through the lead SWAK.

741
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,160
No one was infected.

742
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,680
Oh, I don't believe you.

743
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,400
I don't give a damn whether
you believe me or not.

744
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,360
You are under arrest for biological
attack on a federal agency.

745
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,400
Take her to interrogation.

746
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,080
I'll wait here for the task force

747
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,760
to arrest the others.

748
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,240
You have the right to remain silent.

749
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,080
If you give up that right...

750
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,880
There are no others.

751
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,480
I acted alone.

752
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
You are not a microbiologist.

753
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,400
I stole the Y. pestis!

754
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,200
Dr. Pandy doesn't
even know it's missing.

755
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,280
Dr. Pandy.

756
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:38,800
What?

757
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,040
Where's Dr. Pandy's lab?

758
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,080
North wing, ground floor, BL-Alpha.

759
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
But you need authorization
to enter the North Wing.

760
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,720
Someone was infected.

761
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,120
I hope it was Westmoreland.

762
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,720
Lay back, Tony.

763
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
All right, everybody behind the shield.

764
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,160
Tony, I'm going to need you to
take a deep breath and hold it.

765
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
I don't think I can, Brad.

766
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,840
Maybe Emma can do it for me.

767
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,000
You have very healthy lungs, Emma.

768
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,280
Is he always like this?

769
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,480
Unfortunately.

770
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,200
Tony's humor has always been
sexist, juvenile, raunchy.

771
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,480
Funny.

772
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,040
Sometimes can be funny.

773
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
There is no antidote.

774
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,000
I developed a vaccine, not an antidote.

775
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,160
It's of no use once
the victim is infected.

776
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,680
Hanna misunderstood.

777
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,360
She understood.

778
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,280
No, it's the brain tumor.

779
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,400
That's what's killing her?

780
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,080
It's inoperable, obviously
affecting her mind.

781
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,200
Why else would a woman who fought
to ban biological weapons use them?

782
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,880
I don't know.

783
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Why is Lowell
Pharmaceutical making them?

784
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,120
We're not.

785
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,800
You didn't create this beast?

786
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Yes, but only to develop
a defense against it.

787
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,400
Antibiotic-resistant diseases
are potential terrorist weapons.

788
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
A terrorist isn't
killing my agent, you are!

789
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,520
I understand your anger.

790
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,440
No, you don't.

791
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,240
But if you don't save him, you will.

792
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,280
It has a suicide chain that
stops it from replicating

793
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,720
after 32 hours as a security precaution.

794
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,560
It dies?

795
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,680
Yes.

796
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,000
It's dead now?

797
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,320
If it's over 32 hours since
the specimen has been infected,

798
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,480
all the Y. pestis is dead.

799
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,480
However, the damage will have been done.

800
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,360
The specimen is going to die?

801
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,520
No. No, not necessarily.

802
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,280
He has the same chance of survival as
those infected in plagues of the past.

803
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,000
Probably better since he
would be healthy and young.

804
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:41,760
What was the survival rate of the past?

805
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,240
People were weakened by
depleted crops, bad nutrition.

806
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,680
Damn it!

807
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
What was the survival rate?!

808
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,560
15%.

809
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,640
It looks like pneumonia.

810
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,800
Worse, I'm afraid.

811
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
Showing signs of cyanosis.

812
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,960
His fingernails and lips are going blue.

813
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,960
The Y. pestis is starving
his body of oxygen.

814
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,000
It's too late to reverse, isn't it?

815
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,320
It's never too late.

816
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,320
Until I get the body.

817
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm sorry I teased you
with all those movies, Kate.

818
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,520
Teased?

819
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,560
You've tortured me.

820
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,120
For two years all I've heard is John
Wayne and Clint Eastwood, James Bond.

821
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,320
James Bond is a character...

822
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,000
...played by Sean Connery, George
Lazenby, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.

823
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,840
Why are you wearing the mask?

824
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
'Cause I have a cold.

825
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,000
Why aren't you sick?

826
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,640
'Cause I'm stronger than you, Tony.

827
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,240
No, you're not.

828
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,400
Am, too.

829
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,840
Tony, Tony, sit up.

830
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,240
Kate, you should
leave- now.

831
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,440
Oh, God!

832
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,800
You were brave to stay with him, Kate.

833
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,360
He's dying, Ducky!

834
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,480
Ah, the hell he is.

835
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

836
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,520
Who the hell are you?

837
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,000
His boss.

838
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
The bug had a suicide gene.

839
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,600
It's dead.

840
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,240
Been dead for over an hour.

841
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,920
He's no longer infectious.

842
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,920
Tony, listen to me.

843
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,400
You listening?

844
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,480
I'm lis...

845
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
I'm listening, boss.

846
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,360
You will not die, you got that?

847
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,640
I said, you will not die.

848
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,920
I got you, boss.

849
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,560
Good.

850
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,280
Now...

851
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,760
It's you new cell.

852
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,840
I'd get the number changed.

853
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,240
Women keep calling for "Spanky."

854
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:02,560
You need to rest.

855
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic, please.

856
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,840
Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic.

857
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,560
Can you excuse me?

858
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,680
How's Tony?

859
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,200
Ah, he'll make it.

860
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,800
What happened?

861
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,600
Hanna lost it in the car.

862
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,800
Started rambling, flashing peace signs.

863
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,520
Once she bared her breasts and shouted,

864
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
"Make love, not war,"
I drove straight here.

865
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,560
Sure it wasn't an act?

866
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,520
Her neurologist says it's the tumor.

867
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,160
He just left.

868
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,440
He wants her relead into his care.

869
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,360
Not likely.

870
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,680
He can see her here as much as he wants.

871
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,040
That Sarah?

872
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,840
Just as blank as four years ago.

873
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,560
Sarah, this is Special Agent Gibbs.

874
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,040
I am so sorry.

875
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,360
I can't believe my mother did this.

876
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,560
I knew someday Mother
would do something terrible.

877
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,200
I told her, but she wouldn't believe me.

878
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Told her?

879
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,440
That it wasn't a midshipman.

880
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,200
So, you remember who assaulted you?

881
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,400
No.

882
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,600
How do you know it wasn't a midshipman?

883
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,920
I heard they were all cleared.

884
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,200
Are you sure you don't remember?

885
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,960
Yes.

886
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,360
You know who raped
you, don't you, Sarah?

887
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,880
Sarah?

888
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,440
I wasn't raped.

889
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,440
We all thought it was funny...

890
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,680
tying me to the bed.

891
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,840
I d said that the midshipmen
looked cute in their uniform.

892
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,240
I was kidding!

893
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,240
And so when he went out to get us
some burgers and shakes, he tied me up.

894
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,360
Nobody's going to disturb you.

895
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,760
Oh, help!

896
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,240
So that way, I wouldn't
run off with one of them.

897
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,080
It was just a joke.

898
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,200
And then when he didn't come
back, I started going crazy.

899
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,440
First worrying about
why, and then, and then...

900
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,960
being found.

901
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,120
What happened to him?

902
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,680
He was killed by a hit-and-run
driver crossing the road.

903
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,920
Why did you say you were raped?

904
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,280
I was tied naked to a bed.

905
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,320
What else could I tell my mother?

906
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
Can I sleep here?

907
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,120
As long as you don't
give Tony that cold.

908
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,320
He's asleep.

909
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,000
Thank you.

910
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,720
This reminds me of the end of Alien.
