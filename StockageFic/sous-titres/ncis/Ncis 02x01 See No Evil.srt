1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,860
We're running late, let's
get a move on, little lady.

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,620
There's someone at the front door, Mom.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,060
Show-off. Let's go.

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,260
Mrs. Watson?

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,660
Yes?

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,620
There's been an accident, ma'am.
Your husband... he's been injured.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm to transport you and
your daughter to the hospital.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Good morning, Captain Watson.

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,800
Good morning, Shirley.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,000
How'd the recital go last night?

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, would it be wrong for
me to say that I am the father

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
of the most talented little
girl in the entire world?

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,720
It'd be wrong if you
didn't. Still on a diet,

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
or should I put cream in your coffee?

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,560
I ran ten miles yesterday.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Cream coming right up.

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,280
Captain Watson.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,240
Who’s that?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Before Shirley returns with your coffee,

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
know that we have
your wife and daughter.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
If you want to see them alive again,

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,200
you will do exactly as I say.

23
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,900
Look in your briefcase's
back compartment.

24
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,780
Who are you?

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,460
Now, Captain Watson.
Plug it in and place

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,580
it on top of your computer screen.

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,180
You will go about your
day in the usual way,

28
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,580
only you will not leave your office.

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,060
You will make no attempt
to contact anyone.

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,700
Who are you? What do you want?

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,660
Two million dollars from
the special operations fund.

32
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,300
Are you crazy? I can't
transfer two million dollars;

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
the system won’t allow me to.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,700
You'll find a way, Captain

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,820
Or would you rather I
shoot them both right now?

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,580
Anyone? I mean, anyone know
when the air conditioning's

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,740
getting fixed? What about the name of

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,260
the genius who invented
windows that don't open?

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,980
What are we, on a space
ship? Windows should open!

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,220
Oh, have you been working out?

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,340
All summer long... thanks for noticing.

42
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,580
No, I mean right now,
'cause you're sweating

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,860
like a pig and it's not very attractive.

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,820
Ah, morning, Agent Todd.

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,220
McGee!

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:00,940
Yeah?

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,820
You have two seconds to tell
me what you're doing down there.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,180
I'm, ah, upgrading the
computer network and, ah...

49
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,140
Time's up!

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,780
Ah, ah, I wasn't looking, I swear,
ow, ow, I wasn't looking, ow...

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,940
Tony.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,540
Yes, sir?

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,460
Did I just see what I thought I saw?

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,820
Out of respect for my co-workers,
boss, I'd have to say yes

55
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,140
you did, and it's very disturbing.

56
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,020
I agree, put your damn shirt
back on, this is a federal

57
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,269
office building, not a gym.

58
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:31,448
Damn.

59
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,704
McGee, why are you still here?

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,940
Ah, the, the contractors, they
won't wire the network until

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,340
the air conditioning's fixed,
it's a union thing, so...

62
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,100
So you decided it's more
important for an NCIS

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,860
Special Agent to crawl
around all day by yourself?

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,260
Man asked you a question.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, I just, I, I wanted it
fixed, before I returned to Norfolk.

66
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,660
Yeah? You have any idea where
thinking like this is gonna lead you?

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,780
Yeah, do you, McGee?

68
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,620
Promotion. You need any
help, you ask Tony here.

69
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Looks like he could use a workout.

70
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,060
I, he, he, he, eh,
it's not that difficult.

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,460
So, I, I guess I could do it myself.

72
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,860
Good answer.

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
Don't let him intimidate you, McGee.

74
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,620
That's my job today. Agent Todd?

75
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,660
I didn't look.

76
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,980
Oh, no. I believe you. I
just have a little question

77
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,060
that I want to ask you. Is she
a pantyhose or a thong girl,

78
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,943
'cause I'm thinking thong...

79
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:25,510
Ah!

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,420
We've got a problem, Gibbs.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,500
Dammit, I hate this
thing. Piece of crap.

82
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
There's a secretary from
the Pentagon downstairs, and

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,220
she claims her boss is being
held hostage. By his computer.

84
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,140
See? There's a reason I
didn't trust these things.

85
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,020
Here, reboot that or
something. Send her up.

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,500
Reboot it?

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,820
Or you can do what we always do.

88
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,460
it's his third one this month.

89
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,460
When I brought him his coffee, I
heard the computer talking to him.

90
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,620
You've got mail?

91
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,220
No, it was this weird electronic
voice and then it cut off

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,780
the second I entered the room.
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

93
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,940
but I can't tell you the rest until

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,380
you promise that you
won't try to contact him.

95
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,940
Whatever you're afraid of,
Ms. Wilkes, we can handle it.

96
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,140
He slipped this into
a stack of folders and

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,620
then told me to take
the rest of the day off.

98
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,420
Forget your glasses, boss?

99
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,660
Office under electronic
surveillance, can't leave.

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,460
Jill and Sandy kidnapped.

101
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
Must transfer two mil to overseas
account by 1800 or they die.

102
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,460
Contact NCIS, no one else.

103
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,900
Finally, someone who appreciates us.

104
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,540
If anything should happen to them, I...

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,020
I mean, she's jut a
little girl, Agent Gibbs.

106
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,100
The Watsons live in MacLean.
There's no answer at home,

107
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,380
and their daughter Sandy didn't
show up to school this morning.

108
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,780
It says here she's blind.

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,300
Tony.

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,660
I can confirm he's the
comptroller for JSOC,

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,380
office is in the
A-right of the Pentagon.

112
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm pulling up the schematic now.

113
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,620
JSOC?

114
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,660
Joint Services Operational Command.
They fund SMU. SMU stands for -

115
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,820
Special Military Units, I worked with
a few of them when I was Secret Service.

116
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,260
So he can really transfer
this kind of money overseas?

117
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540
More, if he needs to.

118
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,860
Our bad guy'd have to pass
through five security checkpoints

119
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,500
to get to Watson's office.

120
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,180
Well, the Pentagon records all access.

121
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,260
There's 25,000 people
working there, Kate.

122
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,820
By the time we're finished
downloading that list,

123
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,300
the government's out
two million dollars.

124
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,580
Or Watson's family's dead.

125
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,460
Well, it has to be
someone on the inside.

126
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,620
The Pentagon is the most
secure building in the world.

127
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,060
They could be using a Trojan.

128
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,980
Well, she said that they
were using his computer.

129
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,380
A Trojan would give
them backdoor access.

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,980
You kiss your mother
with that mouth, McGee?

131
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,700
No, Tony, a Trojan's a program. It's
like a virus; it establishes a gateway

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,100
to a computer and allows a
hacker to control the system.

133
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,580
That still doesn't explain
how it got onto his machine.

134
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,180
Well, if they're good they
could've done it from anywhere.

135
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,620
Wouldn't even have to
set foot in the building.

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
How're they watching him, then?

137
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,020
Could be using a web cam.

138
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,460
Or they're lying. Kate, take McGee
and search the Watson's house. Dinozzo,

139
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,220
I want everything there is on Watson
and his family by the time I get back.

140
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,340
Where're you going, boss?

141
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,580
Talk to Watson.

142
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,940
Wait, Gibbs, if you show up -

143
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,340
I'd better hope they don't notice.

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,860
That is not a good call.

145
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,780
Relax; you think Gibbs keeps
that haircut to save on shampoo?

146
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,380
Morning, Gunny.

147
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
Morning, Staff Sergeant.

148
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,340
Moving those dollars around, Captain?

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,660
I’m trying. Only way I can
stay beneath the radar is

150
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,300
not make a withdrawal
that doesn't exceed

151
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,460
ten thousand dollars form
any single operational budget.

152
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,380
What's that?

153
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,340
Well, this is an office.
People are going to be dropping

154
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,260
by with request forms all day long.

155
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,900
Not today. Send them away.

156
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,020
I keep doing that, they're
going to get suspicious.

157
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,380
Okay. Just don't forget
what's at stake here, Captain.

158
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,740
I won't. Bastard.

159
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,936
Enter.

160
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,700
Sorry to have missed the
budget meeting yesterday, sir,

161
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,140
but you know how the
Colonel gets when he's sick.

162
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,740
How’s he doing, Gunny?

163
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,540
Better, sir, thank you. Wanted me to check with
you, see if you needed any extra help down here.

164
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,180
Tell him I appreciate it,
but we got things covered.

165
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,700
Roger that, sir. Latest batch of requests
for you. Most immediate priority's on top.

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,380
This must be that daughter you're always
talking about. She is a beauty, sir.

167
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,580
She is that, Gunny. She is that.

168
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,700
You change your mind, sir, you just call.
Go plenty of people willing to help you.

169
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,420
I will, Gunny. Thank you.

170
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,500
Have a nice day, sir.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,740
He’s gone.

172
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,380
He is right about one thing.
She is a little beauty.

173
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,620
Who
- who's there?

174
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,300
Well, no signs of anyone
observing the place.

175
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,036
Let's roll.

176
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,540
She either left in a
hurry or was forced to.

177
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,860
What makes you think she
just didn't leave it there?

178
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,620
Because she's a little girl,
McGee. They're not typically slobs.

179
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,740
Remind me to introduce
you to my little sister.

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,540
what was that?

181
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,820
Nothing, Agent Todd.

182
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,780
You still pushing to be
a full time field agent?

183
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,340
Very much so.

184
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,540
Well, we need to get in. Suggestions?

185
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,900
Last time I encountered
a situation like this

186
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,820
Tony threw a rock through the window.

187
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,860
yet another glaring difference
between boys and girls. Follow me.

188
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,660
He was right about one
thing. She is a little beauty.

189
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,140
Okay, Gibbs, your mike is
coming in loud and clear.

190
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,940
Who's that in the office
with him, the devil?

191
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,620
You know, considering no one
in this room is actually deaf,

192
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,540
that's really annoying.
Hey, was that about me?

193
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,940
Patch in the video, Abs.

194
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,100
Not a very flattering angle.

195
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,700
Yeah, well, it was the best I could do.

196
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,300
What can you tell me about the voice?

197
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,740
It sounds like this particle
physicist I used to date.

198
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,940
He had these tiny little Chiclet teeth,

199
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,740
and an Eiffel Tower tattoo right -

200
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,420
You want this or not?

201
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,100
Okay. Obviously, it's being
disguised. I think I can filter

202
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,460
it back to its original state.

203
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,740
Yeah. Okay, I'll get that APB
out the Lollipop Guild right away.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Patience, Tony.

205
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,180
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Not bad.

206
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,620
Next thing I want you to do
is hack into Watson's computer.

207
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,220
It's the only link we
have to the kidnapper.

208
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,820
Gibbs, we are talking
about the Pentagon here.

209
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,820
Even their encryptions have encryptions.

210
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,900
yeah? That dirtbag sure managed it.

211
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,940
It probably took him months!
Our best bet is to ask

212
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,900
the DOD for access to their system.

213
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,420
And the first thing they'll do
is disconnect the connection.

214
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,220
That happens, we end up
with two dead dependents.

215
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,820
I don't know if I can do it.

216
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,100
Dinozzo, get McGee on the phone.

217
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,660
Wait. I'll get in.

218
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,620
Yeah?

219
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,620
Yeah.

220
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,740
I believe you.

221
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,340
Relax. when's the last
time Gibbs was wrong?

222
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,140
Discounting the whole
marriage thing, of course.

223
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,340
Okay. McGee, hold me steady.

224
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,340
Okay.

225
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,220
Go left.

226
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,580
Okay.

227
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,660
No, no, no, my left, your right.

228
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:49,780
Oh. Sorry.

229
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,980
McGee, what are you doing?

230
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm doing what you're
telling me to doing.

231
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,060
Are your eyes closed?

232
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,540
yes!

233
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,380
Well then open them before you kill us!

234
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,700
But this morning you -

235
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,540
McGee, can't you tell when
someone's kidding with you?

236
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,220
I used to, then I met you guys.

237
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,380
If you want to work with Gibbs, hen
you're gonna have to get over that.

238
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,100
Trust me, I know.

239
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Eyes open it is.

240
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,140
Dinozzo! I need a way to
communicate with Captain Watson.

241
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,140
Communication problem solved,
boss. Earwig radio receiver,

242
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,140
used them all the time
undercover in Baltimore.

243
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,940
How do we get it in his ear?

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,260
Did I also mention there's
one tiny flaw in my plan?

245
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,420
Dinozzo, I show back up there as a
Gunny, this guy's gonna get suspicious.

246
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,660
Well, you think I
could pass for a Marine?

247
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,540
I don't know. Let's shave
your head and find out.

248
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,140
Actually, I was leaning more toward
a Merchant Marine kind of thing.

249
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,660
I got a better idea, don't eat that.

250
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,860
well, no signs of forced
entry or a struggle.

251
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,380
They could've been taken at gunpoint.

252
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,020
Well, it's possible,
but I don't think so.

253
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,220
Why's that?

254
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,740
Well, why go to the trouble of
locking the front door behind you?

255
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,220
Not bad, McGee. Tony hasn't
completely ruined you yet.

256
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,260
Their daughter must
be quite the pianist.

257
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,940
Beautiful, too. There's nothing
here. We're wasting our time.

258
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:26,740
Let's go. Uh-uh. I use the door.

259
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,780
You lock it and go back out the window.

260
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,460
I get it. You're kidding, right?

261
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,780
Five hours left,
Captain. Read the total.

262
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,780
I’ve managed to isolate 900,000.

263
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,660
I'd work faster if I were you.
You're learning. You may answer.

264
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,180
Enter.

265
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,020
Hey, Cap'n. Got your sweet
'n sour with extra pineapple.

266
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,020
You might want to change
your order tomorrow,

267
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,820
heard we're gettin' in some fresh duck.

268
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,380
I’ll just stick with the usual.

269
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,140
All right. 8.75 today.
How's the family going?

270
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,740
Find. You?

271
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,500
Still having trouble
communicating with the girlfriend.

272
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,380
I talk, she doesn't listen...
what are you gonna do?

273
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh, yeah, sure
- for you.

274
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,660
Thanks, Cap'n. See you tomorrow.

275
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Freeze. Open your lunch,
show it to the camera. Now!

276
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
Enjoy!!

277
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,300
Delivery complete.

278
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,580
That's good work, Tony.

279
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,100
Thanks, boss, that means a lot.

280
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,700
NCIS doesn't work out, I hear General

281
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,340
Wee's Chinese Restaurant's hiring.

282
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,820
Abs, get the Captain up on the feed.

283
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,100
This is Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
If you can hear me, cough once.

284
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,780
We are changing the game plan, Skipper.

285
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,380
If he contacts you again, tell him you
want a good faith gesture on his part.

286
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,180
Tell him that you want
your daughter returned now.

287
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,260
Tell him if you don't get her back,

288
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,740
you're gonna take your
chances with the FBI.

289
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,260
He'll try to intimidate you.
We have to call his bluff.

290
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Rub your brow if you have
the courage to go this route.

291
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,540
You are not alone, Cap'n. We're
gonna get through his together.

292
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,700
I will be in touch.

293
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,420
All right, I want these
feeds hardwired into MTAC.

294
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,380
Done.

295
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,620
You inside his computer yet?

296
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,020
Oh, um... I think, um...

297
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,780
need help?

298
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,700
Yeah.

299
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,780
All you had to do was ask.
One of the smartest people

300
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
I know told me that once.

301
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,860
Who?

302
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,820
You.

303
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,060
Car's still in the driveway,
no signs of a struggle inside.

304
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,860
I think they may have
known their kidnapper.

305
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,900
Or been duped.

306
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,020
Looks like you and Tony have
been making some progress.

307
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,060
Not enough.

308
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,940
Time to update, Captain.

309
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,660
I’m doing my best.

310
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,660
Just make your deadline.

311
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,980
McGee. Help Abby get into
Watson's computer. Hey, c'mon!

312
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,420
A little short on deodorant, Tony?

313
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,980
I’ve isolated nearly 1.3 million. Now
I want a gesture of good faith from you.

314
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,340
What kind of gesture, Captain?

315
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,220
I want you to release
my daughter. Immediately.

316
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,740
Not gonna happen.

317
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,900
Why? 'Cause they're already dead?

318
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
How do I know that's not just a tape?

319
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,980
You listen to me.

320
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,820
You let Sandy go right now, or
it's over. I’m going to the FBI.

321
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,220
You'd never forgive yourself, you know.

322
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,060
This is the hard part,
Captain. Don't back down.

323
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,260
Tell him you want to
talk to your daughter.

324
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,540
I want to speak to her. Right now!

325
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,820
Plays the piano. Gifted, I hear. You
don't need eyes to play the piano,

326
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,900
but you sure as hell need ears.

327
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,140
Sandy!

328
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,380
One move, pop, Waterworld. And the other
ear, pop. Total silence and darkness.

329
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,540
We can't risk that.

330
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,300
He's bluffing, stand your ground.

331
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Tell him if he does that,
he'll never see a penny.

332
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,140
Let her go unharmed, or I
swear you'll never see a dime.

333
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,180
You know I never was any good
at taking orders, Captain.

334
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,500
I screwed up. I screwed it all up.

335
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,860
It's only been forty minutes, captain.

336
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,540
He will contact you soon. Until
then, you have to stay strong.

337
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,860
It's our best chance of
getting your family back.

338
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,620
You got something to say?

339
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,260
We're taking a really
big risk here, Gibbs.

340
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,420
Yeah, Kate? What happens
to the little girl and

341
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,020
her mother once this
dirtbag gets the money?

342
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,100
What, you think he'll kill them?

343
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,420
You're the profiler. You tell me.

344
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,780
Answer your phone, Captain.

345
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,660
Where is she? Where's my daughter?

346
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,180
I said, answer the phone, Captain!

347
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,860
Yes?

348
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,620
Daddy?

349
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,180
Sandy, sweetheart, where are you?

350
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,540
I don't know. He let me go
but he said, he said he'll kill

351
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,460
Mom I told anybody what happened.

352
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,460
You tell me where she is.

353
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,260
Morton Amtrak Station. You got your
good faith gesture. Now get back to work.

354
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,220
My people are on the way, Captain.

355
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,820
You tell her to stay
where she is. Go get her.

356
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,300
Sandy, sweetheart, just say right there,

357
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,980
don't, don't go anywhere, and Daddy,

358
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,460
Daddy'll be there to get
you in just a little while.

359
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,100
Hang up the phone now,
Captain, and believe me when

360
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,300
I say your wife's life depends on it.

361
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,340
I have to hang up now, baby. Listen,

362
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,980
I want you to be brave for me, baby.

363
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
This'll be over before you know it.

364
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:41,138
Daddy, help me!

365
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:44,487
God forgive me.

366
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,847
Daddy!

367
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Face it, McGee. We are doomed.

368
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,700
-Okay, we can try random password generators.
-Did it.

369
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,020
-How about an open port scan?
-Done it.

370
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,820
-There's an undocumented hole on the east side...
-Tried it.

371
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,780
Gibbs can't honestly expect us to hack

372
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,020
into the Pentagon in a single afternoon!

373
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,780
Yeah.

374
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, you're right, we are doomed.

375
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,180
We have to call DOD
and hope they'll let us

376
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,060
in without severing the connection.

377
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,820
Unless... what if the
Trojan isn't system-wide?

378
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,260
If it was, our bad guy...

379
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,140
Could just steal the money
himself. He wouldn't need...

380
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,900
Watson to do it for him. That means

381
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,540
he can't access the rest of the network.

382
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,380
We've been trying to
hack the wrong place.

383
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,660
Yeah. Right, scan for open
UDP and TCP connections

384
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,700
on the Geosock VPN... yes, yes...
got multiple incoming packets.

385
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Port 139, 445.

386
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,940
Looks like a variant of the DMC Trojan.

387
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,300
-I love it when you talk geek.
-I love it that you love it.

388
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,020
I'll be sure to mention
that to Captain Watson,

389
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
right after we're done
burying his family.

390
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,220
I would hold off on those
funeral arrangements, Gibbs.

391
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,620
The reason we're so excited...

392
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,420
Is we just hacked Captain
Watson's computer...

393
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,300
And we should be able to
backtrace the connection...

394
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:36,660
no! No, no, no! No! No! Aah!
My baby just French fried.

395
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,260
The system’s overheated.

396
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,140
So? Reboot it.

397
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,260
Believe it or not, Gibbs,
not all computer problems

398
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,060
can be solved by rebooting.

399
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,980
Works for me.

400
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,180
Even if it does, it's going to take

401
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,060
at least an hour for mine to cool down.

402
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,740
And without air conditioning,
it'll happen again.

403
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,340
So take it someplace cooler.

404
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,260
Where? This whole building
is like an illegal sweatshop.

405
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,060
Not the whole building, Abs.

406
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
May I trouble you for
the left ear, Mr. Palmer?

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,840
Ah, one left ear, coming right up.

408
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,040
When is the DNA analysis coming
back on the right toe grouping?

409
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,720
Oh, should be ten, twelve, ah... days.

410
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, that's interesting.

411
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,880
What's that, doctor?

412
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Oh, dear.

413
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,280
It's not the left ear?

414
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,240
It's the left; it's just not
the right left. So to speak.

415
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
Well that would mean that, ah...

416
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,640
Three bodies. Time to
start another table.

417
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,360
Hey, Ducky. My computer died, we
need someplace cooler to set up shop.

418
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, well, we're a bit
tight on space at the moment,

419
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,240
but, ah, you could use 107.

420
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,840
Definitely not 107. His family
was supposed to make arrangements

421
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,040
to pick him up last week.
Ah, there we are. How's that?

422
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
Perfect. Thank you.

423
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,320
Fascinating, isn't it? Parts
of three separate bodies,

424
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,680
carved up with almost
surgical precision.

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,280
Why?

426
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,600
Haven't a clue. We found them
in a 55 gallon tub of alcohol

427
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
behind Bethesda Naval
Hospital last month.

428
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,280
McGee? We're kinda
running short on time.

429
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,280
Oh, can I give you a hand?

430
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,960
Whoa... well, uh... I'm all right.

431
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,480
When I'm a mother, I'm never
letting my kids out of my sight.

432
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
Yeah? Well how do you
plan on doing that?

433
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
GPS locator strapped to
their ankle. Audio and

434
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
video surveillance
built into their clothes.

435
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,640
No, I mean the part
about becoming a mother.

436
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
Haha. Funny. The area looks clear to me.

437
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,120
Me too. Let's go get that kid.

438
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,920
Sandy? My name's Kate.

439
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,360
And my name's Tony. We're
NCIS agents. It stands for -

440
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,240
I know what it stands for.
You spoke at my school.

441
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
Well, then you know that we're here
to help you. Your daddy sent us.

442
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,440
We know what happened to you and
your mom, but you're safe now, okay?

443
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,840
I heard him.

444
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,480
Heard who, honey?

445
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:13,200
He didn't know it, but I heard
him. He told my mom... he... he...

446
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,520
he's going to make my Dad suffer.

447
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,840
What the hell is it?

448
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
A; It's probably some
leftover bodily fluid.

449
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh, is that all?

450
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,160
Yeah.

451
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,880
Disgusting.

452
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,480
If you want to be a full
time field agent, Timothy,

453
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
you're going to have to get
used to sights like that.

454
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,600
Is this a common occurrence, Ducky,
dismembered bodies in tubs of alcohol?

455
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,440
Well, now that you mention
it, I did have a great-uncle

456
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,440
who drowned in a vat of alcohol.

457
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm sorry to hear that.

458
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,880
Of course, he reportedly climbed out
three times to go to the bathroom.

459
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
Hey. What's the holdup?

460
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,160
We are almost set here.

461
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,760
McGee, if I were you, I would spend
more time working and less time cleaning.

462
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,960
Yes. Yes, sorry, boss.

463
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Duck. Got a patient upstairs for you.

464
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,680
There you go. Feel better now?

465
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Yes. Thank you.

466
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Well, you've been a very brave patient,
so I think you deserve a surprise.

467
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,440
A Hershey bar?

468
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes. Are you sure you're blind?

469
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,360
I can smell it.

470
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,640
Ah. I'll be right back, Sandy. I need
a few moments to talk to my friends.

471
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,800
It took him 45 to drop him off. You
figure 22 minutes out, same back,

472
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,040
gives you a fifteen mile radius
where he could be located.

473
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,560
Hundreds of square miles and
what? We have two hours left.

474
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,040
We also pulled tapes
from the train station.

475
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Might catch a shot of
him dropping the kid off.

476
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,680
Gibbs? It's, like, a hundred degrees
in here. How can you drink that stuff?

477
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,920
Keeps me cool. How's she doing, Duck?

478
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
Remarkably well, considering
the circumstances.

479
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,480
What does she remember?

480
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,880
Unfortunately, everything.

481
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Except for where she was.

482
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,720
Maybe you haven't asked
the right questions.

483
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Well, she's eight and blind, Ducky. It's
not a great help in a situation like.

484
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,160
Sandy
- are you thirsty?

485
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,880
A little bit. Can I have some water?

486
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,840
Okay. I'm back in. Initiating a
back trace from Watson's computer. ??

487
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,960
on board encryption.

488
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,640
It's commercial grade, so
consider it cracked right... now.

489
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,400
Yes, Team McGee does it again.

490
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,400
Why Team McGee?

491
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,800
Well, no offense, I am the special agent.
Hm. Must have switched off the audio.

492
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
Team Abby. I'm the smart one.

493
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,480
You wanna scream? Scream.
No one will hear you.

494
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,200
Sandy. This is really important.
Can you tell us anything

495
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,040
about the car you were driven in?

496
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,640
Well, it was a van and there
were no windows in back.

497
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,320
How could you tell?

498
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,240
Because I couldn't
feel the sun on my face.

499
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,320
What about the place he was keeping you
and your mom? Anything unusual about it?

500
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,400
I don't know. I was real scared
and I could hear him talking

501
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,040
to my mo and she was crying
and... he kept on pulling my hair.

502
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,360
It's okay, Sandy, just
tell us what you remember.

503
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,760
Yeah, Gibbs. All
right. We're on our way.

504
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,800
I want you to stay here with
Doctor Mallard. We have to check -

505
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I heard. You can see my
mom on your computer now.

506
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,400
I hear lots of things other
kids can't. Can I help you?

507
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,320
Your husband has less than
two hours to make my deadline.

508
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm engaging the audio
filters right now.

509
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
There'll be a slight delay with picture.

510
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,480
But what he doesn't know is if he makes
it or not, you're never going home.

511
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,180
Time's running out, Captain.

512
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,940
Look, I've been able
to isolate 1.8 million.

513
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,140
If I send it now, will
you release my wife?

514
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,980
How about I send you back 1.8 of your
wife? You want me to keep an arm or a leg?

515
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,660
Captain, we need more
time. You have to stall him.

516
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,740
It’s getting harder
to find open accounts.

517
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,020
You're going to have
to give me more time.

518
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,980
You have ninety minutes.
Make it, your wife lives.

519
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,420
Don't, she dies. It's
your call, Captain.

520
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,020
Negotiate, Captain. Tell him you
need at least three more hours.

521
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,060
I repeat, tell him you
need at least three hours.

522
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,660
I’ll meet your deadline.

523
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,020
Ah, damn.

524
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,780
Good news, boss. I found a shot of our bad
guy's vehicle on the trains station tapes.

525
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,660
The little girl was right.

526
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,100
It's a white van with no windows.

527
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,660
You run the plates?

528
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,820
Came back stolen.

529
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,300
And this helps me because, Dinozzo?

530
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I also ID'd our dirtbag. Pulled his
prints from Sandy's hair, uh, thingies.

531
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,740
Barrettes.

532
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,540
Right. He's a former Petty
Officer, name's Kyle Grayson.

533
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,940
Did six years in Leavenworth
for embezzling government

534
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,660
funds and Captain Watson as
responsible for putting him there.

535
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,300
Good job.

536
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,180
We're going to play some sounds
from the room you were in, Sandy.

537
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,380
We think it might help
you remember better.

538
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,380
Can you just play certain
hertz if I want you to?

539
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,780
Sure, how'd you know that?

540
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,340
From the piano. I know the
number of vibrations of every key.

541
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,940
Like key number forty-four, E4.

542
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:37,820
That's 329.63 hertz. A5 is
880. My mom says I'm half bat.

543
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,940
Well, that's cool. I love bats.

544
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Me too. I like your voice,
Abby. It's kinda gravelly.

545
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,380
Thank you. All right, you
ready to show off for us?

546
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,500
Morton Amtrak Station. You got your
good faith gesture, now get back to work.

547
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:04,500
There's birds up kinda high. Try a G7
- the 83rd key. That's 3136 hertz.

548
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,540
That is amazing, Sandy.
I'll be right back.

549
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,860
-Gibbs, she's incredible, you gotta see her
-I want her listening to the live feed.

550
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,660
Gibbs, she's been traumatized enough.

551
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Yeah? Howa bout growing up without a
mother, Kate? Hey, Sandy. I need you to -

552
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,580
Listen to the live feed. I want to
help my mom, Agent Gibbs. I can take it.

553
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,580
here.

554
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,980
What's this?

555
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,620
Your very own NCIS badge. You ready?

556
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:44,660
Yeah.

557
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,460
McGee. Bring the live feed
up on the speakers. Sandy.

558
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,380
We need to know anything you can tell
us about where he is keeping your mom.

559
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,460
When I took this job, I was instructed
not to hurt you or the little princess.

560
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,860
But your husband cost me six years.

561
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,260
Who hired you?

562
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,060
I don't really care. The point is, I've
decided your husband has to pay for that.

563
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:16,860
Why?

564
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,300
No more questions.

565
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:37,340
Go in the area of A7. I mean, 4000 hertz.
Bring it two keys down. I mean, 3800.

566
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,540
Sounds like a train.

567
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,420
It's getting closer.
It's passing right... now.

568
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,380
1706. What time's the
next train scheduled ??.

569
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,540
I'm on it, boss.

570
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,660
Can you remember anything
else about the train sounds?

571
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:05,020
We drove over a lot of tracks. My mom...
she... she squeezed my hand every time.

572
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,820
How many times?

573
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,900
I don't know, a lot. What is he
doing to her? Why is she crying?

574
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,220
You did great, Sandy.

575
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,860
Are you going to save my mom now?

576
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,660
Oh yeah, you can count
on that. Let's roll.

577
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,580
Hey. The only train in
the area's an Amtrak.

578
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,420
It left DC at 16:20 and
arrived Lorton 17:30,

579
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,620
average speed 65 miles an hour.

580
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,260
Now, we know it passed our
dirtbag at 17:06, right?

581
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:55,260
So... dammit. I owe
Mrs. Powers an apology.

582
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:55,860
Who?

583
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,860
My tenth grade math teacher.
I told her I'd never be able

584
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,100
to use anything she
taught us in real life.

585
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,020
It's here. Seven miles
outside of Lorton.

586
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,340
There's an abandoned train maintenance
yard about half a mile north.

587
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,780
That's the place. McGee, you tell
Watson to delay sending the money.

588
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,660
Well how?

589
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,100
Any way you can, c'mon, let's go! Now!

590
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,500
Five minutes left. Tell me you
have the two million, Captain.

591
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,500
I have it.

592
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:28,580
Stand by to copy the ISP and
routing number. ISP is CS.CN.ACN.

593
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,820
Read it back to me.

594
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:37,860
CS.CN.ACN. Beijing.

595
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,180
Very good, Captain.

596
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,740
McGee, talk to me.

597
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,700
Okay, he's giving Watson the wire
transfer code. Do you have a visual yet?

598
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,140
Negative. Tell the Captain
to stall for more time.

599
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,220
Captain Watson, you have to
buy us a few more minutes.

600
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,060
I repeat, you have to
buy us a few more minutes.

601
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,100
He's not listening to me.

602
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,100
Tell him the second he transfers
that money, his wife is dead.

603
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,100
Captain Watson, your wife is gonna be murdered
- ow!

604
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,140
Okay, Gibbs, he took out the earwig.

605
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,580
I got nothing, boss.

606
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:29,660
The routing number is
A1213669B1. Read that back to me.

607
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,580
A1213669B1

608
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,420
That's correct. Now make me rich.

609
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,900
And I have your word you're
gonna release my wife?

610
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,865
Yes. My word.

611
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,286
Now send it.

612
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,860
He's sending the money to Asia. If I
can tag his transmission with a marker,

613
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,860
we might be able to follow it.

614
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,580
Gibbs, he sent it, I think he's
gonna shoot her, what do I do?

615
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,420
Something, McGee, anything!

616
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,380
This is the FBI, Grayson.
We have you surrounded.

617
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,100
Come out with your hands in the air.

618
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,260
The hell?

619
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,100
You didn't really think
you'd get away with this?

620
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,820
You two inside. I'll cut
him off. We take him alive.

621
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,860
Come on, let's go. Come on. Go.

622
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,620
Clear.

623
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,740
C'mon! You come any
closer and I'll shoot her!

624
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,180
Come out where I can see you! Now!

625
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,580
Just like in Colombia.

626
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,060
You're not getting out of
here, Grayson. It's over.

627
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,620
I know the FBI's SOP. I want a
cell phone and negotiator, now!

628
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,780
We're not the FBI, dirtbag.

629
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,820
Drop the weapon.

630
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,300
Everything does gonna be all
right now, sweetheart. Everything.

631
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,060
Kinda makes you think.

632
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,340
'Bout what?

633
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,940
Having kids someday.

634
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,780
Yeah. I don't think I could handle that.

635
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,340
Don’t know how we can ever
thank you, Agent Gibbs.

636
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,460
We owe you so much.

637
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,700
You can thank Special Agent Watson here.

638
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,500
We couldn't have done
without her. Thanks.

639
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,580
We did good today, Gibbs.

640
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:40,020
Did we, Special Agent Todd? Grayson
doesn't have the smarts to be in this alone.

641
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,020
We still have to find out who hired him.

642
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,220
Not gonna get it from Grayson.

643
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,660
Why not? Get him to roll for a deal.

644
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,460
I don't deal.

645
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,420
he doesn’t deal?

646
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,940
Not when Grayson doesn't
know who hired him.

647
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,620
This guy's good. We lost the money
for a little while in Hong Kong.

648
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,580
But McGee's bots picked it
up again on the way to Zurich.

649
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,020
And with Abby's encryption algorithm
embedded in the transaction -

650
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,100
Okay, would you two, just
for a sec, just pretend

651
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,740
I don't know anything about computers?

652
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,540
Pretend?

653
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,740
Can we get this guy or not?

654
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,340
Well, we've been following the
money for the last eight hours,

655
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,060
and if it transfers into a country

656
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,060
where we have jurisdiction...
wait. I don't believe this.

657
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,140
What?

658
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,940
It's headed back here.

659
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,980
Washington, DC.

660
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,700
Captain Watson.

661
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,180
Agent Gibbs. This is not what you think.

662
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,780
You're right. It wasn't.

663
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,820
You did this to your own family?

664
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,420
No, nobody was supposed to get hurt.

665
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,540
That tight enough for you, Cap'n?

666
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,380
I can't believe this is
happening. The perfect plan.

667
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,780
Even Grayson didn't know who hired him.

668
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,500
How the hell'd you figure this out?

669
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,380
Next time, you might want
to send your note to the FBI.

670
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,660
Look, you don't understand.
I needed the money because -

671
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Don't you dare tell me that there's a
reason for you throwing away what you had.

672
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,140
Your network is up and operational now.
so, uh, I'll be heading back to Norfolk.

673
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,340
I'll take that as a thank you.

674
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,940
McGee. Where're you going?

675
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Ah, Norfolk?

676
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,340
Well, I got some good news, and some bad
news for you. You've just been promoted.

677
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,460
To a full time field agent.

678
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,340
Really? That's incredible, what's -

679
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,140
You belong to me now.

680
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,380
Congratulations.

681
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah. What she said.

682
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,660
Wha, so, uh, I'm one of you guys now?
No more getting coffee, no more hazing?

683
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,900
Sure.

684
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,820
All right, well, I just want to
say, I never took it personal,

685
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,700
and I, I really look forward to...

686
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,434
You know I could
really get used to that.
