1
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Wow, she's pretty flexible.

2
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Just don't let her catch
you looking at her, Probie.

3
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
I think she saw me.

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
She gave me that look.

5
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,480
What look?

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,120
The look she's always giving you.

7
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,640
Yep. She saw you.

8
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,040
Hope you wore a cup.

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Okay, welcome to my version
of close combat training.

10
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
McGee.

11
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,640
Yeah?

12
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,560
You start with Kate.

13
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,720
Go on.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,200
All right.

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
You and me the ring today.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,840
You sure about that?
I've been taking classes.

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
In what?

18
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,320
Boxing.

19
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
We're grappling today.

20
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,240
You want to grapple?

21
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,480
Yeah.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,120
You have a problem with that?

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,160
No, it's just, you know, I did
some wrestling in high school.

24
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
Did you, now?

25
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
Hoo-hoo, come on. Why I ought to...

26
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,720
Not bad, DiNozzo.

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,240
Thanks.

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,080
You learn how to box in the Marines?

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,840
No.

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
Corps doesn't teach boxing.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
That's your loss.

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,840
They teach fighting.

33
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,360
Your phone.

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
Gibbs.

35
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:05,200
Have I mentioned that

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,720
I was hand picked to protect the
President of the United States?

37
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,440
Five times.

38
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
You gonna take that abuse, McGee?

39
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,840
No!

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,920
That's more like it, McGee.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,080
Why were you holding back?

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,600
Well, you're...

43
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,560
I mean, I've nevrestled...

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,000
A girl?

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,800
No.

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
Tony...

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I look like a girl to you?

48
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
All I see are two

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,480
NCIS Special Agents.

50
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,640
Me, too.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,920
Training's over.

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,280
We're heading to Quantico.

53
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Guy tried to outrun a 500-pound bomb.

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,640
And...?

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,600
He lost.

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,160
Hey.

57
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,440
She had three older brothers growing up.

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
I think there's some
unresolved issues there.

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,320
You think?

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Break out the gear. I'm going to find
out who's in charge of this circus.

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,560
You didn't have to stop like that.

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,520
I know that.

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Sorry about that, Probie.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
But it's your fault.

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
My fault?

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah, the brakes grab.

67
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,360
It's your job to see the vehicle's
in perfect running condition.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,800
You should've called.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
I could've saved you guys a trip.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,840
Why don't we start with,
who the hell are you?

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
Gunnery Sergeant De Luca, CID.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Is this your idea of how to run
a crime scene, Gunnery Sergeant?

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:33,960
Nope.

74
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,600
It's my idea of how to run
an accidendeath investigation,

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
Special Agent...?

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,240
Gibbs.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, a civilian decided to trespass

78
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,640
at the wrong place, at the wrong time.

79
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,480
Marines didn't spot him
till it was too late.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,480
What was a civilian doing down there?

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,280
My guess, he was a scavenger.

82
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Lot of metal and scrap iron's
been dumped here over the years.

83
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Enough to risk blowing yourself up over?

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,720
I didn't say he was smart, Agent Gibbs.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,800
But, hey, you want NCIS to handle
the paperwork on this one? Fine.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Get down there, secure the scene.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,240
Just make sure your people stay
inside the marked areas cleared by EOD

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,040
I don't need another
dead civilian on my hands.

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Attractive.

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,520
I want everybody off this
range except EOD personnel.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,240
What about Mr. Potato Head?

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,240
He stays. With luck,
he'll spit on my boots.

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Looking for a reason to
whack him in the head, Gibbs?

94
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,480
No. To shoot him.

95
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,840
Tony, didn't you tell methat you worked
a case on a live-impact range once?

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
Yeah, that's right. Fort A.P. Hill.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,400
Tragic.

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,440
What happened?

99
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
EOD missed ordnance marking the path.

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Boom!

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Agent walking point, a probie,
of course, blew his foot off.

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
You're kidding, right?

103
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,600
Of course I'm kidding... Probie.

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
We're right behind you, buddy.

105
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,080
You're doing great.

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
Some of them are
buried under the ground.

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,765
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,400
I'd say our young victim
was running when he was hit.

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,085
How can you tell, doctor?

110
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,760
Oh, I've seen far too many of these
types of wounds during my tour in Vietnam.

111
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,080
What about the bruising on
his wrists and face, Duck?

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,360
It's possible it was
caused by blast concussion.

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
We'll know more when we get him back.

114
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
This guy was no scavenger, boss.

115
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,280
Salvatore Ferragamo's.

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,440
What?

117
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,200
Italian shoes.

118
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
Expensive.

119
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
Pair I got cost almost 500 bucks.

120
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, not everybody shops at Wal-Mart.

121
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm not saying you shop at Wal-Mart.

122
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Or even that that's a bad thing.

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
How's it going, Kate?

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Almost finished.

125
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,640
I've got McGee doing measurements.

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
What are you doing?

127
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,640
Following our vict prints.

128
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,320
They came from over there.

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,120
Well, how'd he get down here?

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,200
We're at least five miles
from the nearest civilian road.

131
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,400
Someone dropped him off.

132
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,680
Hey! That area hasn't been cleared yet.

133
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
Agent Gibbs!

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey! You trying to get yourself killed?

135
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,200
Are you deaf or nuts?

136
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Little of both.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,720
You still think that this
was an accident, Gunny?

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Jimmy, run this up to Abby for me.

139
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,840
Uh, sure.

140
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,640
Would it be okay if I stayed and
chatted with her for awhile, doctor?

141
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
We're rather busy at the moment.

142
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,360
Okay, so you're saying that, uh...

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
it's not okay, then?

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Sorry. Sorry. The accent kind
of throws me off sometimes.

145
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,640
He means well, but often I have
an overwhelming urge to slap him.

146
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,280
Is that wrong?

147
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
Do it all the time.

148
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,480
So I've noticed.

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,845
But only on the back of the head.

150
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,080
A slap in the face would be humiliating.

151
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:50,520
Back of the head's a wake up call.

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Looks like he got both.

153
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:54,560
You were right.

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,120
His facial injuries
weren't from the bombs.

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Our victim received a rather
savage beating before his death.

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
And our crispy critter?

157
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,940
He wasn't burned by today's explosions.

158
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,140
Tests indicate the poor chap's
been deceased east six months.

159
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,780
There are more bodies out there.

160
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes. I was afraid of that.

161
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,700
We've stumbled into a bone yard, Duck.

162
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,900
Yeah.

163
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,700
Serial killer's dumping ground.

164
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,380
Hey, Gunny!

165
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,019
Have a look.

166
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,500
What have we got here?

167
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,340
Well, that's not good.

168
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,665
You hear that?

169
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,460
Yeah, what is that?

170
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,820
Evac!

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,340
Go! Go! Go!

172
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,500
Go! Come on!

173
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,555
Well at least I get Gibbs a finger.

174
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,520
I heared Kate kicked your
but this morning, McGee.

175
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:23,655
Oh, you heared wrong. It wasn't my butt.

176
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,979
She kicked you in the...

177
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:26,401
Yeah.

178
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,200
I thought I was joining a Federal Agency
not reliving my junior year in high school.

179
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,120
Just remember, they torture
you because they care.

180
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,400
So I make them dislike me...

181
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,692
Never get worth.

182
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,689
It's what I thought.

183
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,690
Hey!

184
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,129
I just I.D.'d your body.

185
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,720
And he's cute.

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,600
He's dead.

187
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,360
I know.

188
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:45,920
He's also a major criminal.

189
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,140
What can I say? I'm attracted
to that bad boy type...

190
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,620
No way.

191
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm get hacked.

192
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,420
A port scan?

193
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,460
No, no, this is major.

194
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,345
They've already burned to
the NCIS public firewall.

195
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,980
Well, isolate the node and dump
then the other side of the router.

196
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,020
I'm trying!

197
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,700
It's moving too fast

198
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:08,690
Oh, this is not good.

199
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,540
They're using our connection
with AFIS database- sever it.

200
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,300
I can't, It's a point attack.

201
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,180
He or she is only
going after my machine.

202
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,580
It's not possible, there's
DOD Level Nine encryption.

203
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,540
It would take months...

204
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,380
Hey. What is that, a video game?

205
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,065
No, Tony, we're getting hacked.

206
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,780
If they get into Abby's computer,
the entire NCIS network is next.

207
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:24,757
I can't stop him.

208
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:25,700
Do something, McGee.

209
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,100
I've never seen code like this.

210
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,145
Ah, way to go, Abby.

211
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,060
I didn't do anything. I thought you did?

212
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:36,620
No.

213
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,420
I did.

214
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,420
What the hell's going on here?

215
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,300
We were pulling a fingerprint
match from the AFIS database

216
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,340
and we set off some
kind of cyber attack.

217
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,260
- They were definitely waiting for us.
- Who?

218
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:56,980
I don't know, Tony, and right now

219
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,585
I'm afraid to turn my machine back on.

220
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,785
The speed they were
cracking our encryption at

221
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,740
there's only a few computers in
the world with that type of power.

222
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,260
Name them.

223
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,260
Well, the... the CERN institute in Geneva, IBM's
research facility, rumors of a few in China.

224
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,446
Oh, good, so it should
be easy to find them.

225
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:12,926
Where is my match?

226
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,780
China.

227
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,700
You want some?

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,460
Thanks.

229
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,220
Whoever this guy is, he's got
some friends in high places, Gibbs.

230
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,665
Victor Gera.

231
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,820
AKA Guido Valentino.

232
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,080
Career criminal.

233
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:46,905
Guido Valentino?

234
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,705
That's the alias he used in L.A.

235
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,020
Started running numbers
in Chicago as a kid,

236
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,340
moved onto jacking cars as a teen,
graduated to drug dealing on the West Coast.

237
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,420
Six months ago, he showed up in D.C.

238
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:57,100
Mafia?

239
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,500
Well, with names like Vic Gera
and Guido Valentino, what else?

240
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,340
Probie, in case you forget, my name is

241
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,740
Tony DiNozzo. Italiano.

242
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,220
Doesn't make me, Mafia, now does it?

243
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,100
No. Of course not. I'm sorry.

244
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,505
Prego.

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,380
McGee, what's the connection between
small-time hood and super computer?

246
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,300
Well, I have no idea, boss.

247
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,060
Ooh, wrong answer.

248
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,060
I'll go look for the right one now.

249
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,180
Why would the mob, or anyone, stash
bodies at a Marine bombing range?

250
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,065
Because it's the last
place you'd look for them.

251
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
Who'd be nuts enough to go
down there looking for bodies?

252
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,420
Besides us?

253
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,140
Yeah, Gibbs.

254
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,820
You did what?!

255
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,465
I'm on my way!

256
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,385
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.

257
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,980
He's not done screwing
up my investigation.

258
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,665
Wow.

259
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,620
I thought you were the only one
who could piss him off like that.

260
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:53,580
You never met his second wife.

261
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,420
I told you not to touch anything
without my M.E. being present.

262
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:04,340
I didn't really have much of a choice.

263
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,225
It was near an unstable javelin round.

264
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,460
It'd likely kill me and another
Marine when it exploded. Here.

265
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,660
You have a body that goes with this?

266
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,380
I think it was destroyed
during the explosion.

267
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,340
You think?

268
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,305
Look, EOD kicked me off the range.

269
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,940
That whole entire area's been
declared off limits 'til it's cleared.

270
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,145
How long?

271
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,220
Gibbs, there's decades of
unexploded ordnance down there.

272
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,660
My guess, three weeks, minimum.

273
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,140
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.

274
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,020
Gunny, you coming?

275
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,540
I set up a virtual model
emulating my system.

276
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,100
He comes back again,
we can dump him into it.

277
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,060
Won't fool him for long.

278
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
All I need is a minute to
back-trace his connection.

279
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,260
Okay, I'm ready.

280
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,260
Plug me in, McGee.

281
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,900
Round two.

282
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,180
He's still there and coming on strong.

283
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,460
Initiating my back-trace... now.

284
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,340
Oh, this guy is good.

285
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,260
He's almost made it through
your little virtual world.

286
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah, but I'm better.

287
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,260
Oh, got you!

288
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,980
Ha! Now let's see who
we're dealing with.

289
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh, my God.

290
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,020
Gibbs is going to kill you.

291
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,505
Kill me? Why?

292
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm not gonna tell him.

293
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,265
EOD has cleared 10% of the range so far.

294
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,065
In this small area and in a relatively
short span of time, we found three bodies.

295
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,740
Do the math and we could be looking at potentially
30 or more victims concealed down there.

296
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,500
Gunny, I want you to coordinate
with the Provost Martial.

297
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,140
I want a cordon around
that range 24 hours a day.

298
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,620
Agent Gibbs, that's a lot of
man power. You really think...

299
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,060
Well, then you'd better get moving.

300
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,340
Right.

301
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,580
Is there some secret to
getting on his good side?

302
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,100
Oh, there's no secret.

303
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,460
He doesn't have one.

304
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,380
Uh, excuse me, boss?

305
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,225
What?

306
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,540
We completed the back-trace
on the intruder's system.

307
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,580
Yeah?

308
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,940
Yeah, and, uh...

309
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,780
Well, the thing is...

310
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
The hacker...

311
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,300
It's me.

312
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,620
Why is NCIS interested
in Vic Gera, Gibbs?

313
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,060
Who said we were interested in him?

314
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,780
You ran his prints through AFIS.

315
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:26,380
Where'd you get them?

316
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,420
He gave them to us.

317
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,380
You have him in custody?

318
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,700
Technically speaking.

319
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,500
Where'd you find him?

320
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,300
On a live fire range at Quantico.

321
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,460
He was killed in a practice
bomb drop this morning.

322
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,900
He Mafia?

323
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,380
He's an undercover FBI Agent, DiNozzo.

324
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,260
When we saw your print search,
we were hoping Vic was alive.

325
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,780
I want his killer, Gibbs.

326
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,180
Is that an offer for
a joint investigation?

327
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,100
I can't.

328
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,020
Kate, Tony, escort our guests out.

329
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,780
I need to talk to you alone.

330
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,780
Our usual conference room.

331
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,700
What's going on?

332
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,340
Fornell seems unusually upset.

333
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,340
For an FBI Agent.

334
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,340
How would you feel if one of
your team was lying on a slab?

335
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,940
Depends on who it was.

336
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,300
You always a smart ass?

337
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,940
Just to you boys from
the Hoover building.

338
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,100
I'm listening.

339
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,380
Jimmy Napalitano.

340
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,100
Know him?

341
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,540
Fat, ugly Mafioso, runs the business
in Maryland, Virginia and D.C.

342
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,980
I've spent half my career trying
to put that bastard behind bars.

343
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,060
Three trials, three times
he walked on a technicality.

344
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,620
Tough to be sympathetic,
considering you let Ari go.

345
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,140
Ari's a valuable
intelligence asset, Gibbs.

346
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,540
Napalitano's nothing but a cheap hood.

347
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,780
Ari shot one of my people, kidnapped
one of my agents, put a round through me.

348
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,580
I don't see the difference, Fornell.

349
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,100
I knew this was a waste of time.

350
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,140
At least we agree on something.

351
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,260
Anyone ever tell you you're
an insufferable bastard?

352
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:23,380
Yeah.

353
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,860
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here
because I need your help.

354
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,780
I offered a joint investigation.

355
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,220
You turned it down.

356
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,900
I couldn't say anything
in front of those Agents.

357
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,060
You don't trust them?

358
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,100
Napalitano's always
been a step ahead of me.

359
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,940
Every informant, every agent I get close
to him ends up like that kid downstairs.

360
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
No one's that lucky.

361
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,300
He's got a mole in the Bureau.

362
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,320
Or someone with access to my operations.

363
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,740
Why not take it to Internal Affairs?

364
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,260
They can't help me.

365
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,060
But I can?

366
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,580
Realizing how sad this sounds, you're the
closest thing I have to a friend, Gibbs.

367
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,900
You dying or something?

368
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,980
Okay, not dying.

369
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,300
This some part of a 12-step program?

370
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,820
Look, you going to help me or not?

371
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,780
I'm thinking about it.

372
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,660
It's settled then.

373
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,220
This isn't your style, Tobias.

374
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,500
I know it.

375
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,260
The Bureau believes that the mole
who put my man on your slab...

376
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,580
is me.

377
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,020
Sorry, Tobias.

378
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,680
Hey, Tiffany, enough
with the smoking already.

379
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,200
Get off my back, Ricky.

380
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,120
I pay you to dance, not get lung cancer.

381
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,800
All right, already.

382
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,920
I thought Tiffany was your numero uno?

383
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Nah, I dumped her.

384
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,520
Rickey, how do ya dump
somethin' that looks like that?

385
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
It's easy.

386
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
Ba-da bing,
ba-da boom. Ciao!

387
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,080
I gotta remember that one.

388
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,760
The comedian is Napalitano's
son, Little Rickey.

389
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,520
Who's the muscle with him?

390
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,480
Sal Balducci, Napalitano's enforcer.

391
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
And that's the man himself.

392
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
Jimmy Napalitano, AKA Jimmy Naps.

393
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,720
He's politically connected and has
the finest lawyers money can buy.

394
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,360
He's virtually untouchable.

395
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
We got a problem.

396
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,320
What kind of problem, Pops?

397
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,400
Not here.

398
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,160
Inside.

399
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,080
You got ears inside?

400
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,480
No. Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.

401
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,160
Camera two, get me tight on
the thug by the rear entrance.

402
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,160
- They find our bugs and wiretaps before we finish installing them.
- Or your mole tips 'em off.

403
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,765
There's no mole.

404
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.

405
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,120
They study us like we study them.

406
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,800
Rumor has it they have
dossiers on all of us.

407
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,400
They even know we're
watching them right now.

408
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
Camera one, show me Abe.

409
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,480
Hello, Abe.

410
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
"Abe?"

411
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,160
As in Vigoda.

412
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
That's the FBI call sign for him.

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,645
Oh, yeah, it does sort of look like him.

414
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,200
Tom, can you get me
off, for old time's sake?

415
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Sorry, Solly. No can do.

416
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
You two through?

417
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,205
Sorry.

418
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,080
Point is, Agent Gibbs, it's
impossible to get near them.

419
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:34,520
Agent Gera did.

420
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,120
And he's dead.

421
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,520
Not much of a view.

422
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,320
Kind of reminds me of your basement.

423
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,565
It'sot dark enough.

424
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,485
You see the Bureau's case against me?

425
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,200
You know that your people
won't share files with us.

426
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,280
What's this supposed to be?

427
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,805
Coffee.

428
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,480
I'll take your word for it.

429
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,160
They found two kilos of coke and 50
grand in counterfeit bills in my freezer.

430
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,200
I thought the coke in ice
cream quarts was a nice touch.

431
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:15,560
It was an expensive one.

432
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,200
Jimmy Naps's going to a lot of
trouble to frame youTobias... Why now?

433
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
He knew I was vulnerable.

434
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,560
Vulnerable? How?

435
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,000
Ari.

436
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,120
You laying this on me, huh?

437
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,040
I arranged your meeting
with him, Jethro.

438
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,640
He's our only agent inside
Al Qaeda, and what did you do?

439
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,760
You shot him.

440
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,400
I could have killed him.

441
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,200
Putting a round in his shoulder
helped sell his cover to Al Qaeda.

442
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,800
Why don't you explain
that to the director?

443
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,320
He didn't buy it when I did.

444
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Okay. If you think it'll do any good.

445
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm not getting out of this, am I?

446
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,760
Ah, you'll get out of it.

447
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,280
It just may not be the way you like.

448
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,120
Duck, what do you got for me?

449
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:26,160
Ah, I've identified our second victim
from the dental charts supplied by the FBI.

450
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
His name's Frank Pilato.

451
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,000
Frankie P.

452
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,040
He was to testify against
Napalitano five years ago.

453
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,040
Disappeared walking his
dog on a Sunday afternoon.

454
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,320
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon
strolls can be dangerous.

455
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,800
Ducky, I thought you said the test indicated
he was dead only five or six months ago.

456
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,560
I did.

457
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
Anyone care to guess how he died?

458
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,720
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say something to do with flames?

459
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,880
And you'd be wrong, Tony.

460
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,280
His throat was slit.

461
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,880
Bled to death.

462
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,320
Actually, no, Kate.

463
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,960
Lead poisoning.

464
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,600
Three nine-millimeter
slugs to be exact.

465
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Administered at close range.

466
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,480
He was kidnapped in '99. And
wasn't shot until a few months ago?

467
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,360
He was most likely executed years ago;

468
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
His body has only recently
been exposed to the elements.

469
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,480
Excuse me.

470
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,840
His blood was drained after death...

471
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
and his body frozen.

472
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,240
Jimmy Naps' version of the ice man.

473
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,560
They stashed the body in a cooler somewhere and then
dump it years later when everyone's stopped looking.

474
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,040
Yeesh. Shot, throat
slit, frozen and burned?

475
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,840
Jimmy Naps definitely
didn't like this dude.

476
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,440
The Mafia does tend to have a
flair for the dramatic, Tony.

477
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,800
Anything on the finger parts Gunny
De Luca picked up on the range?

478
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm good, Jethro, but not that good.

479
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,680
I sent them up to Abby.

480
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,920
Kate, Tony.

481
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,080
On it, boss.

482
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,040
Agent Charles, can you get
me the Bureau file on Fornell?

483
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,240
I haven't even seen it.

484
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,120
I get caught, I'm finished
as a Federal Agent.

485
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,280
Don't get caught.

486
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,080
You know what I think, McGee?

487
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,840
What?

488
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
I think you're more interested
in me than what I'm doing.

489
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,360
That's not true.

490
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,360
Wait, not that I-I'm not
interested... in you. I am.

491
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,160
But I'm more interested in the work.

492
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,720
How could you say that?

493
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,640
Because what I'm looking
at through the microscope...

494
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,280
Yeah?

495
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,200
...is up there on that screen.

496
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,160
Hey, guys!

497
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
You here for the finger or the blood?

498
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,440
What blood?

499
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
I found two types on Agent Gera's face.

500
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,000
One is his. One is not.

501
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,800
So if he was beaten, you know, kind of like the way
you were yesterday by Gibbs, it could be the killer's.

502
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Kate, Kate, Kate, when I
let Gibbs win, we all win.

503
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,440
And if I beat the crap out of him,

504
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
who do you think he's
going to take it out on?

505
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,440
Oh, that's right, all of us.

506
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,360
So you took a dive for the team?

507
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,400
Of course, McGee.

508
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,560
It's good to know.

509
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
It sure is.

510
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,800
Turn around.

511
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,280
I'm waiting for you to slap
the back of my head, boss.

512
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm not going to slap your head.

513
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,920
You're not?

514
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
What, you don't think
I have a sense of humor?

515
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,400
Abbs, I need the DNA
on the unknown blood.

516
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,240
I already started it.

517
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
Okay, what about the finger?

518
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,200
Any idea how long it
was it on the range?

519
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,320
Well, ordinarily, you can't date
bone unless it's been in the ground

520
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,045
long enough to soak up fluorine.
Which is, like, hundreds of years.

521
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,760
But sometimes being in a place where
things get blown up is a good thing.

522
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,520
I swabbed the finger for explosives
and I found traces of one:

523
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,040
mercury fulminate, which was completely
phased out by the military by 1986.

524
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,280
Well, that means the Mafia must have
been dumping bodies down there for...

525
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
At least 18 years.

526
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,360
Thank you, McGee.

527
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,520
That's a good job, Abbs.

528
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
McGee, find a way to
get Little Rickey's DNA.

529
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,480
Okay.

530
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,080
It's no fun if you know it's coming.

531
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,360
What was that for?!

532
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,120
That's for eating my sandwich.

533
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,960
I know how to get Little Rickey's DNA.

534
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,720
Gonna sleep with him?

535
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,680
He was hit with two paternity
suits in the last five years.

536
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,400
Beat them both with a DNA test.

537
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,400
Nice try, Probie, but those
tests are sealed court records.

538
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,280
Those court records are sealed, McGee.

539
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,325
Hey, that's what I
just said- first!

540
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,240
But not the records from
the lab that he used.

541
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,200
It's downtown.

542
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
You'll never get a judge
to sign off on that warrant.

543
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,040
Maybe we don't need one.

544
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,320
That is, if you're
ready to become a father.

545
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,360
I think she's talking to you, Probie.

546
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,720
We go down to the lab and
see if I'm carrying your baby.

547
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,600
It'll be fun.

548
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,360
Oh, and we can steal
Little Rickey's DNA test.

549
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,800
Photograph it for Abby.

550
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,280
I'll do it.

551
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,040
Why you?

552
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,880
You think anyone'd believe
you actually slept with Kate?

553
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,240
Hey!

554
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,640
I figured out how to get
Little Rickey's DNA records.

555
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,800
You mean I fig...

556
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
Hey, there is no 'I'in "team", McGee.

557
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,280
How?

558
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,640
Paternity clinic downtown.

559
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,880
Kate and I can have them in an hour.

560
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,040
Go get 'em.

561
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,280
Thank you, sir.

562
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,000
McGee.

563
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,320
I got the file on Fornell.

564
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,560
Good.

565
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,520
Not good.

566
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,960
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps
was under surveillance.

567
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,840
He can explain this.

568
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,560
That photo came from
an anonymous source.

569
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,160
From the newspaper blowup
you can see the date.

570
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,680
The 17th?

571
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Tobias had me pull
surveillance on the 17th.

572
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Why?

573
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,320
Never said.

574
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,880
But it's the day before
Agent Gera disappeared.

575
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,160
He didn't hang himself, not Fornell.

576
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,160
That's the coward's way out
and Tobias was no coward.

577
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Only one person was in
this cell with him today.

578
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,320
Who?

579
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,080
Me.

580
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,440
To cut him down.

581
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,320
Doctor...

582
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,920
I would like our M.E.,

583
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,720
Dr. Mallard, to receive a
copy of your autopsy report.

584
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
Ducky? Of course.

585
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,560
You writing my name right?

586
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,120
What?!

587
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,160
I just want to know if it's mine.

588
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
She kind of sleeps around a
lot, if you know what I mean.

589
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,840
If I did, it's 'cause
he ain't any good in bed.

590
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,200
Least I didn't sleep with my cousin.

591
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
You slept with my sister.

592
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
I thought it was you.

593
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,720
She weighs 300 pounds.

594
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,800
She was wearing your earrings.

595
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,640
Now that's enough.

596
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,240
If you two can't be civil I'm
going to have to ask you leave.

597
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,040
Look, is there anywhere that I
can wait away from him, please?

598
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm begging you.

599
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,520
There's an empty exam room
behind you two doors on the right.

600
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,120
Thank you.

601
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,040
I'm sorry.

602
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,400
She slept with my brother... and
my best friend at the same time.

603
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,920
Okay, we've got Rickey's
DNA from the clinic.

604
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,880
Let's see if we can match it to
our sample from the crime scene.

605
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,920
We're cued up. Initiating DNA match.

606
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,040
That's it, it's Rickey
Napalitano's blood.

607
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,080
Thanks, Abs.

608
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,200
We made a good couple, Kate.

609
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
For The Jerry Springer Show.

610
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Dig your threads.

611
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:21,125
You got to be kidding me?

612
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,840
Un-freaking-believable,
he whacked himself.

613
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
Yeah, poor Fornell.

614
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
You won't see him no more, Pops.

615
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,880
What the...?

616
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,640
This guy's pulling us over, boss.

617
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,320
If I find out we got a busted taillight
or something, Sallie boy, it's your ass.

618
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,640
Is there a problem, officer?

619
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
You're talking to the wrong person.

620
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,680
We got a warrant for your
arrest, Little Dickey.

621
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,720
It's Rickey.

622
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,640
It's for murder, Dickey.

623
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,040
Come on.

624
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
Get out.

625
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,160
All right.

626
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Hands on the hood, big guy.

627
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:10,920
Hand up.

628
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,920
Who the hell are you guys anyway, FBI?

629
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,200
NCIS.

630
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,160
Meat inspectors?

631
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?

632
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,800
They're Navy cops. Turn around.

633
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,080
Arrested by Navy cops?

634
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,080
Talk about embarrassing.

635
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,560
At least you're hot, sweet...

636
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,720
Take it easy, take it easy.

637
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,160
Now that's embarrassing.

638
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,200
Let's go.

639
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
All right, don't worry.

640
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,280
Go with them, Rickey.

641
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,880
Our lawyers'll take care of this.

642
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
I don't think we've met, Agent...

643
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,280
Special Agent. Gibbs.

644
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Special Agent Gibbs.

645
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,280
So who is it my son was
supposed to have whacked?

646
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,600
An FBI Agent.

647
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,760
Victor Gera.

648
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,544
I remember something about that.
Something happened on a marine base?

649
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:57,124
What was that?

650
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,693
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.

651
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,208
A bomb. Yeah, yeah.

652
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,796
Suppose- God forbid-
that my son could be

653
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:06,162
connected to this accident,
what would you charge him with,

654
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,400
Special Agent Gibbs?

655
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,440
Manslaughter.

656
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,480
Manslaughter?

657
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,360
Manslaughter, what's the worst
you can get with that, Sallie?

658
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,880
Four years. Does one.

659
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,280
Might do the kid some
good, season him up a bit.

660
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,680
Jail can be a dangerous place.

661
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,800
So they tell me.

662
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
You remind me of somebody,
Special Agent Gibbs.

663
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,720
Who was that guy that always
talking trash, that Fed?

664
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,680
Fornell?

665
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,320
Oh, yeah, Fornell.

666
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,160
That's it, yeah.

667
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,240
Whatever happened to him?

668
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,360
I think he hung himself.

669
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,720
Real sad.

670
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,720
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.

671
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,560
All that ambition and everything
and he ends up doing the twist.

672
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,320
I get the government agent on
your payroll by sunup, dirt bag...

673
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,280
or Little Rickey does the twist.

674
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,120
Say I do this, all right?

675
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
What do I get?

676
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,619
I deliver Little Rickey to you,

677
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:11,887
the evidence against him gets
lost, and you never see me again.

678
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,720
You'd do all this just
to clear Fornell's name?

679
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,000
He was my friend.

680
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,600
You can't threaten to kill
someone in custody, Gibbs.

681
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,680
It wasn't a threat.

682
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,800
You'd really do it?

683
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Hey.

684
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,320
You want to clear Tobias's name?

685
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,080
Hell, yes.

686
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,480
But not by letting Little
Rickey off for Vic's murder.

687
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,920
Oh, he'll screw up again.

688
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,560
You think Jimmy Naps is going to make
a swap and just let you walk away?

689
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:45,120
I hope not.

690
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,045
Gibbs.

691
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,710
Rear of the club. One hour.

692
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:55,000
Lose the Feds in the
building and in the alley.

693
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,440
Oh, I can't do that.

694
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm operating on my own hook.

695
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,560
Pick another place.

696
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,880
You want me to pick a place?

697
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm trying to show you there
are no tricks here, Jimmy boy.

698
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,280
Coleman Park.

699
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,160
You know it?

700
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,680
Yeah. Yeah, I know it.

701
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,920
Come alone.

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,085
I'm not that stupid.

703
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,480
All right, we each bring a man.

704
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,880
One hour.

705
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,760
And, Gibbs... you hurt my boy,

706
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,840
I'll kill your brothers, your uncles, your
father... and after their funerals, I'll kill you.

707
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,480
No brothers, no uncles.

708
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,160
My father passed years ago.

709
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,960
I do have three ex-wives
whose names and addresses

710
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,080
I will gladly fax on to you.

711
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Oh. He hung up.

712
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:41,161
Whoa.

713
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,480
Where do you three think you're going?

714
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,280
With you, boss.

715
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
I can bring one back up.

716
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,680
Clearly you should take me.

717
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:51,629
Kate, with all due respect...

718
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
Are you kidding, Tony,
why should he bring you?

719
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,600
With all due respect,
you have no idea...

720
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,840
You're a total jackass.

721
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,240
Come on, you can conduct
yourself in the field?

722
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,360
Agent Charles is going.

723
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,240
Me?

724
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Are you kidding, boss?

725
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,240
He's kidding, right?

726
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,280
I don't think he is, Tony.

727
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,520
Gibbs, you need someone...

728
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,240
Someone who can verify the guy that
Jimmy Naps turns over is FBI or Justice.

729
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,066
Can any of you do that?

730
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,720
He's right.

731
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,720
I know the players.

732
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,680
I go.

733
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,480
These bracelets are killing me.

734
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,000
You hear me?

735
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,600
Stay there, Sallie.

736
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,480
Stay, stay.

737
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,080
Where's my boy?

738
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,920
Where's Rickey?

739
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,840
Pops.

740
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,080
Hey. You okay, son?

741
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,760
No.

742
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Make them take these
freaking bracelets off me.

743
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,760
Where's your end of the swap?

744
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,360
I leave my backup at
the car, u do the same.

745
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,880
Sallie, bring him out.

746
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,640
Yeah, I got it.

747
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,800
Come on, let's go.

748
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,960
Come on. Chop-chop, let's go.

749
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,040
We ain't got all day.

750
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
That's Abe.

751
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
Stupido.

752
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,840
Pop, I had nothing to do...

753
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
Not you, not you. This jabone.

754
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,000
What'd you think I was gonna do, let you come
in my backyard and walk away with your coglioni?

755
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,640
You know what Primacord is, Jimmy?

756
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,520
Primacord?

757
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,360
That was Primacord.

758
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,360
This... is Primacord.

759
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,144
Oh! Oh! Pops!

760
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:18,418
And this is a dead-man's switch.

761
00:39:18,932 --> 00:39:19,711
Oh, marone.

762
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:21,360
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.

763
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,880
All you have to do is
give me your mole's name.

764
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,120
Yeah, that's what we thought.

765
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,240
You dumb Wop.

766
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,760
He never would've set it off.

767
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,440
The blast would kill him.

768
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,480
Who you gonna believe?

769
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,120
He's pazzo, Pop.

770
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
He'll do it. He'll do it.

771
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,040
In fact, I think the blast
should kill all of you.

772
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,040
You should've kept your
mouth shut, Napalitano.

773
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,800
You lied to me, Jimmy.

774
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
Like you didn't expect it.

775
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,480
I just saved all our lives.

776
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,920
Now what?

777
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,160
Ciao.

778
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,720
Pops.

779
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,240
Pops!

780
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,840
You go to jail, you stay
there a couple of years,

781
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,680
it'll do you good, son.

782
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,880
Come on, come on, come on, let's go.

783
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,560
Hey, let's go.

784
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,280
Get this thing off me.

785
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,520
Here. Do it yourself.

786
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,760
Boom.

787
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,720
What you doing there, Probie?

788
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,280
I'm trying to find what I missed.

789
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,600
How did Gibbs know that it was Charles?

790
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,880
You mean you didn't know?

791
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,440
He didn't know.

792
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,400
What, you knew?

793
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,400
We're seasoned investigators, McGee.

794
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,520
You have to start
thinking outside the box.

795
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,760
Expect the unexpected.

796
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Good advice, Tony.

797
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,040
Agent Todd.

798
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
DiNozzo. McGee.

799
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:29,200
What?
