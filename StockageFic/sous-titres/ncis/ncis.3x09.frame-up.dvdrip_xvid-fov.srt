1
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,084
lt's called Shroomsville
because the guys think

2
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,760
these reeds
look like little mushrooms.

3
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,480
Or they were on mushrooms.

4
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,837
Hey. You're not supposed
to be lighting fires out here.

5
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,317
lt's against base rules.
Let's go, kids. Let's go home.

6
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,042
You too, miss. Let's go.

7
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:33,846
Last one out has to douse the fire.

8
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:31,321
Oh, yeah, baby.

9
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:34,285
Oh, come on.

10
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:38,285
Come on, come on.

11
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:41,486
l'm trying to concentrate.

12
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,683
That makes two of us then,
doesn't it, Ziva?

13
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:48,085
- ls it work-related?
- Of course it's work-related, Ziva.

14
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:53,077
- JudgeMyTush.com?
- Hey, a little privacy here, probie.

15
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:02,125
- l give it a four.
- Are you kidding? Four?

16
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,835
Out of five, l think that's good.
lsn't it?

17
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,725
Out of five.

18
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,480
What do you think about this one?

19
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:14,040
- Come on. Come on.
- l will not get involved with this further.

20
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,879
Gibbs seems to always be
around the corner.

21
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,038
- Give me a little something. Come on.
- No. No. No.

22
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,799
What do you think? Rate it.

23
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,327
- Fine. A two.
- A two?

24
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,366
- A two?
- What's a two, DiNozzo?

25
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,404
l was just explaining
the rules to Ziva, boss.

26
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,319
And number two is what?

27
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:39,005
- You know, l was a little fuzzy on two.
- Grab your gear.

28
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,401
We're going to Quantico.

29
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,996
Two.

30
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,522
l took three points off
for excessive hair.

31
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,040
l don't have--

32
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,766
That's a five.

33
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,079
lf you shave.

34
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,319
Shave.

35
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,603
Marines run tactics
through these woods every day, sir.

36
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,916
What time yesterday?

37
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,759
- 1 900.
- Ducky, where's Jimmy?

38
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:10,719
Having a root canal.

39
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,679
Allow me.

40
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,759
Thank you.

41
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:17,881
Thank you.

42
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,959
Oh, watch your step.

43
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,606
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,606
Oh, let me give you a hand.

45
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,235
No, no, no. lt's lovely
that chivalry is not dead, doctor.

46
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,602
But in the army, l swam three miles
across the Red Sea

47
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:33,884
after scaling rough cliffs
without safety lines.

48
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,878
l believe l can manage.

49
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,886
How refreshing.
An independent woman.

50
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:51,246
They were under this bush here,
until l moved one to here.

51
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,964
- The teenagers?
- Said they never noticed the legs.

52
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,884
Tony, shoot. Ziva, bag and tag.

53
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,366
- McGee, samples.
- Got it.

54
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,919
Well, l'm afraid a liver temp
is out of the question.

55
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,845
Well, talk to me, Duck.

56
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,918
lt's very strange.

57
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:11,318
The marbling on the skin
indicates advanced decomposition.

58
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:15,959
But the complete lack of insect activity
on the moist area of the open thigh

59
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,078
indicates a cessation of decay.

60
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:19,720
Any idea how long?

61
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:22,606
Well, the muscles have gone
through all three stages of rigor mortis,

62
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,598
so that gives us at least 48 hours.

63
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,163
But, Jethro,
the leg is in pristine condition,

64
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,882
apparently untouched
by air, water, soil or insect.

65
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,766
- Frozen?
- No ice crystals.

66
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,406
Basement?

67
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,161
Well, if that's the case,
we are dealing with a dark soul,

68
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:42,046
one who kills, cuts and keeps.

69
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,042
That's trash.

70
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,640
l think l know
what l'm doing by now.

71
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:52,958
Well, MREs and paint pellets,
say training area to me.

72
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,556
No one has ever been killed
during training?

73
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:59,159
You know, my forensic instructor
back at FLETC

74
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,558
once planted a pregnancy test
at a crime scene to test us.

75
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,406
That's nice, probie.
But in my years as an investigator,

76
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,919
l've learned that trash indigenous
to an area is not worth collecting.

77
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:13,245
What if because l did not bag
and tag this trash,

78
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,920
l happened to miss this?

79
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,118
The finger of a rubber glove.

80
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,395
l didn't say don't look
under indigenous stuff.

81
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,165
- l think we're almost done here.
- No, l don't think so.

82
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,722
l want every paper, projectile,

83
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,845
stomped-on leaf
within a ten-foot radius of both legs.

84
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,443
l'll bet Tony made some unseemly
comment about these legs, didn't he?

85
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,319
Why would he do that, Mr. Palmer?

86
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,963
l just mean knowing Tony--

87
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,199
They're fairly shapely legs, doctor.

88
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:53,805
Yes, nobody had the bad taste
to verbalize such a thought until now.

89
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,195
Now that you
come to mention it,

90
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,756
they do look remarkably similar
to Betty Grable's.

91
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,076
Betty--?

92
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,556
One of the all-time pin-up gals
of the '40s.

93
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,922
- Yeah, great gams.
- Gams?

94
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,920
Aren't you a little young
to remember Betty Grable, Jethro?

95
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,555
My dad had her painted on the nose
of his P-51 , Duck.

96
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,319
- A P-51 ?
- Up to Abby.

97
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,840
- Quick as you can.
- Yes, doctor.

98
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,360
What do we know
about our Jane Doe?

99
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,677
She was young.
Look at the femur here.

100
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:19,999
lt's one of the last bones in the body
to develop fully.

101
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,244
ln the female,
growth is complete around age 25.

102
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,956
l'd say our victim
was between 1 9 and 21 .

103
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,721
- lD?
- Without a toeprint database,

104
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,845
l'm afraid we'll just have to rely
on good old DNA.

105
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,084
What about the splotch
on her calf, Duck?

106
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:37,965
Blood. l'd say the assailant's.

107
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:42,006
lt's on its way up
to Abby's mass spectrometer.

108
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,680
- Couldn't be hers?
- lt could be.

109
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,520
But she was dead
long before she was dissected.

110
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,359
Blood no longer pulsed
through her veins,

111
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,683
when, what l would guess
was a surgical saw,

112
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,600
severed her thighs from her torso.

113
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:56,844
Now, look, see how my glove
sticks here?

114
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,885
Also headed up
to the mass spectrometer.

115
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,117
Yes, but take a look at this.

116
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,878
- Skin's been removed.
- Yes. A meticulously cut circle.

117
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,241
Strange keepsake.

118
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:12,678
Actually, l think it was the killer
trying to remove his marks.

119
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,917
Like all sex killers after Bundy?

120
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,078
Yes, after Theodore Bundy

121
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:20,723
was identified and caught
by his crooked lower teeth,

122
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:24,806
sadistic biters have been forced
to excise their evidence.

123
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:28,636
You know, l think l might be able
to get an impression of teeth

124
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:32,362
from the underlying damaged tissue.

125
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,518
You could get me a bite mark?

126
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,518
l could try.

127
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,358
l have some samples for Abby.

128
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,358
That's convenient,
because l'm Abby's assistant.

129
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,676
l wanted to say hi.

130
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,044
- l haven't seen her in a while.
- She's really busy right now.

131
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:50,435
lt'll only take a minute.

132
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,998
You haven't been an assistant
for very long.

133
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,167
- Longer than you.
- We'll see about that.

134
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,880
That doesn't make any sense, Chip.

135
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,198
lt's Charles.

136
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,679
Charles.

137
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,758
lt's an evidence showcase
showdown, Chip.

138
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:11,559
What do you prefer? Possible prints,
sticky stuff, or name that blood?

139
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,479
Well, l aced serology.

140
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,036
l was a dilettante
with fingerprint identification, so--

141
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,518
Name the sticky stuff
for a hundred, Chip.

142
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:20,955
For a Caucasian female,

143
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,278
a factor of 2.90
is multiplied by the tibia length.

144
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:28,844
Okay, autopsy report says
tibia is 38.34 centimetres.

145
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,396
- What are you doing?
- We are calculating our Jane Doe's

146
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,956
- probable height and weight.
- Why didn't you ask me?

147
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,516
Tony, these are complex equations
we're dealing with.

148
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,643
Whatever. She was, what, 5'8''.

149
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:42,243
So she's like 1 25, 1 26 pounds. Hey.

150
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay, 1 1 1 .1 86 for adipose.
Density of musculature--

151
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,284
That's 61 .53.

152
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,796
1 72.72 centimetres for height.

153
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,084
Ducky estimates
57.08 kilograms in weight.

154
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,238
Converting to imperial,
and we're done.

155
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:02,043
- She's 5-foot-8.
- 1 25 and a half pounds?

156
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,526
This doesn't make any sense.

157
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:12,925
You're grumbling.

158
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,555
Well, l know.
l can't read Ziva's writing.

159
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,643
lt looks perfectly clear to me.

160
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,524
You've got to loosen up, Chip.

161
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,605
Evidence is fun. Fun?

162
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,406
You know fun. Fun, Chip.

163
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,207
- You're a tough case, Chip.
- Yeah, l know.

164
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,001
Gibbs. All this evidence
and a Caf-Pow!

165
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,964
- ls it my birthday?
- Pretend it's mine.

166
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:42,876
Okay, here's what l have for you.
The blood on the calf is different

167
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:46,084
from the victim's. l sent both off for
processing. But here's your real gift.

168
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,522
l found a smudged print
on the tip of the glove finger

169
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,757
and clarified it into a partial print.
Happy birthday.

170
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,044
- Get a match.
- lt's running through AFlS now.

171
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,366
l must have ripped a glove
at the scene, boss.

172
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,877
Like l said, l must've ripped
a glove at the crime scene

173
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,242
- some time before yesterday.
- When was the last time

174
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,205
- you worked a crime scene there?
- Napolitano case, boss.

175
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:35,438
The computer only found three points
from your fingerprint to the sample.

176
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:37,165
Most prosecutors want 1 1 .

177
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,922
Well, technically, Abby,
the minimum to go to court is one.

178
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,525
Well, l'm just saying that, you know,
people have been convicted on less.

179
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,121
Well, that's great, Chipper.
Team player.

180
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,643
l'm gonna redo this by hand.

181
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,397
You set this up, didn't you?

182
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:01,845
l would never.
Okay, maybe l would, but l didn't.

183
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,241
- lt matches Tony.
- Put a rush on those blood samples.

184
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:10,046
- l did. But it's a 1 6-hour turnaround.
- Make it 1 2.

185
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:15,838
When's the last time
you were at the dentist?

186
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,201
Hold still.

187
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,757
This is far faster
and more accurate than your x-rays.

188
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,327
You're not known for your bedside
manner, are you there, Duck?

189
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,398
You're just upset
that l didn't have peppermint.

190
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,206
McGee.

191
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,803
Here's Tony.

192
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,083
The program uses laser scans
of 3-D objects

193
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,522
to create 3-D images
for comparison.

194
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,723
Computer-generated
hollow volume overlay.

195
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,004
Measures inter-tooth spacing,
dental arc, tooth thickness.

196
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,998
All right,
enough of the geek speak.

197
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,357
Here's Ducky's muscle-tissue scan.

198
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,717
A little 3-D magic for clarity.

199
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:04,920
And l give you the killer's incisors.
Next step--

200
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,602
And don't worry, Tony, the chances
of even one of your teeth matching

201
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,327
are like 1 00,000 to 1 .

202
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:12,636
Do it, Abby.

203
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,443
Jethro, l know DiNozzo
didn't do this.

204
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:28,923
But l also know
that it would be political suicide

205
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,317
if we got caught investigating
one of our own agents.

206
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:33,245
Appearances matter, Jethro.

207
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,796
ln this world,
sometimes more than facts.

208
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,006
lt could ruin the agency.
Look at Robert Novak and the ClA.

209
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:43,919
You have a responsibility to your man,
l know that.

210
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:47,159
But l have a responsibility
to the entire agency.

211
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:50,125
- Jen--
- l'm not forgetting the time

212
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,279
l stepped in it and you covered my ass
until l could get out of it,

213
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:56,837
but that was alone, undercover,
and in the field.

214
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,362
Half of NClS
already knows about this.

215
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:03,202
l know what you have to do, Jethro,
and l won't stop you.

216
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,601
But officially,

217
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,725
l am suspending you
from investigating this further,

218
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,004
- and l am turning it over to the FBl.
- l know.

219
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:13,562
One request.

220
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,957
l'll see that Fornell
runs the investigation.

221
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,039
l always could read your mind.

222
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,203
Not always, Jen.

223
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:31,839
Still waiting on Jane Doe's DNA.

224
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,641
Corporal at Quantico said there were
no missing female dependents

225
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,445
- or UA Marines.
- Try the base hospital.

226
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,286
l checked missing persons
for Maryland, Virginia and D.C.

227
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,398
There were
a few similar descriptions.

228
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,637
Their DNA is headed over now.

229
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,481
- David Brant.
- Gibbs.

230
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,080
l heard you were quitting.

231
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:50,557
l like to refer to it as a lateral move
into the recreational sector, Jethro.

232
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:51,961
l wish you luck with that.

233
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,958
Lateral move
into the recreational sector?

234
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,762
Yeah, it mostly means
fishing and hitting a golf ball.

235
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,400
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss.

236
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,398
- What are you doing?
- Someone's setting me up.

237
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:04,877
Two surgically removed legs
dumped into a training area.

238
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,924
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,521
l was trying to think
of arrestees with grudges.

240
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:13,356
- Wouldn't they all have grudges?
- You see my dilemma.

241
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,802
- Mike Macaluso?
- He's the Mafia boss

242
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,527
- DiNozzo busted in Baltimore.
- They get touchy when they think

243
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,439
of you as family
and you turn out to be a cop.

244
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,997
What about that forensics dweeb
that you got fired?

245
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,282
l didn't arrest him, Abby.

246
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,836
Yeah, but you really, really,
really pissed him off.

247
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,204
Forensic tech set a killer free when
he contaminated some blood samples.

248
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,086
- Tony reported him.
- Good old George Stewart.

249
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,238
You know,
maybe you should expand the list

250
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,602
just to include people
that just hate you.

251
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,440
- Hate me? Nobody hates me.
- Paula Cassidy.

252
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,198
Don't go there.
People like me. l'm a nice guy.

253
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,523
What about the woman
who posted your picture

254
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,915
on the herpes-alert website?

255
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:51,836
- Lieutenant Pam Kim.
- She so went <i>Fatal Attraction</i> on you.

256
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,486
Boiled the bunny.

257
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,399
Oh, don't forget about Mrs. Dean.

258
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,361
- Another girlfriend?
- No, she threatened to cut off

259
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,599
his...when Tony put her husband
away for murdering his first wife.

260
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:06,204
Speaking about wives,
what about your ex-girlfriend Monica?

261
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,484
l always break up with them
when l find out they're married, Ziva.

262
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,846
Okay, all right. Thank you all,
but l think that's enough.

263
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,839
The personnel
in the evidence garage?

264
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,645
- What about them?
- They hate you.

265
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,642
She's right. You never wait your turn
to check in evidence.

266
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,086
And women don't appreciate
being called baggie bunnies.

267
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,761
They're right, DiNozzo.
Eight years. Three different forces.

268
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,322
That's a lot of names
and people to remember, boss.

269
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,479
Ziva, take the women.
McGee, you take the men.

270
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,679
l'll pull the case files of the ones
DiNozzo put away who are on the list.

271
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,957
Wait a minute,
you never do anything.

272
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:42,283
Because you're such
a good delegator.

273
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,117
Oh, this is not good.

274
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:48,921
Gibbs.

275
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,846
DiNozzo.

276
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,322
This is Special Agent Sacks.

277
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:03,405
- He's being framed.
- l believe you.

278
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,438
l've been there myself, Jethro.

279
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,162
- l'll take care of him.
- l know.

280
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:09,840
But l wanna be kept in the loop.

281
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:12,117
Oh, now l'm hurt.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

282
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,675
Whoever set this up, Tobias,
is a pro.

283
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,317
lf this were to go to court right now,
DiNozzo would not stand a chance.

284
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,204
Well, l gotta take him
into custody for questioning.

285
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,516
Or l guess
we could question him here.

286
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:33,595
Tony, Fornell's gonna question you.

287
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,440
- You mean interrogate me.
- Question. Draw it out.

288
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,286
After we talk to Agent DiNozzo,

289
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,325
we'll need to requisition any evidence
involved in the case.

290
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,237
- Are we covered on evidence?
- l'll just need a few hours

291
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,841
to copy the data from Tony's
hard drive, cell phone--

292
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:54,918
- l'll make duplicates.
- Have Ducky do the same.

293
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:56,440
- What can l do?
- Help. Help Abby.

294
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,757
Help McGee. Help Ducky.

295
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:02,716
Where were you Tuesday night

296
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:06,436
between 0900 and 0300
the next morning?

297
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,366
Would that be Zulu time?

298
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,043
Just run through your night.

299
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,322
Okay.

300
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,398
Oh, out loud. Right.

301
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:30,920
Worked till 7, went for a run,
drove home.

302
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,925
Spent the night alone,
which, l know, is unusual,

303
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:38,046
but it was a school night,
and l wanted to watch <i>Magnum</i>.

304
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,156
What was it about?

305
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,120
The old checking-the-plot ploy.

306
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,676
You're good, Agent Sacks.

307
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,355
Very good.
lt's my favourite <i>Magnum</i>.

308
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,082
lt's the one where he finds himself
adrift at sea after a boating accident

309
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,597
and vividly relives his father's death
during the Korean War.

310
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,837
l'm gonna go out on a limb here.

311
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,440
You think you were framed.

312
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,960
Now we're getting somewhere.

313
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,637
And who do you think
it was who framed you?

314
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,598
Well,

315
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,839
any one of a hundred people,
maybe.

316
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,725
l have a list if you're interested.

317
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:20,640
Do you realise the kind of trouble
you're in here, DiNozzo?

318
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,923
Oh, believe me. l do.

319
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,361
Do you realise
that you have an enormous clump

320
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,438
of something green
between your teeth?

321
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,598
lt's right there.

322
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,279
What is it about women?

323
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,604
ls it the way they smell
or the beguiling smiles?

324
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,997
The whispers? The secrets?

325
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:51,677
The way they tiptoe around
in those little ridiculous shoes?

326
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:56,762
And the way they fit their tiny
little bodies into those tiny little outfits.

327
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,363
You're wasting my time.

328
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:09,886
Take it easy.

329
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:13,801
This guy is implicated in a homicide,
and he's making jokes.

330
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:16,435
You've never worked with NClS
before, have you, Agent Sacks?

331
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,644
Federal agents suspected of crimes
don't get special treatment in my book.

332
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:21,399
lt's late.
We should collect the evidence.

333
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,683
We have to arrest him, Fornell.

334
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,202
Bite marks don't lie,
and this guy can't stop.

335
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,120
l'll think about it.

336
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,202
The U.S. attorney's gonna see this
as a heinous crime.

337
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,796
lt is a heinous crime, Fornell.

338
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,322
- Tony didn't do it.
- Without an alibi.

339
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,039
l'd be remiss if we didn't detain him.

340
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,482
People are gonna think
we're orchestrating a cover-up.

341
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,438
- Finally. How'd l do?
- Fine.

342
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,326
Fine?
l thought l was Oscar material.

343
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,715
Fornell's not gonna book you.

344
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:43,484
But he is gonna take you into custody
until we figure out a few things.

345
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:01,081
You all right?

346
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,283
l must have screwed up, Gibbs.

347
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,801
You didn't screw up, Abs.

348
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,795
But now l have all this evidence.

349
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:15,118
Forensics.
The thing that l love and l believe in.

350
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,925
And it says Tony's a murderer.

351
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:20,318
- Tony's not a murderer.
- l know he isn't.

352
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,884
But something's gotta give.

353
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:26,084
l mean, either
the forensics are wrong,

354
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:30,559
just bad forensics, or...

355
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:32,797
We have to save him, Gibbs.

356
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,920
- We will.
- Because if this goes to court,

357
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:41,244
with his fingerprint
and his bite mark on the leg,

358
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:44,558
Tony's gonna go to prison
for the rest of his life.

359
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:47,327
And l'll be the one
to put him there.

360
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,802
l smelled you coming, boss.

361
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,802
Pepperoni, sausage,
extra cheese, right?

362
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,636
My favourite. Thanks.

363
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,517
l'll save that for later.

364
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,163
You know, l've been thinking.

365
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,080
l'm a federal prosecutor's dream.

366
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:33,802
You do tend to date a lot,
don't you, Mr. DiNozzo?

367
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,999
Yeah. l do tend to date a lot,
but where does it say

368
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,840
that dating, you know, a new girl
every week is a crime?

369
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,156
No, it's not.

370
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:46,446
But it does speak to your deep-seated
psychological problems

371
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:49,201
and commitment issues.

372
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,482
Really?

373
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:56,119
So you're saying my intimacy issues
stem from my mother,

374
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:59,524
who dressed me as a sailor
until l was 1 0 years old?

375
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:00,876
Maybe.

376
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,557
Well, l guess it might explain

377
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:12,364
why you objectify women
and treat them as sexual objects.

378
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:18,085
While you're being so forthright
and insightful, Mr. DiNozzo,

379
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,281
why did you sink your teeth
into the victim's leg?

380
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:27,446
Because l'm angry
and l'm immature,

381
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,561
and l like control.

382
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,086
You have no alibi.

383
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:35,637
Alibi? How can l have an alibi

384
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:38,196
when the murder
doesn't even have a time or a date?

385
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:41,236
That's interesting.
What about means?

386
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,005
Latex glove?

387
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,125
Scalpel?

388
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:48,400
You could have gotten
these things

389
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,286
from work. No?

390
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,483
Right. Of course.

391
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:57,646
Yes, l ripped a glove at the scene.
lt seems a little sloppy

392
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,401
for a federal agent
who investigates crime scenes,

393
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,127
but, you know, those are the breaks
when you're a homicidal maniac

394
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:04,561
dumping butchered
women's remains

395
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,844
out in the woods
in the middle of the night. Right?

396
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,477
l'm not getting out of this one,
am l, boss?

397
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:29,964
Thank you, boss.

398
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,677
Mike Macaluso. Still in jail.

399
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,162
My sources say,
his family is very happy about it.

400
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,359
How is it you've been in this country a
few months, you already got sources?

401
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,483
Who says my sources
are from this country, McGee?

402
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,882
- <i>ls this Agent Timothy McGee?</i>
- Yes, hi.

403
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,799
- <i>He was killed in prison.</i>
- Killed in prison?

404
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,878
- l'm sorry for your loss.
- <i>Can we ship the body?</i>

405
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,844
No, you'll have to take that up
with lCE.

406
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,201
- Dead.
- Where are we?

407
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:07,040
Head of my suspects list
is George Stewart.

408
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,477
The forensic tech Tony
got fired from Baltimore P.D.

409
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,405
Lost everything
when Tony accused him

410
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,364
of contaminating
blood samples in '02.

411
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,087
- Define ''everything.''
- Wife, house, kids.

412
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:18,807
Fought the firing and won,
but by then, no one would hire him.

413
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,241
Disappeared two years ago.

414
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:21,601
- How did he win?
- Don't know.

415
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:24,196
<i>George Stewart vs. Baltimore P.D.</i>
was sealed.

416
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,762
- Un-disappear him.
- Right.

417
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,678
Lieutenant Pam Kim.
Surgical nurse.

418
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,281
Fully capable of slicing off
a woman's legs.

419
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,962
Met Tony on the Jeremy Davison
serial-rapist case.

420
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:38,516
- At Quantico.
- She's the one that egged Tony's car.

421
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,405
- Really?
- Where is she now?

422
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,604
Virginia. Returned two weeks ago
from a tour in lraq.

423
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,519
She's on her honeymoon
at the Greenbrier.

424
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,245
- Who'd she marry?
- Scott Sparks.

425
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,637
That's the guy that she was
engaged to when she met Tony.

426
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,638
- Get her in here.
- On it.

427
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:56,246
Boss? l was thinking,
she's on her honeymoon.

428
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,439
Yeah?

429
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,285
Ever heard of coitus interruptus,

430
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,403
- Special Agent Gibbs?
- Nope.

431
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:11,355
- Ever been on a honeymoon?
- Yep.

432
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,205
- Then you know l feel.
- You found them--?

433
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:16,359
- Flagrante delicto.
- That's--

434
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:20,042
Roman slang for what Tony calls
badda-bing badda-boom.

435
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:23,121
Being dragged into NClS
for interrogation

436
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,118
isn't exactly the best way
to start a marriage.

437
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,040
ls your husband the same guy you
dumped for Tony DiNozzo last year?

438
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:34,442
Look, l had a fling with Tony,
and l regret every last minute of it.

439
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,603
ls that why you put him
on the herpes website?

440
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,118
l got a little emotional.

441
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,319
A little emotional was egging his car.

442
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,079
Putting him
on the herpes website was--

443
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:46,238
Bitchy? l know.

444
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:52,278
What does a woman accomplish
by cracking eggs on a man's car?

445
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,997
A lot of guys really care
about their cars.

446
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,318
lt's kind of like a ''you break my heart,
l break yours'' thing.

447
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,004
ln lsrael,
we just shoot men who are untrue.

448
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:06,277
Look. Tony could have turned me in
when l was harassing him.

449
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:10,639
He didn't. lf anything, l owe him.

450
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:13,002
When were you last at Quantico?

451
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,922
l've been on tour in lraq
for the last eight months.

452
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,805
That's not my question.

453
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,519
l checked in with my command
ten days ago

454
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,121
before l took leave to get married.

455
00:27:24,887 --> 00:27:27,117
Look, if someone
brown-bagged Tony's door

456
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,039
or torched his car, it wasn't me.

457
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:30,640
Does your husband
know about Tony?

458
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,843
Of course he knows. What--

459
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:37,366
Scott's a lawyer. lf he has a problem
with someone, he sues them, not--

460
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:40,085
Tony wasn't murdered, was he?

461
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:44,522
- No.
- Then what is this about?

462
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,999
Lieutenant...

463
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:53,040
...you can return to your honeymoon,
but if l need you--

464
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:57,719
We'll be at the Greenbrier
for another week.

465
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,477
And next time,
have your agent knock.

466
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,846
Boss, do you really not know
what coitus interruptus means?

467
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,122
Better question.

468
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:16,755
Do you know what it means
if you haven't located Stewart?

469
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,400
My father used to say:

470
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:23,878
- Translate.
- A little fire burns a great deal of corn.

471
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,556
- What?
- lt never made sense to me either.

472
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:30,964
lt loses something in translation.
Director.

473
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,955
l saw Lieutenant Kim leave.
She have an alibi?

474
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:38,357
No. She framed DiNozzo
and l let her go.

475
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,001
- So George Stewart is--
- He's next on my list.

476
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,163
You know, there's no reason
to be petulant, Jethro.

477
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:44,840
The word's pissed, Jen.
You know what?

478
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:46,725
You can drop the director act.
We're alone.

479
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:49,560
- You think my job is an act?
- No, not all of it.

480
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:52,195
Ass-kissing on the Hill is a skill.

481
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:54,637
- So is castration.
- l wear a cup.

482
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:02,481
What is this?

483
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:05,207
George Stewart's alias
and work address.

484
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,564
l managed to find it
between kissing asses.

485
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,721
lt just proves
you should've stayed a field agent.

486
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:23,199
Ma'am?

487
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:26,039
Abby?

488
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:30,245
- What?
- l think l found something

489
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:32,716
- that might help out Tony.
- Why didn't you say so?

490
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:35,117
Maybe not exonerate,
but place someone else at the scene.

491
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:37,323
- What is it?
- The sticky substance on the ankle?

492
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:38,602
- Yes.
- Well,

493
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,883
l chemically
and instrumentally examined it.

494
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,800
The material's an adhesive. The kind
found in duct tape or carpet tape.

495
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,241
How does this help Tony?

496
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:48,558
l discovered an anomaly
in the adhesive material. A carpet fibre.

497
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:51,685
l used the FTlS and the mass spec
to determine its chemical composition.

498
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,525
lt's a DuPont fibre for a Mustang.

499
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:55,917
- But Tony drives--
- l know what Tony drives.

500
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:57,884
But when l tested
the stain resistance,

501
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,204
it showed the fibre had a coating
from a 2004 Mustang.

502
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,801
Tony's Mustang is a '66.

503
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,685
lt couldn't have been his car.

504
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,197
We have to get a fibre from Tony's car
before it gets towed.

505
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,875
Nice to have you back, Abby.

506
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,764
- George Stewart?
- Petrie.

507
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,039
l changed it legally.

508
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:26,357
- No sailors here.
- Any Jane Does?

509
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,206
- Always got a couple of them.
- Could we see them?

510
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:32,081
l told you, no sailors here.

511
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,885
How do you know,
if they're Jane Does?

512
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:35,958
Look, what the hell
do you two want?

513
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,560
To see your Jane Does.

514
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:38,842
Got a warrant?

515
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,802
No. Do we need one?

516
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,286
Hell, yes. Now get out.

517
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,962
Tony DiNozzo.

518
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:51,078
What did that bastard
say about me now?

519
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,845
l was exonerated.

520
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,638
How were you exonerated?

521
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:05,646
Fourth Circuit Court.

522
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,639
Wasn't me that
messed up that blood test.

523
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:12,275
- l sent it out to a lab.
- What's the name of the lab?

524
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,885
Pemberton Medical Analysis.

525
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,719
Sure we can't take
a quick look around?

526
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:21,361
Not without a warrant.
That's what happened last time.

527
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:23,916
Just a quick look around.
A few questions.

528
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:27,318
Then l'm fired and my life is trashed.
Now get out.

529
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:30,759
We'll be back.

530
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:33,358
With a warrant.

531
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:49,037
Reasonable doubt
can go a long way with a jury, Chip.

532
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:54,600
lf this is someone else's carpet fibre
that was on that duct tape--

533
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,845
Hello.

534
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,558
Frame-up.

535
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,402
The bite mark? l guess you could steal
dental records, create your own mould.

536
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,956
- Make an impression on the leg.
- Keep going. Keep going.

537
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,561
The print, anyone could've
pulled those gloves from our trash.

538
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,876
- Yes.
- Yeah.

539
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,719
But how would anyone know
which is Tony's?

540
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,206
Don't blow it, Chip.

541
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,800
You're on a roll.

542
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,846
Sorry.

543
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:23,960
- See what l mean?
- No.

544
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:27,802
The carpet fibres match.
Tony must've redone his carpeting.

545
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,800
Never have a negative thought
when you're on a roll.

546
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,044
- lt could have been worse.
- How?

547
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:37,882
The blood on the severed leg,
DNA came back with a match.

548
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,275
lt matched DiNozzo.

549
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,356
What are you doing?

550
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,961
l was trying to throw away
your Caf-Pow!

551
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,038
- Why?
- l bought you a fresh one

552
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:11,675
- while you were sleeping.
- l can't sleep. l have to save Tony.

553
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:15,123
What time is it? Six a.m.?
l lost two hours.

554
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,323
l have been running
Jane Doe's DNA everywhere.

555
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:18,920
She's not in CODlS,
the armed forces,

556
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:21,555
the fertility clinics,
rare-disease databases.

557
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,080
Abby. Abby, it's not your fault.

558
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,317
Not my fault? Someone's
using forensics to frame Tony.

559
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,876
- l'm letting them get away with it.
- You'll find something.

560
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,881
How? All the FBl left me was
a speck of blood and a carpet fibre.

561
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:34,607
l have to look at this
from a new perspective.

562
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:37,641
Your butt's getting bony.

563
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:43,446
Bony? l'll have you know that Ziva
rated it a four out of five, okay?

564
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,566
Bone marrow. There's a national
database for bone-marrow donors.

565
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,120
Why is Ziva rating your butt?

566
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:53,282
- Tony started it.
- Don't you blame Tony.

567
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:57,440
- He's almost on death row right now.
- No, no, no. Look, l--

568
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,398
Jane Doe is Carla Johnson.

569
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:05,355
You matched my DNA
with a pair of disembodied legs?

570
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:08,798
l'd fire whatever lab
you're using at NClS, Agent Gibbs.

571
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,398
l assure you,
they're real and they're mine.

572
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,925
Are you a bone-marrow donor?

573
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,442
l volunteered for bone marrow,
organs, blood.

574
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:20,086
l believe in sharing my good health.

575
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:22,636
But l draw the line at body parts,
at least until l'm dead.

576
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:26,078
We got the DNA match
from a bone-marrow database.

577
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:28,482
l haven't donated
any bone marrow yet.

578
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:32,282
l did give blood to an accident victim
a couple of weeks ago.

579
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,039
She died on the operating table.

580
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,720
Did she lose her legs?

581
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,957
No. Her chest was crushed.

582
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:39,401
Where is her body now?

583
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,479
Either at our morgue or the state's.
She was a Jane Doe.

584
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,925
l can't believe
the blood we DNA-tested

585
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:48,476
was someone else's from a
transfusion. What are the odds?

586
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:51,241
The same as this killer getting away
with framing Tony.

587
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:53,557
Well, the guy is a genius.
You gotta give him that.

588
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,962
Even genii make mistakes. l did.

589
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,519
What was your mistake?

590
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:02,123
Giving up on forensics
when l should have looked deeper.

591
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:06,360
- We already processed that fibre.
- l know that, Chaz-zoid.

592
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:09,564
But the killer picked up this fibre,
took it to work,

593
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:11,604
had it in his car,
carried it through the woods.

594
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:16,124
There has to be some sign
of that guy on this fibre.

595
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,919
Not if he wore gloves.

596
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:20,362
Maybe the gloves have
a different residue than NClS gloves.

597
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:22,518
Maybe he smokes a cigar.

598
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,359
Maybe there's cigar residue
on the fibre.

599
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:27,081
You're testing for cigar smoke?

600
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:32,844
For a second...

601
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:36,803
...l lost my faith in--

602
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:42,279
But now l know that forensics
was just testing me.

603
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:43,846
And l will rise up,

604
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:50,043
and l will find the man that did this
to Tony and l will crucify him.

605
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:58,243
ls it standard operating procedure
for nurses to give transfusions?

606
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,285
No. We were low on blood
and l'm a universal donor.

607
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,646
ldentifying a pair of legs
must be a first.

608
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:11,242
Here it is. Jane Doe was transferred
to the Virginia County Coroner's office

609
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:13,682
- eight days ago.
- Who signed for the body?

610
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,085
We have a warrant now.

611
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:19,240
For what?
l didn't do anything wrong.

612
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:21,284
No? l can think
of at least two things.

613
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:23,079
Framing an NClS agent for murder.

614
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,559
- Really, really, really pissing him off.
- Open it.

615
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,287
l strongly recommend
you do what he says.

616
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:51,884
This explains why Jane Doe's legs
were in pristine condition.

617
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,526
You think l cut off some girl's legs?

618
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,439
- Did you?
- No.

619
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,199
Why would l ever do such a thing?

620
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,119
l don't know,
but if you're gonna talk to me,

621
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:02,518
please get a breath mint first.
Please.

622
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,680
- Very funny, probie.
- Come on, Tony. lt's a gift.

623
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:21,959
From who?
The baggie bunnies or Pam Kim?

624
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:23,799
No, actually it's from Chip.

625
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,800
Great. Now l'm getting crap
from lab monkeys.

626
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,162
Not for much longer.

627
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,397
l knew boss would get me out of here.
What'd he find?

628
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,364
Hopefully the body
that goes with those legs.

629
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:36,087
- What do you mean, probie?
- Abby matched the legs you severed.

630
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:39,045
- l didn't sever any legs.
- Sorry, a slip of the tongue.

631
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,523
The legs you supposedly severed.

632
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:43,564
DNA matched
to a Carla Johnson, who--

633
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:46,161
- You are not gonna believe this.
- l will if it gets me out.

634
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,323
- She's alive.
- With no legs.

635
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,960
No, she's got legs.

636
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:56,802
- Okay, Tony.
- Prison changes a man.

637
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,281
Tony, come on, man.

638
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,760
- He's doing it to me again.
- You have the right to remain silent.

639
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,599
- DiNozzo set me up.
- Anything you say

640
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,156
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

641
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,924
l never thought l'd say this...

642
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,039
...but l am so happy to see you,
Fornell.

643
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,436
That makes one of us, DiNozzo.

644
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,838
Never even got to do my
Cool Hand Luke impersonation either.

645
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:44,761
What we got here
is a failure to communicate.

646
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:47,322
- Never saw it.
- Are you kidding me?

647
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,599
Only the greatest chain-gang movie
of all time.

648
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:06,640
They're throwing a little welcome-back
party for Agent DiNozzo upstairs.

649
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:08,206
Go, Chip. l'm not finished here.

650
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:11,006
There is no way that Stewart
pulled this off by himself.

651
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,998
- Why not?
- Because l refuse to believe

652
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,045
that some alcoholic ME's assistant
beat me at my own game.

653
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,800
Abby, don't you think
you're obsessing?

654
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:20,242
You know what l found
in the little fibres, Chippy?

655
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:23,996
Sodium, chloride, potassium,
lactate, urea.

656
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:25,799
- Sweat?
- Exactly.

657
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:28,157
Should be able to pull DNA
from that.

658
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,602
l've also put a call in
to Pemberton Medical Analysis,

659
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,997
the lab that fired Stewart.
He's probably after them too.

660
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:37,280
- What can l do to help?
- Stay out of my way.

661
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:39,881
l didn't doubt you for a second, boss.
Well, maybe one second.

662
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,402
No, don't thank me. lt was all Abby.

663
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:45,240
The poor girl hasn't slept
since this entire affair began.

664
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,281
- Where is she?
- She's probably passed on by now.

665
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:51,883
- The term is passed out.
- Whatever. The girl is tired.

666
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:55,724
l got the court records from Stewart's
case against Baltimore unsealed.

667
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,957
You're a little late, Jen.

668
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:03,039
l mean, thank you, director.

669
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,646
Better, Jethro.

670
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:07,002
All l'm saying is that
you might wanna warn the person

671
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,361
who actually made the mistake

672
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:10,279
- that got Stewart fired.
- <i>Now, that</i>--

673
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,403
Hello? Hello?

674
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:16,197
lt looks like we lost our connection,
Abby.

675
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,516
lt was you.

676
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,441
You worked
at Pemberton Medical Analysis.

677
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,483
Until l got fired.

678
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:26,723
You took this job
just to set up Tony?

679
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:29,561
Yep.

680
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:34,841
And l did a pretty good job at it,
didn't l? Didn't l?

681
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:56,605
You know,

682
00:40:57,327 --> 00:41:00,603
l thought a fair trade
would be taking down those two idiots

683
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,365
who got me fired.

684
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:07,519
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

685
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,559
Could you?

686
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:16,040
Jethro?

687
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,918
Abby.

688
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:41,957
Now can l work alone?
