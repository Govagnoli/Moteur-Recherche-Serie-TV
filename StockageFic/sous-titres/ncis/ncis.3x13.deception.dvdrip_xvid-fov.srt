1
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:08,925
- <i>NClS.</i>
- l need help.

2
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:12,204
- <i>You'll have to speak up, ma'am.</i>
- l've been abducted.

3
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,559
- <i>Are you there, ma'am?</i>
- Where is it?

4
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,045
No.

5
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,285
- <i>NClS.</i>
- My name is Wilkerson.

6
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,765
l've been abducted.

7
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,963
Please. Please, help me.

8
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,802
- <i>Ma'am.</i>
- No. Help me, please!

9
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:27,801
Hi.

10
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,917
You know what l like about coming
to work on a Sunday?

11
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:33,726
- The relaxed dress code?
- Actually, no.

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,237
lt offers us the unique chance
to get a glimpse

13
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:39,165
into the private lives
of our co-workers.

14
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:42,125
Except l have no interest
in your life.

15
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,323
Now, me, l was playing football.

16
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:49,237
lt's American football.
You, l'm guessing, yoga?

17
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,763
Why do you insist on calling it football
when you don't use your feet?

18
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,559
No. Hadn't though of that.

19
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:56,445
Well, we kick it sometimes.
Listen to this.

20
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,723
So anyway, right, it's first and goal.

21
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,280
l'm about to snap the ball,

22
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,715
and my butt starts to vibrate.

23
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,798
l've seen this on TV.
There was a guy behind you.

24
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,356
No, it wasn't the quarterback.
lt was my phone.

25
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,444
So you keep it
in your pants at all times?

26
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,242
Enough about me.

27
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,285
- Let me guess. Pilates?
- Very good, Tony.

28
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,644
l am an investigator.
lt's kind of what l do.

29
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,198
l thought you said
you were doing Pilates.

30
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:27,925
lsn't Pilates one of your martial arts?

31
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,595
No, it's kind of like
expensive stretching.

32
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,803
Well, then, l guess
l wasn't doing a Pilate.

33
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,405
Mind giving me a hand with this?

34
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,207
Yes, l do. Whose blood is that?

35
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,122
Not mine.

36
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,923
- Where's McGee?
- ln trouble.

37
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:49,443
l left messages on his home phone,
cell and BlackBerry. No answer.

38
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,516
Rule number three.

39
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,681
Never be unreachable.
When Gibbs finds out about this--

40
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,964
- Find out what, DiNozzo?
- We got a possible abduction, boss.

41
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:01,404
Call came in at 0903,
Fairfax area code.

42
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,001
Caller said her name was Wilkerson,
then the line went dead.

43
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,566
Ran a reverse look-up
on the number.

44
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,366
lt came back belonging
to a Navy lieutenant commander.

45
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:11,246
Commander Wilkerson, stationed at
Department of Navy, Washington, D.C.

46
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,079
No one answers
from her home phone or cell.

47
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:14,396
She's currently on liberty,

48
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,685
scheduled to be back at work
tomorrow morning at 07.

49
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,561
That's a nice suit.
You didn't get married again, did you?

50
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,081
lf you have more, DiNozzo,
now would be a good time.

51
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,319
Yeah.
Her cell wasn't GPS-enabled,

52
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,917
but the service provider
narrowed the call location,

53
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,964
you know, to the-- To the--

54
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,401
- Radius.
- Radius.

55
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,444
The two-and-a-half-mile radius,
yeah.

56
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,404
They said they'd contact us
if it's used again.

57
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,205
We might be able to triangulate,
get a fix.

58
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,925
- Where's McGee?
- l don't know.

59
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,647
Sunday's a spiritual day
in your country, Gibbs. Perhaps--

60
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:50,281
Did you get Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's home address?

61
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,516
l did.

62
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:52,876
Then why are you still here?

63
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,397
Are you waiting for an invitation,
Officer David?

64
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:00,320
- So you really are getting married?
- He means you're with me.

65
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,924
- Oh, l knew that.
- Tick, tock, tick, tock.

66
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,526
- Morning, men.
- Hi.

67
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,401
Reporting for duty as ordered, sir.

68
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,086
- Wrong hand, Abs.
- Sorry, sir.

69
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:20,477
Call came in from a woman
claiming she was abducted, Abby.

70
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,365
l need an acoustical analysis
of the tape.

71
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,758
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- You always speak freely, Abs.

72
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,441
l know. l just always wanted
to say that. So where's my tape?

73
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,997
- On the way to your lab.
- Then so am l.

74
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,207
lf l finish quickly, maybe l can
get back to Habitat for Humanity.

75
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,716
l'm doing a bunch of wiring
for them this weekend.

76
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,479
- We'll see, Abby.
- Thank you, sir.

77
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,558
- Don't call me ''sir.''
- Thank you, ma'am.

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,004
lt's clear she isn't home.
What's our plan?

79
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,960
We use good old-fashioned
American ingenuity.

80
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,727
Good plan,
except l'm not American, Tony.

81
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,286
Well, lucky for you, l am.

82
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,955
- We start looking for the key.
- Why would there be a key?

83
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,198
Because they always hide one.

84
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,517
lt's stupid, l know,
but it's what they do.

85
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,041
You're certain there's no alarm?

86
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,841
Positive. No sign, no alarm.
But there's always a key.

87
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,123
You may wanna write that down.

88
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,999
After you.

89
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,964
- Clear.
- Clear.

90
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,356
Very OCD.

91
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,125
- OCD?
- Anal-retentive.

92
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,482
- Are you're saying she's a neat freak?
- Yeah.

93
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,439
Nice job with the lock, by the way.

94
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:44,117
Thank you. lt was a very simple
pin-and-tumbler design.

95
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:46,926
So are handcuffs, but l bet you
couldn't get out of a pair of those.

96
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,118
Are you saying
you'd like to handcuff me, Tony?

97
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,965
lt's not really my thing, Ziva.

98
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:53,559
l see.

99
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,804
You're the one who likes
to be handcuffed, then, huh?

100
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,356
Spread out.

101
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:10,681
- What are we looking for exactly?
- Anything that's out of place.

102
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,117
You're gonna have to be
a little bit more specific.

103
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,362
We're looking for a reason

104
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,398
why someone would kidnap
our Naval officer.

105
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:21,955
Preferably before Gibbs
asks us for it.

106
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,765
<i>You're absolutely certain</i>
<i>the phone call</i>

107
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,997
<i>was from Lieutenant Commander</i>
<i>Wilkerson, Agent Gibbs?</i>

108
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:29,560
Not yet, captain.

109
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,440
l was hoping you could
help me out with that.

110
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:36,355
- <i>l need help.</i>
- <i>You'll have to speak up, ma'am.</i>

111
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,563
<i>l've been abducted.</i>

112
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>That's her. That's her voice.</i>

113
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,836
Why would someone abduct her?

114
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,515
- <i>She's a Force Protection Officer.</i>
- Protecting what?

115
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,566
<i>Right now, my worst nightmare.</i>

116
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:52,246
<i>We're now at Force Protection</i>
<i>condition delta, gentlemen.</i>

117
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:53,880
- <i>Notify the admiral.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

118
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,446
<i>l'm heading your way,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

119
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,365
<i>l need to come in</i>
<i>to brief you personally.</i>

120
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,444
That's great, captain.
You mind telling me why?

121
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:03,003
<i>Last night a shipment of nuclear</i>
<i>fuel rods left a reactor plant in Ohio.</i>

122
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,805
- Bound for?
- <i>That's classified.</i>

123
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,443
<i>Only a handful of people know</i>
<i>the exact route that train is taking.</i>

124
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,683
And Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson was one of them.

125
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,204
Houdini?

126
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,443
How are you
at picking computer locks?

127
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,644
Not very good. Why, did you find
something interesting, Tony?

128
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,357
Tony, did you find
something interesting?

129
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,845
- Tony.
- Hands over your heads.

130
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,647
Now. You too, lady.

131
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:39,677
Make any sudden moves, l shoot.

132
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,036
Do we understand each other?

133
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,244
Okay, relax, quick-draw. We're feds.

134
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,244
Yeah? What agency?

135
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:47,522
- N--
- NClS.

136
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:49,876
Never heard of it.

137
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:52,726
- Naval Criminal lnvestigative Service.
- Never heard of it.

138
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,602
You never actually get used to it.
You think you will, but you never do.

139
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,480
- Okay, l have a badge.
- Sit down.

140
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:03,636
Cuff yourself to him.

141
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,842
- l'd rather you shoot me first.
- Cuff yourself, dirtbag.

142
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:17,278
Now, you cuff yourself to the chair.

143
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,278
You're making a big mistake.

144
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,039
Yeah, like you did
setting off the alarm?

145
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:30,924
There's supposed to be a sign outside.
There's supposed to be a sign outside.

146
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,920
Kids probably stole it. Don't move!

147
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:41,640
Central, got two suspects
claiming to be feds.

148
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:48,277
No little red light on the radio
means the radio not working.

149
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,843
- Hey.
- Will you please calm down?

150
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,567
This guy is a little jumpy
and nervous, so just relax.

151
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,001
No sudden moves, all right?

152
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,117
No, no! Don't shoot!

153
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,165
- Don't shoot.
- Nobody's gonna shoot anyone.

154
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,642
- Right, Officer David?
- He called me a dirtbag.

155
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,236
- l'm sorry, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

156
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,037
- <i>My name is Wilkerson.</i>
- You hear that?

157
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,396
- Hear what?
- Gibbs,

158
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,637
l thought your hearing
was better than your eyesight.

159
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:21,956
How wrong was l?

160
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,635
Okay, l'll just back up, slow it down,

161
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:27,805
fiddle with the hertz a bit
and we will interpret this as we go.

162
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:28,996
lt'd be a good idea.

163
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,841
- Okay, just after she says her name--
- <i>Wilkerson</i>--

164
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,356
Name that tune, Gibbs.

165
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,205
- That's a tyre skid.
- Yes.

166
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,641
So the car braked.

167
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,640
- Next up, is the funk.
- <i>Abducted.</i>

168
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:44,284
Manual trunk release.
Now, the second that happens,

169
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:47,718
the ambient noise changes.
Mostly the engine sound.

170
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,282
She's in a car trunk.

171
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,523
Yes again.
Now for the big finish.

172
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:56,965
Exactly 3.4 seconds later,
the trunk is slammed shut.

173
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,160
But the engine sound stays the same
until the phone shut off.

174
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,159
They took the phone,
left her in the trunk.

175
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,396
l'm afraid so, Gibbs.

176
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,876
- How much time does she have?
- There's a lot of factors.

177
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,242
Depends on the age of the car,
how airtight's the trunk,

178
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:12,204
- how much CO2 she releases--
- Abby.

179
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,965
Twelve hours she might be safe,
then she'd slip into a coma.

180
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,237
After 1 7,
she'd definitely run out of oxygen.

181
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,124
We stopped the nuclear-supply train
in Pennsylvania, in a rural area.

182
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,086
lt's heavily armoured and defended
by FAST Company Marines.

183
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:46,039
The fuel rods are
in a containment capsule

184
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:47,845
capable of withstanding
small-arms fire.

185
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,124
However, if someone did manage
to detonate those fuel rods,

186
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,720
they would irradiate
a 1 0-mile radius.

187
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,685
How many other people
know about the train's route?

188
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,684
The personnel onboard escorting,

189
00:10:57,887 --> 00:11:00,276
two Cobras flying air escort
and my staff.

190
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,081
And Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's involvement?

191
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,438
She helped plan both the primary
and alternate routes.

192
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,797
What the hell was she doing
on liberty, captain?

193
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:11,441
She was never involved
in the operational phase.

194
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,763
And she specifically
requested today off.

195
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,441
- Why?
- l didn't ask.

196
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:19,559
Are you suggesting
that she's somehow involved in this?

197
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,439
She's one of my finest officers.

198
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:24,247
What's next on your checklist?
Do you want me to guess?

199
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,803
We head back to the processing plant
and reschedule our delivery.

200
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:29,565
Think they'll hit us
on the way back?

201
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:33,606
l think we ought to find your missing
officer before we move that train again.

202
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,399
l thought you said
she was organized.

203
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,956
Her house looked like
Martha Stewart's jail cell, only neater.

204
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,799
Her hard drive is a mess.

205
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,599
There's subfolders with subfolders,

206
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,485
thousands of files,
all password-protected.

207
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:52,115
She didn't know
the concept of ''delete.''

208
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,840
Boss, l'm sorry l'm late.

209
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,404
Look who's joined us.
The ghost of David Niven.

210
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,035
l couldn't hear my cell because
of the commotion where l was.

211
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,038
- Where was you?
- lt won't happen again.

212
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,358
- You're right, it won't. Help Abby.
- Help Abby with what?

213
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:09,326
Okay, l'll have Abby fill me in.

214
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,119
What do we know?

215
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,245
Don't even try to act all normal
dressed like this. Come on.

216
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:16,762
What is wrong
with what l'm wearing?

217
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,359
You got elbow pads. Look at this.

218
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,445
You're like, ''Mr. Peabody,
where's the Wayback Machine?''

219
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:26,480
ls there a costume party? lt's like
you're like an English professor.

220
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,558
- What are you doing?
- You finished?

221
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,365
No, l haven't even started yet,
Banacek.

222
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,478
What do you got here?

223
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh, you smoke a pipe, McGee?

224
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,762
- l do not--
- This is his writing pipe.

225
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,236
Our McGee fancies himself
a novelist.

226
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,642
- l am a novelist.
- Don't listen to him, McGee.

227
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,526
l think your attire is quite sexy.

228
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,160
Thank you, Ziva.

229
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,677
Can we continue with this or are
you guys gonna make out for a while?

230
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:56,045
- Can l?
- By all means.

231
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,715
The computer belongs
to an abducted Navy officer.

232
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:00,081
All her files are encrypted.

233
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,078
She hasn't defragged her drive
since she got it,

234
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,885
- so it'll take time--
- Found something.

235
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:05,366
- What?
- Electronic date book.

236
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:06,516
Where?

237
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,155
lt's an icon, centre of the desktop.
l use the same program.

238
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,558
Don't worry, Abby. Sometimes it's hard
to see the jungle through the ferns.

239
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,645
- Right.
- What do we have?

240
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,685
Looks like her last appointment
was today at 8:30 a.m.

241
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,957
A half an hour before she called us.

242
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,681
- lt say where?
- Braddock Mall.

243
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,838
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

244
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,237
Just out of curiosity,
who taught you to drive?

245
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,721
l did.

246
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,962
On the chance that l can
see something at warp speed,

247
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,719
what kind of car are we looking for?

248
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,277
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
drives a 2002 silver Jetta.

249
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,364
- Figures.
- What figures?

250
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,046
- Chick car.
- Meaning?

251
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,238
There are guy cars
and there are chick cars.

252
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,085
lt's a known and irrefutable fact.

253
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:57,720
Was it a government study?

254
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:01,320
lt's just a thing you know.
You don't know how, you just do.

255
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:12,961
Sebring, Liberty, Jetta and Bug,
the whole VW line, all chick.

256
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,085
Mustang, Camaro, Escalade,
PT Cruiser, all guy.

257
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:17,839
Hummer is very guy,
with adequacy issues.

258
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,396
And then there's some
that go both ways.

259
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,119
lt's an Accord, not a Jetta.

260
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:27,996
But case in point.

261
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,163
Mini Cooper and Acura
fall in the same category.

262
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,238
You've given this a lot of thought.
lt's very sad.

263
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,557
Well, then there's the Miata.
lt's a special case.

264
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,804
Leans to chick but can go guy.
Usually means he's in denial, though.

265
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:40,880
Stop!

266
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,556
Gladly, if it means l don't have to listen
to your automobile gender issues.

267
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,519
Plate matches.

268
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,357
<i>Abducted.</i>

269
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,197
The car definitely hit something
in the road.

270
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:55,522
Play it back again.

271
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,602
l mean,
can you please play it back again?

272
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:00,876
Better, Timmy.

273
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:04,202
You're mad at me.

274
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,559
l have better things to do than deal
with your pipe-smoking fetish, McGee.

275
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,998
l told you that l don't smoke it.
lt is purely an inspirational thing.

276
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,641
Whatever. lf you wanna get cancer,
it's not my concern.

277
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,041
Abby, l don't smoke.

278
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,284
The important thing here is to dissect
this tape and try to get something

279
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,443
that will help find Lieutenant
Commander Wilkerson.

280
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:22,636
Of course.

281
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,446
You're not the only one who came
to work dressed differently today.

282
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,765
l saw Tony and Ziva.

283
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,117
l was talking about me.
Here's a hint.

284
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:34,680
l'm not one of the Village People.

285
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,001
Oh, no, the Habitat for Humanity
was this weekend?

286
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,921
Abby. Abby, l'm so sorry, okay?
l'm sorry. l completely forgot.

287
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,716
You must hate me.

288
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,804
l could never hate you, McGee.

289
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,479
Don't let it happen again.

290
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:05,525
There's no commander in here.

291
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:11,042
- Need any help with that, Tony?
- No, l've got it.

292
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:14,637
lt's just been a while since
l broke into cars on a regular basis.

293
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,998
- You broke into cars?
- l was a cop in Baltimore.

294
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:21,119
You stole cars for the police?

295
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:25,286
No. You wouldn't believe how many
kids lock themselves in by accident.

296
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:28,126
Or suicides that lock themselves
in on purpose.

297
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:31,922
Drug addicts who think they're
on a trip, only the car's not moving.

298
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,519
- Old people. l love them--
- Fond memories. Can l try that now?

299
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,400
No. l almost got it.

300
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:42,964
Just gotta stick it in,
twist it around a little bit.

301
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,444
There it is.
Now l give it a nice firm yank--

302
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:54,355
Happens with the German cars
sometimes. Be right back.

303
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,245
- No one likes a show-off.
- Got something.

304
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,645
Open up.

305
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,199
Roll the tape.

306
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:20,997
- l tell you how much l like movies?
- Only several times a day.

307
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:26,043
<i>lt's Sunday the 1 4th, 0833.</i>

308
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:29,199
<i>Location, the parking garage</i>
<i>at Braddock Mall.</i>

309
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,642
<i>The agreed-upon meeting place</i>
<i>with my target.</i>

310
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,877
<i>He's promised money</i>
<i>and a place to stay</i>

311
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,800
<i>in exchange</i>
<i>for my willing cooperation.</i>

312
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,878
Why don't l think what she said
is a good thing?

313
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,038
Because you're a better agent
than you are a driver.

314
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,875
Boss, it looks like she used
an lDEA algorithm

315
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,317
to generate a short key
for some of the files.

316
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,239
Got the software working now.

317
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,321
<i>As for the rest, l am condensing</i>
<i>like extensions into their own subsets.</i>

318
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,643
- ln English, McGee.
- <i>l am working on</i>

319
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,964
opening the locked files
and establishing protocol.

320
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,239
Gibbs, what he's trying to say
is that there's a crap load of stuff.

321
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,881
<i>The sheer volume</i>
<i>of material is daunting.</i>

322
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,317
Even for a guy in a turtleneck.

323
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:12,200
- But l'm working it as fast as l can.
- <i>Work faster, McGee.</i>

324
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,676
lf she's still in the car trunk,
we have 8 hours to find her

325
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,641
- till she runs out of air.
- That's not strictly accurate, Jethro.

326
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,362
l was on the 9th with a shot at a
$1 0 Nassau when Abby called.

327
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,798
She wanted to make certain
her survival figures were accurate.

328
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,082
How far off were they, Duck?

329
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:30,757
Well, they were spot on,
but something she said bothered me.

330
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:35,081
She arrived at her figures based on
a young woman in good health.

331
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:36,845
Well, given the dire circumstances,

332
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,443
l thought it best to verify that
that was, in fact, the case.

333
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:41,960
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

334
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:46,524
was treated for acute bronchitis
by an intern at the base two days ago.

335
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:48,797
With her lungs
in that condition, well,

336
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,601
they would not be operating
as efficiently as normal.

337
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,243
- How long?
- Her survival time would be shortened

338
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,926
by several hours.

339
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,643
- You've been so helpful. l don't know--
- DiNozzo.

340
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,566
l hope that was background
on Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson.

341
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,319
l talked to everyone
in her command.

342
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,398
They think she's clean.
Not much social life.

343
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,842
Spends half her time at work,
half at home on her computer.

344
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:33,565
She's basically a McGee.

345
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:36,924
He's not responsible for the movement
of nuclear fuel rods across country.

346
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,600
And McGee didn't make
a personal video

347
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,803
about money and transport
to a safe house.

348
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,999
What's with that video? lt doesn't make
any more sense than that phone call.

349
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:49,161
They both accomplished one thing.
The train is no longer mobile.

350
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:53,365
Navy can't risk moving it until
they find out what happened to her.

351
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,323
- Navy.
- Yeah.

352
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:57,562
As in us!

353
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,523
- Boss, l think l have something here.
- Show me, McGee.

354
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,200
l'm not 1 00 percent sure
it's anything,

355
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,164
but l found something
that could possibly help.

356
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,919
- Show me.
- Wilkerson's e-mail log

357
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,806
shows that she sent 1 4 messages
from the same location last night.

358
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,559
lt wasn't her home lSP.

359
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,525
- l can't read that.
- lt's encrypted.

360
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:19,080
- Then un-crypt it.
- Abby and l are working on it.

361
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,240
Why am l sitting here
looking at you?

362
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:22,999
l thought that it might
be helpful to know

363
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,522
that Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
sent all these emails

364
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,076
from a store called PBJ.
at the Braddock Mall in Fairfax.

365
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:29,885
Wilkerson could suffocate
at any time,

366
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,515
and you couldn't tell me this
with a phone call, McGee?

367
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,917
Well, l could. l should've.

368
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,086
- Hi.
- Hello.

369
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,124
Can l help you?

370
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:47,883
NClS, l'm Agent DiNozzo,
this is Officer David.

371
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,766
- lt stands for Naval Criminal--
- lnvestigative Service.

372
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,123
We've worked with NClS before.

373
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,359
l'm Ross Logan.
l run this chapter of PBJ.

374
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:57,756
Peanut butter and jelly, yes?

375
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,118
Actually, no. lt stands
for Perverts Brought to Justice.

376
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,557
We're a non-profit
that helps law enforcement

377
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,160
track down online paedophiles.

378
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,362
That was my second guess.

379
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,756
That's Amanda Wilkerson.

380
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,116
ls she in trouble?

381
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,079
- She's been--
- Why ask if she's in trouble?

382
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,839
- l guess past experience.
- Meaning...?

383
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,567
Meaning we have a strict policy
to only monitor suspected abusers.

384
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:20,287
We never confront.
That's obviously your job.

385
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,245
l'm gonna take a wild stab and say
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

386
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,443
- didn't always follow policy.
- lnitially, no.

387
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,677
She had a few confrontations
with some of our targets.

388
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,963
One ended up suing us
for harassment.

389
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,244
- How long did she volunteer here?
- She started about two years ago.

390
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,604
Ever since her 1 4-year-old niece
was raped by an online predator.

391
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,327
- What's she done now?
- Gone missing.

392
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:41,836
Her e-mail records say
she was here last night.

393
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,804
She was. The 8-to-midnight shift.

394
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,117
Last couple weeks,
she's been working a pervert

395
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,357
with the screen name
''Fleet Captain.''

396
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,119
He thinks Amanda's 1 4.

397
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,403
But there's a transcript
of last night's conversation.

398
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:56,717
lt's very...explicit.

399
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:59,276
- More like sickening.
- They're called perverts for a reason.

400
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,802
- You got an address for this freak?
- Unfortunately, no.

401
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,004
His connections route through a dozen
different lSPs and they change nightly.

402
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:06,806
Gonna need your server
and files, then.

403
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,798
Our best hackers
haven't been able to track him.

404
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:10,923
- You haven't met our hacker.
- He's good?

405
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,680
Does a bear sit in the woods?

406
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:14,838
Are you the crackerjack team
on this job?

407
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:16,406
She's lsraeli.

408
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,603
Look, l know l got
the bear thing right.

409
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,046
What can l do to help, McGee?

410
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,596
You can stop touching things
when you're not grounded.

411
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:31,996
Right, sorry.

412
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,965
Hack away.
You won't even notice me here.

413
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:35,720
Okay, but you're standing
on my foot.

414
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:38,242
Thought it was a cable.
My apologies once again.

415
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,603
Sure there isn't something
you wanna help Abby with?

416
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,321
No. l wish to improve
my computer skills.

417
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,677
So come on, hacky-sacky.

418
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,126
Right.

419
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,442
l isolated the sound
of the commander's phone call.

420
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,439
What do you think?

421
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:06,041
The ''thunk'' sort of sounds like metal.

422
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,356
You don't think l haven't
already ''thunk'' that, Tony?

423
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,562
Why'd you ask me to listen?

424
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,678
l went to a Plastic Death concert
last night.

425
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:14,923
l couldn't even hear my alarm.
l wanna be sure.

426
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:17,157
Oh, play it again.

427
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,799
- A train track?
- Yes.

428
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,639
Railroad tracks would be
the obvious choice,

429
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,162
but there isn't a second ''thunk''
or a ''thack,''

430
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,079
not even a ''thock'' on that track.

431
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,564
Have you been reading a lot
of Dr. Seuss books?

432
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,598
You know l love me
some Theodor Geisel.

433
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,926
- <i>You'll have to speak up, ma'am.</i>
- <i>l've been abducted.</i>

434
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,645
l think l heard something
after the ''thunk,''

435
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:45,082
but the scream kind of covers it.
Can you erase that part?

436
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,761
No, but l can mess
with the frequencies.

437
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,236
The sound you heard, was it higher
or lower than her scream?

438
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,366
- Lower.
- <i>l've been abducted.</i>

439
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:58,356
lt was a railroad track.

440
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,678
Her scream was covering the ''thunk.''
l need to wear earplugs at concerts.

441
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:05,999
Okay, the commander was
at the Braddock Mall at 8:30 a.m.

442
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,284
Crossed railroad tracks
20 minutes later.

443
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:14,526
There. Those are the only railroad
tracks within 1 5 miles of the mall.

444
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,760
Ox Road. That's good work, Abby.

445
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,686
Assuming Abby is correct,

446
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,917
the vehicle harbouring
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson

447
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,918
left the mall via Ox Road.

448
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,681
The car travelled southbound,
passing three gas stations,

449
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,883
a Wal-Mart
and this Lexus dealership.

450
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,686
2.6 miles later
they passed by this bank,

451
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,520
just before crossing
the Dungy Street railroad tracks.

452
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:36,678
How many times you pass Go?

453
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,846
Collect your $200?

454
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:41,117
You know, Monopoly, the board game?
lt's American.

455
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:47,002
Ox Road eventually comes to an end
at the luxury living community

456
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:48,276
of Terra Trace Estates.

457
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,564
The Fairfax police are now focusing
their search on this central area.

458
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:55,640
They estimate between 8 to 9 hours
for a thorough search.

459
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,522
Lieutenant Commander Wilkerson
doesn't have that long.

460
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:01,446
Which is why l tracked down
the only available surveillance video

461
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,802
on or near Ox Road.

462
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,241
Hit the little right button.

463
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,322
This is the internal security camera

464
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:11,796
of a Northern Virginia
Savings and Trust ATM.

465
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:15,443
Now, it sits about 300 yards north
of the train tracks at Ox Road, right?

466
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,207
Now, we know the car passed
over the tracks at 0904.

467
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:21,001
Speed limit is 35 miles per hour.

468
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:24,842
We gotta assume our abductor didn't
wanna attract attention by speeding.

469
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:28,602
Our car should be passing
this camera around--

470
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,327
Hold on a second.
Carry the seven. Divide by six--

471
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,239
Right, here.

472
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:37,241
- l'm switching banks.
- You really think she's hot?

473
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:40,160
She's a perfect 1 0 with a great--

474
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,598
l saw that.
Why'd you give her the soft touch?

475
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,083
- Thank you, boss.
- ls that the best shot you can get?

476
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,278
There's a few frames
just after she blocks our view

477
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,563
with her incredible figure.

478
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:54,364
That's a 1 989 Mercedes
560 SEL, boss.

479
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:56,119
l can't see the plate.

480
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,040
Well, use your little clicker
and zoom in.

481
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,527
That first number's either
an eight or a six.

482
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,961
lt's an eight.

483
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:07,086
With all due respect, sir, your eyesight
isn't exactly your strong--

484
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,397
863 Romeo Charlie Tango.

485
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:13,605
Nine cars reported stolen
from Northern Virginia this morning.

486
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,445
One is a Benz 560 SEL.

487
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:19,003
- William Lafferty, Fairfax, Virginia.
- Move it.

488
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,599
How long has your car
been missing?

489
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:32,760
Well, l just reported it missing
this morning.

490
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,644
l went out to get the paper

491
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,724
- and it was gone.
- When did you last see it?

492
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:41,758
Last night around 9.

493
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,198
- l came back from renting a movie.
- What movie?

494
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:47,845
- Does it matter?
- Oh, yeah.

495
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:52,046
- The title's kind of embarrassing.
- Back of the store? Triple X?

496
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:55,324
- No.
- <i>Weekend at Bernie's Part Two.</i>

497
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:56,966
That's even worse.

498
00:26:57,127 --> 00:27:00,642
- Anyone else have keys to your car?
- No, l live alone.

499
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:02,041
Someone stole my car

500
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:05,244
- and used it in a crime, right?
- What makes you think that?

501
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,286
Three feds looking for a stolen
'89 Mercedes. l'm not an idiot.

502
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,000
- You've been home all morning?
- Yeah.

503
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,522
- What happened?
- Can anyone verify that?

504
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:18,523
l didn't have anything
to do with whatever shooting

505
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,201
- or robbery my car was in.
- Yeah, Gibbs.

506
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,920
<i>Boss, hey, l picked up a trace on...</i>

507
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,123
Lionfish, trigger and clown.
l breed them.

508
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,445
l hate clowns.

509
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:28,966
Good work, McGee.
We're on our way.

510
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:30,606
Someone's using
Wilkerson's cell phone.

511
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,280
McGee's getting a fix.

512
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,517
- What about my car?
- We'll call you.

513
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:37,560
<i>Keep going. Keep going.</i>

514
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,558
<i>Okay, it's directly north</i>
<i>of you right now.</i>

515
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:42,082
<i>You should be right by him, boss.</i>
<i>Phone's still in use.</i>

516
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,362
Yeah, l got it, McGee.

517
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,845
Signal's coming from
1 00 yards of here. lt's still active.

518
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:06,159
- Freeze! NClS!
- Don't shoot.

519
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,204
- lt's not our beer.
- <i>Hello? Danny?</i>

520
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,720
Yeah, we found it.

521
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,479
- <i>Danny?</i>
- Who's on the phone?

522
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,484
- My girlfriend?
- Hi.

523
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:15,961
Oh, my God,
don't touch me there.

524
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:19,320
He's gonna have to call you back.
Bye.

525
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:20,636
You're busted.

526
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:33,361
Definitely Lieutenant Commander
Wilkerson's cell phone, boss.

527
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,006
Five calls made in the last hour.

528
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,926
Two to an adult chat line.
Three to a teenage girl in Manassas.

529
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,237
Coordinate with the locals.
l want the park searched.

530
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:41,926
Sheriff's department is en route.

531
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,118
They say they bought their phones
from another boy.

532
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:46,204
- This boy have a name?
- l'm sure he does.

533
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,439
- They, however, claim not to know it.
- They also claim this isn't their beer.

534
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,086
You don't think l know they're lying?

535
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,162
Thank you, because l do.

536
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,881
- They're only children.
- Actually, they're teenagers.

537
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:59,123
Whatever. The little one
was about to cry.

538
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,640
You have to draw the line
somewhere.

539
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:03,640
l mean, these boys are not
potential suicide bombers.

540
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,604
And l don't interrogate children.

541
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:09,725
No, you don't, Ziva.

542
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,366
You talk to them.

543
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,365
Why would Commander Wilkerson
pretend to be a 1 4-year-old girl?

544
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,718
She was luring an online predator into
a meet at Braddock Mall this morning.

545
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:22,355
Her disappearance has nothing to do
with the fuel-rod shipment?

546
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,880
- Maybe.
- The e-mails could be

547
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,844
the way she communicates
with her cell.

548
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,077
ln a paedophilia chat room
on the lnternet?

549
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:29,481
Give me a break.

550
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,405
Your response, captain,
is the exact reason

551
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:33,802
why intelligence operatives
use such methods.

552
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:35,961
You still think there's a threat?

553
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:40,916
That train doesn't move
until we find the commander.

554
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,200
We didn't know
the phone was stolen.

555
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,597
We bought it from a guy
we know at school.

556
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:55,361
- l want the name, Beavis.
- We don't, like, ''know'' know him.

557
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,236
Yeah, meaning
we don't exactly know his name.

558
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:04,917
Well, l, like, think you're, like, totally,
like, lying, like.

559
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,561
- You wanna know why?
- Because you're old?

560
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:15,484
Funny guy. You're playing
a dangerous game, small fry.

561
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,478
Ops. Yeah, it's DiNozzo.

562
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,804
Hey, Mattie. l need to requisition
two sets of genital cuffs,

563
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:25,239
and l gotta requisition
the mark-5 Taser again.

564
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:28,678
No, you don't have to clean them.
l'll wear rubber gloves. Thanks.

565
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,078
l'm thirsty.
Can l get you something to drink?

566
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:33,956
You really should,

567
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:36,641
because interrogation
makes you a little dehydrated.

568
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,601
Okay. Oh, before l forget.

569
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:44,356
Any history of testicular cancer
or high blood pressure in the family?

570
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:48,399
Okay, you know what? You guys
think about that for a second.

571
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:49,801
l'm gonna do a little refill,

572
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,322
and we'll talk about
the boring stuff later, funny guys.

573
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,837
- Genital cuffs?
- Steve Martin, Michael Caine,

574
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,475
<i>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.</i>

575
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,598
- Great.
- Whatever. lt's working.

576
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:03,796
<i>We have to tell them.</i>

577
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:06,077
<i>He's bluffing. There's no such thing</i>
<i>as genital cuffs.</i>

578
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,926
- What if there is?
- lf Geck finds out we ratted on him?

579
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:11,681
These guys aren't even cops. They're
some secret government agency.

580
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:13,724
You see the way she was
playing with her knife?

581
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:17,004
Yeah, l know. lt was kind of hot,
like Salma Hayek in <i>Desperado.</i>

582
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,401
Never seen that.

583
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,237
All right.

584
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,915
- That's for the number.
- What number?

585
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,559
Geck's, Beavis.

586
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,398
Write. Write. Write, write, write.

587
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,878
And that is how you interrogate kids.

588
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,157
This guy's not
your average pervert, Abs.

589
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,323
He's got some serious
programming skills.

590
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,836
- Well, so do we.
- That might not be enough this time.

591
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,486
Don't say that, McGee.

592
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:50,319
Commander Wilkerson's
almost out of time.

593
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,882
Damn it. l keep losing
his connection in Madrid.

594
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,197
Okay, that's it.
You need a break.

595
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:59,717
- We don't have time for breaks, Abby.
- We don't, but you do.

596
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:02,600
How many times have l told you
he's not a toy?

597
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,519
Hi, Gibbs.
He's getting a little stressed out.

598
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,685
So am l. Tell me you two
have found ''Captain Pervert.''

599
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,559
lt's ''Fleet Captain Pervert.''

600
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,922
And we keep losing
his computer's connection in Spain.

601
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:14,083
- Un-lose it.
- lt doesn't work that way.

602
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:17,205
lt's true. The servers are down, we
can't pick up his trace without them.

603
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:19,841
Pick it up somewhere else.
Look, we already know

604
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,360
this guy is somewhere
in Virginia,

605
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:23,643
otherwise he couldn't have
shown up at Braddock Mall.

606
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:25,320
We also know
he stole a car this morning

607
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,715
from a home in Fairfax County.

608
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:29,677
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Me? What about you?

609
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,037
- Can you find him or not?
- lf he's in Fairfax--

610
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,879
Then we can match
his computer's profile

611
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:36,925
- against lSP node service in the area.
- Maybe an hour, Gibbs.

612
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,759
- Good, You have--
- Twenty minutes, l know.

613
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,997
- We know.
- l was gonna say 1 0.

614
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:54,155
Look, we need to know
where your son is, Mr. Geckler.

615
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,437
Well, where does
he usually hang out on Sundays?

616
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:59,115
- <i>Braddock Mall and in an arcade.</i>
- Okay.

617
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:00,561
Well, if he gets home,

618
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:03,844
tell him he can't leave,
and you call me. Thank you.

619
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:05,645
He appears to be a busy
young man.

620
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:07,525
He's also our only link
to the commander.

621
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:10,764
Not anymore. Give the kid's stuff
to McGee. We found the pervert.

622
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:11,956
Where?

623
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:16,285
The computer he was using traces
back to 23346 Maple Street.

624
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:19,559
- Mr. Clown-Fish?
- William Lafferty?

625
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,081
Come on, let's roll.

626
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:33,484
Just give me 1 0 seconds and l'll--

627
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,682
DiNozzo, we're in position.

628
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,318
<i>And all Ron does is spray.</i>

629
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:47,766
<i>Ron, what if this gets on some</i>
<i>area of our skin that we don't want it?</i>

630
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,963
- DiNozzo coming in.
- Clear.

631
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:53,876
Back of the house is clear, boss.
Looks like this guy left in a hurry.

632
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:57,244
- You think, DiNozzo?
- And he won't be coming back.

633
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,956
- Bleach.
- He poisoned his fish?

634
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,606
Because he couldn't take them
with him.

635
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,923
These fish
were his prized possessions.

636
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,516
lf he can't have them, no one can.

637
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,604
Fits the profile
of a malignant narcissist.

638
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,883
- Spread out.
- What are we looking for, Gibbs?

639
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:16,958
Anything that will tell us
where this freak went.

640
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,598
Jason Geckler.

641
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:31,246
My name's Special Agent McGee,
NClS.

642
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,602
Like l told your other agents,
l'm not saying anything

643
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,126
until my dad gets here.

644
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:38,082
He's on his way.
He also said that he expects you

645
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,437
- to give us your full cooperation.
- Yeah?

646
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,797
And how do l know
that you really talked to him?

647
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:46,156
He wanted me to remind you

648
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:50,479
that Winthrop Military Academy
is still accepting applications.

649
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,564
He would never send me there.

650
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:55,882
lt kind of costs money, dude.

651
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,002
Look familiar?

652
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:09,439
lt was being used
by two of your classmates,

653
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:12,918
a Timothy Griffin
and Daniel Austin.

654
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,685
They said they got it from you.

655
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:15,922
Did they, now?

656
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:19,762
Well, l'll just have to be sure to thank
them for that when l get home.

657
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,238
Look, a woman's life
is at stake here, okay?

658
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,642
l need to know
where you got the phone.

659
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:39,156
Tim and Dan, they must be
pretty scared of you, huh?

660
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,038
What makes you say that?

661
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:44,556
Come on.
They're obviously geeks.

662
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,439
We used to shove them into lockers,

663
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,922
pull their gym shorts off in class,

664
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:50,765
drop their books down the toilet.

665
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,887
lt's even better
if they start crying, right?

666
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,766
Or wet their pants.

667
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:02,805
Yeah, well, that too.

668
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:05,721
You know what the best part is?

669
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,202
When you get older, you're not
gonna remember their names,

670
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,801
but you know what? They're always
gonna remember yours.

671
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,486
That's pretty cool, huh?

672
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:16,559
You know, l really haven't thought
about it too much.

673
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,841
Well, l have.

674
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:24,440
You know why?
Because l was one of those kids.

675
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:27,957
And l've been looking forward
to this day my entire life, dirtbag.

676
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,486
But l didn't do anything.

677
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,478
l got you for aiding
and abetting a kidnapping,

678
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,957
interfering in a Federal investigation
and selling stolen property.

679
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,081
You know what that means?

680
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:40,199
That means they can try you
as an adult, Geck.

681
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,760
And when you're in prison,

682
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,242
every night when you're
crying yourself to sleep,

683
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,802
l want you to think of me, tough guy.

684
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:50,482
We're done here.

685
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,797
- See you in court.
- Wait, wait, wait.

686
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:55,202
Look, l found it, all right?

687
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:56,920
l can show you where.

688
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:03,765
BOLO's out on Lafferty, boss.

689
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,961
And his passport expired.
He can't leave the country.

690
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,162
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Boss, l just spoke with Geckler.

691
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,358
He said he found the phone
at around noon today.

692
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:16,039
- Where, McGee?
- The Braddock Mall parking garage.

693
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:17,925
Lafferty must have driven
her back there.

694
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,042
- Where we going now, boss?
- The mall.

695
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,639
And they have a problem
with my driving?

696
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,046
Drop your weapon.

697
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,201
- NClS. Get down on your knees!
- Okay, okay. All right.

698
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,517
- Put your hands on your head!
- Okay.

699
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:55,602
- You let me know if l'm hurting you.
- lt hurts. lt hurts.

700
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,882
Good.

701
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,636
Squeegee gun?

702
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:03,124
l was only trying
to teach her a lesson.

703
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:05,201
Ross Logan, boss.

704
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,403
The man who runs
Perverts Brought to Justice.

705
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:10,041
l knew she was gonna confront
Fleet Captain, so l followed her.

706
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,402
You kidnapped her and locked her
in the trunk of a car.

707
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,485
To scare her. That's all.
l came back. l was letting her out.

708
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:18,440
Look, we have rules for a reason.
Breaking them could get her killed.

709
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:21,684
She's on her way
to Bethesda in a coma, Logan.

710
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:25,600
Hey!

711
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,083
<i>Look, l never meant</i>
<i>for Amanda to get hurt.</i>

712
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:31,965
<i>l'll be sure to tell her that</i>
<i>if she lives.</i>

713
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:33,879
<i>Why do you think l parked the car</i>
<i>at the mall?</i>

714
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:36,402
- <i>l wanted someone to find her.</i>
- Where's Lafferty?

715
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,000
- Who?
- Fleet Captain.

716
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,078
- How would l know?
- You were working with him.

717
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,366
Are you insane?

718
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,400
l've dedicated my life to putting
perverts like that behind bars.

719
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:47,006
You were driving his car.

720
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:50,244
Because when l confronted him
at the garage, the guy just took off.

721
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:51,966
- Without his car?
- They're cowards.

722
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,156
<i>lt's pretty common.</i>

723
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:57,076
<i>Oh, really? ls it also common</i>
<i>to kidnap your co-worker?</i>

724
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,203
l had to make a choice.

725
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:04,881
We provide you with the transcripts
of them soliciting sex from minors.

726
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:07,641
We give you their names,
their addresses,

727
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,566
and you know what happens
most of the time? You let them walk.

728
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,756
- ls that true, McGee?
- Well, the system isn't perfect.

729
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,759
The punishment doesn't
fit the crime.

730
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,521
Personally, l prefer simpler ways
of handling things.

731
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:20,445
l don't suppose
any of those ways are legal.

732
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:22,640
<i>So you decided to frame him?</i>

733
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:24,286
Amanda spends a few hours
in a trunk,

734
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,358
Fleet Captain spends
at least 1 0 years in prison.

735
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:28,483
That sounds like a fair trade to me.

736
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,197
Look, monsters
like Lafferty destroy lives.

737
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:32,925
That guy deserves to be in prison.

738
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:36,563
Be patient. You may see him there
before you get out.

739
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,080
This is classic.

740
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:43,165
l go to jail while he's free
to find a real 1 4-year-old.

741
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,835
You think that's justice,
Agent Gibbs?

742
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:54,915
- Where's the boss-man?
- Think he went home.

743
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,355
He never leaves before l do.

744
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,956
- lt's been a long Sunday, Abby.
- Alrighty.

745
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,600
Just got off the phone
with Bethesda.

746
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,723
Commander Wilkerson
is a little dehydrated,

747
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,320
but otherwise doing just fine.

748
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,837
So you could say today
would qualify as a success.

749
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:10,356
Except we let a pervert get away.

750
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,286
Gibbs went home
with a child molester on the loose?

751
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:17,843
- There's no way.
- You're right.

752
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:19,076
Then where is he?

753
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:30,165
The paedophile's at the front of the line
putting his bag on the belt now.

754
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,716
- Get him.
- <i>Roger that, Agent Gibbs.</i>

755
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,881
- <i>Grab him.</i>
- <i>l got him.</i>

756
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,520
<i>Let go of me!</i>

757
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:42,559
- <i>Come on.</i>
-<i>Stay back.</i>

758
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,280
<i>We have everything under control.</i>

759
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:46,286
<i>All right, let's go.</i>
