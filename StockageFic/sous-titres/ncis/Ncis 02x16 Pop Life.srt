1
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,180
Baby, you're freezing.

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,617
Hey. Hey.

3
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,740
Whoa! Whoa!

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,720
I didn't think that you would notice.

5
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Oh, stealing food is
okay if nobody notices?

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
It's not stealing, it was sharing.

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
It was my lunch. I didn't want
to share my lunch with you.

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
See, you just said it was sharing.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Excuse me.

10
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Show a little respect.

11
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,280
This is a place of peace and dignity.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,840
That was before Kate got here.

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,920
We need a mediator, Ducky, or I'm going

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
to have to go to Employee Relations.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
Which would be tattling.

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,520
No, going to Employee
Relations is not tattling.

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,400
It's the adult version
of "I'm telling Mommy".

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,440
You are so juvenile.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,040
Am not.

20
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:45,520
Are so.

21
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,920
Am not.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,800
Ducky...

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,680
we need an unofficial mediator.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Did you try Gibbs?

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Yes, I see your point.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
We thought of McGee.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
But we have no respect for him.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
And then we thought of you.

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,280
I see, third on the short list.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, at least I beat out Abby.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, we just came from there.

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,480
She turned us down.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,720
Oh.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
Come on, Ducky, she's driving me crazy.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,680
Well, I am busy, but...

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
Abby needs these blood samples stat.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,880
Yes, as I say, I am
busy, but I'm flattered

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,120
that you would entrust
your relationship to me.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
It will be rather like
marriage counseling.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
Let's not use those words.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,520
Ducky, it is only a
"working relationship".

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,840
So you'll do it?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,480
Of course.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
I would relish the experience.

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, I studied psychology at
the University of Edinburgh

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,000
under Professor O'Donnell...

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
Okay, so let's start.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
I left my desk for just a
minute and when I came back,

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Tony was eating half of
my tuna fish sandwich.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Okay. See... see...

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,720
Whoo!

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm hungry we're buddies.

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
It shouldn't be a big deal.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,447
But little Miss Tighty Twisty Pants

55
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:54,640
blows everything out of proportion
and it becomes a major deal.

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
All you left me was the crust.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,920
Ah, who is right here?

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Come on, Ducky, please.

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,480
Tell him.

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,480
We need to look a little deeper.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,160
I mean, there is clearly a latent
sibling rivalry being expressed by

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,920
your adolescent and
sexually-charged bickering.

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
It all stems from a desperate
desire to please a father figure.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
And I think we all know who that is.

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
What does this have to do
with my tuna fish sandwich?

66
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,720
There's no father figure, Ducky.

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,560
Hey.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
Why don't you answer your phone?

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,680
Norfolk Homicide found a
body, a female petty officer.

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Come on. Let's go.

71
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:32,160
I'll gas the truck.

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
I got the gear.

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,200
I pre-packed the gear already.

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,640
Yes, there are clearly issues here.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,880
Yes, we need to meet
twice a week, at least.

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Petty Officer Second Class
Manda King according to her ID.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,280
26 years of age, in the navy four years.

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,280
That's as far as I
got when we called you.

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Hell, we got enough
things to do around here.

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,720
Give me a break, I'm trying to quit.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,880
This the suspect?

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,080
Willie Taylor.

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,720
Tends bar at Sugar Street.

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
We're processing him now.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,840
Okay, Ducky.

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,120
All right.

87
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Stabbed to death?

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh, I think that's a safe assumption.

89
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,720
Although, I found
something around her nares.

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,520
Show him, Jimmy.

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
Do I have nares, Jimmy?

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,280
All mammals have nares, sir.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Openings in your nose.

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,640
Give that to Abby. Have her ID it.

95
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,080
Yes, sir.

96
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,000
- I didn't mean to imply you didn't know what nares were.
- Time of death?

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Well, the windows are
open, the body is naked,

98
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,000
which would allow the
heat to dissipate faster.

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
If I were forced to proclaim a rough...

100
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm forcing.

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
0330, 0500.

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,320
We got an anonymous 911 call of a woman
screaming in this apartment at 5:30.

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,160
Or 0530.

104
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,680
McGee.

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
See if you can trace the
source of that 911 call.

106
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,320
On it.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
Her lividity has changed.

108
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
She may have been moved.

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Suspect said he flipped her.

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,560
Boss, I don't know if you want to
see this, but you probably should.

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,200
Some night.

112
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,440
Got to be three condoms in there.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,640
Bag 'em.

114
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Get 'em to Abby.

115
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,280
Spoke to Manda King's C.O.

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,200
Bag 'em, Probie.

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,640
Said she was a good sailor,
straight-laced, a real hard worker.

118
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,000
And she was being promoted
to the captain's yeoman.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,240
Personal yeoman to a navy captain
doesn't track with snorting drugs.

120
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,760
She told her shipmates she
had business in Norfolk.

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,040
Didn't say what?

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,560
No.

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,200
Your place or mine?

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Mine.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,680
Look...

126
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,200
on my mother's life, that's not the
girl that I took home last night.

127
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
You went to bed with one woman
and you woke up with another?

128
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Mm-hmm.

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,880
I hate it when that happens.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Never as pretty.

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,125
Sorry.

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,600
Oh, come on, you're not going to
tell Ducky about that, are you?

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Yes, I am, I'm keeping a journal.

134
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,000
I suppose that knife wasn't your knife?

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
No, it wasn't.

136
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
I actually carry a Swiss Army knife.

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,600
How many drinks did you have?

138
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,160
Like, two or three.

139
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,880
Your blood alcohol level
was.12 percent, Willie.

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,960
All right, look, you got me.

141
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,800
I had a few more.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
You know how it is
when you're tending bar.

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
No. Tell me.

144
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,160
You act friendly and
people buy you drinks.

145
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Which are watered down
to make more money.

146
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,920
We don't do that at
Sugar Street, all right?

147
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,160
You pick her up at the club?

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
No. No, I met her in the parking lot.

149
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
She said she lost her keys.

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
You ever see her before?

151
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
Nope.

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,960
I just thought, "Damn, you're
a lucky bastard, Willie."

153
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
You get her name, lucky bastard?

154
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Manda, I think.

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,240
Ah. Funny.

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
Dead sailor we found in
your bed was named Manda.

157
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
She's not the girl that I slept with.

158
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
What was Manda's last name?

159
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,840
She didn't say.

160
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Phone number?

161
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
I didn't get it.

162
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
It all went down kind of fast.

163
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,400
I gave her a kiss,
whoop-de-whoop,

164
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
and then it's back to my
place to make some noise.

165
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,520
Anybody see you two who
can verify your story?

166
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,640
No.

167
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,520
You and Manda get in a fight?

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,280
No.

169
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,560
Look, look, we had a good time.

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,240
Yeah.

171
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,160
I'd say you had a real good time.

172
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,800
We found traces of meth in your blood.

173
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
Did you give her meth, too?

174
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,600
No.

175
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
We didn't do any drugs together.

176
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,080
I am telling the truth.

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,440
That is not the girl that I slept with.

178
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,080
Abbs, I need the condoms tested.

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
Not the words you want to hear
first thing in the morning.

180
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,800
It's already running.

181
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,160
Not just the inside, I want to
make sure the outside DNA's tested

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,080
and matches that of
Petty Officer Manda King.

183
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,760
Suspect claims he went to bed with
one woman and woke up with another.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
That happens to girls, too.

185
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,880
Midnight, some guy seems all
dark and gnarly, then you wake up

186
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,960
and his tattoos are fake
and he works at a bank.

187
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
I used to work at a bank.

188
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,240
Your tat is real.

189
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
And you don't disappoint me.

190
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,920
Boss, the anonymous phone call came from
a pay phone outside Willie's apartment.

191
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,040
No fingerprints?

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,280
No, and that's weird.

193
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
He sleeps with her, he stabs her,
and there's no prints on the knife.

194
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,920
Blood matches the victim?

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,760
Yeah. The tox screen's still running,

196
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
but it's a safe bet that
it's methamphetamines.

197
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Powder in her nose was meth.

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,240
Yup.

199
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Why would a straight-laced
petty officer OD on meth?

200
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,760
Maybe she's not so straight-laced.

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
We all have our funky side.

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,720
Except Kate.

203
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
And you, boss. I'm sure
you have no funky side.

204
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,760
Time to find out who
the real Manda King was.

205
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,400
I never thought Manda
would go before me.

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,800
Dad's got end-stage bone cancer.

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
Did your sister know a Willie Taylor?

208
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
Not that I know.

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,560
But, then, she's been
at sea for eight months.

210
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,840
He's not a sailor.

211
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,560
Is that who stabbed my little girl?

212
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,840
He's a suspect, sir.

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,160
You burn him, won't you, Agent Gibbs?

214
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
If he did it, you have my word.

215
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,400
Mr. King, can you tell us a
bit about your daughter, sir?

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Manda was tough as nails, worked hard.

217
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Cared for me, helped me to raise her.

218
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,840
She'd do anything for you.

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,920
Did you know Manda was
promoted to captain's yeoman?

220
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Yeah, she was a fine sailor.

221
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
Which makes what I'm about
to tell you difficult to hear.

222
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,320
My daughter's dead.

223
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
What's worse than that?

224
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
We found drug residue in her nose.

225
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,640
That's a lie.

226
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,880
Manda never did drugs in her life.

227
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
Well, I'm sorry, but
that is what we found.

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
I don't believe it.

229
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,680
Won't believe it.

230
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,120
You have to come in here
and tell this to my father?

231
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Your sister was murdered.

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
We have to know who she really was.

233
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,440
She was my good girl.

234
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,920
That's who she was.

235
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Daddy's good... good girl.

236
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,520
Hey.

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
DNA test done already?

238
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,160
No.

239
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
It's running, but I got
an answer without it.

240
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,360
The fluid on the outside of
the condoms has a different

241
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
blood antigen than
Petty Officer Manda King.

242
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,520
There's no way Petty Officer
King had sex with Willie Taylor.

243
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Willie was set up.

244
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,240
The knife missed her vital organs, so
the wound in and of itself was not fatal.

245
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,880
She didn't bleed to death.

246
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,840
Exactly.

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,840
Her body contained four liters of blood,

248
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,000
so there was no exsanguination.

249
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,040
Ducky...

250
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,080
It's such a lovely word, exsanguination.

252
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,520
I can't help saying it.

253
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Moving on.

254
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,440
Since there was no
bleeding from the wound...

255
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
She was dead when she was stabbed.

256
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,760
Precisely.

257
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,520
Abby confirmed the drug
in her nose and blood

258
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,080
was a methamphetamine, an incredibly
large, lethal dose of methamphetamine.

259
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,160
Someone tried to make an accidental
overdose look like murder?

260
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,800
I wouldn't call it an
accidental overdose.

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
No, in cases like this, where
such a frighteningly high

262
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,440
amount of the drug is found,
I would say it was a suicide.

263
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,800
Boss, Willie Taylor's here.

264
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,520
You know why Norfolk
P.D. delivered you here?

265
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,800
Yeah. I'm a ping-pong ball.

266
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,720
They serve me to you and
you smack me right back.

267
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,040
No. No, you are telling the truth.

268
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,320
Petty Officer King OD'd.

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,640
After she was dead, someone stabbed her,

270
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
put her in your bed;
made it look like murder.

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
Who would do that to you?

272
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Wait a second.

273
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,520
So, you know that I'm
completely innocent?

274
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,080
Man, don't I get, like,
an apology or nothing?

275
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,880
You get to slide on
using methamphetamines.

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
I- I don't know.

277
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
That's not good enough, man.

278
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

279
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,880
Wait.

280
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,840
Damn.

281
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,600
Look, uh...

282
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
female sailors are, are like poison.

283
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,520
Anything happens to them drugs,
sex, anything, it doesn't matter

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
boom, you guys put our
club off limits, all right?

285
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,520
No sailors, you ain't
got no Sugar Street.

286
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,200
Who'd benefit from that?

287
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,880
Uh, yeah, well, Ian Hitch.

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,640
He owns Teaz, and we're
his only real competition.

289
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
If that sailor OD'd in his club, he
would need to get the stink off fast.

290
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,280
And shut Sugar Street
down in the process.

291
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Yeah, it's the kind of stunt that
limey bastard would pull, too.

292
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,840
Ian Hitch, AKA "Bulldog."

293
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,400
American mother, English father.

294
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Dual citizenship.

295
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,240
According to Scotland Yard, he
was charged with murder twice

296
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,040
in Manchester, skated both times.

297
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
I'm afraid to ask, why "Bulldog"?

298
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
I don't know.

299
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,880
Bulldog bites you in the
ass and never lets go.

300
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,520
He owns Teaz in Norfolk.

301
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,880
Yeah, well, when I was stationed
there, I-I heard about it.

302
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
Apparently, there's some
very hot dancers there.

303
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
You heard?

304
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,160
Yeah. Well, I never went there.

305
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,680
Honest.

306
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Okay.

307
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,560
Hey, it seems to me that...

308
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
Why are you looking at me like that for?

309
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,760
Oh, I'm just waiting for you to say,
"Boss, let me take the lead on this one!"

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
What I was going to say, Kate,
was that if Hitch used a girl

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,880
to seduce Willie Taylor, it
was probably one of his dancers.

312
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,280
We get Willie to identify Ms.
Go-Go and flip her to get to Hitch.

313
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
What are you doing?

314
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Oh, just chronicling this little
conversation for our next session with Ducky.

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,520
You done?

316
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,560
Almost.

317
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
"Done" or "fired" are the choices.

318
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Done.

319
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
Should we take Willie to the
club to identify the girl?

320
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,200
No. I don't want him
anywhere near Hitch.

321
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,400
Boss, I will find out who dances at
the club and pull their DMV photos.

322
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
Not going to work, McGee.

323
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,320
Girls at the club work for tips, Probie.

324
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,400
No W-2 forms.

325
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,800
And names like "Tiffany
Glitter" and "Stormy Weathers"

326
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,240
they don't appear on driver's licenses.

327
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Boss, I really think I should take...

328
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
the lead on this one.

329
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,720
All right, it's looking good.

330
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Let's see Tony.

331
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
Well, what do you know?

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
DiNozzo is finally looking where
he is supposed to be looking.

333
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,520
I heard that.

334
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,240
How's that?

335
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,920
Well, it's art, but we kind
of need a shot of her face.

336
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,360
I could make a fortune
on the Internet with this.

337
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,120
Okay, got it.

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,600
Next!

339
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,440
Right, boss.

340
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
Just being thorough.

341
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,120
That's it.

342
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm watching you, DiNozzo.

343
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,800
How's that look?

344
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,640
Uh, closer.

345
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Is this better?

346
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,040
One second.

347
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,360
Did ya get it yet?

348
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Wow, Kate, how'd you get her to do that?

349
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,480
DiNozzo, go back to the last booth.

350
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,800
Yeah, right there.

351
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,800
That Hitch?

352
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,560
That's him.

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
What's up, party people!

354
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,040
Tonight is going to be hot,
but this crowd is even hotter

355
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,840
'cause only the best get into Teaz.

356
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm DJ Night Trap, and I'm gonna

357
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,040
get off the mike right now because
I know who you came here to see...

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Jade!

359
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
That's Samantha King.

360
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:51,520
Sophisticated lady But nasty when I want to
be I see you staring from across the room.

361
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,240
And you can't keep your eyes off me...

362
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,640
Hey, Tony, stop jumping up and down.

363
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,480
We can't see.

364
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,880
Like a puppet on a string, whoo!

365
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,840
Have you in cuffs like cops and
robbers, baby 'Cause touching me's

366
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:18,200
a felony Put your hands up 'cause I'm
cold-blooded Boy, who does it belong to?

367
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Cold-blooded It ain't that complicated.

368
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,280
Thanks. That was fun.

369
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
Now get out.

370
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,200
Taking your sister's
death pretty hard, Jade.

371
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,400
What are you doing here?

372
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
The question is: What
are you doing here?

373
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,000
What are you afraid of?

374
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,480
Who are you?

375
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,800
Same as Kate.

376
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Well, not exactly.

377
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,560
Answer my question.

378
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,480
It's Saturday night.

379
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,920
I sing here, okay?

380
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
Oh, you sing the day after
your sister's murdered?

381
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,440
I gotta go.

382
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,520
Not unless we get some answers.

383
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Blue, you better get out here.

384
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
You know how we found you?

385
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,600
We were here looking for
your sister's murderer.

386
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,320
You said you had her murderer.

387
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,440
He didn't do it.

388
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,760
What's going on, Jade?

389
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,760
We're just talking.

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Well, not no more you ain't.

391
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
Yeah, I think we are.

392
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,920
My partner, Lulu, she wants to
sign Jade to a record contract.

393
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,920
Bulldog ain't gonna like that.

394
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,680
Twinkle Toes, Candy Pants,
stay behind your mommy.

395
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Where'd Bulldog get his name?

396
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,600
When he gets his teeth into a
girl's arse, he never lets go.

397
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,760
I knew it. I knew it.

398
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,960
Lulu, I was right about Bulldog.

399
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,240
You're gonna get me killed.

400
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,440
Just like your sister was?

401
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,160
Look, we think Hitch
had her killed. Why?

402
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,560
No, he wouldn't do that.

403
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,440
I mean, he knew she wanted me to leave
this life, but he wouldn't kill her.

404
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Wouldn't he?

405
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,120
Let's go, Bruce!

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,200
She's not interested!

407
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,560
No harm, no foul.

408
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,560
Guess not.

409
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,680
Gosh, those guys were big.

410
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Big, big, big, big.

411
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,400
Mm-hmm. She's cute.

412
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,640
She's hot.

413
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,400
I don't know about you, but I sleep with

414
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,440
a lot of women, so...

415
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
I wouldn't know anything
about that, Willie.

416
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,040
I'm a Mormon.

417
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh. I'm sorry.

418
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm, uh, you know, I think
it coulde this one here.

419
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,960
But I was really drunk, so...

420
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,640
Sit down.

421
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,720
You're going to have to do better.

422
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,760
Look, man, I'm doing the
best I can, all right?

423
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,680
All right. All right.

424
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Yeah, I think it's her.

425
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,040
Summer Diamond. Very hot.

426
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,360
You "think" this is her?

427
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
Look, there's always
something about every woman

428
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,960
that you remember,
something small and subtle.

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
Something you're going to
remember 20 years later:

430
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,840
A piece of jewelry, a laugh, something.

431
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,440
A smell.

432
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,200
Ugh! I feel like I died and
woke up in a Calvin Klein ad.

433
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
I thought you were a Mormon?

434
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Concentrate, Willie.

435
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,080
Ah, yeah.

436
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,600
She had a tat.

437
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,880
How could I forget?

438
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,080
What did it look like?

439
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
It was of a bulldog.

440
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
It was right there on her ass.

441
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,040
Sweet Slick Willie.

442
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,680
Look at that.

443
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
The devil is in the details.

444
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,000
I knew this girl once.

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,800
She squeaked.

446
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
She made this little squeak...

447
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
Tony, do you want to
tell Ducky that story?

448
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,880
Ducky's already heard it. We all have.

449
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
It's a good story.

450
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,080
Then you tell it to Kate while
you're bringing in Summer Diamond.

451
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,600
Don't I get to hear it?

452
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,040
You recognize this man?

453
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
Nope.

454
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,760
He works at Sugar Street.

455
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,480
Ever been there?

456
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,760
I work six nights a week at Teaz.

457
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
The last place I'm going to go
on my night off is another club.

458
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
You recognize this?

459
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,680
Agent Todd took that photo.

460
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,040
It is of your rear end.

461
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,840
You always get the best jobs.

462
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
Willie described it perfectly.

463
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
I dance practically naked.

464
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,000
Hundreds of guys have seen my ass.

465
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
So, you didn't sleep
with him two nights ago?

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,600
No.

467
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,160
Willie says he's never
been to your club.

468
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,760
You know what?

469
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,960
I believe him.

470
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,040
Every dancer in the club has that tat.

471
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,280
It means we're in Bulldog's crew.

472
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
I'd have thought he'd use a bite mark.

473
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,480
Enter.

474
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
We have a court order for
a DNA sample, Ms. Diamond.

475
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,640
Open your mouth.

476
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,540
It doesn't hurt.

477
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,540
Compare it to the DNA
found on the condoms

478
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
in Willie Taylor's apartment.

479
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
Jethro, Jethro.

480
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,900
I need you.

481
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,860
I need you, like, now.

482
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm sorry, Jethro, because
of the chemical burns

483
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,780
from the methamphetamines and
the bleeding, I-I missed this.

484
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,700
There. There, you see it?

485
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,020
Almost a perfect circle.

486
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,500
I know I said that the
cause of a massive overdose

487
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,380
was usually suicide, but
then I got to thinking.

488
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
Always a good thing.

489
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,220
I mean, that mark was
made by the end of a hard,

490
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,700
round tube, like the end of a funnel.

491
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,900
You don't commit suicide by pouring
meth through a funnel into your nose.

492
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,220
No. It was a horrible, painful death.

493
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,020
You know what'll happen if he
finds out I'm talking to you?

494
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,100
Don't you want to know how
your sister died, Samantha?

495
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,020
She was stabbed?

496
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,460
Yes, she was, but that
wasn't what killed her.

497
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,780
Your sister was restrained
and methamphetamine

498
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,700
was forced down her nose and her
throat until her heart failed.

499
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,380
Oh, God... Manda.

500
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,220
Look, Willie Taylor believes that he's

501
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,500
been framed for her murder
by your boss Ian Hitch.

502
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,940
Bulldog wouldn't, he...

503
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,500
Why not?

504
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,780
Sugar Street gets declared
off limits and Club Teaz gets

505
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,220
a huge surge of new clientele.

506
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,220
But that's isn't why it
happened, is it, Samantha?

507
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,460
Our mom died when I
was three, Agent Todd.

508
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,620
Manda practically raised me.

509
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,900
When she found out I was
working for Hitch, she lost it.

510
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
How'd you get hooked
up with a guy like that?

511
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,580
He said he had connexions with record
companies, that he'd make me a star.

512
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,980
I believed him.

513
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,340
But your sister didn't.

514
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,220
She was always the
smart one in the family.

515
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,780
Why didn't you just walk away?

516
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,820
I signed a contract with him.

517
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,900
Manda was trying to get me out of it.

518
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,700
And he had her killed.

519
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,700
Look we got to get you someplace safe...

520
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,180
You don't get it, do you?

521
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,380
Hitch owns me.

522
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
I sing when he wants,
dance when he wants.

523
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,460
I sleep with him when he wants.

524
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,140
No one walks away from him...

525
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,260
ever.

526
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,900
He murdered your sister, Samantha.

527
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,340
And you'll never prove it.

528
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,140
They never do.

529
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,060
It's him.

530
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,820
Don't answer it.

531
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,820
I have to.

532
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,980
What are you doing, love?

533
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Some shopping, baby.

534
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,460
Really?

535
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,780
It looks like you're
having a spot of tea toe.

536
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,100
If he finds out you're a cop, I am dead.

537
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,140
Lulu, I presume?

538
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,860
Didn't get my message last night?

539
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,020
Jade here already has a manager.

540
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,620
That's what I told her, Ian.

541
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
Did I ask you to speak, love?

542
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,260
So, tell me, what
label do you scout for?

543
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,980
Well, that's none of your business.

544
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,220
Ah, but it is if you're
after my property.

545
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,700
Is she available?

546
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,780
Only to me.

547
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,980
Say good-bye to Lulu, love.

548
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,940
Good-bye, Lulu.

549
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,340
You and your friend Bruce might
want to leave town tonight.

550
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,500
You should have had
backup yesterday, Kate.

551
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,060
Well, I didn't expect
Hitch to show up, Gibbs.

552
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,660
It won't happen again.

553
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,820
I know.

554
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,100
McGee, how'd he track her?

555
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,500
Well, Samantha's cell phone
number is registered to Ian Hitch.

556
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,660
So he's probably using the imbedded
GPS to keep tabs on her location.

557
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,420
Paranoid.

558
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Kind of reminds me of someone.

559
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,420
What I meant was, most managers
are afraid of losing their stars.

560
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
With a voice like that, Samantha

561
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,860
could be the next Brandy.

562
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,100
What's a Brandy?

563
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,780
She's a singer and an actress, boss.

564
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,820
She's very, very hot.

565
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,380
The point is, Hitch
isn't going to let her go.

566
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,620
He'd kill her first.

567
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,900
Yeah. Gibbs.

568
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,780
We're on our way.

569
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,620
Norfolk Homicide found
the body of a young woman.

570
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,780
She had my card in her bra.

571
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,260
We just ID'd her.

572
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,540
Keisha Scott.

573
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,660
Looks like a
hit-and-run, Gibbs.

574
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,020
Her club name's Summer Diamond.

575
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,420
She was in our
interrogation room yesterday.

576
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,340
Willie Taylor ID'd her as the girl he
had sex with, not Petty Officer King.

577
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,460
She cop to it?

578
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,420
If she did, she'd be in
NCIS custody instead of dead.

579
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,380
No chance this was an accident.

580
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,820
Nope.

581
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,100
Ian Hitch is involved.

582
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,900
Bulldog?

583
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,500
Explains a lot.

584
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,900
No witnesses, nobody in the
neighborhood heard anything last night.

585
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,620
He's got this part
of town in his pocket.

586
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,580
Yeah, how about you?

587
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,460
I'll pretend I didn't hear that, Gibbs.

588
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,980
Either way, I'm taking him down.

589
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,180
You might find who did this,
but connecting him to Bulldog?

590
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,300
Uh-uh, ain't going to happen.

591
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,220
Well, no, not if you keep
letting him skate, Mauceri.

592
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,060
Hey, I've been down
this road before, Gibbs.

593
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,980
I bring him in for questioning, his
lawyer'll have him out before lunch.

594
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,380
I got a better idea.

595
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:49,900
Yeah?

596
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,340
Yeah. You turn jurisdiction
over on this to me this time.

597
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
Well, you got it.

598
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,060
How soon can you get the
rest of your team here?

599
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,820
Oh, pretty soon.

600
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,220
No way this was
hit-and-run, boss.

601
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
She's practically naked.

602
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,740
It was 35 degrees this morning.

603
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,700
You see that, Mr. Palmer?

604
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,740
Someone was holding her arms
tightly before her death.

605
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,820
Enough to cause these bruises.

606
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,340
She was shoved in front
of a vehicle, Duck?

607
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,180
It's possible.

608
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,940
I'll know more when I get
the poor girl back home.

609
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,260
We've got some broken glass over here.

610
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,740
Looking at the thickness,
maybe a headlight.

611
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,700
Bag it.

612
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,420
McGee!

613
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,300
Yeah, boss?

614
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,580
Locals think it
was a hit-and-run.

615
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,180
What about you?

616
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,300
Me? Um...

617
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Me, uh...

618
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,340
Answer the man, Probie.

619
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,380
I don't think so.

620
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,540
Why?

621
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,220
Well, uh, there are no skid
marks before or after the body.

622
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,100
Whoever hit her didn't even slow down.

623
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,980
Kate, take DiNozzo and pick up Samantha.

624
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,380
Make sure her cell phone's off.

625
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,820
Don't tell her about Summer.

626
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,140
I want to know where this
dirt bag was the night

627
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,060
Petty Officer King was murdered.

628
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,060
And where he was last night when Summer
decided to go for a walk half naked.

629
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,460
You got it, boss.

630
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,580
It's supposed to be my day off.

631
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,420
How do you know Hitch won't find out
I'm not at the hospital with my father?

632
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,180
He won't.

633
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,740
When our computer geek's done your
phone, it'll show you were there all day.

634
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820
Probie, rig the GPS chip.

635
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,140
Location: Norfolk
Hospital, noon to 1730.

636
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,180
You can really do that?

637
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,780
Sure.

638
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,700
I've already told your people, I'm
not talking about this, Agent Gibbs.

639
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,420
So can we please make this quick?

640
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,620
You're not here to talk.

641
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,460
You're here to see.

642
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,340
What?

643
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,220
A friend.

644
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,580
Oh, God, Summer.

645
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:02,740
Summer...

646
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,300
This is not happening.

647
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,820
How did this...?

648
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,700
How do you think?

649
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,580
She has a
two-year-old.

650
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,420
Even Bulldog couldn't...

651
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,100
Bulldog's tying up his
loose ends, Samantha.

652
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,420
All you have to do is
cooperate with us and

653
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,700
we'll take him out
of your life for good.

654
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,100
I can't.

655
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,860
Don't you understand?

656
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,340
Your sister's in the freezer.

657
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,620
Maybe you'd like to say good-bye?

658
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,660
Summer talked to you!

659
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,220
That's why she's lying on that slab.

660
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,260
It's not happening to me.

661
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,340
You're right.

662
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,700
It's happening because of you.

663
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,380
Okay.

664
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,340
Either charge me with
something or I'm out of here.

665
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,620
Now.

666
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,100
You're making a big mistake, Samantha.

667
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,220
Once you walk out those
doors, we can't protect you.

668
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,220
Boss, Hitch has got a very
good alibi for last night.

669
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,900
He was in New York promoting his club.

670
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,380
The photos here are from the gossip
page of Eastsider this morning.

671
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,100
I checked with the airlines.

672
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,300
He didn't get back until 1100 today.

673
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,980
He always wins.

674
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,060
I tried to tell my sister that.

675
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,980
She didn't listen.

676
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,420
And I hope you do before
I end up dead, too.

677
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,780
Cause of death?

678
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,140
She received several fatal injuries
consistent with vehicular homicide.

679
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,140
If I had to pick one?

680
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,980
Hmm. Internal bleeding.

681
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,580
Although, her neck was
broken on impact, damaging

682
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,860
her spinal cord and carotid artery.

683
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,540
I'm afraid even if you'd survived, my
dear, you would never have danced again.

684
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,060
Drugs?

685
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,820
Well, the tox screen showed a mixture

686
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,900
of methamphetamine and
alcohol in her blood.

687
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,300
But not enough to kill
her like our petty officer.

688
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,380
What about the bruising?

689
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,860
Well, these bruises here on her arms
were made by somebody holding her tightly.

690
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,580
I wish I could tell you more.

691
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah, Duck, so do I.

692
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,100
Jethro, there is a procedure
Abby could use to lift

693
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,180
the fingerprints off these bruises.

694
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,900
Off of dead skin?

695
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,860
Yeah, only we'd need your approval.

696
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,340
Why?

697
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,300
Well, it's prohibitively
expensive and rarely works.

698
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,460
So's getting married.

699
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,740
Do it.

700
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,100
Are you done yet?

701
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,020
I'm going as fast as I can.

702
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,460
Do you mind?

703
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,020
No.

704
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,980
Now I'm done.

705
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,940
Okay, put it on the plasma, Probie.

706
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,540
Did you really make
these yourself, Kate?

707
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,020
I did.

708
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,860
'Cause they're delicious.

709
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,220
I didn't know you could cook.

710
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,100
Well, technically, it's baking, and
there's a lot about me you don't know, Tony.

711
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Hey, Kate, could I try one?

712
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,020
Of course, McGee.

713
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,100
I made enough for all...

714
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,540
Tony, there were a dozen in here.

715
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,460
They're really delicious.

716
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,020
Okay, what do you have for me?

717
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,180
A way to keep tabs on
Samantha King's location, boss.

718
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,220
I think that one was for...

719
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,700
When I...

720
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,540
when I rigged the GPS chip in her
phone, I also downloaded the code.

721
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,140
So now we can follow
her anywhere she goes.

722
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,300
She's 20 miles outside
of Norfolk on Route 64.

723
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,180
Good work, McGee.

724
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,940
That's a good job.

725
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,500
Thank you, boss, but
actually, it was Tony's idea.

726
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,300
I'm impressed, DiNozzo.

727
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Just trying to help out, boss.

728
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,340
Uh...

729
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,380
That's so not right.

730
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,820
McGee, Abby needs help.

731
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,740
Tony, Kate, you're with me.

732
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,540
Where're we going?

733
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,180
Norfolk.

734
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,500
We're going to pay Ian Hitch a visit.

735
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,180
What about blowing our
cover as talent scouts?

736
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,940
Samantha is leaving with us.

737
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
She changed her mind, boss?

738
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,060
Does not matter.

739
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,580
I'm not letting her end up
like her sister downstairs.

740
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,140
So, uh, how's this
supposed to work exactly?

741
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,140
Good question.

742
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,820
I've never actually
done it on a body before.

743
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,220
We'll figure it out together, Jimmy.

744
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,940
Oh, please, call me Jimmy.

745
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,940
I just did.

746
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,500
Oh, sorry.

747
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,180
I guess I didn't hear you.

748
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,980
So, this stuff is basically Super Glue.

749
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,820
It bonds instantly with almost anything.

750
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,740
And then when it's heated, the
vapors are attracted to proteins

751
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,140
and fats left behind
from a human fingerprint.

752
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,420
And when they dry, you can just
peel 'em off like a sticker.

753
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,340
Oh.

754
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,780
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

755
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,220
I'll get it.

756
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,860
I got it.

757
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,300
Ow!

758
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:33,189
I'm sorry, my fault, My fault.

759
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:39,460
Um, okay, you know, I think that this would
be better if I just did this by myself.

760
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,300
I was only trying to observe.

761
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,300
Okay.

762
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,060
You can let go of my arms now.

763
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,540
Right.

764
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,500
Oh, um I'm, I'm trying.

765
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,300
Well, try harder!

766
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,660
Palmer, what the hell are you doing?!

767
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,180
McGee, acetone and
Band-Aids - fast!

768
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,260
I'm tracking her GPS signal, Gibbs.

769
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,620
Samantha's back at the club.

770
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,260
DiNozzo?

771
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,220
I'll wake him up.

772
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
No, no.

773
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,060
I got a better idea.

774
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,500
Hold on.

775
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,420
Bad dream, Tony?

776
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,860
I thought I...

777
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,900
Call Abby, see if she got
any prints off the body.

778
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,220
Sure, boss.

779
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,580
You know, you didn't
have to yell at him.

780
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,380
Jimmy is terrified of you now.

781
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,340
He is?

782
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,500
Cool.

783
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,580
This is the last print.

784
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,340
It's a partial from the right bruise.

785
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,820
Any luck with the prints
from the left arm, he-man?

786
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,900
Still running them through AFIS.

787
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,500
Look, I'll apologize to him later.

788
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,660
I just...

789
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,660
Ooh, we got a match.

790
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,460
It's one of Hitch's bouncers,
Richard "Blue" McGinty.

791
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,780
All right, I got it.

792
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,340
Thanks, Abby.

793
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,180
Yeah, they got a print
off Summer's body.

794
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,140
It's the bouncer from outside
the club the other night.

795
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
Jade, Bulldog wants to see you.

796
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
You okay, sweetheart?

797
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,540
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, Blue.

798
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,820
When you're a star, this'll
all seem like a bad dream.

799
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,740
I'm having second
thoughts about the dream.

800
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,820
It's kind of late for
that, isn't it, Samantha?

801
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,740
You wanted to see me?

802
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,300
Close the door, Jade.

803
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,700
It seems that Lulu isn't
a talent scout after all.

804
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,940
She's a Navy cop.

805
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,740
I didn't know, Ian.

806
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,540
I swear.

807
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,020
What did you tell them,
that I killed your sister?

808
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,180
I didn't tell them anything!

809
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,420
Now, why don't I believe you, Jade?

810
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,820
She's inside.

811
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,100
If you shoot me, they'll
know it was you, Ian.

812
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,380
Tell me the game you're playing and
I'll try and bear that in mind then.

813
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,980
I'm not playing any games.

814
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,940
That's not what Summer said.

815
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,780
Did you know she's dead?

816
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,100
Oh... of course you do.

817
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,820
Put the weapon down.

818
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,180
He was going to kill her.

819
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,460
I didn't have a choice.

820
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,380
Drop it.

821
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,780
You have everything ready
for shipment to Norfolk?

822
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,460
Working on it.

823
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,660
There might be a problem, though, Gibbs.

824
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,380
What kind of problem?

825
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,180
I got back Summer Diamond's
DNA, and it does not match

826
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,820
the DNA we took off the condoms
at the first crime scene.

827
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,940
She didn't set Willie Taylor up.

828
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,380
Nope.

829
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,620
The weird thing is, I did get a near
match from the Armed Forces DNA Registry.

830
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,660
He was set up by a sailor?

831
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,020
I'm going to make you proud,
Daddy, just like you were of Manda.

832
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,980
Everybody's going to know my name.

833
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,780
I was always proud of you, Sammy.

834
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,980
My baby the pop star.

835
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,020
Wish I...

836
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,340
wish we could be around to see.

837
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,340
Manda always loved your
singing. We need to talk.

838
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,500
Outside.

839
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,420
He only has a few
hours left, Agent Gibbs.

840
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,260
Is this about Blue?

841
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,260
It's about you.

842
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,740
Summer Diamond didn't
set your sister up.

843
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,980
Were you going to split
the money with Blue?

844
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,540
Or record a demo with it?

845
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,180
We know, Samantha your
big sister told us.

846
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,180
Or more appropriately, her DNA.

847
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,100
There's a 70% match of the DNA found

848
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,700
on the condoms in Willie
Taylor's apartment.

849
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,260
Only a sibling could be that close.

850
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,260
We also had access to
your phone, Samantha.

851
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,900
Guess where the GPS chip puts you

852
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,460
on the nights your sister
and Summer Diamond died?

853
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Setting up Ian Hitch was a nice touch.

854
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,740
Gets you out of that crappy
record contract you signed

855
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,660
and you get all your dad's money.

856
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,460
She's dead and still
screwing with my life.

857
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,140
Go say good-bye to your father.

858
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,820
If I were you, I'd keep lying to him.

859
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,460
I always believed in you,
even when your sister didn't.

860
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:49,580
You're gonna make it,
you're gonna be famous.

861
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,140
I can feel it.

862
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,420
That's right, Daddy.

863
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,220
I'm going to be a real star.
