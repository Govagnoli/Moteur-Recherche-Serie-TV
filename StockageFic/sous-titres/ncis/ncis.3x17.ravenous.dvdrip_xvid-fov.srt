1
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:07,119
Almost there, boys.
Just five more to go.

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,278
- Minutes?
- Miles, Jerry.

3
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:13,647
Hold up. Come here. Come on.

4
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:14,956
This here's your lucky day.

5
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,718
- You know what we got here?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:23,005
- A seriously mammoth pile of--
- Bear scat. Fresh.

7
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:27,365
Any brave soul wanna investigate
this particular bear's diet?

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,085
Sure.

9
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:32,127
My old man always said
l was full of this stuff anyway.

10
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:35,444
Now, bears are omnivores.
They'll basically eat anything.

11
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:39,043
lt's not unusual
to find digested berries, deer sinew,

12
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,959
even bones
in a single scat specimen.

13
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:44,563
So, Jerry, tell us.
What's this one been eating?

14
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,796
l think maybe people.

15
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:39,318
Trust me. You gotta see this.

16
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,956
- l'd rather shower.
- Every newbie's worst nightmare.

17
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:47,399
This liver shows signs
of advanced cirrhosis.

18
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,923
lt's clearly consistent with
the jaundiced skin we noticed earlier.

19
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:53,885
Now, if you'll come closer,
you'll be able to see

20
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,959
the inflammation of the pancreas.

21
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:59,846
Oh, hello.
Scalpel, please, Mr. Palmer.

22
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:02,925
Every cadaver
has its own story to tell.

23
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,555
ln many cases,
it's just a whisper that reveals--

24
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,844
All new agents are required
to observe an autopsy.

25
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,680
You should have seen McGee.

26
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,001
Hurled.

27
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:16,566
Emptied the contents of his stomach
onto Ducky's shoes.

28
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:21,164
lt's not only visual cues we look for.
Odours can be helpful too.

29
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,079
Note the putrid smell.

30
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,238
l think he's talking about you, Tony.

31
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,560
There's no need to be shy.

32
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,957
Odours like sticks and stones--

33
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,606
We had the same test at Mossad.

34
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,644
lf you fail, they terminate you.

35
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:34,956
How do you fail an autopsy?

36
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:36,841
By doing that.

37
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,119
- What happens if you fail here?
- lt depends, Officer David.

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,965
Some of them go on
to become our director.

39
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,842
You're gonna have to reschedule
your class, Duck.

40
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,079
The rangers found a body
in Shenandoah Park.

41
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,922
Well, perhaps you'd be willing
to share the specifics with the class.

42
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,636
Yes, the three most frequent causes
of death in our national parks

43
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:59,875
are heart attacks, hiking accidents and
prolonged exposure to the elements.

44
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,607
Not this time.
A sailor was eaten...

45
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:05,356
...by a bear.

46
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,876
Yet another reason
why l never wanna go camping.

47
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,197
Actually, Tony,
bear attacks are quite rare.

48
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,198
- Really?
- Do you wanna tell this guy that?

49
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:29,803
- Not a big fan of nature, huh?
- l'm a big fan of nature

50
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,082
as long as it's on TV.

51
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:35,520
l'd say 325 pounds.

52
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,524
Maybe 6 foot, standing, Agent Gibbs.

53
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:39,638
You found the dog tags here,
Ranger Hendricks?

54
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,326
On the other side
of the clearing.

55
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,285
l followed the tracks back
and found--

56
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:46,119
Found what was left of his body.

57
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,278
Well, name matches the dog tags
recovered by the park rangers.

58
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:53,205
Petty Officer Benjamin Riley.

59
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,601
Bag it. Probie,

60
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,043
you were a Boy Scout
or whatever, right?

61
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,042
Yeah. Well, technically,
l was a Webelos, but--

62
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,198
Whatever. Use your expertise,

63
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:04,597
and go and bag and tag
that bear poo down there.

64
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:07,922
Bag the poo.

65
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,005
Here.

66
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,486
When you're done collecting scat,

67
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:15,360
- find out what happened to Ducky.
- Got it, boss.

68
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,127
This entire area was supposed
to be off-limits to campers.

69
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,039
A hunter was bear baiting
here last month.

70
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:21,362
Bear baiting?

71
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,365
Have you spent any time in the woods,
Special Agent DiNozzo?

72
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,439
Well...

73
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:29,963
As much time as l can, l'm in the
woods. l'm a big fan of Mother Nature.

74
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,563
ln the off-season, hunters set out food,
always in the same place.

75
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,565
Bears get used to being fed and come
season, all they have to do is wait.

76
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,878
That's clever. l'll have to try that
the next time l'm out.

77
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,196
lt's illegal, Tony.

78
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,756
lf l had my way,
hunting would be too.

79
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,440
Who was baiting the bear?

80
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,326
A local. Jason Edom.
We pulled his license

81
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,557
- and banned him from the park.
- For life.

82
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,958
Petty Officer Riley know
this was a potentially dangerous area?

83
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,958
We hand this out to every visitor.

84
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,395
Had a bad drought this year.

85
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:02,605
Berries the bears feed on
have been scarce.

86
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,399
A hungry bear
will eat about anything.

87
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,127
The sad fact is they're gonna
track down this bear and kill it

88
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,283
because your stupid sailor
couldn't be bothered

89
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:10,766
to read a three-page pamphlet.

90
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,518
You'll have to forgive her. She's what
we like to call opposed to hunting.

91
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,804
Yes, that's not
the only thing she's opposed to.

92
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:19,561
You said Riley checked in alone?

93
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,560
Monday afternoon.
l signed him in myself.

94
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,280
We need to organize a search.

95
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,245
l'm one step ahead of you. l've got
a team out tracking the bear now.

96
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,001
lf he's still in the area,
we'll find him.

97
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,725
l'm more concerned about the woman.

98
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:34,601
There's two sets of footprints.

99
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:39,006
One is Riley's.
The other's a ladies' size 7.

100
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,919
Are you sure about that?

101
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:42,521
Yeah.

102
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:45,804
Unless these are Navy issue.

103
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,044
Listen up.
l want four-man teams in each sector.

104
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:53,357
At least two of them
armed with rifles.

105
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,199
She's been out there
at least two nights,

106
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,404
possibly injured and most definitely
scared out of her mind.

107
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,479
All communications
will run through mountain tac one.

108
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,365
All right, let's go.

109
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,324
They worked
search and rescue in the park

110
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,715
before l got stationed here.

111
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:10,562
- They'll find her.
- Hope it's before the bear does.

112
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:15,997
l'm sorry we were so late, Jethro.

113
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,239
Mr. Palmer's navigating skills
still leave something to be desired.

114
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,245
Honestly, doctor, l thought that
moss grew on the south side of trees.

115
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,875
lt does, in Australia.

116
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,716
Petty Officer Riley's vehicle
isn't in the parking lot.

117
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:32,004
According to the red--
The local guys,

118
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,839
campers park their cars
at the general store

119
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,157
- outside the main gate.
- Park's been having problems

120
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,046
with vandalism and theft
of unattended vehicles.

121
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,124
- Find it, DiNozzo.
- On it, boss.

122
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,039
Move over, Palmer. l'm driving.

123
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,763
- Don't.
- Don't what?

124
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,042
Don't encourage them, probie.

125
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,442
- Didn't you ever see <i>Deliverance?</i>
- No.

126
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:52,997
When you do, just remember that l'm
Burt Reynolds and you're Ned Beatty.

127
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,919
lt's Riley's.

128
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,520
''Jackrabbit Slim's''?

129
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,166
Just like the diner in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.

130
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,120
You can't say ''porcupine,''

131
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,766
but you know the diner
from <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

132
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:20,839
Believe it or not, we actually have
movie theatres in my country.

133
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,963
- Locked.
- Keys are probably inside.

134
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:24,960
Afternoon.

135
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,482
Five-dollar shakes.
Girls dressed like Marilyn.

136
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,917
This might be a little slice of heaven.

137
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,039
Or not.

138
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,997
Do you feel like dancing?

139
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:44,322
They drinking cappuccinos?

140
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,876
Probably fuelling up
for the banjo-duelling contest later.

141
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,641
- What's that?
- Those are scones.

142
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,923
They're like an English coffee pastry.

143
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,363
l think, probie, that Ziva was referring
to the jar next to the scones.

144
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,201
Those are pickled pigs feet, Ziva.
l think you'd enjoy them.

145
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:04,397
l'll pass on that.
They're not exactly kosher.

146
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,561
Can l help you folks?

147
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,242
- l'll take a double shot, extra foam.
- NClS.

148
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,683
You here about
the sailor eaten by the bear?

149
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,963
Well, yeah, l guess his car
is in your parking lot.

150
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,316
Yep.

151
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,199
l figured someone
would show up for it.

152
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:23,116
l charge park visitors ten bucks a day.
l'm gonna have a hard time collecting.

153
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,395
- That's a good guess.
- Jason.

154
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,881
The key to the Cherokee.

155
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,722
Jason Edom?

156
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,725
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Jason.

157
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,525
l know you, lady?

158
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,720
Not yet.

159
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:45,117
You see anyone with PO Riley
when he dropped that off?

160
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,879
Nope. You?

161
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:48,315
Nope.

162
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,883
You're wasting your time,
sweetheart.

163
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,799
l don't date your kind.

164
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:59,076
What is your kind, Mr. Edom?
Breathing?

165
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,521
You wanna keep working here?

166
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,484
You better learn
to keep your damn mouth shut.

167
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,644
l'm sorry about that, miss.
The boy's a little on the touchy side.

168
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,604
Yeah, l'd say so.

169
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,957
Thank you for your help.

170
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,845
Ziva, come on. Let's go.

171
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:23,045
The American black bear has a narrow
muzzle and a large, hinged jaw

172
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,004
with enormous crushing power.

173
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,203
600 pounds per square inch.

174
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,326
No animal of equal size
is nearly so strong.

175
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,324
You never discovered any of that,
did you?

176
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:36,803
- How do you know that?
- When Mr. Palmer sponged him,

177
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:42,087
we didn't find any evidence of slashing
or wounds on his hand and forearm.

178
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,040
- He didn't defend himself.
- More than that, l'm afraid.

179
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,755
The bear's claws and teeth

180
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:51,522
have rounded edges
that pierce the flesh.

181
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:56,005
Yet when l examined Mr. Riley's heart,
it revealed a very different story.

182
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:01,599
Our petty officer
was killed with a flat blade.

183
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,438
Death would
have been instantaneous.

184
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,043
Yes, he was dead.

185
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,556
Before the bear started eating him.

186
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,121
According to Petty Officer Riley's C.O.,
he's been on leave the last six days.

187
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,397
Nice vacation. A little camping.

188
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,326
A knife to the heart. A little trip
inside a bear's digestive track.

189
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,404
- Yeah, l'd fire my travel agent.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:30,607 --> 00:10:32,165
You're late, Ziva David.

191
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,160
l almost forgot it was Abby's birthday.
Do you think she'll like them?

192
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,205
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

193
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,156
Thanks.

194
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,076
- Think we should have told her?
- No.

195
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:46,646
No, me neither.

196
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,917
Little square, little square,
where have you been?

197
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,476
Stuck on the behind
of Riley's missing girlfriend.

198
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:06,041
Oh, hey. l was just about
to call Tony and McGee.

199
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,839
l think they were having sex.

200
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:11,363
- Tony and McGee?
- No. Riley and the missing girl.

201
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,801
l found this in their camp trash.

202
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:15,959
One of those little sticky thingies
you use when trying to quit smoking.

203
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,637
But it had residue of medication on it.
lt was progestin and oestrogen.

204
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:20,922
Birth-control patch.

205
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,965
- Yes. ls that burrito for me?
- Nope.

206
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,518
But these are.

207
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,402
Happy birthday, Abby.

208
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:34,879
Thank you so much.
You shouldn't have.

209
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,880
You're right.
l guess l shouldn't have.

210
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,878
l mean, l could get you
something else.

211
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,275
No.

212
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,044
l love them.

213
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:47,517
Hey, is Gibbs in yet?

214
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:51,045
- l haven't seen him.
- Okay.

215
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,000
ls something wrong?

216
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,961
No. Nope. Nothing's wrong.

217
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:01,797
lt's just that every year,
Gibbs usually takes me out to dinner

218
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:04,640
the night before my birthday.
lt's like a tradition.

219
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,038
Well, he probably just forgot.

220
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:09,761
Yeah.

221
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,201
l mean because of the case.

222
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,846
- l could remind him when l--
- No.

223
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,606
Don't remind him.

224
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,918
lt's really no big deal. l mean,
l don't wanna distract him

225
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,999
and Gibbs is gonna want
a name to go with this patch,

226
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,839
and that means
that l have work to do.

227
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,838
Thank you for the flowers.

228
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,082
Nice flowers, Ducky.

229
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:41,000
l should hope so. l went
to four flower shops to find them.

230
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,364
Apparently, they're sold out
all over the city.

231
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,081
What if we're not looking
for a damsel in distress here, probie?

232
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,363
No one saw our missing Jane Doe.

233
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:59,041
Not the rangers
when Riley checked in.

234
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,118
Or the hillbillies
when he parked his car.

235
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,243
- She didn't wanna be seen.
- We could be dealing

236
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,722
- with a black widow here.
- Lions and spiders and bears.

237
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,361
Oh, my.

238
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:11,044
What, Mr. Movie doesn't know
<i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

239
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,679
l'm talking about
a predatory female here, Ziva.

240
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,519
Mates, then kills.

241
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,803
Reminds me
of my father's second wife.

242
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,477
- l don't buy your theory.
- Well, what's to buy?

243
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,241
She lured him out to the woods,
made love to him, then whacked him

244
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,045
- while he was sleeping.
- Or ran off

245
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,767
while Riley was being
stabbed to death.

246
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,639
- How about neither?
- Rough night, boss?

247
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:35,401
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.
l spent it tracking our missing woman

248
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,763
with a bunch of volunteers
in Shenandoah Park.

249
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,246
- You found her?
- No.

250
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,762
- So she's still out there?
- Park Service thinks so.

251
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,042
Here, McGee.

252
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:46,722
Take the film dooeywhacker out
of there and put it up on the plasma.

253
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,481
Well, boss, actually,
this is a digital camera.

254
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,239
They use memory cards now.

255
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:53,637
l'll put the dooeywhacker in.

256
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,920
There wasn't a sign or track

257
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,317
of a ladies' size 7 boot
ever leaving that campground.

258
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,921
- How'd she get out here, boss?
- Like this.

259
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:09,561
- So, what's this?
- Snipers call that a ghost, DiNozzo.

260
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,321
Someone who can move
through the woods almost undetected.

261
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:16,002
l followed them for 300 meters
before l lost them.

262
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,203
They only left two obvious signs.

263
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,961
The back edge
of a military boot heel,

264
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,876
and this.

265
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,840
- Jewellery?
- Get it to Abby.

266
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,326
You think someone
carried her away?

267
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:31,796
Ziva, l think she didn't just
float out of that campsite.

268
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,759
We need to find out who she is.

269
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,646
Right. l talked to the guys Riley
worked with at the Navy Yard.

270
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:40,157
Only one of them, a Seaman Brad
Phillips, knew he was going camping.

271
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:43,637
Riley mentioned taking a girl he met
weeks ago. Phillips never got a name.

272
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,526
- Pull Riley's phone records.
- Has a cell phone he doesn't use.

273
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:49,440
Went back two weeks. Made a couple
of calls to his family in New York,

274
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,996
and the rest were to local businesses
and government agencies.

275
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,721
- Check out his room.
- Went through his room.

276
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,559
Nothing unusual.
No sign of a girlfriend.

277
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,764
Rangers set up a temporary aid centre
inside Jackrabbit Slim's for volunteers.

278
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,157
l want you both there.
l had them pull the files

279
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,636
of all other deaths
that happened in that park.

280
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,277
Looks like another chance to hit
on that cute ranger, yes?

281
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,245
lt's gonna be tough but not impossible.
Misreads are part of the game.

282
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:16,162
True, except l was talking about me.

283
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,439
Maybe she drove out here
on her own.

284
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,677
That's why no one saw her
with Riley.

285
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,439
Registration could give us a name.

286
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,837
l assume Gibbs would have
checked that out last night.

287
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,486
Rule eight,
never assume anything.

288
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:36,161
To be precise,
it's ''never take anything for granted.''

289
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:40,684
To be more precise, what would
you do if l started head-slapping you?

290
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,483
l'd most likely kill you.
lt's a reflex thing.

291
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,639
Gentlemen.

292
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,198
People with guns make me nervous.

293
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,086
- l noticed.
- l was talking about you, actually.

294
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,440
Still holding any vehicles
for campers?

295
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:06,520
Your Agent Gibbs asked
the same question last night. Nope.

296
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:08,757
Looks like the search is good
for business. Yes?

297
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,195
Yeah.

298
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,240
Special Agent DiNozzo. Ziva.

299
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,598
- Find anything?
- Not yet.

300
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:24,043
We've expanded the search area
beyond the initial five-mile radius.

301
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,118
lf she was abducted,
she could be anywhere.

302
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:27,959
Park's 1 98,000 acres.

303
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,606
That's over 300 square miles.

304
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:33,282
- lt's a big area to patrol.
- Yeah, unless you like to exercise.

305
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,437
Well, as a matter of fact,
l like to walk and--

306
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,804
Our boss would like any records
you have on deaths in the park.

307
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,879
- Bobby?
- Follow me.

308
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,364
These are every death
over the last ten years.

309
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:49,603
All ruled natural or accidental.

310
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,997
Thank you. Listen, l just wanted to--

311
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,919
We may have gotten off
on the wrong foot,

312
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,966
and l just wanted to let you know
that l'm not a hunter.

313
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,363
l was trying to impress you.

314
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:03,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,078
Got anything?

316
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,363
Define ''anything.''

317
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,357
- No, thanks.
- Hair follicles?

318
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,797
- Our missing woman?
- Most likely.

319
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:21,755
- And?
- And Caucasian. Brunette.

320
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:25,317
lt's at the anagen, or growth, stage,
so l can probably get DNA off the root.

321
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,883
- What about the one on the right?
- lt's from Petty Officer Riley's car.

322
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,038
- They're from the same person.
- She drove with him.

323
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,767
- You think?
- ls something bothering you, Abby?

324
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,560
No. l did a further test on our lady's
birth-control method of choice.

325
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,365
lt's a low-level oestrogen patch.

326
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,916
Prescription dosage is based
on weight and height.

327
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,761
So odds are she's
of average to small stature.

328
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,645
ls there anything else
l can do for you?

329
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,157
Find me a name.

330
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:01,877
Now l know how Molly Ringwald felt
in <i>Sixteen Candles</i>.

331
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,165
Slam dunk.

332
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:05,601
We're going out next weekend.

333
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:13,641
That's not bad, Tony.
Landis asked me out tonight.

334
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,521
l said no.
l don't want him to think l'm sleazy.

335
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:17,961
The term is ''easy.''

336
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,277
- What's the difference?
- Mostly the makeup.

337
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,682
- What do we have?
- Over the last seven years,

338
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,326
there's been eight deaths
in the park.

339
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:27,206
Three from natural causes, a stroke
and two heart attacks.

340
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,959
- The others?
- All accidental.

341
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,687
ln 2000, a couple drowned
while canoeing.

342
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:33,439
The woman's body
was never recovered.

343
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,679
ln 2002, a couple got lost hiking.
Their remains were recovered last year.

344
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:40,806
- ln 2004, a woman named--
- Tracy Roberts' body was discovered

345
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:44,323
nine months after she went
into the park to photograph wildlife.

346
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,886
- Her remains were--
- Too ravaged

347
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,607
by animals and the elements
to determine a cause of death.

348
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,962
- l wanna see a profile on them.
- l found something.

349
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,355
- Passports. Get me--
- Boss?

350
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:54,358
- What, McGee?
- Sorry.

351
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:55,676
l found something here.

352
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,520
The three dead women,
they all fit the same description.

353
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,440
- Twenties, Caucasian--
- Brunette, petite?

354
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,321
Yeah.

355
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,443
Since we all know
how you feel about coincidences,

356
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,877
l decided
to pull their driver's license photos.

357
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,005
Wow, they look like
they could be sisters.

358
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:19,682
Something tells me their deaths
weren't exactly accidental.

359
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:25,395
We're dealing with a killer who's using
park accidents to cover up murder.

360
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,765
Three almost identical women.
All of them end up dead

361
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,758
in Shenandoah National Park.

362
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,202
And if our missing woman
fits the same profile,

363
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:42,325
we could be dealing with a serial killer.
One who uses park accidents

364
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,398
to cover up abductions and murder.

365
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
- So, what do you think?
- l'm not sure yet, McGee.

366
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,684
But l think that
this might be unforgivable.

367
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,237
Well, yeah.
Of course it's unforgivable.

368
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:55,796
- What if he had a really good reason?
- A good reason?

369
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:59,596
Yeah, like he was really stressed out
or, like, overworked.

370
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,281
- What difference does that make?
- Nobody's perfect.

371
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:06,360
- Abby, there is no excuse.
- McGee, that's so sweet.

372
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,281
You know what? lt's just a stupid
birthday. Who cares if Gibbs forgot?

373
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,719
Why, l guess that l do.

374
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,320
That's why l love you.

375
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,325
When you get all hot and bothered
like that, it really turns me on.

376
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:18,920
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

377
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:21,079
Are you two done playing grab-assy?

378
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:25,206
Or do l need to transfer McGee
to a weather station in the Antarctic?

379
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:28,279
- We were just--
- l think l found our missing girl, Gibbs.

380
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,517
And McGee
was just congratulating me.

381
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,076
The birth-control patch
that our Jane Doe was wearing

382
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,238
turned out to be a Rosetta stone.

383
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,921
lt delivers
a very specific oestrogen cocktail.

384
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:41,204
lt's usually prescribed for women
whose systems can't handle the pill.

385
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:45,076
- The pill is the most common--
- l've had a few wives, Abby.

386
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,080
And yet you know
so little about women.

387
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,077
Luckily, this patch was still
in the rollout phase,

388
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,205
so the company is required
to maintain detailed medical profiles

389
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,846
on the 3,000 women
that are using them.

390
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,164
l crossed those profiles

391
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,319
with the data l pulled off her DNA
profile, her race and her blood type.

392
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,478
l came up with 200 women, Gibbs.

393
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:07,083
- Find out which one's missing.
- l'm not done yet.

394
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:11,484
From the hair samples, we know
that the woman was brunette.

395
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:15,606
So if we subtract blond women
and those with black hair,

396
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,485
that brings us to 43.

397
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,246
Of the 43, only 1 4 live
in the Mid-Atlantic.

398
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,762
l called them all, and l got 1 3.

399
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,042
Number 1 4...

400
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:29,326
...is Jessica Fagan.
She works at HUD in D.C.

401
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,955
She didn't show up for work
on Monday. She's missing, Gibbs.

402
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:33,924
- Got a picture?
- l was waiting for the DMV

403
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:37,682
to email me one before l called you.
But fortunately, it's already here.

404
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,082
Boss, this definitely
doesn't look like a coincidence.

405
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:43,283
You think, McGee?

406
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:46,721
lt's confirmed, boss.

407
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,525
She told a co-worker
she was going camping

408
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,040
with her boyfriend in Shenandoah.

409
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,756
Duck, all three of these women's
deaths were ruled accidental.

410
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,361
Pull their autopsy records, along
with the guys who died with them.

411
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,324
To look for what, specifically?

412
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,397
- How they were murdered.
- Oh, right.

413
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,046
- Nice place you got here, Ziva.
- Thanks.

414
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:09,005
They cut our wildlife conservation
budget, and you guys have a skylight?

415
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,680
- Nice.
- l understand things

416
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:12,678
have taken a turn
for the worse, Agent Gibbs?

417
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:16,203
lf by ''worse'' you mean multiple
homicides in your park since 2000,

418
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,840
then yeah, worse.

419
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,726
- Well, there goes that theory.
- What theory?

420
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,959
l was prepared to say that
this could all be just a coincidence,

421
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:27,244
- but when you see them like that--
- lt's more than a little disturbing.

422
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,080
Yeah. What can we do to help?

423
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,643
We're looking for someone who knows
his way around your park. Like a local.

424
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:37,402
We've got a list of the usual
troublemakers, poachers and vandals.

425
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,956
But l never figured any of them
for a serial killer.

426
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,004
Most likely you wouldn't, James.

427
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,397
The successful ones
blend into their environment.

428
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,603
Yeah. l mean,
look at the BTK killer, right?

429
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:50,362
Pillar of the community, Cub Scout
leader, president of his church.

430
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,320
- You're saying it could be anyone?
- Not in this case.

431
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:55,762
We're looking for someone who
carried a woman through the woods

432
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:57,246
and hardly left a track.

433
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,205
- An experienced hunter?
- Or someone with military training.

434
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,086
l'd like to send the photo of the missing
woman to our search teams.

435
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:04,441
- DiNozzo.
- l'm on it.

436
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:06,040
Get it to Pete at Jackrabbit Slim's.

437
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:09,404
Tell him to post it on every pole,
every fence, every car near the park.

438
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,239
- Gibbs.
- <i>Got something if you're interested.</i>

439
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:14,319
Yeah, we're on our way.
Abby's got something.

440
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:16,837
Our forensic scientist.
You'll like her.

441
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,326
She's a vampire.

442
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:22,364
So would you like me
to email that or fax it?

443
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:23,915
Email is fine.

444
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:25,966
Email it is.

445
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,046
So is it just me
or is it hot in here?

446
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,480
lt's probably a little bit of both.

447
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,962
Email sent. There you go.

448
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,721
So l was thinking
about this weekend and...

449
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,876
About trying camping?

450
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:51,476
- ls something wrong?
- l'm married.

451
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,480
- Then why'd you ask for my number?
- She's dead.

452
00:23:57,247 --> 00:24:02,162
lt was a-- lt was a pottery accident.
Kiln overheated or something.

453
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:05,399
Very unexpected. Very unexpected.

454
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,878
l thought l was ready to move on.

455
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:12,084
Oh, you.

456
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:15,239
Oh, you poor, poor man.

457
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,762
l swabbed what's left
of Petty Officer Riley's clothes.

458
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,795
lt's mostly his blood and what
l now know to be bear saliva.

459
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,083
He was eaten by a bear.
Tell me something l don't know.

460
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,078
About the case
or something more personal?

461
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:36,766
Abby.

462
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,686
l also found traces
of a cornucopia of different chemicals

463
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,202
sprayed all over his clothes.
Phenylacetic crystals,

464
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,006
methyl anthranilate and acorn,
caramel and bergamot oils.

465
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,920
- A hunting lure?
- You are correct, Mr. Ranger, sir.

466
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,965
More specifically,
it was Uncle Bebo's Bear Attractant.

467
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:52,765
Somebody hosed
the officer down with it.

468
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,201
l can pull a list of every hunter

469
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,006
that applied for
a bear-hunting permit this year.

470
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,840
You don't have to. McGee just found
who sprayed him with it.

471
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:03,363
Boss, we pulled multiple prints
from the equipment at the campsite.

472
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,558
Most of them are Riley's.
A bunch, l assume, are--

473
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,080
You assume, McGee?

474
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:10,717
Well, l meant we're working on getting
Jessica Fagan's prints to clear them,

475
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,043
but we have three other matches

476
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,686
belonging to a third individual.

477
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,556
Jason Edom.

478
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,445
Looks like he was baiting
more than bears.

479
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:37,479
This man makes my skin crawl.

480
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,956
Can you interrogate him
without breaking bones?

481
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,117
Truthfully? No.

482
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:46,199
l agree. That's why l'm doing it.

483
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,119
You're gonna spend
the next few hours

484
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,517
studying everything we know
about him and the evidence.

485
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,279
And supply the answers
to you in there?

486
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,677
No. No, l've got DiNozzo
doing that.

487
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,558
You're on Edom's side.

488
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,520
- Meaning?
- Meaning,

489
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,242
you're going to defend him. l want you
to assume that he's innocent.

490
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,361
- The man's a serial-killing racist.
- He probably is.

491
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,398
- But you're still gonna do it.
- Why?

492
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:15,082
Because you can't walk in there
and interrogate him.

493
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,080
Yet.

494
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,758
You mind telling me why l'm here?

495
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,836
You like hunting.

496
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:41,475
Last time l checked,
that wasn't illegal.

497
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,957
Your hunting license was pulled.

498
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,477
You're a Marine, huh?

499
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,765
l can tell.

500
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,400
My old man was a Marine.

501
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,516
Hated his guts.

502
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,604
''Get your hands
out of your pockets, boy.

503
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,844
Shave your face, boy.
Cut your hair, boy.''

504
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:04,239
See?

505
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:05,960
A lasting impression.

506
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:08,285
Semper fi.

507
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:12,886
He teach you how to bait bears?

508
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:18,283
No, l learned that for myself.
He was just a real loser.

509
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,081
Your record includes
more than bear baiting.

510
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:23,078
l guess l'm a complicated man.

511
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,721
You did time for assault and battery.

512
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,957
lt was a bar fight.
l didn't even start it.

513
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,603
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

514
00:27:34,327 --> 00:27:36,602
That's the idiot
who got eaten by the bear.

515
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:40,277
He was murdered first
with a hunting knife.

516
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,158
You baited the area
where that occurred.

517
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:44,919
Lookie here, Mr. Marine.

518
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:47,078
l haven't been in that park
for over a month.

519
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:50,796
News flash.
l happen to be banned for life.

520
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,804
Your fingerprints
were found at the campsite.

521
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,759
Last time l checked,
that was inside the park.

522
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:56,440
No, that's a damn lie.

523
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,399
l ain't been nowhere near that area.

524
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:02,806
Know her?

525
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:04,926
Nope.

526
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:09,681
How about them?

527
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:12,202
Like l said, no.

528
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:13,886
Okay?

529
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,436
l didn't have nothing to do with this.
l wouldn't...

530
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,959
Wouldn't what?

531
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,480
Kill people.

532
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,120
l may be a lot of things,

533
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:27,678
but l'm not some psycho.

534
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,876
- Yes, l'll hold.
- You shave, right?

535
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:34,605
- What?
- Nothing.

536
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,683
So how'd the killer's prints
end up at the campsite?

537
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:40,281
Obviously when he murdered the sailor
and abducted the girl.

538
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:45,084
No, Gibbs wants you
defending him, Ziva.

539
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:48,205
McGee, what objects
were the killer--

540
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:51,165
Sorry, sorry. Edom, Edom.
--Edom's prints found on again?

541
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:54,364
Two cans of tuna,
one pack of AA batteries.

542
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,197
All items sold at Jackrabbit Slim's.

543
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:01,203
Okay, so, what if Riley
bought these items

544
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,760
and Edom placed them in a bag?

545
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,685
Yeah. That one's actually plausible.

546
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:09,244
Nice job. But it is hard to prove.

547
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,126
- l'm still here, yes.
- Okay, Edom's a hunter, right?

548
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:13,561
He's familiar with the area

549
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:16,241
- and he's done time for violent crime.
- Thank you.

550
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:18,642
And we found his prints
at the campsite, so--

551
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,923
- He didn't do it.
- Okay, you're not getting this.

552
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,681
- You can't just say he didn't do it.
- Ziva, he's right.

553
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,759
You need to back your side up
with facts and rational--

554
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,121
The night Riley was murdered,

555
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:31,000
Edom was at his daughter's
dance recital in Manassas, Virginia.

556
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,441
Multiple witnesses.

557
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,166
- Unbelievable.
- l agree.

558
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:38,045
l thought for sure this was our man.

559
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:40,357
No. l mean, this guy
actually reproduced?

560
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,677
- Gibbs, we just--
- Confirmed Edom's alibi.

561
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,917
He was in Manassas
the night of the murder.

562
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,004
- He didn't do it.
- l know.

563
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,522
- He knows.
- So, what now?

564
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,484
You're gonna go
and have a talk with him.

565
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:54,366
Why? You just agreed
he didn't kill the petty officer.

566
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,806
Because he knows who did.

567
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:20,646
lt's not poisoned.

568
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,038
Afraid of germs?

569
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,604
l didn't kill those women.

570
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,241
l know.

571
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:50,843
You were at your daughter's
dance recital.

572
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,365
You know...

573
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:03,560
...l used to spend
most of my time on stage...

574
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:08,521
...searching for my father's face
in the audience.

575
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,484
But he was never there.

576
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,276
Even when he promised he'd...

577
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:28,361
l drove all the way
to South Carolina once.

578
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:31,922
To watch your daughter dance?

579
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:33,719
What's her name?

580
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:36,286
Sarah.

581
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:44,282
That's a Hebrew name.

582
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,843
lt means ''princess.''

583
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,803
l didn't know that.

584
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:16,884
Each of them was
someone's princess, Jason.

585
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:35,526
She should have never left him.

586
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:38,126
Not like she did.

587
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,919
Left who?

588
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:51,926
Wes.

589
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,639
Boss, state troopers
just missed Wes Rowan.

590
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,241
He left Jackrabbit Slim's
with a rifle and a backpack.

591
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:01,716
- Said he was gonna help search.
- He is the search, McGee.

592
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,405
Jessica Fagan was
Wes Rowan's childhood sweetheart.

593
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,764
lt was over when she filed a restraining
order against him in 2000.

594
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:10,440
Why am l finding out
about this now?

595
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,285
She changed her name.
lt used to be Parker.

596
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,007
Most likely to make it difficult
for Rowan to locate her.

597
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,840
When he couldn't, he took his anger
out on women who resembled her.

598
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,277
Explains why she never
let anyone at Jackrabbit Slim's

599
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:23,245
- or the park see her.
- Oh, you think, DiNozzo? Gibbs.

600
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:26,685
- Abs, l have no time. Two minutes.
- <i>lt's really important.</i>

601
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:29,566
Boss, state troopers are setting up
roadblocks on all highways

602
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:32,321
- leading down from the mountains.
- He took his backpack with him.

603
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:33,840
He's not planning on coming down.

604
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,884
Grab your gear.
l'll meet you out back in five.

605
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,198
Guess what, guys?
Rowan is a hunting guide,

606
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,278
- apparently one of the best in Virginia.
- Great.

607
00:33:40,447 --> 00:33:42,244
He'll be like finding
a pin in a haystack.

608
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,482
A needle in a haystack.

609
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,717
Well, aren't pins
just as hard to find?

610
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,081
- No.
- No.

611
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,885
You've got two minutes, Abby.
Starting now.

612
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:56,515
l don't need two minutes. Just
a minute or maybe 45 seconds.

613
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:59,042
- Abby.
- l pulled skin cells off the rhinestones

614
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:01,721
that you found in the park, and the
DNA matches Fagan's hair.

615
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:05,197
- You could've told me on the phone.
- Well, l also found traces of blood.

616
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:06,926
l have a theory, Gibbs.

617
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,076
l made this in high school.

618
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,683
- Minute, 33.
- Okay. l screwed up a bunch of times.

619
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:16,601
Pulling these things off is really hard.
l cracked two nails and l cut my finger.

620
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,486
Oh, hell, she's leaving a trail.
That's great work, Abs.

621
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:21,877
Wait, l still have
a minute and change left.

622
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:26,278
l know you're really busy with the case,
and l understand.

623
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,405
- Understand what?
- That you forgot my birthday.

624
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,240
- l didn't forget.
- You didn't?

625
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,523
No. l remember how old you are too.

626
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:35,915
Oh, you can forget that.

627
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,360
Check your desk.

628
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:39,642
No.

629
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,525
l have been working in here all night.

630
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:44,281
There is no way you snuck by me.

631
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,798
This is so <i>Pulp Fiction</i>.

632
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,923
l've been searching
the building for you.

633
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:05,038
- You found me.
- She may be still alive, Jethro.

634
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:08,119
l re-checked the
Rappahannock County ME's records.

635
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,482
All three victims
had hairline fractures.

636
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:13,247
The medical examiners assumed
that these were caused by animals

637
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,967
- or falls in the woods.
- They didn't know she was murdered.

638
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,879
- That bastard beats them.
- l'm afraid so.

639
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,275
How does that make her alive?

640
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:21,876
Some of the fractures
had minute calcification.

641
00:35:22,047 --> 00:35:23,400
They'd begun to heal, Jethro.

642
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,876
- How long?
- Well, l'd say a week or 1 0 days

643
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:27,799
perhaps after he beat them.

644
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,080
He'll find you, my dear,

645
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:34,839
hopefully before it's too late.

646
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,283
There are hunting cabins along this
edge. He could have taken her to one.

647
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:40,920
- Any cabins in the park?
- Two.

648
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:44,124
Birch and Pine. Gotta reserve them a
year in advance. They're real popular.

649
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:45,879
- ls anyone there now?
- No.

650
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:47,639
We open them Memorial Day
to Labour Day.

651
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:50,156
- Where?
- Pine's here. Birch is here.

652
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,198
The other night,
l lost the trail around here.

653
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:53,726
Jessica could be in those cabins.

654
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,115
Checked them the first day.

655
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,755
What if he held her in the woods
while you searched the cabin?

656
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:58,962
Search them again.

657
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,765
Where's Ranger Landis
and his search party?

658
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,163
- Razorback Ridge.
- He's a lot closer than we are.

659
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,716
Have him search them. McGee!
DiNozzo, you're with me.

660
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:07,286
Ziva, stay
with Ranger Hendricks.

661
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:11,838
- l'd be better suited if l actually went--
- We're taking him alive. Let's roll.

662
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:15,516
l hate it when men try to protect you
because you're female.

663
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,040
He's not trying to protect me.

664
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,125
He's afraid l'll kill Rowan
before he tells us where the girl is.

665
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:31,477
For a ghost,
he's sure leaving a lot of footprints.

666
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,755
- He took a knee here.
- Maybe he heard McGee coming.

667
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,719
No.

668
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:49,559
He's tracking.

669
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:53,320
Tracking who?
He already knows where the girl is.

670
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:02,044
James? Bobby. How you doing?

671
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:05,358
<i>Almost to Pine Cabin. l've got</i>
<i>Beaufort and Max checking Birch.</i>

672
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,445
- You be careful, you hear?
- <i>Don't worry about me, Bobby. Out.</i>

673
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:11,396
- You both live here?
- Jim does.

674
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,478
l got me a log cabin
about a mile down the road.

675
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:15,326
Built in the 1 830s.

676
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:18,801
- ls that old?
- Yeah, around these parts it is.

677
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:22,881
l'm sorry, that was bitchy.
l get that way when l'm tired.

678
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,284
Yeah. Me too.

679
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:27,036
That'll be more searchers.

680
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,640
l better go brief them.

681
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:30,798
Do you mind if l grab a bat nap?

682
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,516
No. Just hang from the rafters.

683
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,485
What is it, boss?

684
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,120
The trail's too obvious.

685
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,163
Rowan doesn't know
that we're tracking him.

686
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:52,919
Or he's setting an ambush.

687
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,198
McGee, l want you 30 meters
to my right.

688
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:00,360
DiNozzo, 30 to my left.

689
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:02,686
l'll stay on this trail.

690
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:05,201
What if it is an ambush?

691
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,958
l want you guys to get him
before he gets me.

692
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,964
Go. Go. Be ghosts.

693
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,166
l got him.

694
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:39,956
- l thought it was you, boss.
- Me too.

695
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:44,767
l was trying to find Jessica.

696
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,326
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
- Let the bastard bleed to death.

697
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,958
He dies,
we may never find that girl alive.

698
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:13,726
Your station can't be far.

699
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,445
Maybe a quarter of a mile that way.

700
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,319
- You got him?
- Come on.

701
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,441
- Jim made it in. They got Rowan.
- Call 91 1 .

702
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:34,679
l just did for Rowan. They're bringing
him in wounded. How?

703
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:37,566
You tell me.
She was in your root cellar.

704
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:42,520
l thought you were leading
the search.

705
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,678
Bobby radioed
she had fresh searchers.

706
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:46,200
l was cutting back to pick them up

707
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,921
and l spotted Rowan
sneaking through the woods.

708
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,643
He wasn't sneaking,
he was tracking.

709
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,845
<i>Jim, this is Bobby.</i>
<i>Officer David found Jessica Fagan.</i>

710
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,555
<i>She was in your root cellar.</i>

711
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,082
- <i>Jim? Jim, do you read me?</i>
- Drop that shotgun.

712
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:04,240
- <i>Jim, are you there?</i>
- How many?

713
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:06,804
Twenty-seven.

714
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,605
No, 26.

715
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:10,923
Can't count Jessica.

716
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,243
l didn't finish with her.

717
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:15,001
Now, drop that shotgun!

718
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,160
- Take him.
- No. What are you doing?

719
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:20,557
- l'm gonna go help boss.
- Doesn't need you. Look at him.

720
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:44,285
- Boss didn't--?
- No. He wouldn't do a thing like that.
