1
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,957
- Never get tired of this sight.
- You and me both.

2
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:27,365
- Where's number three? McMannis.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

3
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,245
We have a loose one.

4
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,917
l can't take much more of this!

5
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,561
<i>lt's driving us crazy!</i>

6
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,158
Where's Taylor?

7
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,196
- Maybe she got lucky and escaped.
- They're coming.

8
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:57,883
Oh, my God. Tell me you did not
just wave at me, Vance.

9
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,123
You call yourself a supermodel?

10
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,363
Right now, the only thing
you are super at

11
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,603
is looking like an idiot on TV!

12
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:07,958
l count two of you.

13
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,362
Where is little princess
number three?

14
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:12,365
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:22,200
The next award to be presented is
the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal.

16
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:27,117
Would Special Agent Leroy
Jethro Gibbs please step forward.

17
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,599
- She went with the elf cut?
- lt's called the Pixie.

18
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,406
- l think she looks terrific.
- Where's Gibbs?

19
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,000
ln all the years l've known him,

20
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,919
he's never once turned up
for an award ceremony.

21
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:46,999
Even if he's the one receiving,
Ducky?

22
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,721
Especially if he's the one
receiving it.

23
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:52,642
Special Agent Gibbs?

24
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:55,884
Told you he wouldn't show. Pay up.

25
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:58,681
- Got change for a 20?
- No.

26
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:05,004
- Nice haircut.
- Where the hell is he, DiNozzo?

27
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,163
- He's working on a case.
- What case?

28
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,518
The one that's preventing him
from being here.

29
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,161
l'll take that for him, though. l...

30
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:17,997
Accepting for Special Agent Gibbs
is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

31
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,925
She's pretty.

32
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,164
l like to think that
l'm the Michael Douglas

33
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:28,124
to his Karl Malden,
on the streets of D.C.

34
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,677
Thank you, everybody.
That concludes our award ceremony.

35
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:35,243
- Thank you.
- Gibbs thanks you. Thank you.

36
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,440
ls this on? l have a speech. l didn't--

37
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,804
l wrote a whole...

38
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,879
Whole thing.

39
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,036
Gibbs.

40
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,359
Where are you?

41
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,801
l'm right behind you.

42
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,124
l really hate it when you do that.

43
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:58,246
Tony has your award.

44
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,365
He can keep it.

45
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,522
Some things never change,
do they, Jethro?

46
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,883
Depends on your definition
of change.

47
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:09,486
My definition?

48
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:12,838
l expect you to be there the next time
l'm handing you an award.

49
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,840
DiNozzo didn't tell you?
l'm working a case.

50
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,561
- Alone in my office?
- lt's high-profile, Jen.

51
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,082
l thought you'd wanna hear about it
before it hits the news.

52
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:24,120
- l'm listening.
- Well...

53
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,676
- There's a dead celebrity at Quantico.
- Who?

54
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:30,118
- Some woman named Taylor Shane.
- The supermodel?

55
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:33,399
Found her hanging from an OCS
security fence this morning.

56
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,917
- Then why aren't you there?
- l just got the call five minutes ago.

57
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,687
Oh, and the award ceremony
started 30 minutes ago.

58
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, l like to get a head start
on things. l'll keep you informed.

59
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,236
Jethro, the press is gonna be
all over this one.

60
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,126
l'd appreciate it
if you could go easy on them.

61
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,840
Telling me how
to do my job, director?

62
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,441
No, just reiterating
your previous point.

63
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,605
- Which was...?
- l know you.

64
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:02,722
Break out the gear.

65
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:05,679
<i>Boot Camp Babes</i>
is a real TV show?

66
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:09,641
Reality TV at its finest.
Three hot, rich babes

67
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,805
- learning what's truly important in life.
- Defending their country.

68
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:16,522
No, firing machine guns
while wearing bikinis.

69
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,365
Think l like your reason better, Ziva.

70
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,718
Your Marine Corps would actually
allow these models to serve?

71
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,923
Well, they're not joining for real.

72
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,721
lt's a stunt.
lt's kind of like <i>The Simple Life.</i>

73
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,395
- <i>The Simple Life?</i>
- Yeah, that show about Paris Hilton.

74
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:32,280
l've never heard of it.
But l've been there a few times.

75
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,324
l wouldn't mind spending
a night there myself.

76
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:37,280
Oh, you have no idea.
l often dream about it.

77
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,478
Really?

78
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,721
What?

79
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,282
Just trying to picture
Paris and you together.

80
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:48,116
Don't get your hopes up.
l'm not attracted to blonds.

81
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:51,316
This is bad.

82
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,597
Gibbs is gonna go
completely and utterly ape--

83
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,960
What is the official word
on Taylor Shane's cause of death?

84
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,965
- Like l said, l just got here.
- What condition was her body in?

85
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,681
- l just got here. l haven't--
- What about the other girls?

86
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,196
How are the other girls handling it?
How are they handling it?

87
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,760
- Okay, that's it. lnterview's over.
- l'm sorry. lt was an accident.

88
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,764
l don't care.

89
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,396
- Sergeant, secure the area.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

90
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,439
Wow, she really was beautiful.

91
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:47,356
She still is, Mr. Palmer.

92
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,922
She's been dead
at least five hours, Jethro.

93
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,958
l'm more interested
in how she got that way, Duck.

94
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,398
Well, her body is covered
with these lacerations.

95
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,843
None of them appear to be fatal.

96
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,639
We'll know more
when we get her back.

97
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,520
l'll just go get the gurney now.

98
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,763
- Who moved the body?
- l did, sir.

99
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:10,559
Didn't think it was right, them taking
pictures of Taylor hanging on the wire.

100
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,843
You have any crime-scene experience,
Staff Sergeant McMannis?

101
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,766
No, sir. But l do have
public-affairs experience.

102
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,959
Photos like that aren't why the Corps
agreed to support this show.

103
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,123
- You the liaison?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,562
We've been trying to contact
the producer, Thomas Crawley.

105
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,957
He doesn't know anything
about this yet.

106
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:32,395
- How'd she get up there?
- Looked like she was trying to climb.

107
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,398
But that doesn't
make any sense, sir.

108
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,882
lf she wanted off the show,
all she had to do was ask.

109
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,123
lt's not like this is a real boot camp.

110
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,477
McGee, photos. Ziva, interview
the rest of the models. DiNozzo--

111
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:46,286
Boss, l'm pretty familiar with the show.
Maybe l should interview them.

112
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,166
That would work for me.
l hate models.

113
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:51,676
That so?

114
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,119
McGee, help Ziva. lnterview them.

115
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:57,600
Any other suggestions, DiNozzo?

116
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,275
- No, l think l got it.
- Good.

117
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,121
l'm gonna need to see all the footage
that you shot on this.

118
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,842
You got it, sir. Postproduction office
is right over here.

119
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,117
Do you want me
to get their autographs, Tony?

120
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:15,838
Hey, probie. See if you can get them
to sign it to ''the Big D.''

121
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:23,562
What was she doing out there,
Hannah?

122
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,405
Probably just looking
for a bigger story line.

123
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:28,355
- What?
- Think about it, Nat. The big escape?

124
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,444
Would've made some great TV.

125
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,922
Unfortunately, it did.

126
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,397
Special Agent McGee,
Officer David, NClS.

127
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,922
We would like to ask you
a few questions.

128
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:41,676
- ln private, please.
- Okay. Let's go.

129
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:47,359
When was the last time
you saw Ms. Shane?

130
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,364
- Lights out.
- Time?

131
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:51,240
Around 1 0:30.

132
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,318
Do you really believe
she did this as a stunt?

133
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,876
l don't know. Taylor would do anything
for more camera time.

134
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,839
Hannah, she's dead, okay?
Stop being a bitch.

135
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,163
The cameras are off, Natalie.

136
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,562
You can stop pretending
you cared about her.

137
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,526
You didn't get along.

138
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:08,002
We're supermodels, honey.
We don't have to get along.

139
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,602
On the show, you three
seem like such good friends.

140
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,878
They shoot us 24 hours a day,
Agent McGee.

141
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,726
You only get to see 23 minutes of it.

142
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,998
Just about done here.
Thought l'd check on the team.

143
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:25,040
You're riding with the body. Make sure
those reporters don't follow you back.

144
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,641
- How am l supposed to--?
- lmprovise.

145
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,640
- Give me the keys. l'm driving.
- Tony.

146
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,926
Thanks, Ducky.

147
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,918
Anything else we can help you with?

148
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:44,765
Maybe some hair tips
for your girlfriend here?

149
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,966
No, l think that about covers it.

150
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:53,877
But if you can remember anything else
that might help, please give us a call.

151
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,285
lt's called a business card.

152
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,206
Maybe you can have
one of the Marines read it to you.

153
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,755
No bones broken,
no major arteries severed.

154
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,280
And take a look at the tox screen.

155
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:10,605
No, her death was not the result
of tangling with the razor wire.

156
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,002
- Phencyclidine. Angel dust.
- Yeah.

157
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:17,246
An overdose of PCP drove
that poor girl flailing into that fence.

158
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,961
She had a seizure,
fell into a coma and died.

159
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,680
- Accidental overdose, Duck?
- l doubt it.

160
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:26,363
She had enough PCP in her system
to kill a small water buffalo.

161
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,716
- Water buffalo?
- l tire of saying ''small horse.''

162
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:34,476
l'm afraid our young model
might have committed suicide.

163
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:37,963
- We don't investigate suicides, Duck.
- No.

164
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,800
- We don't investigate suicides?
- Technically, no.

165
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,956
But even the most obvious suicide
is investigated by NClS as a murder.

166
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,402
On a Marine base
surrounded by cameras?

167
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,722
Yes.

168
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:53,960
The stuff good mysteries
are made of, Mr. Palmer.

169
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,481
<i>The incident shocked the</i>
<i>entertainment industry and the nation.</i>

170
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,046
<i>The sudden and gruesome death</i>

171
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:11,722
<i>of supermodel and recent reality star</i>
<i>Taylor Shane.</i>

172
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:15,846
<i>The 25-year-old was found at</i>
<i>approximately 6: 1 0 yesterday morning</i>

173
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,680
<i>hanging atop a barrier fence</i>
<i>at the Quantico Marine Base.</i>

174
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,165
<i>Shane was at Quantico participating</i>
<i>in hit reality show</i> Boot Camp Babes.

175
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,124
l'll just fast-forward to the good part.

176
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:30,486
<i>Special Agent Gibbs, is the</i>
<i>Marine Corps attempting to cover up</i>

177
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,366
- <i>how Taylor Shane died?</i>
- <i>lnterview's over.</i>

178
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,918
- <i>But people have a right to know.</i>
- <i>l don't care.</i>

179
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,635
What were you thinking?

180
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,997
Give me a break, Jen.
l wasn't even asked that question.

181
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,759
You're saying
they did a hatchet job on you?

182
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,043
Yeah. Are you saying
you don't believe me?

183
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:51,719
You were wrong the other day.
Some things do change.

184
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:56,318
Part of our job is to make sure that
they don't creatively edit our interviews.

185
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:59,997
No, that's maybe your job, director.
My job is to catch dirtbags.

186
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,563
The Marine Corps does not need
any more bad publicity at this moment.

187
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,361
Supporting something
called <i>Boot Camp Babes?</i>

188
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,040
What did they think
was gonna happen?

189
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,357
The intention of the show
was to represent

190
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,757
that the Marines
could be a life-changing experience.

191
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,521
Maybe in season two.
Are we done here yet?

192
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:18,560
l have a dead girl downstairs
and an investigation to run.

193
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:23,158
l've got an entire agency to run,
and sound bites like these do not help

194
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,319
when the budget's under review, or
maybe you'd like to go back to the days

195
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,802
when we had to buy our own ammo
to train on the range?

196
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,720
You want me to help fix this?
Then get me that reporter's number.

197
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,041
You're going to apologise?

198
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:37,279
No. Ask her to dinner.

199
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:44,326
There's Ducky. Ducky looks good.
There's the autopsy gremlin.

200
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,922
There it is. Right there.
That's my jacket.

201
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:51,042
Oh, that's McGee's jacket.

202
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,758
l didn't make a single broadcast.

203
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,320
l wish l could say the same.

204
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,757
The camera must've added
about ten pounds to me.

205
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,117
Actually, that was your refrigerator,
probie.

206
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,044
You think Gibbs watched
the news last night?

207
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,475
l know the director did.

208
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:08,326
He's been up in her office
for the past half an hour.

209
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:13,242
Anyone else think they were more
than just partners back in the day?

210
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,397
Hi, boss. We're just talking
about <i>Cagney & Lacey.</i>

211
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,636
lt's a real good show.

212
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,845
- What do we got?
- Taylor Shane

213
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:27,124
checked into the Los Angeles
Better Health Center

214
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,966
in August of '02
and then again in May of '03.

215
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,759
Publicist said
it was an eating disorder.

216
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,122
But the truth is it was heroin,
cocaine and--

217
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:35,561
- PCP.
- Bingo, boss.

218
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,877
Friends have given several interviews
over the years.

219
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,523
They blame her drug problem mostly
on the boyfriend, Noah Keller,

220
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,844
- son of Marshall Keller.
- That guy owns half of Manhattan.

221
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,116
His kids are loaded too.

222
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,922
Well, this kid was arrested
for possession of illegal narcotics

223
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:53,244
three times in the last five years.
Twice for cocaine, once for PCP.

224
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:54,766
- Find him.
- Already on it.

225
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,720
That executive show guy, Crawley,
he got back last night?

226
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,118
- The term is executive producer.
- Whatever. lnterview him.

227
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,397
l wanna know how this girl
did a fistful of PCP

228
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,125
in the middle of his reality show.

229
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:08,801
That guy dates supermodels?

230
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,918
They're shallow, he's wealthy.
lt's a perfect match.

231
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,595
lsn't your family wealthy?

232
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,920
That's different.

233
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,880
- Why?
- My dad cut me off when l was 1 2.

234
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,799
l had to earn all my dates
the old-fashioned way.

235
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,400
Begging?

236
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,837
Abs, got some good news for you.
l talked to the director.

237
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,201
Your new assistant starts Monday.

238
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:44,115
No, Gibbs. No.
l can't go through that again, that--

239
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,524
- That is so not funny.
- No?

240
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:50,195
- No.
- lt was to me, kind of.

241
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,164
Here you go. Where are we?

242
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,358
Well, l know why no one heard
Taylor screaming

243
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,757
when she was in the wire
the other night.

244
00:14:56,967 --> 00:15:00,482
Two 300-car trains passed
by OCS the same time she died.

245
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,200
l doubt anyone
could've heard anything.

246
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,558
- You on a new diet, Abs?
- No. According to Ducky,

247
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,679
there were no signs
of intravenous drug use on the body,

248
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,321
- and no traces of PCP in the lungs.
- She took it orally.

249
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:13,200
But there were also no traces
of the binders and chemicals

250
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,722
you would find
when something's taken by pill.

251
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,447
- l guess that's what all this is about.
- You'd be guessing right.

252
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,524
There were traces of PCP
in her stomach.

253
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,723
There was also dextrose,
ferrous sulfate, riboflavin

254
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,879
and other chemicals consistent
with these delectable pastries.

255
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:27,759
- Which one?
- l've been trying to find out.

256
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,037
lt's kind of fun.
lt reminds me of Bill Nye.

257
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,640
- Who?
- Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

258
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,959
- Wacky scientist with a kid's show?
- Oh, it's like Mr. Wizard.

259
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:37,726
Who?

260
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,677
- Never mind.
- So anyways, Bill Nye did an episode

261
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:43,156
where he broke down the molecular
structure of junk food.

262
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,439
Same thing l did today,
only Bill Nye was trying to get kids

263
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,962
to eat healthier, and his pastries
weren't laced with PCP.

264
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,083
- Although Bill Nye once--
- Abby, the case?

265
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:54,165
Two things l know.
One, l like cream filling.

266
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,837
And two, her last meal was this.

267
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,561
l think we're looking at
death by Klowny Kake.

268
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,165
That's good work, Abs.

269
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,041
Taylor got along with everyone,
Hannah.

270
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,441
Everyone but you.

271
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,399
Your point is, staff sergeant?

272
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,519
She committed suicide for a reason.
l wanna know why.

273
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:17,962
How the hell would l know?

274
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,924
You've been abusing her on and off
camera for the past two months.

275
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,402
Oh, so it's my fault
she decided to off herself?

276
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,518
l wanna know what happened
in this room last night.

277
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,759
Well, let's see.

278
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,121
l went to bed.

279
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,598
Natalie probably snuck off two or three
times to the bathroom to throw up.

280
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,401
And Taylor, well,

281
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,804
she apparently decided to hang herself
from a barbed-wire fence.

282
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,881
Anything else l can help you with,
staff sergeant?

283
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,804
You're a real piece of work,
Bressling.

284
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,244
Get out of my sight.
l'll see you at the pull-up bars.

285
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:58,596
With pleasure.

286
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,484
ls this a bad time, staff sergeant?

287
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:07,602
No, ma'am. l'm just counting the days
till this reality show is off of my base.

288
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,240
We need to speak
with Thomas Crawley.

289
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:10,601
So do l, sir.

290
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,206
He's asked not to be disturbed.

291
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,126
A girl died from a drug overdose
while taping the show.

292
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,124
Disturbing him
is not our primary concern.

293
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,681
Taylor overdosed?

294
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,725
- On what?
- PCP. A lot of it.

295
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,396
That's why she tried to climb
that fence? She was on drugs?

296
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:27,040
She was most likely delusional.

297
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,886
Perhaps she thought
someone was chasing her.

298
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,356
You know how she got the drugs,
staff sergeant?

299
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,927
No, sir. l know she had
some problems in the past,

300
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,406
but if anything, she was anti-drugs.

301
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,523
Hell, she wouldn't even
take an aspirin.

302
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:43,596
- Where's Crawley, staff sergeant?
- His office. lt's just outside that door.

303
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,439
Mr. Crawley.

304
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,920
Mr. Crawley.

305
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,086
l'm sorry.

306
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,887
Please.
l was thinking about my daughter.

307
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,245
Her death just...

308
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,960
Taylor Shane was your daughter?

309
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,804
l became her legal guardian
when she was 1 5.

310
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,998
We've been through
a lot together, but--

311
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,084
Were you aware
that she had a drug problem?

312
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,642
Taylor's been clean and sober
for over two years now.

313
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:35,642
- She OD'd on PCP.
- No, no. There's no way.

314
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,240
She would never go
through that again.

315
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,444
Statistically,
addicts fall back in times of stress.

316
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,286
Meaning Marine boot camp probably
wasn't the best environment for her.

317
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,200
This entire reality series
was Taylor's idea.

318
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,995
l've never seen her happier.
She loved it here.

319
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,482
- How did she get the drugs?
- She didn't.

320
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,679
The whole point of the show was to
show that she wasn't that girl anymore.

321
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,447
Well, l'd say it backfired. Large time.

322
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,285
lt's ''bigtime.''

323
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:03,681
Get up!

324
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,919
Let's go. Move.

325
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,526
Come on,
show me what you're made of.

326
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,199
Come on, now. Just two more.

327
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,395
l can't do any more.

328
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:22,041
What did l tell you
about the word ''can't,'' Bressling?

329
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,841
Taylor's the only one who took
any of this Marine stuff seriously.

330
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:29,801
But you knew that, right, sarge?

331
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:32,162
- Get the cameras out of here.
- Yes, sir. Pack it up, guys.

332
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,356
Was he here?

333
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:37,006
Answer me, Hannah.

334
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,361
You're hurting her arm, sir.

335
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,199
My daughter's dead, staff sergeant.

336
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,085
lf she's responsible,
l'll do more than that.

337
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,120
Hey, no one's doing anything
around here but calming down.

338
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,000
- Who is ''he''?
- Noah Keller, Taylor's ex.

339
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:51,882
- Noah Keller, he was here?
- Couple of days ago. Big deal.

340
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,157
- Did you know this?
- No, sir.

341
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,517
Staff sergeant, can you take
Mr. Crawley for a walk?

342
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,325
We need to talk to the girls alone.

343
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:01,480
- You need to let NClS handle this.
- l'll talk to you when they're done.

344
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,837
We'll be here, Tom. We don't wrap
for another three days.

345
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:10,761
- ls that Berry Mango Madness?
- Yes.

346
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:13,881
We haven't had anything
but Marine food since we got here.

347
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,681
- l'll give you 1 00 bucks for it.
- lt's not for sale.

348
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,918
lt's free. Just like love.

349
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:24,119
You know, l'm a big fan of the show.
You guys are really beautiful and great.

350
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,926
- The show is excellent.
- Thanks, cutie.

351
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,640
Why didn't you tell me that
Taylor's boyfriend had visited her?

352
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,839
She made us promise
not to say anything.

353
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,083
Well, you know, she's dead,
so l don't think she'll mind.

354
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,640
You saw the way Tom reacted.

355
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:41,281
He hates Noah.
He blames him for Taylor's drug habit.

356
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,006
Was she using while she was here?

357
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,723
Considering
we're in a Marine boot camp? No.

358
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,161
None of us have used any drugs.

359
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,766
Noah just came to talk to her.

360
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,640
They were having
some relationship problems.

361
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:55,926
Taylor thought he was using again.

362
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,878
- What?
- Well, it just makes sense.

363
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,397
Someone gave her enough PCP
to kill the three of you.

364
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,318
When was the last time
you heard from Mr. Keller?

365
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,638
- Hang up the phone, McGee.
- Boss, l got Noah Keller's accountant.

366
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,238
He's at the Cranston Motel
in Triangle, Virginia,

367
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,358
right outside the main gate
of Quantico.

368
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,445
- How'd you track him down?
- l got a call from the president.

369
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,316
His Amex records
were in the fax machine, McGee.

370
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:30,236
- Come on.
- l specifically told her to e-mail those.

371
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:37,315
Millions of dollars,
a supermodel girlfriend,

372
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:38,806
and this is where he stays.

373
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,281
Well, he showed up in style.

374
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:43,126
- l would've rather slept in the car.
- That one.

375
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,919
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Boss.</i>

376
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:47,641
Noah Keller was in Quantico
the day before Taylor Shane died.

377
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,996
Yeah. l see him now, DiNozzo.

378
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,764
Don't bother, McGee.

379
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:08,286
A young person's death
is never easy, McGee.

380
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,884
But two in 24 hours,
and both self-inflicted. Well, that's...

381
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,478
- ...tragic.
- He got off easy, Duck.

382
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:18,036
The drugs he gave his girlfriend
had her thrashing herself to death

383
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,726
in a barbed-wire fence.

384
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,439
These people can have everything,
and this is how they end up?

385
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:28,397
Well, wealth and fame have often gone
hand in hand with fatal addiction.

386
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:31,724
- Edgar Allen Poe, Keith Moon.
- Kurt Cobain.

387
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:34,117
Yeah, the list goes on and on.

388
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,120
No, this one's been dead
about 24 hours, Jethro.

389
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:40,683
Well, that means he offed himself
the same night his girlfriend OD'd.

390
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:44,516
The froth around the mouth suggests
a breakdown of the nervous system.

391
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,121
PCP?

392
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,323
Yeah, possible, but not probable.
Look.

393
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:52,401
Pinpoint pupils, blue discoloration
around the fingernails.

394
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:55,883
No, l'd say his death
was the result of diacetylmorphine.

395
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:57,886
Heroin?

396
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,045
- Yeah.
- l would say you're right, Ducky.

397
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:05,126
That a suicide note?

398
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:07,041
Not exactly.

399
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:11,082
''lt's time for us to realise that this
just isn't meant to be.

400
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,000
Please know that it was never
my intention to hurt you.

401
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:16,880
l will always remember
the great times we've had.''

402
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,918
This is a Dear John letter.

403
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,476
Postmarked six days ago
from Quantico post office.

404
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,245
Handwriting checks out.

405
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:25,279
Taylor Shane sent it.

406
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,126
Yeah. Noah Keller came by
to chat about it.

407
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,124
Very Romeo and Juliet.

408
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:34,036
Except for the part where he feeds her
a toxic Klowny Kake and offs himself.

409
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,961
This must've been a very difficult
letter for her to write.

410
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:38,846
Probably harder for him to read.

411
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,475
No one likes getting dumped
by postal express.

412
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:43,365
Maybe he didn't listen.

413
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:47,480
Relationships change. Some people
don't know when to let go.

414
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:53,644
l have to brief the C.G. of Quantico
first thing in the morning on this,

415
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,485
and l'd like you to be there
when l do that.

416
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,601
Negative, Jen. All we have
is circumstantial evidence so far.

417
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,281
We don't even have anything to tie
the two deaths together yet.

418
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:04,484
l can't call the general
and tell him we have nothing.

419
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,117
You can always write him a letter.

420
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,080
Abby.

421
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,162
Abs?

422
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,282
They're for you.

423
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:28,996
They're really black.

424
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:32,923
- Really, really black.
- lt's pretty cool, huh?

425
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:34,765
Yeah.

426
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:39,081
- ''Get well soon''?
- They didn't have a card that said:

427
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,636
''Sorry l almost sent you to prison''
at the flower shop.

428
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,925
Almost?
You actually did send me to prison.

429
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:47,163
Well, not for good.

430
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:53,122
Abby. l don't know what to say,
Abby, these--

431
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,841
Just say that you don't hate me.

432
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:58,399
l could never hate you.

433
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,359
l don't think anyone
could ever hate you.

434
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,484
Oh, you don't know Billy Bob.

435
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,716
- You gave him black roses?
- No. l gave him two black eyes.

436
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,565
He tried to run over me
with a Harley Fat Boy

437
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,524
when l was sleeping
in the living room.

438
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,638
A guy rode a motorcycle
through your living room?

439
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,879
Yeah. No.
Well, it was his living room, my Harley.

440
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,637
Billy Bob had intimacy issues.

441
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,286
Don't forget to water them,
or they'll die.

442
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:27,156
l thought they already were dead.

443
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,916
''Laugh now, cry later.''

444
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:33,675
That's an interesting concept,
Mr. Palmer.

445
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:37,516
Unfortunately for our guest here,
the laughter has ended.

446
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:41,959
My friend who went to NYU said this
guy was the club king of New York.

447
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:43,480
He was almost legendary.

448
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,440
Well, if he wasn't before,
he most certainly is now.

449
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:49,639
And apparently, he only hung out
with models and A-list celebrities.

450
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,923
This guy got the VlP treatment
everywhere he went.

451
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:54,083
You writing a gossip column,
Palmer?

452
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:59,680
Oh, l was just informing Dr. Mallard
that he'd-- We-- l--

453
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,077
- Talk to me, Duck.
- Our initial assumptions

454
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,475
were far from correct.

455
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,440
When l examined him just now,
l found fresh bruises

456
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,359
on his upper back, the left shoulder.

457
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:13,476
The x-rays indicated a severe fracture
of the left scapula and a clavicle

458
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:17,322
- that was almost completely crushed.
- He was in a fight?

459
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:21,958
lnjuries of that nature, his left arm
would be completely useless.

460
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:23,680
Someone else shot him up.

461
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:26,924
Well, Abby's tox screen
showed that Mr. Keller

462
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,045
had a blood alcohol level of 0.34.

463
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,636
His heart was pumping so slowly

464
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,725
that most of the heroin
was never even metabolized.

465
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,959
He was passed out.

466
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,800
Yes, l'm afraid our young man
was unconscious

467
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,276
when the drug was administered.

468
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,436
From Abby?

469
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:06,801
l thought this show
was just mindless entertainment.

470
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,604
lt's called research, Tony.
And l'm merely looking for a lead.

471
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,803
Well, this is only the beginning.

472
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,759
Before you know it,
you'll be sitting at home

473
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,525
eating a large box of chocolates,

474
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,281
watching the Food Network
on your 50-inch plasma.

475
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:22,240
We're not all so easily corrupted.
Take McGee, for example.

476
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,199
He's been raised in America
his entire life,

477
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,564
and he rarely turns the television on.
Tell him, McGee.

478
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,240
Yeah, tell him, McGee.

479
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:34,119
Well, depends
what you consider rarely.

480
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,323
l might watch 20 minutes
here or there.

481
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:38,882
Tell her what you do
the rest of the time, probie.

482
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,122
That's not TV.

483
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:43,885
He pretends to be a fairy
in an online computer game.

484
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:45,116
lt's an elf lord.

485
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:46,922
Whatever.

486
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,123
Keller didn't commit suicide,
he was murdered.

487
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,197
What the hell are you two doing?
Find out why.

488
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,240
Hey, l gotta call you back.

489
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,157
Boss, l think
l might have something.

490
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,606
Are you waiting for me to guess,
Elf Lord?

491
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:11,640
No, sorry. l was searching through
Noah Keller's cell-phone records.

492
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,644
The night that he died,
he received three calls.

493
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:16,879
Two were from his business manager,
the other was from Hannah Bressling.

494
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:21,237
l've known Noah since high school.

495
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,802
We used to sneak into the Limelight,
like, every weekend.

496
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:29,481
- Limelight, that's that club in Chelsea.
- Yeah, you've been?

497
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:33,162
Actually, no, l...

498
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,045
l saw it on <i>Wild On.</i>

499
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:38,402
Sounded like it was
a pretty exclusive place.

500
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:41,799
Even as a kid, Noah seemed to know
all the right people.

501
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,242
l don't think he waited in line
his entire life.

502
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:47,485
Money tends to open doors.

503
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,565
No, he didn't use his dad's money
as a crutch.

504
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:50,956
Really?

505
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,839
Yeah, everyone always assumed
he was popular

506
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,602
only because he was rich, and that
that was the reason he dated models.

507
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,606
l'm sure it didn't hurt.

508
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,964
No, women liked Noah because
he was charismatic and interesting.

509
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:05,119
l mean, most guys that come
from money are womanizers

510
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,840
whose life revolves around their car.

511
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,723
Were you and Noah Keller
ever an item?

512
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,595
We dated on and off
for a couple years,

513
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,917
but we sort of lost touch
when he hooked up with Taylor.

514
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,039
When did he get involved
with drugs?

515
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,924
People say he got her started,
but it's not true.

516
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,600
They both made that leap together.

517
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,367
Did you speak to him
when he came to see Taylor?

518
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:31,726
No. He was drunk and really upset.

519
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:36,361
But l called him later that night
just to make sure that he was safe.

520
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:44,524
l just can't imagine why anyone
would've wanted to hurt him.

521
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,396
What are you doing?

522
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,117
l just stopped by to drop you
something off, Jethro.

523
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:57,000
Looked to me like
you were playing agent.

524
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,716
l left you four messages today.

525
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,161
Really?

526
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:02,726
l only got three.

527
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,646
Keller's death was a murder,
not suicide.

528
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,003
That's something
l should probably know.

529
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,198
lt sounds like you do.

530
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,397
This case is getting more attention
by the hour.

531
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,804
l trust that you will keep me
informed?

532
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:19,005
Trust is a two-way street.

533
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:22,286
What are you saying, Jethro?
You don't trust me?

534
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,516
Of course, l trust you.

535
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:36,486
ls that all?

536
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,406
For now.

537
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:43,761
l can save you the trouble.

538
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:47,840
On today's Channel 6 News,
per Director Shepard's demands,

539
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:52,040
Cynthia Sanchez issued a retraction
on Monday's story.

540
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,881
She was also forced
to issue a public apology

541
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:58,278
to one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

542
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:03,923
Our director has friends
in high places, yes?

543
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:07,164
Something l can do for you,
Officer David?

544
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:11,243
Abby needs to see you.
Said she found something.

545
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,478
l looked through all
the <i>Boot Camp Babe</i> footage

546
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:16,525
from the night Taylor Shane died.
She was nowhere to be seen.

547
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:19,155
She knew where the cameras
were placed, knew how to avoid them.

548
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:22,564
Not all of them.
A few minutes ago, l found this.

549
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,283
lt's from a Quantico security camera
placed on top of the mess hall.

550
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:29,644
This video was taken about two hours
before Taylor Shane died.

551
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,685
l presume not many people stroll
around Quantico at 1 a.m.

552
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,724
- Can you zoom in, Abs?
- My new enhancement program

553
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,201
is booting up as we speak.

554
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:39,562
l've been waiting for the chance
to bust out this bad boy.

555
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,646
This should clear it up a bit.

556
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,523
Taylor was with
Staff Sergeant McMannis?

557
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,437
When's Gibbs planning on starting?

558
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:05,326
- This is one of his techniques.
- Really?

559
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,240
Leaves the guy alone
in a cold, dimly lit room.

560
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,598
And then, just as the guy
starts to zone out,

561
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:15,360
he bursts in the door and rifles off
some questions.

562
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,798
l call it ''rock the baby.''

563
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,323
l see. And does it work?

564
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,605
Just watch.

565
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:26,116
ln a few moments,
that door is gonna fly open

566
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:29,882
and this big, bad Marine
is gonna jump like a little girl.

567
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,117
What the hell's with you, DiNozzo?

568
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,800
l was just telling Ziva
about your interrogation techniques.

569
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:42,840
l'm not interrogating McMannis.
You are.

570
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:46,160
Thanks, boss. l could've used
a little more prep time, but that's--

571
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:49,086
l'm not talking to you, DiNozzo.

572
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,399
He is all yours, Officer David.

573
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,964
You are aware that l've never
performed an interrogation

574
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,761
without inflicting some sort of pain?

575
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:08,844
This footage was pulled
from a Quantico security camera.

576
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,476
lt was taken at 01 1 7

577
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:14,121
the morning Taylor Shane
was murdered.

578
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:15,641
That's an interesting technique.

579
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,606
She doesn't wanna tempt herself.

580
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,883
Tell me what you know,
staff sergeant.

581
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:21,275
Okay if l dip, ma'am?

582
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,923
Promised Taylor l'd quit.

583
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,845
We're both addicted to nicotine.

584
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,638
Supermodel who spits tobacco?

585
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,519
She smoked.

586
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,636
But it's against the rules
at boot camp.

587
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,597
So you supplied her
with your snuff there?

588
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:43,559
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:33:44,127 --> 00:33:45,640
And junk food?

590
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:51,236
- Sometimes.
- And the midnight walks?

591
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:54,076
You did that with every girl,
staff sergeant?

592
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:57,282
No, just Taylor.

593
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:01,722
We didn't want anybody to find out
about us until the show ended.

594
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:05,765
Find out what?

595
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:09,075
That we were in love, ma'am.

596
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,679
This is the worst defence
imaginable.

597
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,721
The idea of a supermodel
falling in love with a guy like this.

598
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,725
Okay, why's that?

599
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,565
Well, it's absolutely ridiculous,
you know?

600
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,399
Supermodels date guys
like George Clooney,

601
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,837
or guys with George Clooney's
bank account,

602
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:25,639
or, of course,
the actual George Clooney,

603
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:29,004
but not guys like this.
They don't date guys like this.

604
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:34,280
- Definitely not guys like this.
- Meaning Marines, DiNozzo?

605
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:39,558
No, l didn't say that.
l mean, l would never say that.

606
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,405
He thought l meant Marines.

607
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,797
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>l've got something for you, Gibbs.</i>

608
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:49,404
l'll be right there.
Abby's got something.

609
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,441
Hey. You were a lot of help.

610
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:03,406
Taylor was nothing like her reputation.
She was normal, like a regular girl.

611
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,684
l know it sounds weird, but l fell in love
with her the moment l met her.

612
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,323
And she felt the same way?

613
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:12,925
We were gonna get married
once the show ended.

614
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:16,683
She was done with modelling.
She was sick of the whole lifestyle.

615
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:18,881
And the reason you failed
to mention

616
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:21,481
you were with her
a few hours before she died?

617
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:25,766
Who'd have believed me, ma'am?

618
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,363
Hell, it was my life.

619
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:30,886
Barely believe it myself.

620
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:32,996
l believe you.

621
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,800
You do?

622
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,086
So l'm free to go?

623
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,326
No.

624
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:44,039
l think we will charge you
with murder instead.

625
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,117
But you said
you believed me, ma'am.

626
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,881
l would never, ever have done
anything to hurt her.

627
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,802
What about the man who supplied
the drugs that killed her?

628
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:55,762
Noah Keller?

629
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,764
Answer the question, staff sergeant.

630
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,201
l'm not feeling too well, ma'am.

631
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,644
This is the final wardrobe
of Taylor Shane.

632
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,600
- l couldn't imagine a worse way to go.
- l could.

633
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:16,805
She planted herself
on a barbed-wire fence.

634
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,235
What could possibly be worse?

635
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,045
My top three are falling
into a wood chipper,

636
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,039
drowning in lava
and being eaten by a shark.

637
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:26,203
- l'm guessing you thought about this.
- On and off for the last 25 years.

638
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,246
l read a statistic says you're more likely
to be struck by lightning

639
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,436
than attacked by a shark.

640
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,040
Not if you're a seal.

641
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,599
- What do we have, Abs?
- l broke down the origin

642
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,917
of each and every stain
on Taylor's clothes.

643
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,721
- Most were blood, mud, rust, sweat.
- Most?

644
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:43,403
Yes. This stain here, under the collar,
has traces of PCP

645
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,286
mixed with formaldehyde, sodium
and nicotine.

646
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,480
- Tobacco.
- Yep.

647
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,156
The PCP wasn't laced
in the Klowny Kake.

648
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:54,677
lt was laced in this.

649
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,116
Are you sure you don't want
some more water, staff sergeant?

650
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:06,761
- l have to leave here now.
- Sit down, staff sergeant.

651
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,395
What are you doing to me?

652
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:17,564
l believe Officer David
asked you to sit down.

653
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:22,283
You did this to me.
You're trying to destroy me!

654
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,402
- Guy just went crazy, boss.
- He's OD'ing on PCP.

655
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:38,835
Get a medical team in here.

656
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,566
Where'd you get
the chew, sergeant?

657
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,595
- Sergeant!
- From the show.

658
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:49,360
- What's happening to me, sir?
- You've been drugged.

659
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:51,801
But you'll be all right now.

660
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,600
Hush.

661
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:00,964
This is what l would call
some serious snuff.

662
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:05,083
The staff sergeant's chew was laced
with 400 milligrams of PCP.

663
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,723
A typical hit for a user would be
between seven and ten milligrams.

664
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:11,566
l knew that dude couldn't have
taken me if he wasn't juiced.

665
00:38:11,727 --> 00:38:12,921
What are his chances, Abby?

666
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,958
lt depends on how much
PCP he ingested.

667
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:16,760
How long was he dipping?

668
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,561
That long, huh?

669
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,604
Let's hope he has better luck
than Taylor Shane.

670
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,559
Okay, great. Thank you.

671
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:25,797
Staff Sergeant McMannis
is stable at Bethesda.

672
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,003
- Still in critical condition.
- Any prints?

673
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:30,323
l was able to lift two latent prints.

674
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:34,165
One matches
Staff Sergeant McMannis.

675
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,039
- And the other?
- No owner yet.

676
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:39,995
But it does match a print lifted
from Noah Keller's syringe.

677
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,118
Whoever killed Taylor killed Keller.

678
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,278
What's that for?

679
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,765
- lt's a fingerprint kit.
- Why?

680
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,205
Someone tried to kill
Staff Sergeant McMannis today.

681
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,317
His chewing tobacco
was laced with PCP.

682
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,319
Whoever did it
left a print on the can.

683
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,802
The same person who murdered
Taylor Shane and Noah Keller.

684
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:05,119
- Whoa, you think it was one of us?
- Oh, we know it was one of you.

685
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:06,721
You were jealous of her, Hannah.

686
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,525
You're the one who introduced her
to Keller.

687
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:12,356
Me, jealous of a crackhead?
Please, Tom, you're stretching it a bit.

688
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:14,404
But why would we?
That doesn't make any sense.

689
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,600
Taylor Shane was in love
with the staff sergeant.

690
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:22,399
- Yeah, right. You've got to be joking.
- No, we're not.

691
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:24,837
Well, then, fingerprint away,
sweetheart. lt wasn't me.

692
00:39:25,047 --> 00:39:27,083
We don't need it.
They're already in your arrest record.

693
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:31,196
From the time you beat up your
assistant with your phone, l believe.

694
00:39:31,807 --> 00:39:33,604
Well, it wasn't me.

695
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,559
Nope. We've got yours too.

696
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,319
Yeah, remember that time you drove
your SUV

697
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:38,880
through the front of the Limelight?

698
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:44,836
What is this?

699
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,317
l loved Taylor.

700
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,797
l'm not giving you permission
to take my fingerprints.

701
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,440
l'm gonna talk to my lawyer first.

702
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:57,326
We don't need anybody's permission.
You're under arrest for murder.

703
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,842
You didn't want her to give up
her career to marry a Marine,

704
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,480
but you couldn't stop her.

705
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,797
Too bad she was addicted
to nicotine too.

706
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:07,081
You killed your own daughter?

707
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,761
lt was an accident!
What was l supposed to do?

708
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,878
She was gonna throw her life away,
be some--

709
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,123
Be some jarhead's housewife.

710
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,118
Thanks, Tom.

711
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:22,240
What's so funny, honey?

712
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:25,883
The ratings on this one
will really be through the roof.

713
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,122
Ziva, no. No, no, no.

714
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:32,841
- You really find her attractive?
- Oh, yeah.

715
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,156
Well, l want to shoot her.

716
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:39,078
Tony, it's a matter of opinion.
How can it be wrong?

717
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:42,717
Exactly. lt's a matter of you
having the wrong opinion.

718
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:46,283
- Why don't you two agree to disagree?
- l don't agree to that.

719
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:50,122
Boss, the director's new hair,
you like the way she cut it? Short?

720
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,476
She cut her hair?

721
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,596
Never mind.

722
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,603
l don't suppose you want this.

723
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,399
l'll get rid of it.

724
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,482
Go home, DiNozzo. lt's late.

725
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,317
Yeah, l'm just finishing up
a couple things.

726
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:20,526
Your flowers are dead.
