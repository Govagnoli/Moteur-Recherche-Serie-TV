1
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,165
Sorry, Caitlin.

2
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,917
Oh, Caitlin.

3
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,676
l am so sorry.

4
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,203
Why me, Gibbs?

5
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,837
Wasn't stopping
one bullet enough for you?

6
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,881
Why did l have to take two?

7
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,559
l don't know.

8
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,485
You don't know?

9
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:33,244
Come on, Gibbs,
what's that famous gut tell you?

10
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,241
Why did l die instead of you?

11
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,164
Found Ari's sniper's nest, boss.

12
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:45,636
Roof of an abandoned
office building to the east.

13
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,360
Didn't police his brass.

14
00:03:58,207 --> 00:04:00,437
They're Lapua .308s.

15
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,916
l didn't mean
that you couldn't see that, boss.

16
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,366
l can't without my glasses.

17
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,878
Lapua's match-grade sniper ammo.

18
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,165
You guys find any bullets?

19
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,836
None that match the casings.

20
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,878
l left three guys on the roof
searching.

21
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,123
McGee and l
will go back to the roof, boss.

22
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:25,836
Tony, you're soaking wet.

23
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:27,886
Go put some dry clothes on.

24
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,043
Ari's rooftop
wasn't much higher than ours.

25
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:42,604
Rooflines behind us were lower.

26
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,125
No telling how far a full metal jacket
bullet would go,

27
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,286
after killing Kate.

28
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,766
How's he know
it's a full metal jacket?

29
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,045
Didn't you see Kate?

30
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,003
l didn't want to.

31
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,758
Her head was intact.

32
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,482
Oh, so she didn't look bad?

33
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:08,841
No. No, not at all, Probie.

34
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,120
ln fact, a little mortuary putty
right here

35
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:13,756
and she'll be good as new.

36
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:17,039
Of course, she was having a bad hair
day, though, right back here.

37
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,556
A full metal jacket will put
a hole the size of a grapefruit

38
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,842
- right about there.
- Tony.

39
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,359
Please.

40
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,960
Sorry, kid.

41
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,919
Three rounds. Only one hit?

42
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,560
He must've popped off
a couple rounds

43
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,160
when we were weaving
across the roof.

44
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,443
l was standing still
when Kate was shot.

45
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,440
McGee lasered the distance
at nearly 600 metres.

46
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,040
Five seventy-two.

47
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:47,477
Slight shift in the wind, he misses you.
He hits Kate.

48
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,445
There was no wind.

49
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,845
What are you saying?
He was aiming at Kate?

50
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,120
- You're the one he wants to kill.
- Ari had a thing for Kate.

51
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:03,476
What are you talking about?

52
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,445
She told me that he was always
coming on to her. ln Autopsy,

53
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,763
when he kidnapped her
and let her go.

54
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,076
She never told me that.

55
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,482
- Gee, what a surprise.
- What?

56
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:14,876
Don't do that, Tony.

57
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,122
When was this hit, Tim?

58
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,280
When l was pinned down.

59
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,802
Ari have a shot at it?

60
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,957
A car was between the terrorist
and the controller.

61
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,799
There's no way
he could have hit it.

62
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,198
l'm sorry. l should've realized
that it was Ari.

63
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,278
- Why didn't he pop McGee?
- Oh, thanks, Tony.

64
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:49,206
All l'm saying is you're
a sizeable target. The controller isn't.

65
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,720
- Are you saying l'm fat?
- No.

66
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:54,556
All right, maybe a little
around the waist, under the chin.

67
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,359
He didn't have an angle on Tim.

68
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,235
You owe that shooter
from the warehouse a thank-you.

69
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:01,800
He saved your life.

70
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,045
The bullet entered here.
lt could have ricocheted into the car.

71
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,044
l'll-- l'll get on it.

72
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,676
- Abby should be in by now.
- Tony,

73
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,276
see what you can pull off that brass.

74
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:22,681
l'm going for coffee.
Can l get you boys some?

75
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,764
- No.
- No, thanks.

76
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,125
That's a first.

77
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,639
- He called me Tim.
- He patted my back.

78
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,197
lt's kind of nice.

79
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,519
Nice?

80
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:45,120
l don't want nice.
He's not Gibbs if he's nice.

81
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,525
You're a mess, girl.

82
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:23,839
Red eyes. No makeup.

83
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,198
lf ever there was a time
for black lipstick, it's now.

84
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:41,602
Remember when we first met?

85
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:48,478
l couldn't believe
you were a forensic scientist.

86
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:53,080
l thought goths had bats for pets
or vice-versa.

87
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:57,962
l really liked you, Kate.

88
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,920
A lot.

89
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:03,244
Don't start that again.
Where are your pigtails?

90
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,076
l love you in pigtails.

91
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:13,000
That's better.

92
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,163
You were persistent, Abs.

93
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,042
First, the dark lipstick.
Then the black nail polish.

94
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,761
Next thing you know,
l have a tat on my bum.

95
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:26,196
Oh, God. Ducky's gonna see it.

96
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,243
l'm dead and l'm embarrassed.

97
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:38,839
Abby.

98
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:40,926
Hey, Tony.

99
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,240
Are you okay?

100
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:48,239
l will be as soon as
l tie up my pigtails.

101
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,046
There.

102
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:51,796
What can l do for you?

103
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,196
- What?
- You're weirder than Gibbs.

104
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,200
How so?

105
00:09:58,607 --> 00:09:59,756
He's being nice.

106
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:01,756
Gibbs is always nice.

107
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,036
To you and Ducky, maybe.

108
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,926
Me, he growls at
and smacks on the head.

109
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,285
Which makes you feel wanted.

110
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,275
Yeah.

111
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,205
What do you got for me?

112
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,159
.308 casings from Ari's sniper's nest.

113
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,077
You would have to give me
the most popular calibre in the world.

114
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,680
Well, hey, l just found them.

115
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,681
Can you tell what weapon he used?

116
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,082
- A .308.
- What model .308?

117
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,437
- You don't know?
- Would l be asking?

118
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:36,242
- Well, how am l supposed to know?
- Because you're the firearms expert.

119
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,516
That l am.

120
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:45,126
And when l'm done,
l will tell you the propellant, the primer,

121
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,841
the percentage of nickel and copper
in the brass,

122
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,720
whether or not all three rounds
were fired from the same weapon

123
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:53,401
which you assume,
but l can prove or disprove.

124
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,956
l will tell you
who manufactured the ammo,

125
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,482
the batch number
and, perhaps, where it was sold.

126
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,558
l will also,
with some degree of accuracy,

127
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,082
tell you if it was fired
from a lever-action,

128
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,518
a bolt-action, a semi-automatic
or an automatic weapon.

129
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:09,844
However, there is no way in hell
l could tell you

130
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:15,639
which of the 87 different .308 models
fired those rounds.

131
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,607
The rounds are Lapua.

132
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,519
What?

133
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,803
Lapua made the ammo.

134
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:28,838
Logo's on the rim.

135
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:34,720
Tony, l'm gonna miss her.

136
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,080
Me too.

137
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,605
- You hit?
- No.

138
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:08,083
- You're heavy.
- Sorry.

139
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:14,957
No wonder you're so heavy.
Tony, you're all muscle.

140
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,759
Abby:

141
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,277
Packing a nice booty too.

142
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:22,001
Hey, is this how you deal
with getting shot at?

143
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,084
- l don't know. lt's my first time.
- Abby.

144
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,881
Boss, down. We're taking fire.

145
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,246
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,083
Close off Anacostia Park
between the bridges.

147
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,643
- Tell Metro cops it's a crime scene.
- Okay, right.

148
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,199
What if he has a night-vision scope?

149
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:05,841
That's a good point, boss.

150
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,044
l will get you bullet-proof glass.

151
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,205
- There's no such thing, Gibbs.
- Okay, bullet-resistant glass.

152
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:21,362
Ari didn't shoot at you
and hit Kate by mistake, did he?

153
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,322
He's after me now.

154
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:25,995
l was walking by that window
when he fired.

155
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,563
You're just saying that
to make me feel safe.

156
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,042
l'll keep you safe, Abby.

157
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:35,238
l promise.

158
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:54,439
l appreciate your keeping me covered
in front of the others.

159
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,245
Especially Tony.

160
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,802
Yes, l know how modest you are.

161
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:02,519
Were.

162
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,923
l'm dead now, Ducky.

163
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:07,756
Shouldn't be.

164
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,516
l could have killed Ari right here.
ln Autopsy.

165
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,242
Why did you hesitate?

166
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,679
His eyes.

167
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:26,839
There was something in his eyes
that made me not wanna kill him.

168
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,239
His eyes were ice to me.

169
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,163
Ari fired into Abby's lab.

170
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,716
Good Lord.

171
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,442
lt had to come from across the river
in Anacostia Park.

172
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,006
Was Abigail hurt?

173
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:45,562
No, she's a little shook up.
Tony's with her.

174
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,961
ln the lab?

175
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:50,644
ln the squad room
writing up an incident report.

176
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,720
You should have brought in
another M.E., Duck.

177
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,245
Couldn't.

178
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,525
Not for Caitlin.

179
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,876
l've lost men in combat.

180
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,718
You hope you won't.
You know you will.

181
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:13,405
- This is different.
- But it shouldn't be.

182
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,240
Kate was an agent.

183
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:18,285
She knew she had to lay her life
on the line.

184
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,318
But you're right.

185
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:22,962
lt's different.

186
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:24,885
Well, you just said it.

187
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:28,238
You've lost men.
Have you ever lost a woman?

188
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:32,357
Let's face it, Jethro, you and l
are a couple of old chauvinists.

189
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:37,243
Women will never be equal in our eyes
until they're equal in death.

190
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:38,880
Why, Ducky?

191
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:40,486
Why Kate? Why not me?

192
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,962
- Well, maybe he meant to hit you.
- No.

193
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,886
No, him sniping Abby
means he's after my people.

194
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,236
Women first.

195
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,125
Then he's torturing you.

196
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,525
One has to wonder
what made him such a sadist.

197
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:54,763
l don't give a damn.

198
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,446
l just wanna kill the bastard.

199
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,041
Hey, McGee, take a look at this.

200
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,845
l think it's a .308.

201
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,879
Stop staring at my butt
and get me an evidence jar.

202
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,680
Drop it.

203
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,400
Oh, l found another one.

204
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:28,526
Boss, we found a .308 slug.

205
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,726
Two. They were plugged
in the trunk.

206
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,759
These fired by the dirtbag
in the warehouse?

207
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:39,199
Yes. Those l found in the right side
of the car. Nine mil slugs.

208
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,325
Ari missed with his first shot.
Hit the controller with the second.

209
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,483
Where were you
before you took cover?

210
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,678
Right here.

211
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:51,406
Tony's right.
You do owe that terrorist a thank-you.

212
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:58,846
He didn't police his brass again.

213
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:02,363
Metro P.D. found a .308 casing
in the park next to tyre tracks.

214
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,880
- And?
- Nothing.

215
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,726
l was waiting for you to tell me to
tell them to bring the evidence.

216
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:08,360
l have to tell you that, DiNozzo?

217
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,480
You always do.

218
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,647
- Tell Metro P.D. to--
- Already did, boss.

219
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,556
Oh, and by the way, the director
wants to see you up in MTAC.

220
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:24,760
Why are you baiting Gibbs?

221
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:27,720
l'm trying to get him
to stop being nice.

222
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:29,921
l like him nice.

223
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,445
Signal is strong.
We have a solid channel.

224
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,680
Distributing the infrared--

225
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,116
What do you have?

226
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,397
Brass from Ari's sniper's nest.
Three bullets.

227
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,563
Tyre tracks in Anacostia Park

228
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:54,682
from where he fired a shot
across the river into our forensics lab.

229
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,004
Unusual for a sniper not to police his
brass, isn't it?

230
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,516
- Yes, sir.
- l've received calls

231
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,645
from every director l know promising
to hunt down this sniper

232
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,798
as if he'd killed one of their own.

233
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,966
FBl might be the most help.
Ari Haswari is their mole.

234
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,720
l endorsed your recommendation

235
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:17,119
to award the Presidential Medal
of Freedom to Special Agent Todd.

236
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,923
- Thank you, sir.
- According to your after-action report,

237
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,647
no one actually saw the sniper
who killed Agent Todd.

238
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,839
Ari was on a rooftop
600 metres away.

239
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,641
- Extraordinary shot.
- No, sir. Not really.

240
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,886
- You were a sniper with the Corps?
- Two tours.

241
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,679
Vietnam?

242
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,042
l'm not that old, sir.

243
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:40,121
Panama and Desert Storm.

244
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,000
- l thought you were older.
- Target vehicle approaching.

245
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,635
<i>We have a hard lock.</i>

246
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,246
Target confirmed. Engage.

247
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,642
<i>Weapon free.</i>

248
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,361
<i>Good lock. On target.</i>

249
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,118
Well done.

250
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:02,726
Good job, everyone.

251
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:03,962
Where was l?

252
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:09,958
Avoiding using Ari's name and the word
''sniper'' in the same sentence, sir.

253
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,159
Your anger is understandable, Jethro.
You lost an agent.

254
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,359
- You want payback.
- Don't you, sir?

255
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,000
lt's a passion l can't afford.

256
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,959
Do you honestly think it wasn't Ari?

257
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,761
No. But there are those who do.

258
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,200
Those who ran him.

259
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:28,479
Those who thought they had
the holy grail of moles.

260
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,076
Those people covering their asses
right now.

261
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,243
Make sure you cover yours
when you bring him in.

262
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,244
Won't be a problem, sir.

263
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,836
l won't be bringing him in.

264
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,445
Anyway, you're not my problem
anymore, Jethro.

265
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,117
You firing me, sir?

266
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,240
l've been offered a deputy director's
position at Homeland Security.

267
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,877
You'd leave NClS, sir?

268
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,002
Well, the agency could use
some younger blood.

269
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,485
Well, who'll be replacing you,
sir?

270
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,205
Not me.

271
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:08,681
Much as l like you, Jethro,
l would not shoot NClS in the head.

272
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:13,041
He's your problem now, director.

273
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:19,835
Hello, Jethro.

274
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:34,797
Should we skip the
''you haven't changed a bit'' bull?

275
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,005
Why start lying
to each other now, Jen?

276
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,358
Any problem taking orders from me?

277
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:44,683
As director or as a woman?

278
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:46,675
Either.

279
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,717
lt was six years ago.

280
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,522
The past won't be a problem.

281
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,278
You were a damn good agent

282
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,558
especially undercover.

283
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,519
Jethro.

284
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:07,123
Madam Director.

285
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:18,245
You have no physical evidence
linking Ari to the shootings.

286
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:20,278
No wonder agencies
here and abroad have doubts.

287
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,762
Bastard killed one of my people.
He's trying to kill more.

288
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,124
l'll tell you something else. No suit with
a tight sphincter is getting in my way,

289
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,436
and that includes you, Jen.

290
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,799
Special Agent Gibbs.

291
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:43,395
On the job,
it is Director Shepard or ma'am.

292
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,120
Okay. What about off the job?

293
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,285
There won't be any ''off the job,''
Agent Gibbs.

294
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,603
That's too bad.

295
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,845
l missed you, Jen.

296
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,324
Don't make this difficult, Jethro.

297
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,327
Fair enough. lt won't happen again.

298
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,759
Director.

299
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,563
We can continue
this conversation in private.

300
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,917
l've gotta change my clothes.
We can talk in my car.

301
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:16,118
- Gibbs.
- Hey, l got a dead agent

302
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:19,757
and a sniper on the loose.
l do not have 1 0 minutes to spare.

303
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:20,956
Tony, where are we?

304
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,078
McGee and Abby
are working firearms analysis.

305
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:27,565
- l'm matching tyre tracks to vehicles.
- No one is to leave the building.

306
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:30,799
McGee's on protection detail
with Abby. l'll be back in an hour.

307
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:37,158
Your mother should have washed
your mind out with soap.

308
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:43,160
Gibbs leaves with a woman
and your only thought is: nooner.

309
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,436
Was not.

310
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:46,080
Was too.

311
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,437
l've always known
what you were thinking, Tony.

312
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,836
What?
What are you up to?

313
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:02,922
Tony, l just died
and you're having a sexual fantasy?

314
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:04,841
Can't help it.

315
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,239
DiNozzo.

316
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:12,120
Sometimes
l used to picture you naked.

317
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:20,200
l'll call you back.

318
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,602
Hi.

319
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,195
l was just--

320
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,440
Having phone sex?

321
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:32,036
Phone sex? No.

322
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,037
- Charades.
- Charades?

323
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,965
- Like:
-You've played.

324
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:39,563
Never on the telephone.

325
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,086
Yeah.

326
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:44,120
My partner and l were coming up
with quotes for Saturday night.

327
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,119
You play charades
on Saturday night?

328
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:49,443
To kill time before l go clubbing.
Who are you?

329
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,685
Ziva David.

330
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:52,876
Mossad.

331
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,805
You're lsraeli?

332
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,766
Very good.
The way you made that connection.

333
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,162
Mossad, lsraeli.

334
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,965
What can l do for you, Ms. David?

335
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,523
Nothing.
l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs.

336
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,601
How do you know l'm not Gibbs?

337
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:20,001
- Gibbs.
- He'll be back in an hour.

338
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,165
Are you sure l can't help you?

339
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,919
l don't think so.

340
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,878
We got off to a bad start.

341
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,997
l'm Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
l wasn't playing charades.

342
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:41,438
l was remembering my partner.

343
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,796
- Naked?
- No.

344
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,277
Yes. l--

345
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,520
l was just--

346
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:53,881
Look, l'm not the only man
who does it.

347
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:56,157
Oh, women do it too.

348
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:01,124
With handsome men.

349
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:07,679
And even an occasional woman.

350
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,561
Now you're teasing me.

351
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,199
Didn't your partner tease you?

352
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,604
Not about sex.
Kate was kind of puritanical.

353
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,926
- Sorry.
- Well, it didn't matter.

354
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:22,915
l wasn't interested in her.
We were partners.

355
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,006
She wasn't attractive?

356
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,358
She was, but not to me.

357
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:33,037
Then why did you imagine her
naked?

358
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:38,687
Miss David, you can sit there

359
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,600
and slouch provocatively for an hour
if you'd like,

360
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,038
or you could tell me what you need
and maybe l can help.

361
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,886
You can't help because l'm here
to stop Special Agent Gibbs

362
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,958
from killing a Mossad officer.

363
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:52,841
Ari Haswari?

364
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:54,605
Yes.

365
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:03,359
l'd wish you luck,
but l want the bastard dead too.

366
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,122
ls this the same boat
you were building six years ago?

367
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,363
- Nope.
- What happened to it?

368
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,320
- l burned her.
- Why would you--?

369
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:19,725
You named it after an ex-wife.

370
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,845
Let's go.

371
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:27,996
- Which one?
- You know damn well which one.

372
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,761
- Why didn't you change the name?
- Because it wouldn't matter.

373
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:33,077
Every time l went out on her,
l'd think of Diane.

374
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:34,716
You could have sold it.

375
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,916
And watched some other guy
sail off on her?

376
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,118
You didn't care
who sailed off on Diane.

377
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,842
Leroy Jethro Gibbs,

378
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:46,878
you are a strange man.

379
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,725
Me.

380
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:51,606
You were a good agent, Jen.

381
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:53,718
- Were?
- Yeah.

382
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,077
Director's job is pure politics.

383
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:57,436
l'm good at politics.

384
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:00,241
NClS needs someone who can shake
the money tree on the Hill

385
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:01,556
and work with sister agencies.

386
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:06,443
Wait, you won't call a boat a ''she,''
but it's ''sister agencies?''

387
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:08,046
l'm a schizoid libber.

388
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,317
lt comes from working
with chauvinists like you.

389
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:14,406
l can't believe you would give up
field work for rubber chicken dinners.

390
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,757
l don't think they serve
that dish at Palena.

391
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,481
- Never heard of it.
- Why would you? lt isn't takeout.

392
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:22,155
So which of the tight sphincters
is taking you out to dinner?

393
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:25,239
Please tell me it's not Fornell.

394
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,241
CBS <i>Early Show</i>.

395
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,517
They want background
before l go on TV.

396
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,116
Jen. Jen, you can't do that.

397
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:33,806
Excuse me?

398
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,281
Ari is a chauvinist.

399
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,320
He is taking out the women
l work with before me.

400
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:39,962
Jethro.

401
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,477
People who should know
don't believe Ari Haswari is the sniper.

402
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,520
And you haven't provided any evidence
to prove them wrong.

403
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:48,924
Have you ever doubted me?

404
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:51,963
Professionally? Never.

405
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,678
Why are you doubting me now?

406
00:27:55,927 --> 00:28:00,045
l have to establish a working
relationship with these people.

407
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,920
Who are you gonna side with, Jen?
Them or me.

408
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,282
Give me a tough question.

409
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,566
What is with this music?

410
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,837
l'm playing it out of respect for Kate.

411
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,963
l thought
you were from New Orleans.

412
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,960
- So?
- Well, don't they play jazz at funerals?

413
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:33,246
Coming from the cemetery
after the body has been buried.

414
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,722
On the way to the cemetery,
we play a dirge.

415
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,441
- Do you know what a dirge is, Timmy?
- Creepy music?

416
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,444
Go back to the squad room
and let me do my job.

417
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:41,796
l can't.

418
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,525
Why?

419
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,566
Gibbs-- Gibbs told me
to watch over you.

420
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:57,362
That is so sweet.

421
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,085
- You're from a wealthy family.
- Really?

422
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:05,723
Born and raised on the East Coast.
New England boarding school.

423
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:09,044
Spent some time in the Midwest.
And Philadelphia.

424
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,158
How would you know that?

425
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:15,879
Shalom, Jen.

426
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:17,955
Shalom.

427
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:20,035
Did l miss it?

428
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:23,683
- Yes, you did, but we didn't.
- You first.

429
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,206
Ziva David, Mossad.

430
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,359
She's here to stop you
from whacking Ari. Yours?

431
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,367
Director Jenny Shepard.
Same mission.

432
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,400
Which agency?

433
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,086
Ours.

434
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,920
Yeah?

435
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,486
Special Agent Gibbs.

436
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:44,120
Ziva David, Mossad.

437
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:45,840
Ziva.

438
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:48,442
Director Shepard
has spoken often of you.

439
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:52,124
- Really?
- Ziva and l worked antiterrorist ops

440
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:54,357
since 9/1 1 .
You saw one today in MTAC.

441
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,602
That was yours?

442
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,480
l only acquired the intel.

443
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:00,715
Excuse me.

444
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:09,119
Yes, l really am
the new NClS director.

445
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,081
Yeah.

446
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,564
Good to have you back, boss.

447
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,726
Shalom.

448
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,964
Miss David, whose balls get cut off

449
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,761
if Ari is not a Mossad mole,
but a terrorist?

450
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,397
Mine, l suppose.
Since l'm his control officer.

451
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,440
They promote control officers
young in Mossad.

452
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,599
Have to. The good ones are dead
at your age.

453
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:30,404
Do you know
how l located Ari's terrorist cell?

454
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,558
GPS fix off
his encrypted cell phone.

455
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,405
He wanted you to know
the terrorists' location,

456
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,205
so you could stop the missile
instead of him,

457
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,766
which would've blown his cover.

458
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:42,239
Only an NSA satellite
can GPS an encrypted phone.

459
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,204
Ari didn't know l had that asset.

460
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:46,602
You give him less credit
than he gives you.

461
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:49,275
Who hung up first? You or him?

462
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,801
Ari knows a fix
takes only 1 9 seconds.

463
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:00,164
When Sharon visited Bush, Ari's
Hamas cell kidnapped Agent Todd.

464
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,685
Why didn't he kill her instead of freeing
her to warn the Secret Service?

465
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,117
Why don't you arrange
a meet and he can tell me?

466
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,439
Ari Haswari is a Mossad
operative undercover in Hamas.

467
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:12,639
He hasn't turned on us or you.
He didn't kill Agent Todd.

468
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:16,445
Gibbs, even if you're right,
we owe them proof.

469
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:17,682
That's all we ask.

470
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:20,157
- Don't kill the wrong man.
- Like Mossad did in Norway?

471
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:21,925
That mistake cost us dearly.

472
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:25,124
Not as dearly
as the Palestinian waiter you killed.

473
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:32,075
Ziva, assure your deputy director that
even though Ari Haswari is a suspect,

474
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:36,166
no action will be taken
unless we have evidentiary proof.

475
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:41,876
Proof before action.

476
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:12,319
You were my sweet superhero,
Kate.

477
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,962
You're a naughty boy, Timmy.

478
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:27,721
Oh, my God. l'm becoming Tony.

479
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:39,516
Wow, what?

480
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,122
l-- l--

481
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,116
Stop ''ah-uming,'' McGee. Spit it out.

482
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,278
l-- l was thinking about Kate.

483
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,519
Me too.

484
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:59,079
l kind of still feel like she's here,
you know?

485
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,917
l want you on Ziva's ass.

486
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:16,719
She's not really my type, boss.

487
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,878
- To tail her.
- l knew that.

488
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,839
She's been in contact with Ari.

489
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:24,596
That's the only way she could know
l hung up on him.

490
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:28,445
- l don't want you to get pissed--
- l thought you wanted me pissed?

491
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,207
l did. lt was kind of weird
when you were being nice.

492
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:34,404
Not that you're not nice. l mean--

493
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,637
Will you spit it out, DiNozzo?

494
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:39,520
What if Ziva's right
and Ari knew you'd trace the call?

495
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:41,598
Maybe he wasn't the sniper.

496
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,124
She is right.

497
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:49,119
Ari wanted me
to raid the warehouse.

498
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,847
He set me up.
And it cost Kate her life.

499
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,286
ls he a mole or a terrorist?

500
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,316
Whatever works to play his game.

501
00:34:58,007 --> 00:34:59,884
lf Ziva leads me to Ari?

502
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:02,243
Shadow him and call me.

503
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,400
- So you can bring him in?
- Yeah. So l can bring him in

504
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,677
to Autopsy.

505
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,118
The FBl database
gave me six weapons

506
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,596
whose rifling patterns
fit the bullets you recovered.

507
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:14,445
l've been able to eliminate
all but three.

508
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,956
Two SWAT weapons,
the Tango 51 and Bravo 51 .

509
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,044
- And this--
- My old friend.

510
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,200
A Marine M40A1 sniper rifle.

511
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,798
lt looks sweet
the way you hold that, boss.

512
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,003
Sweet?

513
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,723
Yeah. lt's an expression that means--

514
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,436
Yeah, l know what it means,
McGee.

515
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,876
You think Ari looked sweet
when he shot Kate?

516
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,636
Of course not, boss.

517
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,922
My vote is for the Tango
or Bravo 51 s.

518
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,839
What do you think, Gibbs?

519
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:58,441
Your test rounds
show more gouging than Ari's.

520
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,320
He was hand loading
and moly coating.

521
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:02,876
You are so good.

522
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,317
- ''Moly coating''?
- Yeah.

523
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:07,518
Molybdenum disulfide.
lt's a lubricant.

524
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,643
lt decreases barrel wear
and increases accuracy.

525
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,805
McGee, run a trace
on Tango and Bravo 51 sales.

526
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,645
Last six weeks. Tri-state area.

527
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:17,284
- Check the Bravo first.
- On it, boss.

528
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,477
Any prints on the brass?

529
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,200
No.

530
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,796
ls your gut telling you something?

531
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,358
Yeah. l need coffee.

532
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:30,445
No, Gibbs. Come on.

533
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,802
This isn't just another investigation.

534
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,521
Todd was your agent,
but Kate was my friend.

535
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,922
So can you stop it
with the John Wayne stare

536
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,925
- and tell me what your gut says?
- What don't l believe in, Abby?

537
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,967
UFOs, mystics, coincidence,

538
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,965
saying you're sorry, excuses.
l could go on all night.

539
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:52,957
As a Marine sniper, l used
hand-loaded Lapua .308 boat-tail

540
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,846
full metal jacket,
moly-coated bullets.

541
00:36:57,287 --> 00:36:58,561
Gibbs.

542
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,327
You know what a sniper calls
a Bravo 51 ?

543
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,360
No.

544
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,885
A Kate.

545
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:36,197
My shoulder hurts
when it rains, too, Gerald.

546
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,844
Good night, Kate.

547
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:51,721
<i>Autopsy.</i>

548
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,395
Hello, Dr. Mallard.

549
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,837
Gerald.
How are you, my dear fellow?

550
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,761
l've been better.

551
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,805
- Oh, what's wrong?
- <i>He's having flashbacks.</i>

552
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,842
- Well, who are you?
- <i>Oh, l'm hurt.</i>

553
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,765
<i>You don't recognise my voice?</i>

554
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,326
You bastard.

555
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,286
You do remember me.

556
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:12,960
lf you harm Gerald--

557
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:15,721
<i>l have no intention</i>
<i>of harming Gerald.</i>

558
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,923
l think one ruined shoulder
is enough.

559
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:19,355
lt certainly is for me.

560
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:21,476
<i>What do you want?</i>

561
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:25,561
A professional courtesy,
one doctor to another.

562
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:29,282
Yes, well, l'd be most willing
to provide a free autopsy.

563
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:35,838
Dr. Mallard,
l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin.

564
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,162
By taking Gerald hostage?

565
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:40,086
<i>Gerald is free to go if you'll listen</i>

566
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:43,398
- <i>to my side of this tragedy.</i>
- l'm listening.

567
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:47,441
lt's a long story and l'd hate
to have somebody trace this call.

568
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:49,279
<i>Well, no one is here but me.</i>

569
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,521
And Caitlin.

570
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,560
<i>lt must have been</i>
<i>a difficult autopsy for you.</i>

571
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,399
l'm truly sorry, doctor.

572
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:57,841
Will you get on with it?

573
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,317
Will you meet me alone?

574
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:01,602
What happens to Gerald?

575
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:04,487
Come alone
and you can exchange places.

576
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,126
Doctor, don't come. He'll kill you.

577
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,279
<i>Learn to trust, Gerald.</i>

578
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,479
l may have shot you in the shoulder.

579
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:16,356
<i>But l've never lied to you. Doctor?</i>

580
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:17,921
You have my word.

581
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:19,802
Thank you.

582
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,446
Re-evaluating your convictions?

583
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,596
How many times did you tell me there's
no such thing as a coincidence?

584
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,482
Jethro?

585
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:41,045
l know it's been a difficult day
for both of us.

586
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,002
That's what my Dl used to say.

587
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:47,155
Never believed him.

588
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:52,686
Jen...

589
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:57,835
Are you going to dinner with CBS?

590
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,639
l am.

591
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:04,118
Don't do that interview.

592
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,606
Please.

593
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,882
l'll see if l can delay it a few days.

594
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,526
Good.

595
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,205
Good night, Jethro.

596
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,846
Night.

597
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:38,002
Ducky. How nice to see you again.

598
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,998
And you. Congratulations.

599
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,364
- Going home?
- Yes.

600
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:44,642
Ducky.

601
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,523
So are you back at work, Gerald?

602
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,645
Next week.

603
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:01,362
l've always found
that work is the best--

604
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:10,717
A vintage Morgan.

605
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,206
How Ducky.

606
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,122
Flash your lights.

607
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,758
Roll down your window.

608
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:29,880
Now wait in the good doctor's car
while we talk.
