1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,068
So, what do you think?

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,226
Not bad, l suppose.

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,427
''Not bad,'' she says as she walks in
from the outdoor patio,

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,146
past the fax machine and the minibar,
complimentary basket of fruit.

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,069
This is the perfect way to spend
a weekend.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,828
Come on. Big-screen TV.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,419
Two hundred channels.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,543
Look at this.
HBO, ESPN, The History Channel.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,025
Turner Classic Movies.

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,739
l take it you're not interested
in the premium channels?

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,022
There's only one thing
l'm interested in right now.

12
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,099
- Do you think they bought it?
- l did.

13
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,466
- That's fairly obvious.
- For your information, that's my knee.

14
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,059
Whatever.
You can get off of me now.

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,945
lt's only been ten minutes.
l have a reputation to protect.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,539
We're not even sure
if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.

17
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,940
You can't be too careful
when you're undercover.

18
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,505
Let's give it another 40 minutes,
just to be realistic.

19
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,905
Realistic, huh?

20
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,659
ln that case...

21
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,950
- ...l'll just ride on top.
- l can live with that.

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,619
- What was that for?
- Because that

23
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,390
was definitely not your knee.

24
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,106
Oh, she's very beautiful, Jethro.

25
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,500
Her name's Sophie Ranier.

26
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,900
She's murdered
over 25 people, Duck.

27
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,748
And her friend?

28
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,465
Her husband. Jean-Paul Ranier.

29
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,264
Both Canadian citizens,
both contract assassins.

30
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,540
She suffered extensive injuries.

31
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,180
lt may take quite a while
to determine the actual cause of death.

32
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,227
They were killed in a car accident
two days ago

33
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,982
outside of Kuwait lnternational Airport.

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,500
- Here's the accident report.
- l'm assuming this is urgent.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,429
l've waited three months
to see <i>Giselle</i>.

36
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,342
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend,
Duck.

37
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,546
- But l do need you to--
- <i>Giselle</i>'s a ballet.

38
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,628
You really should get out
of your basement more, Jethro.

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,384
We need to know everything we can
about these two, Ducky.

40
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,104
Why is NClS investigating this?

41
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,143
Marine ClD found
two fake U.S. passports

42
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,904
and two first-class tickets
for Washington, D.C. in their luggage.

43
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,459
They have reservations at the Barclay
through November 1 0th.

44
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,950
- Marine Corps Birthday.
- They're holding the ball there.

45
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,220
Hosted by the commandant
of the Marine Corps.

46
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,301
Our top military leaders,
congressmen

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,780
and agency directors will be there,
including me.

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,340
Tony and Ziva have taken
their room reservations at the Barclay.

49
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,223
They're there now
pretending to be these two.

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,820
- They're working blind, Duck.
- We're counting on you

51
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,904
to fill them in on some of the more
personal details of our couple.

52
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,466
Oh, though it may be common
knowledge that l talk to my patients,

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,543
unfortunately, to date, none of them
have ever answered me back.

54
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,507
Listen harder.

55
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,828
Sweetheart, you know
what l could really use right now?

56
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,542
Some deodorant?

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,829
l was thinking more along the lines
of a back massage.

58
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,309
Good idea.

59
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,820
Why don't you roll over
like a good boy.

60
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,109
Oh, wow.

61
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,303
Oh, and to think my mother thought
l was too good for you.

62
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,779
What'd l miss?

63
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,509
They had sex.

64
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,907
- Did they have contact with anyone?
- Just each other.

65
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,106
Multiple times.

66
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,786
Was it good for you?

67
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,022
Wait.
Someone's knocking at their door.

68
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,704
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- <i>Room service.</i>

69
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,906
Room service.

70
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,304
Compliments
of the hotel management.

71
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,269
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room
for bugs and place some of our own.

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,904
And he also wants to talk to you.

73
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,706
You can put it over there, please.

74
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,502
Very good, ma'am.

75
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,504
Garçon, we'd like
some extra bath towels.

76
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,902
<i>Of course.</i>

77
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,981
Just checking to make sure
everything's in order.

78
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,669
Would you like me to have the maid
make up the bed for you, sir?

79
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,390
Oh, that won't be necessary.

80
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,148
<i>Oh, and will you check the minibar?</i>
<i>We'd like it restocked with Red Bull.</i>

81
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,749
Red Bull.

82
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,340
- That'll keep you up all night, ma'am.
- Exactly.

83
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,903
Please accept this assortment of
cheeses compliments of the hotel.

84
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,902
- What's wrong?
- Room service put a tray

85
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,345
- on our microphone.
- Well, you know what that means.

86
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,585
We're screwed?

87
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,709
Nope.

88
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,100
You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.

89
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,819
lf you whisper, it should be okay.

90
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,464
- Comfortable, DiNozzo?
- <i>Well, yeah.</i>

91
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,223
<i>l'm working on it.</i>
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

92
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,460
<i>We're looking at you,</i>
<i>Agent DiNozzo.</i>

93
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,022
All of you.

94
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,466
- Sorry about that.
- <i>DiNozzo.</i>

95
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,065
What the hell are you doing?
You're married assassins.

96
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,027
You're not visiting
the Playboy mansion.

97
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,186
<i>lt was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.</i>

98
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,986
- lncoming call.
- Have her answer it.

99
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,982
Sweet cheeks, do you think you could
go over and answer the phone for me

100
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,788
while l pour us some champagne?

101
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,108
Thanks, honey.

102
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,828
Yes.

103
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,544
There's a cell phone
in the Bible next to your bed.

104
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,623
Got it.

105
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,865
Keep it with you at all times.

106
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,147
You have dinner reservations
at the hotel dining room at 9:00.

107
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,782
Don't be late.

108
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,019
The concierge.

109
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,865
We were able to get
into the dining room after all, my love.

110
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,458
lt looks like l'm getting dressed up
for you tonight.

111
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,103
That wasn't the concierge.
That was their contact.

112
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,028
We're on the move.

113
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,822
Let's go. We've gotta get dressed
for dinner.

114
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,059
l'm coming.

115
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,061
Don't look at me that way, Gibbs.

116
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,989
l was at league night
when l got your 91 1 .

117
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,624
l was two frames away
from a perfect score.

118
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,259
And just for the record,
the stupid outfits were not my idea.

119
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,261
- l like it.
- lt is kind of cute, huh?

120
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,785
No sign of Mr. Palmer, l suppose.

121
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,022
- Not since this afternoon, Ducky.
- Abs, these are their personal effects.

122
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,259
Get yourself wired

123
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,786
so you can feed whatever you find
directly to DiNozzo and David.

124
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,147
- Looking for anything in particular?
- Anything that will help those two

125
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,988
act like them.

126
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,024
- Solid on the visuals, Tony.
- There's quite a crowd here tonight.

127
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,500
- See anyone you know?
- Not yet.

128
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,270
But the night's just getting started,
my little hairy butt.

129
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,906
- Abs?
- l'm loading the photos.

130
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,623
Any scoop
for our married couple?

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,465
l have the breakdown of the contents
of their stomachs and intestines.

132
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,905
lf Mr. Ranier had lived,
l would have suggested

133
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,583
a more fibre-rich diet.

134
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,987
<i>His colon was almost impacted</i>
<i>with faecal material.</i>

135
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,662
Do you think it's too late
to order a salad?

136
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,030
Good evening, table for two?

137
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,226
l believe our food is here now.

138
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,143
McGee, report.

139
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,580
l've got the restaurant
covered from the entrance, boss.

140
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,387
l'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.

141
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,506
Tony, the calluses
on Mr. Ranier's hand,

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,588
- <i>suggest he was left-handed.</i>
- <i>Switch hands, DiNozzo.</i>

143
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,508
This is nice, isn't it?

144
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,068
Yeah, a quiet little dinner,
just the six of us.

145
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,385
Our friend is calling.

146
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,987
- Abs, l want that number.
- Got it.

147
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,221
Starting the reverse search
directory now.

148
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,943
l'm glad you called.

149
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,061
We were getting bored.

150
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,864
l thought it would help
to see your target in person tonight.

151
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,866
- He's here?
- <i>You don't see him?</i>

152
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,863
Relax, l've been flying
for over 20 hours.

153
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,868
<i>And the restaurant's packed.</i>
<i>We will.</i>

154
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,708
- Talk to me, Abs.
- From a pay phone. Address coming.

155
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,907
You didn't mention anything about
being surrounded by U.S. Marines.

156
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,905
<i>lt's too dangerous</i>
<i>for the sum you're paying us.</i>

157
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,340
Accomplish your mission,
we'll discuss more.

158
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,939
But you won't pay us more.

159
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,230
Got it. 2205 M Street.

160
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,466
He's calling from a pay phone
inside the restaurant.

161
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,302
- <i>DiNozzo. McGee.</i>
- Already moving.

162
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,949
l have to go
to the little boys' room.

163
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,468
- l have to talk to my boss.
- Do that.

164
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,944
We'll wait for you to--

165
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,462
He hung up.

166
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,427
Don't move. Federal agent.

167
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,864
lt's me, probie. He's gone.

168
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,428
Must've slipped out
through the kitchen.

169
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,103
<i>l didn't even get a look.</i>

170
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,743
You want us back
in the squad room?

171
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,982
No. l want you and Ziva back
in your room, maintaining your cover.

172
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,699
Oh, all night?

173
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,980
Do l stutter or something, DiNozzo?

174
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,547
Afraid l'll bite, Tony?

175
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,702
The name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.

176
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,468
Jean-Paul.

177
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,261
- Hey, Abs, what do you got?
- l have a ''whoopee''

178
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,142
- and l have a but.
- Abby--

179
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,541
l've got a photo of the man that Tony
and Ziva are gonna assassinate.

180
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,667
- But?
- But...

181
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,589
...l have no idea
which of these 32 photos is him.

182
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,186
What makes you think
the target's a male?

183
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,699
- Did you forget l'll be there?
- Nope.

184
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,539
Whoever set up the hit referred
to the collar as a man.

185
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,423
- You've made contact.
- Ziva got a pay-phone call.

186
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,427
You trace it?

187
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,305
Why didn't l think of that?

188
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,346
Sorry, Jethro. l'm a little tired.

189
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,026
Yeah, well, you never
could pace yourself very well.

190
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,700
l have one word for you, Jethro.

191
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,539
- Positano.
- Come on.

192
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,270
That was a week
after l took a bullet.

193
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,780
- Where did the call originate?
- Pay phone in the hotel.

194
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,542
We got there. The guy was gone.

195
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,945
At least we know he's
keeping tabs on the operation.

196
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,147
Abby's matching these photos
with reservations in the restaurant.

197
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,699
She'll check the names
against invites to the ball.

198
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,309
lt'll narrow the target.

199
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,501
What if the hit has nothing to do
with the ball?

200
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,423
- Someone who's a guest at the hotel?
- Ziva told him

201
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,741
she didn't know the target
would be surrounded by Marines.

202
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,544
- And he wasn't surprised?
- No.

203
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,107
Hey, nothing's gonna happen tonight.

204
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,349
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack.

205
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,700
All the backup teams are in place
around the hotel.

206
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,703
Why don't you go grab 40
on the couch in your office.

207
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,344
No. l just need a little coffee.

208
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,547
Yeah?
And when the caffeine jolt ends?

209
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,428
l'll do what you do.

210
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,144
- Get a refill.
- You're not me.

211
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,229
- Chauvinist.
- Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,259
l guess. Good night, Jen.

213
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,541
Jethro.

214
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,630
l need to bounce something off you.

215
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,181
Okay, shoot.

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,548
My director side is telling me
to flood that hotel with security

217
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,146
and notify the FBl
of a potential terrorist attack.

218
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,386
My agent side?

219
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,627
lf l do that, we lose the chance
to take down an enemy cell

220
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,667
operating inside the Capitol.

221
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,781
They'll scatter.

222
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,825
Of course, you'd stay the course.

223
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,543
Trust your people
to get the job done.

224
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,105
Are you telling me what l'd do?

225
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,669
Asking.

226
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,429
lf l was director,
l'd give my people another 24.

227
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,343
They can't get the job done,
l'd notify the FBl.

228
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,342
You'd really do that?

229
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,463
Nah.

230
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,345
But that's why l'll never be director.

231
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,340
The man snores
like a drunken sailor.

232
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,228
Well, we won't have to listen
much longer.

233
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,990
They saw their target at the restaurant.
We're on plan.

234
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,588
l watched the videotape
of their session this afternoon, Maya.

235
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,860
lt's pretty hot stuff.

236
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,300
Those two really know
how to live their life.

237
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,228
You...

238
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,586
- ...ever think about that maybe--
- Forget it.

239
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,624
We're here on a mission, period.
You want something more than coffee,

240
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,429
call room service.

241
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,144
Oh, my God.

242
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,062
Ziva.

243
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,460
Come on, you're killing me here.

244
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,062
Sophie.

245
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,509
- What?
- Nothing. l thought l heard something.

246
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,987
Crazy chick.

247
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,821
l heard that, my little hairy butt.

248
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,381
Good morning, boss.

249
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,068
Thank you.

250
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,708
Hey, boss, this was sitting
on my front porch this morning.

251
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,102
- What is it?
- lt's a package addressed to Ziva.

252
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,989
Well, yeah. l can see that, McGee.
What is in it?

253
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,546
l wasn't sure if l should open it.

254
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,585
That's probably why
she's using you as her mule.

255
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,824
Sunglasses?

256
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,338
With different lenses?

257
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,305
Why?

258
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,579
To protect her eyes?

259
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,423
l'll ask her. l'll find out.

260
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,899
Yeah, good idea, McGee.

261
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,021
Send their wake-up call.

262
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,383
<i>Tony.</i>

263
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,661
<i>Hey, DiNozzo.</i>

264
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,947
Tony.

265
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,589
This is great.

266
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,781
They're sleeping in a five-star hotel.
l'm a waiter.

267
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,867
<i>Want to trade places, McGee?</i>

268
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,349
You're awake.

269
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,820
Since 05.

270
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,067
- He snores.
- l got a package here for you.

271
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,464
<i>My shades.</i>

272
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,663
Can you bring them up
with breakfast?

273
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,940
Sure. Gibbs wants Tony up too.

274
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,988
My pleasure.

275
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,939
Jean-Paul, my little furry bear.

276
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,706
- Wake up, <i>chéri.</i>
- Name and position, boss.

277
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,622
Make the stitches precise,
Mr. Palmer.

278
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,219
- Yes, doctor.
- And when you're done,

279
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,382
l want the supply locker
inventoried and cleaned.

280
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,104
l actually already did that, doctor.

281
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,943
- Then do it again.
- What have we found out, Duck?

282
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,825
That my assistant, Mr. Palmer here,
should keep his cell phone with him

283
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,742
and turned on at all times.

284
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,946
What can you tell me
about our assassins?

285
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,783
Oh, Mr. Ranier here
had his appendix removed.

286
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,062
Mrs. had her left wrist broken
as a child.

287
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,860
We did, however,
find some rather curious markings.

288
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,705
- Markings?
- Tattoos might be more appropriate.

289
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,787
Almost invisible to the naked eye.

290
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,867
On the inside of the fourth digit
of both of their left hands.

291
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,664
- An eight?
- Or the sign for infinity.

292
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,502
Some kind of terrorist cell lD?

293
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,147
On their ring fingers,
perhaps it means love forever.

294
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,262
You know, l want to take another look
at the x-rays,

295
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,943
make sure
l didn't miss anything else.

296
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,742
Yeah, do it.

297
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,264
You missed a stitch there, Palmer.

298
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,460
We really should take you
to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.

299
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,144
Why's that?

300
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,499
Because you snore
like a drunken sailor with emphysema.

301
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,586
Look who's calling the pot black.

302
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,903
Kettle. The pot
is calling the kettle black.

303
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,069
l'd really like some music.

304
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,866
Something with a little beat, dear.

305
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,388
Sorry.

306
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,825
- What have we got?
- Sneaky people.

307
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,427
<i>Top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs.</i>

308
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,427
<i>They have a laser</i>
<i>trained on our room.</i>

309
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,626
l can't believe
that your sunglasses can detect

310
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,143
different light spectrums. Amazing.

311
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,868
We're going to need
a diversion.

312
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,067
- <i>l think we can manage something,</i>
- Let's roll, McGee.

313
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,104
''Ziva, that is amazing.''

314
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,022
Big whoop, she has spy glasses.

315
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,862
Anyone could do that.
That's not amazing.

316
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,986
- She's just--
- <i>You realise we can still hear you,</i>

317
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,623
<i>right, Abby?</i>

318
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,185
l think l'm gonna need
a cold shower after this.

319
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,267
Disgusting.

320
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,506
Give me those binoculars.

321
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,703
l don't know how much longer

322
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,430
- l can keep this up.
- Ninety-six,

323
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,985
97, 98--

324
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,467
We're in position, DiNozzo.

325
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,739
Give it the big finish.

326
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,067
We could make a fortune
with this off the lnternet.

327
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,228
They're serial killers, Yussif.
l wouldn't recommend trying.

328
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,101
- FBl, freeze!
- Put them down!

329
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,139
<i>What's this all about?</i>

330
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,390
l have a whole new respect for NClS,
Agent McGee.

331
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,024
- You guys are hard-core.
- We got lucky.

332
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,540
lt was actually the trained laser
on the room that gave you away.

333
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,947
We were talking about your agents
pretending to be married assassins.

334
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,141
- Very convincing.
- l don't think anyone in the FBl

335
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,778
would actually go all the way
just to sell a cover story.

336
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,379
- l would.
- Guys, they were acting.

337
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,943
Trust me.

338
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,061
l know when someone's acting
when they're having sex.

339
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,261
lt's true. l've met his wife.

340
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,261
Tony and Ziva wouldn't--

341
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,267
<i>lt's unusual for a man</i>
<i>to like love stories.</i>

342
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,025
How do l explain
to the director of the FBl

343
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,784
that we're running an undercover op
in his jurisdiction

344
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,464
- without informing him?
- With a smile.

345
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,501
lt's not funny, Gibbs.

346
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,508
They had intel the two assassins
were going to hit a target

347
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,827
at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
Did you get that memo?

348
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,263
No.

349
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,068
Why didn't l think of that?

350
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,181
Because you're exhausted.

351
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,547
l told you get some sleep,

352
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,305
and do that before you take on
the director of the FBl.

353
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,024
- l can't, Jethro.
- l can fix this.

354
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,983
- How?
- You're not the only one around here

355
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,583
who knows how to play politics.

356
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,901
You're not serious?

357
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,669
Your idea of politics usually involves
some form of physical violence.

358
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,868
Well, you know what they say, Jen.

359
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,101
You can't make an omelette
unless you break a few eggs.

360
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,061
- Are we free to go now?
- Not yet.

361
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,870
- What is NClS doing at the Barclay?
- Our job, Fornell.

362
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,630
Yeah? That involve
jeopardising our operation?

363
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,060
You're damn lucky
we didn't blow these two away.

364
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,461
Which wouldn't have happened if
you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction.

365
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,304
- Conference room. Now. Really?
- So anxious to play with the big boys.

366
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,944
- Big boys, my ass.
- Yeah, this is gonna be ugly.

367
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,500
Oh, yeah.
Fornell hasn't been this upset since--

368
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,541
The last time we saw him.

369
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,899
Gum?

370
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,025
''The big boys''?

371
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,867
- We really screwed this one up.
- Oh, you think, Tobias?

372
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,469
The question is, how do we fix it

373
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,667
without our directors getting
into a world-class pissing match?

374
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,826
- Joint op.
- Whose lead?

375
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,618
My team's already in place.

376
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,139
- Did you find out who hired them?
- Not yet. Working on it.

377
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,949
l need more than that in my tap dance
at the Hoover Building.

378
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,629
Give us 24 hours, then we flip.

379
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,907
- FBl gets operational control?
- Yeah, and credit for the collar.

380
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,022
Agreed. The directors
get to save face and we--

381
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,021
Get the job done.

382
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,182
- And people say we're bastards?
- Only because they know us.

383
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,021
l've got the lDs on the people
in the restaurant

384
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,782
with invites to the Marine Corps Ball.

385
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,629
- Abby. Sorry.
- Make sure Tony and Ziva get them.

386
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,746
Okay, should l also check
the restaurant staff too?

387
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,820
lnternational assassins hired
to take out a waiter.

388
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,225
- l was just trying to be thorough.
- No.

389
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,148
lt's good. Good instincts, Chip.
Run them.

390
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,743
Okay.

391
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,944
Abby, can l ask you a question?

392
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,708
Yes.

393
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,299
Why don't you like Officer David?

394
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,429
What makes you think
l don't like her?

395
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,143
l found this.

396
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,903
That.

397
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,578
Oh, l understand.
l have the same problem with DiNozzo.

398
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,066
Tony is a great guy.
You just have to get to know him.

399
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,148
Yeah, well, you don't know him
like l do.

400
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,380
He gives new people grief,
he learned that from Gibbs.

401
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,541
Okay, quiz time.

402
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,344
What's your take
on Sophie Ranier's blood test?

403
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,185
Well, she's got elevated levels
of human chorionic gonadotropin.

404
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,261
- Which means?
- She's pregnant?

405
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,586
- Good, Chip. She's pregnant.
- Who's pregnant?

406
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,988
Ziva. l mean, not ''Ziva'' Ziva,
but Sophie Ranier, our dead hit girl.

407
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,061
She's got a bun in the oven.

408
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,708
Like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?

409
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,549
The room's clean except
for the listening devices we installed.

410
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,419
- We're free to talk.
- Yeah, so

411
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,462
you're the one
who's been watching us?

412
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,023
Oh, yeah.

413
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,949
When this is over,
we really should go out for drinks.

414
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,265
l'd like that.

415
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,425
l'm pregnant, Tony.

416
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,946
Maybe some other time.

417
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,902
She was-- She was kidding.

418
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,185
Something wrong?

419
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,029
- Thanks.
- She's really not your type anyway.

420
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,586
Hot and in a maid's outfit?
They don't get any more my type.

421
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,501
He's learning.

422
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,864
Number's blocked.

423
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,063
Talk to me.

424
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,103
l've been told to negotiate a price
commensurate with the risk.

425
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,140
- l'm listening.
- <i>Not on the phone.</i>

426
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,187
<i>Be in the lobby in exactly one hour.</i>

427
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,062
A black Lincoln
will be waiting out front.

428
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,704
Make sure you're not followed.

429
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,304
- ln position, boss.
- Your people set, Tobias?

430
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,102
Got four unmarked vehicles
standing by.

431
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,703
We'll follow them wherever they go.

432
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,821
Tony, Ziva, get ready to roll.

433
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,988
- Hour's almost up.
- Roger that, boss.

434
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,146
You haven't fired your weapon,
so it's already clean.

435
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,142
lt calms my mind.

436
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,466
Forces me to stay focused
at the job in my hand.

437
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,059
- The term's job at hand.
- Same difference.

438
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,469
ls something wrong?

439
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,069
Trying to picture you pregnant.

440
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,067
- Don't.
- l have to.

441
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,425
l'm gonna be a father.

442
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,705
lt's a great responsibility.

443
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,022
- Maybe it's not yours.
- Maybe she didn't know.

444
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,504
Oh, she knew.

445
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,902
So why take this contract,
put our unborn child in danger?

446
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,702
Perhaps we needed the money.

447
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,539
- Kids are expensive.
- Bullets are cheap.

448
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,941
There's a big chance this meeting
is a setup, Tony.

449
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,538
Are you scared?

450
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,901
Nope. Excited.

451
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,263
- No sign of the Lincoln yet.
- <i>That's a solid copy, McGee.</i>

452
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,501
We're sending them down.
All mobile units,

453
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,422
prepare to roll on my mark.

454
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,025
This reminds me of our op
in the former Czech Republic.

455
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,110
You took a round in the thigh.

456
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,467
l had the same bad feeling
before that op too.

457
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,621
We're on our way to the elevator,
boss.

458
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,427
Tony, Ziva. We're not taking
any chances on this one.

459
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,461
First sign it goes bad, you call it.

460
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,149
Hold the door.

461
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,662
- Thanks.
- Sure.

462
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,747
Sweetheart.

463
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,746
- Okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
- Yeah, l got a visual on that, McGee.

464
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,782
l got a match. Abby.

465
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,348
A man and a woman just got out.

466
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,585
Heading into the hotel.

467
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,628
- <i>Car's leaving.</i>
- l can see that, McGee.

468
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,509
- All units, hold your positions.
- That's not our Lincoln.

469
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,581
- The waiter's got a warrant on him.
- For what?

470
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,183
Murder.

471
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,659
You're getting off here.

472
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,381
Not a wise choice,
Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.

473
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,584
Weapons.

474
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,866
We would have come
to the third floor ourselves.

475
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,220
Three armed escorts
seems a bit excessive.

476
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,982
Very good.

477
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,500
Our location
and our number in two sentences.

478
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,820
lt's too bad
your friends can't hear you.

479
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,067
- You're being jammed.
- Bring them to my room.

480
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,942
lf they resist...

481
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,898
...shoot the woman.

482
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,179
Come on, let's go.

483
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,626
Tony, Ziva, do you copy?

484
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,988
DiNozzo. l said, do you copy?

485
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,140
McGee.
What the hell is going on there?

486
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,106
<i>Boss, they're not in their room.</i>
<i>They never arrived in the lobby.</i>

487
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,541
My teams have the entire outside
covered. They didn't leave the hotel.

488
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,907
Last contact was at the elevator. That's
1 1 floors they could've gotten off at.

489
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,789
Eleven floors, McGee.
How many rooms are we looking at?

490
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,902
<i>Well, if we don't count</i>
<i>individual bathrooms</i>

491
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,543
- <i>and closets</i>--
- McGee.

492
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,139
<i>Two hundred and sixty-four</i>
<i>hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms</i>.

493
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,982
They haven't checked in
because they can't.

494
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,549
They're at the meet right now?

495
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,662
They removed their earwigs
and they dumped their comm

496
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,060
- when it was changed to the hotel.
- We go room by room.

497
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,228
- My people seal off the exterior.
- No. We wait.

498
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,705
- What for?
- For Ziva to contact us.

499
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,383
We move now, we blow their cover.

500
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,461
And if their cover is already blown,
director?

501
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,621
There are two things

502
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,025
you should be painfully aware of
right now.

503
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,503
One,

504
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,902
no one leaves this business.

505
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,664
And two,

506
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,861
never threaten the people
who employ you.

507
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,503
Should l be writing this down?

508
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,908
l take that as a no.

509
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,628
- Where is the disk?
- What disk?

510
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,582
Where, Mrs. Ranier?

511
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,942
What makes you think we have it?

512
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,539
We spotted your backup
at the restaurant.

513
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,940
On some level, you must've known
this was gonna happen.

514
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,823
Observant.

515
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,868
How much is our disk worth to you?

516
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,067
l have a better question.

517
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,380
- What's it worth to you?
- lt's bad, Gibbs. lt's very, very bad.

518
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,979
Remember when we missed
nabbing the guy in the restaurant?

519
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,703
Tony said he didn't see anything.

520
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,067
But the eye sees more than we think it
does. lt's the brain that misses stuff.

521
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,586
lt has to do with the firing of the
optic nerve and the visual cortex's--

522
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,303
You found something
from Tony's camera.

523
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,949
l went through the feed
frame by frame.

524
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,902
Tony is looking at the pay phone

525
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,867
because that's where he thinks
the target is.

526
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,106
But a camera doesn't think.
lt just records.

527
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,504
So when he runs past the kitchen door
of the restaurant, he got this.

528
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,699
- Our bad guy. Run it. l want a name.
- l do. l did.

529
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,825
Marcos Siazon.
He's a contract assassin, Gibbs.

530
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,588
He's wanted
in more than five countries.

531
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,143
lt doesn't make any sense.

532
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,706
Why would a killer hire other killers
to do a hit for him?

533
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,900
Out of professional courtesy

534
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,710
l've had Mr. Cord
go lightly on your husband.

535
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,267
And l appreciate that.

536
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,500
Unfortunately,
we're running out of time.

537
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,385
lf you let him go,
l'll tell you where the disk is.

538
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,705
You'll tell me either way,
Mrs. Ranier.

539
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,106
Why don't you two take a moment.

540
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,468
Consider your options.

541
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,628
- l might have a plan.
- What?

542
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,661
The Raniers obviously stole something
they want.

543
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,219
- You're gonna give it to them.
- We don't have it.

544
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,142
You're gonna tell them
it's in our hotel room.

545
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,306
The only way they'll find it
is if you show them.

546
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,143
McGee should be waiting for us
in there.

547
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,461
Good plan,
except for one minor drawback.

548
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,739
What?

549
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,307
When l leave, they'll most likely
put a bullet through your head.

550
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:58,624
Oh, well, l didn't say
it was a perfect plan.

551
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:07,347
Two centimetres below
the supraorbital notch.

552
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,268
What do you make of it,
Mr. Palmer?

553
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,940
l originally assumed
it was a spec of dirt on the exposure.

554
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,381
- lt appears to be a heart?
- Yes.

555
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,066
A strange place to find one.

556
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,107
Don't you agree?

557
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,460
lt appears to be gold,
surgically embedded

558
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,461
in the conjunctival layer.

559
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,905
Perhaps some type of body jewellery.

560
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,340
Jewellery embedded in an eye.

561
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,189
Oh, yes. You'd be amazed
what people do to themselves.

562
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,346
To Abby, please.

563
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,260
You know,
l doubt anyone would notice

564
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,099
your little gold heart
unless they knew it was there.

565
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,349
Staring into your eyes,
face to face

566
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,821
like a lover.

567
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,459
l found a chip in it.

568
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,228
Flash memory
embedded underneath, sir.

569
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,103
Five hundred megabyte capacity.
Fifty MPS throughout.

570
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,788
Translation, it contains
the Raniers' personal data in two files.

571
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,901
One has a list
of numbered bank accounts,

572
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,664
a deed for a restaurant,
a house in Gilead, Maine.

573
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,905
We also ran the address.

574
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,709
The phone service and cable are
scheduled to be turned on next week.

575
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,229
Sounds like a retirement plan.

576
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,988
She was pregnant.
They were getting out.

577
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,618
- What about the other file?
- lt has a list of their clients.

578
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,549
Their names, addresses, phone
numbers, all their information.

579
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,945
- lnsurance policy?
- Their ticket out.

580
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,301
- They weren't hired to make a hit.
- They are the hit.

581
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,421
Did you know

582
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,309
the Peruvians make blades
so sharp

583
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,348
some people can't even feel
the initial incision?

584
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,268
Stop.

585
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,023
- The disk's in our hotel room.
- Don't.

586
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,623
- He'll only use it--
- Where?

587
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,544
She has to show you.

588
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,948
Not what l asked.

589
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,664
You'll never find it without her

590
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,143
even if you kill us.

591
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,425
Untie her.

592
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,502
- l'm in position.
- Clear the room.

593
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,548
- l'm on my way up with the girl.
- My pleasure.

594
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,503
Your only mistake
was going for one last big payday.

595
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,382
- You got greedy.
- l'm pregnant.

596
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,342
Really?

597
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,546
Congratulations.

598
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,259
Boy or girl?

599
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,142
l don't know.

600
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,058
We want to be surprised.

601
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,782
lt's the best way, believe me.

602
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,069
- How many months?
- Three.

603
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,823
- Morning sickness?
- Only every single day.

604
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,899
l hated to see my wife go through it.

605
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,949
But believe me,
it's all worth it in the end.

606
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,869
So you're not going to kill us?

607
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,740
We're assassins.

608
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,503
You know we can't just walk away
from the game when we feel like it.

609
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,302
Hell, don't you think

610
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,019
l'd rather be at
my daughter's 5th birthday than here?

611
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,103
So you are going to kill us? Right?

612
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,180
l haven't decided yet.

613
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,148
Give me the disk
and we'll see, play it by ear.

614
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,301
lf l'm not back in five minutes,

615
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,389
kill him.

616
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,709
That was purely
for your wife's cooperation.

617
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,944
We like to call them ''little white lies.''

618
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,938
Open it.

619
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,430
l hope you weren't counting
on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.

620
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,459
He's not my backup.

621
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,698
- Tony?
- Third floor, room 356.

622
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,346
All teams, third floor, room 356.

623
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,262
- Federal agent in distress.
- <i>We're moving.</i>

624
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,347
You know what's funny?

625
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,343
l was really looking forward
to having a kid there for a minute.

626
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,543
That's a big step for me.

627
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,820
Having a little DiNozzo
running around.

628
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,262
DiNozzo?

629
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:55,140
Yeah, that's my full name.
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NClS.

630
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,465
How does that feel, huh?

631
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,348
Huh, big guy?

632
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,506
- Enough.
- You want to punch me again?

633
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,787
- Come on.
- Enough, enough, Tony.

634
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,628
l think you made your point.

635
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,664
l want a divorce.

636
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,108
The emergency room
seems to have done a pretty good job.

637
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,700
- How do you feel?
- Better, now that l can breath.

638
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,219
There doesn't appear
to be any permanent damage.

639
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,943
How many times did he hit you?

640
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,220
- l wasn't counting.
- Seven times.

641
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,705
- She was, of course.
- lt was hard not to.

642
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,428
We're gonna take good care of you,
Tony.

643
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,660
l had Chip pull your car
right around front.

644
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,019
- He drove my car?
- Just from your parking space.

645
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,948
l took extra special care.

646
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,186
Oh, thanks.

647
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,665
- And l'm driving you home.
- Probie.

648
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,548
Ziva, actually you shouldn't
probably drive him home tonight.

649
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,910
- Why's that?
- Maybe he wants to live.

650
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:03,228
Yes, well, however, you get home,
l suggest a couple of aspirin,

651
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,227
yes, and perhaps some Scotch.

652
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,422
l thought doctors weren't supposed
to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.

653
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,860
Well, it always seems to work
for you.

654
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,220
Did you get tickets
to that gazelle thing again?

655
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,990
lt's <i>Giselle</i>, Jethro.
And no, that's not tonight.

656
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,543
Marine Corps Birthday Ball.

657
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,549
She didn't tell you?

658
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,583
Our lovely director
has asked me to escort her.

659
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,144
- All right.
- Good night, boss.

660
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,263
All right, l'm good.

661
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,741
Hey, Gibbs.

662
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,178
Happy birthday.

663
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,899
l miss you guys.

664
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,021
<i>Semper Fi.</i>
