1
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:06,256
Welcome to
the Smithsonian Anthropology lab.

2
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:10,501
l'm Dr. Elaine Burns, and you're
watching the Recovery Channel.

3
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:14,661
Tonight we'll be opening
a time capsule from the Civil War.

4
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:16,500
Lights, please.

5
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:21,134
This iron casket represents
one of America's first uses of rubber

6
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:24,931
in an industrial process,
sealing in the dead

7
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,292
from the ravages of weather
and time.

8
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:29,538
Now, what makes this one
particularly special

9
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,451
is that all of its seals
were found to be fully intact.

10
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,535
Gentlemen.

11
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,740
What we're hoping to find inside

12
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:45,133
are some of the best preserved
remains from the Civil War era.

13
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:48,576
This is unbelievable.

14
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:53,294
This type of preservation is unheard of
in a 1 40-year-old body.

15
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:55,413
Joe, we have a problem.

16
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,655
- Dr. Burns?
- Yes?

17
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:02,013
l don't think they carried those
in the Civil War.

18
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,494
l freaking hate Mondays.

19
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:08,175
Frigging Fat Al's
All-You-Can-Eat Burrito Shack.

20
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,221
More like Fat Al's bacteria shack.

21
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:16,934
Come on.

22
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:21,022
l shouldn't have come in to work today.
Gibbs sees me like this--

23
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:25,295
He'll probably be as horrified as l am,
Agent DiNozzo.

24
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:29,418
Working undercover as a hobo?

25
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:36,175
You mind telling me
what you're doing here again?

26
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,095
Waiting.

27
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,253
- For what?
- To start work.

28
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,852
Does everyone always come in
this late?

29
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,859
lt's 0700.

30
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,860
- At Mossad we start at 0500.
- Okay.

31
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:53,700
Let me rephrase
the original question.

32
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:56,491
What the hell are you doing here,
Ziva?

33
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,936
l see.

34
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:01,374
Gibbs didn't tell you.

35
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,776
Tell me what?

36
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,497
Mossad's assigned me to NClS
as a liaison officer.

37
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,818
We're gonna be working together.

38
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:12,779
- Does Gibbs know about this?
- Do you think l'd be here if he didn't?

39
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:22,612
You might want to do something
about your hair.

40
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:26,815
lt's sticking up like a porcu-swine.
Wrong word. Like a porcu-pig.

41
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,612
The little animal
with the little spikies, yes. The--

42
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,017
- Porcupine.
- Porcupine.

43
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:34,690
Thank you, Special Agent McGee.

44
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,376
Sure.

45
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:42,651
Anyone have a key for this?

46
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,380
That's Kate's desk.

47
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,494
Okay, but if l'm going to be a part
of your team l would love to--

48
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,852
Whoa. You're part of our team?

49
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:53,700
Yes.

50
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:56,612
- Did Gibbs tell you about this?
- Nope.

51
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,814
Here are my orders.

52
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,337
Signed by Director Shepard.

53
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:09,897
- You think Gibbs knows?
- l hope so.

54
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:12,093
All my personal possessions
are now being shipped

55
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,020
from Tel Aviv to Washington.

56
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:18,010
l'd hold off on unpacking
the waffle iron till you talk to him, Ziva.

57
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:21,134
- When's he come in?
- Now.

58
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:25,932
Special Agent Gibbs.

59
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,940
Ziva.

60
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,301
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:38,612
Looking forward to being a member
of your team.

62
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,498
l stand corrected.
lt appears he didn't know.

63
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,334
l feel like a donkey's butt.

64
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:59,140
- A donkey's butt?
- l think she meant horse's ass.

65
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,060
Yes, that too.

66
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:14,661
Something l can help you with
this morning, Special Agent Gibbs?

67
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:21,255
Yeah. l've got a personnel issue.
You know anything about that?

68
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,258
l take it Ziva arrived
a few days early?

69
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:31,457
Right. Before we get into this,
l'm gonna need a refill.

70
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:39,778
That was sweet,
not necessarily sanitary.

71
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,132
What is she doing here, Jen?

72
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,770
lf we're going to fight
a global war on terror

73
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,938
we need to work closely
with our allies.

74
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:49,292
Well, that sounds good.
Put her on somebody else's team.

75
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:50,981
l want her with you, Jethro.

76
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:54,891
Mossad trained her to spy and kill,
not to investigate crime scenes.

77
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,218
Send her to the ClA.

78
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:02,371
Just to be clear, this is not a request
or a debate, Agent Gibbs.

79
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:08,657
Anything else you wanna change
about my team while l'm here?

80
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,413
Look, if anything,
you're lucky to have her.

81
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:13,978
She's one of the finest agents
l worked with in Europe.

82
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:18,778
- Why didn't you ask me first, Jen?
- And what would you have said?

83
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,253
Exactly.

84
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:26,179
Number 1 8, it's better to seek
forgiveness than ask permission.

85
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:29,374
Oh, that's real nice. Using the rules
l taught you against me.

86
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,337
Nice touch.

87
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,854
l learned from the best, Jethro.
l want Ziva to as well.

88
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:44,940
You want something to read?

89
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,251
What do you have?

90
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,414
<i>GSM</i>. lt's a men's magazine.

91
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:59,212
Most women find it objectifies them.

92
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:08,334
l read it on the plane.
l especially like the article on page 57.

93
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:13,056
ln my experience,
it works every time.

94
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:20,018
l always thought
that was urban legend.

95
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:29,861
What's the verdict?

96
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,420
Pack your trash.

97
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,375
Not a problem.

98
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:40,453
Most of it doesn't arrive
till next week.

99
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:46,416
Nice seeing you again, Tony.

100
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,300
McGee.

101
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,535
l told you to pack your trash, Ziva.

102
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:09,530
l don't remember giving you
permission to leave yet.

103
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,773
- You requested this assignment?
- l did.

104
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,415
Why?

105
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:21,934
l had to get away from Mossad
for a while.

106
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,855
- You believe what Ari said?
- No.

107
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,220
Yes.

108
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,735
Maybe.

109
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,174
Your brother was a Svengali, Ziva.

110
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,295
Like father, like son.

111
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:40,539
- Does Mossad know you killed Ari?
- No. They believe your report.

112
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,178
Only you and l know the truth.

113
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:48,052
For that l thank you.

114
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,613
l trust you. You know that.

115
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:56,180
- But when we leave this elevator--
- You start kicking my butt.

116
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,692
l don't kick butt.

117
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,654
Ms. David will be with us for a while.

118
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:21,341
That's Kate's desk.

119
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,498
Yours is down at the end.

120
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,495
He's a tough one to read.

121
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,694
You'll find most NClS agents
are like that. lt's our training.

122
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,136
ls that a fact?

123
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:36,132
We never let other people
know what we're thinking.

124
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:40,292
Right now you're thinking
of doing page 57 with me.

125
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,370
Boss, we have a situation
at the Smithsonian Museum.

126
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:50,731
What?

127
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:54,014
Well, it's kind of complicated,
but there may have been a murder.

128
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:55,371
May have been, McGee?

129
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:58,221
Yeah, well, they have a Union soldier
who was dug up

130
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:01,732
from a battlefield in Manassas. Now
they think that he may be a Marine.

131
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,775
lt was the Civil War, McGee.
Marines fought on both sides.

132
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,019
l know. But this Marine had dog tags.
Didn't exist back then.

133
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,055
- You know that, being a Marine.
- Get to the point, McGee.

134
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,059
They think that this Marine
was killed recently

135
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:17,732
and somehow buried in a way--
They can't quite explain it,

136
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,775
but in a 1 40-year-old
cast-iron sarcophagus.

137
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,620
Dressed as a Union soldier?

138
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,296
Basically, yeah.

139
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,530
Gas the truck, McGee. DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss.

140
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,813
l've got a murder
in your area of expertise.

141
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,252
This happens a lot, me being
a Senior Field Agent and all.

142
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,100
l'm sure it does.

143
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,691
- What do we got? Multiple homicides?
- No.

144
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,540
- Gang related?
- No.

145
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:42,261
Defenestration?

146
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:44,535
The Civil War.

147
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:48,979
l can hardly wait.
lt's my favourite subject.

148
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:51,211
What about me?

149
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,418
You're coming along strictly
as an observer.

150
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,578
Hand over all your weapons.

151
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,300
ls that really necessary?

152
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:01,900
Right.

153
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:08,371
- Your backup.
- What backup?

154
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,055
Left leg.

155
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:11,901
That one.

156
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:19,816
And the knife
concealed at your waist.

157
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,139
You can keep this.

158
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:34,412
l just want you to know that l know.

159
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:37,701
According to his dog tags

160
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:41,736
this young man
is Warren Sorrow, USMC.

161
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,421
How long has he been in there?

162
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:49,821
He's remarkably well-preserved.
Could be months or even years.

163
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,820
We'll know more
when we get him home.

164
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:54,535
You know, in the 1 970s,

165
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:57,814
grave robbers raided
a Southern colonel's cast-iron casket.

166
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:01,535
They took his weapons, his jewellry,
and for some strange reason,

167
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:02,777
the poor man's head.

168
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:07,418
When the local authorities found
the 1 00-year-old decomposing corpse

169
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:10,415
they assumed
he was recently decapitated

170
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,533
and opened a murder investigation.

171
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:14,414
He's still got his head.
We're not local cops.

172
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:17,341
- l wanna know how he died.
- l can help with that.

173
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:22,293
Dr. Mallard.
Well, how nice to see you again.

174
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,618
Yes. lt is. How are you?

175
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:29,298
Dr. Elaine Burns. We met in Hawaii
almost 1 8 years ago.

176
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:34,617
The conference on identifying
POW remains in Vietnam?

177
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:38,132
Yes, of course.
How wonderful to see you again.

178
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:41,533
l still have that puka-shell necklace
you gave me.

179
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:46,372
Yes, quite the keepsake,
aren't they?

180
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,732
Do you have information
on how this man died?

181
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,621
Yes. We took the liberty
of imaging the corpse

182
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,216
before we knew for sure we were
dealing with an actual homicide

183
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,816
- and not just some sick hoax.
- You disturbed my crime scene?

184
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:00,101
As a forensic anthropologist,
l can assure you

185
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:03,419
my examination
was strictly non-invasive.

186
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,821
There. Now, l've seen several images
like this in the past,

187
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,774
but you can't be certain
until you get it out.

188
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:11,496
- Get what out?
- ln my opinion,

189
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,334
it's a musket ball.

190
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,099
l don't think this is what Gibbs
had in mind

191
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,735
when he instructed me to observe.

192
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,858
Do you have any idea
how many people get killed

193
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:30,700
in America by bears every year,
Ziva?

194
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,972
No, but l can't imagine a lot.

195
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:36,014
You'd be surprised.

196
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,701
McGee?

197
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:40,177
l think it's about one.

198
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,413
lsn't there something constructive
you could be doing?

199
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:45,938
- Like what?
- lnvestigating.

200
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,534
DiNozzo and McGee. Report in.

201
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,854
Casket was uncovered
by a housing project

202
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,292
going up near the Bull Run Battlefield
in Manassas, boss.

203
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,140
Got the name and address
of the company.

204
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,253
Scheduled an interview
and soil test for tomorrow.

205
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,413
The only thing removed
from the casket was a cell phone,

206
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,540
damaged and non-operational. l've also
got the prints of the lab workers

207
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:05,091
to run against any we find
in or around the body and tomb.

208
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,730
Dr. Burns was wearing surgical gloves
when she picked this up.

209
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,654
Good work. Ms. David?

210
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:15,093
l'm wondering why there's
a nine-millimetre hole in my hat.

211
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:17,258
Ventilation.

212
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,380
l'll escort the casket back with Ducky.
We'll meet in the squad room.

213
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,180
Agent Gibbs?

214
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:26,216
l would also like to know
if l could drive the truck back to base.

215
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:31,701
lt might make me feel as if l actually
accomplished something today.

216
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:35,655
- Hey, not so fast.
- l always drive fast.

217
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,854
lt's the best way to avoid
possible lEDs and ambushes.

218
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,851
You're in America now.
l wouldn't worry about it.

219
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,296
How about this?
Slow down or l'll puke on you.

220
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,415
Tony, why don't you like
the American Civil War?

221
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,295
- l don't want to talk about it.
- lt's because of his father.

222
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,820
Was she talking to you, probie?

223
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:59,300
Oh, you didn't get along
with your father. Explains a lot.

224
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:02,772
- My father and l got along fine.
- lf you say so.

225
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:05,934
l think it's best to talk about things
instead of burying them inside.

226
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:10,738
What about you? Your father?
Deputy Director David, what's he like?

227
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:15,500
Slow down.
We're taking the next left.

228
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:22,172
Ziva, car! Car! Car!

229
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:28,421
Ziva!

230
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,381
Sorry.

231
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:33,858
First time behind the wheel
after a six-month mission in the U.K.

232
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:38,372
l said l was sorry.

233
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,450
We ran his prints through AFlS.

234
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:45,257
lt is confirmed our Union soldier
is Staff Sergeant Warren Sorrow,

235
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,696
an MSG instructor in Quantico.

236
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,660
- MSG stands for--
- Marine Security Guard.

237
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:52,541
l've been to over two dozen embassies
around the world, Tony.

238
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,614
- What do we have on the sergeant?
- Reported UA about a year ago.

239
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,613
l'm currently building
a profile on his life

240
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,135
around the time
of his disappearance.

241
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,655
Not anymore. l want you with Abby.

242
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,978
Find out what was on the cell phone
we found in the casket.

243
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:05,815
You're on the paper trail.
l wanna know everything about him.

244
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,371
And you. You keep--

245
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:10,459
You keep observing.

246
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,941
What exactly, Gibbs?

247
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:16,451
l don't care. Just do it quietly.

248
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,340
Now l know why he took
all my weapons away.

249
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:27,858
Have you ever spent an evening
with a young lady

250
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:31,498
and failed to remember it,
Mr. Palmer?

251
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,420
Oh, what was l thinking?
Of course not.

252
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,221
But l wouldn't mind.

253
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:38,061
Well, it's not something
to be admired, Mr. Palmer.

254
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,414
That doctor today
at the Smithsonian

255
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:45,410
intimated that we shared
a special something in Hawaii

256
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:48,978
- during a conference once.
- Yeah, what doctor was that, doctor?

257
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,332
The young and attractive one.

258
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,180
Still not following you.

259
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:56,215
She was the only doctor there
beside myself.

260
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:58,652
- Oh, you mean Dr. Burns?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:01,290
Oh, l'm sorry. l thought that you said
she was young.

262
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,653
Young to me, Mr. Palmer.

263
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:06,293
Young to me.

264
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:12,701
Will you rotate the head 20 degrees
to the left?

265
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:17,258
She invited me out for cocktails
tomorrow evening.

266
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:20,420
- l was forced to decline.
- Why? She seemed nice.

267
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,931
Oh, she's more than nice.

268
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,058
But how do you tell a woman
that you have absolutely

269
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:28,254
no mental recollection of her
whatsoever?

270
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,855
l suppose one could always lie.

271
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:34,419
Have you been spending time
with Agent DiNozzo again?

272
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:44,015
- To Abby, please.
- Right away, doctor.

273
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:49,494
l don't suppose
you've ever been to Hawaii.

274
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:53,175
That should do it.

275
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,411
That's what you said
the last eight times.

276
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:59,261
See, that shows how much attention
you pay to me.

277
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:03,210
- lt was nine, Timmy.
- Right.

278
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,579
So did we do it? Did we do it?
Did we do it?

279
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:08,210
Did we fix the cell phone's
circuit board?

280
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:10,771
- Hold on.
- Come on.

281
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,535
You're killing me, McGee.

282
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,740
Yes. Yes, l think that we fixed it.

283
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,694
l think the circuits are--

284
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,772
How many Caf-Pow!s
you had today, Abby?

285
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:26,337
You know, the usual.

286
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,860
Trust me, you've had more
than the usual.

287
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,859
Because l'm getting jumpy
just looking at you.

288
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:35,658
Some people drown their sorrows
in drugs and alcohol. l prefer caffeine.

289
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:38,171
Now hook up the cell phone board
and get cracking

290
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,532
before Gibbs
decides to crack you one.

291
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:45,020
- You mean crack us.
- Gibbs would never hit a lady.

292
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:48,453
Exactly. So l suggest we get started.

293
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,898
- Ziva?
- Yes?

294
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,099
First of all, don't ever do that again.

295
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:07,131
And second, what are you doing?

296
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,412
l'm observing you, Tony.

297
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,931
Any way you can do that
in a less creepy manner?

298
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:18,452
Who's the woman with Gibbs?

299
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,578
Once you're here long enough,
you'll figure it out.

300
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,852
- ls that his girlfriend?
- l have no idea.

301
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,212
- You just told me that--
- Well--

302
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:28,892
You'll figure out there's some things
around here you don't ask about.

303
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,733
All right, then.

304
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:38,854
Bye.

305
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,013
- Where's Gibbs, Tony?
- Your 2 o'clock.

306
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:43,094
What's wrong, Duck?

307
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,174
l know how our staff sergeant died.

308
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:49,857
From your look l'm guessing
it wasn't a musket ball.

309
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,776
At first one could assume
that a projectile of such size and mass

310
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,098
would produce almost instant death,

311
00:19:56,622 --> 00:20:00,695
but pre-Civil War muskets
were notoriously unreliable

312
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:04,252
and lost most of their velocity
over the first hundred metres.

313
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:08,581
Our sergeant was grievously wounded
by a musket ball,

314
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:11,694
but his injury was not fatal.

315
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,211
Then how did he die, Dr. Mallard?

316
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:18,136
His lung tissue was coated
with an extremely fine film

317
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,862
of rust particles.

318
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,377
And one can only imagine
how long he clawed

319
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,056
at the iron sides of his casket,

320
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:31,657
trying to escape
before he suffocated.

321
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:44,500
A Marine dressed as a Civil War
soldier is shot by a musket

322
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:49,173
and then buried alive
in a 1 40-year-old antique iron casket.

323
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:54,094
And you're telling me
this isn't your strangest case?

324
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:56,981
- Yep.
- Pretty much.

325
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,661
l don't know what
l find more disturbing.

326
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,778
Your eating habits
or the fact that l believe you.

327
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:05,493
l'm sorry, do our strange
American foods frighten you?

328
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,297
Not at all.
l was referring to your manners.

329
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:11,180
You should have bought me one.

330
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,419
l'm gonna go help Abby.

331
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:22,621
She seems to be fitting in well.

332
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,938
She almost killed
my entire team yesterday.

333
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,815
- How?
- Driving home from a crime scene.

334
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,298
l should've warned you. l think
she was an East European cabdriver

335
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:35,418
- in a past life.
- Yeah, well, she wasn't a cop.

336
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,981
She obviously has no investigative
or law-enforcement experience, Jen.

337
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,615
Neither did l when l first started.

338
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:44,580
Yeah, well, you were always
a fast learner.

339
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,854
You sure you don't want it back,
Tony?

340
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:59,856
Most men usually don't have a problem
with my germs.

341
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,856
l've got a lead on
how our staff sergeant ended up

342
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,138
in a Union soldier's uniform.

343
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:10,696
He was a member of a local C.W.--

344
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,696
C.W.R out of Fairfax.

345
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,058
C.W.R.?

346
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:20,295
Yeah. Civil War Re-enactors.
Guys who get together,

347
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:23,340
dress up in period costumes,
re-enacting famous battles.

348
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:24,696
Why?

349
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:27,217
l've been asking my father that
since l was 1 0 years old.

350
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:31,534
They're preparing for one of those
battles this week in Manassas.

351
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:33,977
Quite the coincidence.

352
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:37,780
And in the immortal words
of Leroy Jethro Gibbs,

353
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,217
- l don't believe in coincidences.
- ls that a fact?

354
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,453
l was just telling Ziva
about this lead that l--

355
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,300
Yeah, l heard.

356
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,097
Come on. Abby's found something.
Let's roll.

357
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:50,533
That's an American custom.
A form of affection.

358
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:53,455
lt seems like <i>Shalowsh</i> Stooges
to me.

359
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:55,455
Like what?

360
00:22:57,822 --> 00:23:00,211
Larry, Moe, Curly, yes?

361
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:13,378
- Abs?
- l look like a freak.

362
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:19,662
Well?

363
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:21,853
See, l don't think
she really looks that bad.

364
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:25,537
ls she making a reference
to that strange tattoo on her neck?

365
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:27,777
Why?

366
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:34,814
One of the director's new admin
weenies brought me this last night.

367
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:38,339
lt's the NClS dress code.
He said l was in violation.

368
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,730
He did, didn't he?

369
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,177
lt's bad enough
that l have to wear a monkey suit

370
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:44,412
for court appearances,
but every day?

371
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:47,016
l think you look nice, Abby.

372
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:53,456
Nice? You think l look nice?
l look like-- Like--

373
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:56,090
Career Girl Barbie.

374
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,132
Oh, my God.

375
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,773
l do.

376
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,810
- l can't work like this, Gibbs.
- l'll take care of it, Abs.

377
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:07,257
l'm allergic to polyester.
lt makes me itch.

378
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:09,811
lt's a medical condition.
l could get a note from the doctor.

379
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:13,452
Abby, l said l'll take care of it.

380
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,976
- Don't ask.
- Can we get back to work now?

381
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:21,060
Do l have to wear the shoes?

382
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:27,217
The circuit board on the cell phone
was damaged.

383
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,339
But we managed to get it
working again.

384
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:32,735
The battery shut down
on October 3rd, 2004.

385
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:36,053
- The last 22 calls were made to 91 1 .
- None of them went through.

386
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,417
He was calling
from inside the casket.

387
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:41,335
Yep. Cast iron
and buried underground.

388
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:43,618
l don't think anyone's calling plan
extends that far.

389
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,340
What are the last entries here?

390
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:47,572
Well, he was running low
on oxygen, Boss.

391
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,461
l assume he was trying to dial
another number and hit random keys.

392
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,015
Find out.

393
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:53,774
What did you pull from the tomb,
Abs?

394
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:57,298
There were traces of Staff Sergeant
Sorrow's blood inside the cover.

395
00:24:57,502 --> 00:25:00,016
Most likely from when he tried
to claw his way out.

396
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:03,538
Since his fingers were shredded,
that must've been hard to figure out.

397
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,658
Agent David.

398
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,619
lt's pronounced David.

399
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:11,779
Or you can just call me Ziva.

400
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:15,259
l also found two very distinct types
of dirt on the outside.

401
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,176
One is red clay,
which is very common in Virginia.

402
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:21,135
And the other had a high concentration
of fertilizer.

403
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,133
Time you meet with the company
that found this?

404
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,815
- 0900.
- Take Ziva with you.

405
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,779
See if anything's left
of that crime scene.

406
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,455
l'm on it.

407
00:25:34,662 --> 00:25:36,220
Come on, McGee.

408
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,055
Abby, what if these aren't numbers?

409
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:00,695
Abby?

410
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:23,055
- See something you like, McGee?
- No.

411
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:24,974
l mean, yes?

412
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:28,333
Better.
What were you gonna tell me?

413
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:32,531
What if he wasn't trying
to dial a number

414
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:36,218
but he was trying
to send a text message?

415
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:42,737
McGee, sometimes l think
l love you.

416
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:45,453
Tell me you have a shower here.

417
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:48,853
We do. But only for biological
or chemical emergencies.

418
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:51,741
- Wonderful.
- You said you were sick of observing.

419
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,972
You made me crawl
through a dump truck full of dirt.

420
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:55,461
There could've been
valuable evidence.

421
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:56,737
There wasn't.

422
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:59,097
Yes, and thanks to you,
we now know that.

423
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:03,139
- How'd it go?
- Nothing, boss.

424
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,855
Building site was clean.

425
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:07,895
- Figuratively speaking.
- Very.

426
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,860
We taped off the area,
but we're not gonna find anything.

427
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,451
Gibbs.

428
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:14,735
- We did it.
- Did what, Abs?

429
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,097
Those random numbers
weren't random after all, boss.

430
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:22,291
Staff Sergeant Sorrow was leaving us
a text message from the grave.

431
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:26,939
When you put it through the cell
phone's text converter, you get this.

432
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,501
''Only got half.
Oxbow not on his side.

433
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:35,051
Kearns, don't let him
get safety-deposit box.''

434
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,417
- That's it?
- He was buried alive, Tony.

435
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:39,413
What did you expect, a soliloquy?

436
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:41,419
We ran his social through
the banking system.

437
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,931
Staff Sergeant Sorrow
has a safety-deposit box

438
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,781
paid for five years at
the North Virginia Savings and Trust.

439
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:48,580
- Get me a--
- Warrant. l already called it in.

440
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,460
- DiNozzo, Oxbow and Kearns?
- On it.

441
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:53,853
Get me into that safety-deposit box.
You take Ziva with you.

442
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:56,820
ls there somewhere l can clean up?

443
00:27:56,982 --> 00:28:00,895
Yeah. Sure.
Tonight when you go home.

444
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:10,660
You know what?
Let me help you with that.

445
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,574
l'm not a child.

446
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:14,539
Just trying to help.

447
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:17,212
You may get what l missed.

448
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,620
Thank you.

449
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:23,857
- ls Tony always so--?
- Yeah.

450
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,741
- And Gibbs?
- Oh, yeah.

451
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:28,893
And Abby?

452
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,257
Abby's usually nice.

453
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:35,538
Then it's me.
l guess l have that effect on people.

454
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:38,011
lt's-- lt's not you, Ziva.

455
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:41,015
The past month
has been hard on everyone.

456
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,661
But l'm glad you're here.

457
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:43,937
Yes?

458
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,218
Yeah. Means l'm not
the newbie anymore.

459
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:57,855
What's wrong?

460
00:28:58,022 --> 00:28:59,853
Nothing.

461
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:02,411
Still getting used to America,
l suppose.

462
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:14,178
l understand Staff Sergeant Sorrows
has been missing.

463
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:16,253
- Who told you that?
- His brother.

464
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,652
He's enquired several times
about the safety-deposit box.

465
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:20,653
- Why?
- He felt if something had happened,

466
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,939
- he would've wanted him to have it.
- Like death?

467
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:26,377
Obviously. But without
a death certificate and a court order,

468
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:29,852
our policy is to maintain the contents
until the lease runs out.

469
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,855
- ls Staff Sergeant Sorrows missing?
- Not anymore.

470
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:36,893
Anything else
or can we open the box now?

471
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:39,178
l'll be outside if you need me.

472
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,579
- We need to talk to his brother.
- Definitely.

473
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:05,020
A mummified hand.
An ancient map.

474
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:07,332
This has to be
your strangest case now, McGee.

475
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:10,062
Thanks. Maybe. That was Tony.

476
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,651
Staff Sergeant Sorrow does not
have a brother.

477
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,177
So we need to pull the bank
security-camera footage,

478
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:18,220
see if they have a shot of this guy
who claims to be his brother.

479
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:19,781
You know what this reminds me of?

480
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,052
- Mossad case?
- No.

481
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:26,221
- A Harry Potter novel.
- You read those too?

482
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:29,976
Me neither.

483
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:36,176
Excuse me. Excuse me.

484
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:38,810
Do you know where l can find
a Kelleher Avenue?

485
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:40,580
Yeah.
North of here about four blocks.

486
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,061
- Four blocks? Yeah.
- Yeah.

487
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:44,452
Hey, l'm gonna need
that map too.

488
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:46,738
- Excuse me?
- The map.

489
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:49,257
Why don't you take a look
at that van behind me?

490
00:30:56,782 --> 00:31:00,570
All right, now give me your weapon.
Come on, give it to me.

491
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:08,139
Now back up. Back up.

492
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:14,450
- Now what?
- Now you get wet.

493
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:26,536
Damn it.

494
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:34,861
- Gibbs is gonna kill me.
- Look on the bright side, McGee.

495
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,014
At least l'm clean again.

496
00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:43,021
No, no, no. Tighter.
Hold it tighter, Mr. Palmer.

497
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,979
l'm gonna put some English on it.

498
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:52,936
- Oh, dear.
- A little too much English, doctor.

499
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:55,855
There is no such thing.

500
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,941
Do you know what we have here,
Mr. Palmer?

501
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,900
- A very old ring?
- Yes.

502
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,656
And a reason to call
Dr. Burns back.

503
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:09,818
Boss, l'm sorry. l screwed up
and it won't happen again.

504
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:12,450
lt wasn't your fault. They used us.

505
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:15,655
Used us to get into
that safety-deposit box for them.

506
00:32:15,822 --> 00:32:18,336
He knew exactly what he wanted.
All he asked for was the map.

507
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,579
Map? What map?
Map of what, McGee?

508
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:26,214
- l didn't really get a good look at it.
- Maybe it was a treasure map, probie.

509
00:32:26,382 --> 00:32:29,374
You know, like gold,
diamonds, silver.

510
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:31,533
lt wasn't from one
of your dumb-ass movies, DiNozzo.

511
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,892
- Sorry.
- We need to find this guy.

512
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:35,973
Claimed he was
Staff Sergeant Sorrow's brother.

513
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:37,461
l might have a name for him.

514
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,500
Been researching the words
from Sorrow's farewell message.

515
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:43,495
- Oxbow and Kearns.
- Oxbow is the name on the map.

516
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,980
The other name might be his.

517
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:48,781
Judd Kearns,
a member of the same Civil War club

518
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:51,172
- our dead staff sergeant belonged to.
- Get an address?

519
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:53,139
Yeah, but he's not there.

520
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:56,131
The club is on their way
to Manassas Battlefield Park

521
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,418
for a re-enactment.
Should be there this afternoon.

522
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:01,136
McGee, what else do you remember
about the map?

523
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,133
l think l can help with that.

524
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:10,416
At Mossad, officers who fail
to observe don't generally last long.

525
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:15,333
And at NClS, they apparently get
drop-kicked into water fountains.

526
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,897
That would have never happened
if l had my weapons.

527
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,495
Find out what this is a map of.

528
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:20,856
l'm gonna get right on it.

529
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:35,299
Abby, Ziva was amazing. l mean,
she's got a photographic memory.

530
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,740
What?

531
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,500
Why don't you two
just get a room, McGee?

532
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:45,739
What, you think she likes me?

533
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:49,099
McGee, never forget.

534
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:53,619
l am one of the few people
in the world who can murder you

535
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:56,780
and leave no forensic evidence.

536
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:58,773
Well, perhaps
we should come back then.

537
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:02,059
Ducky. Just venting.
Who's your friend?

538
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:04,941
l'd like you to meet
Dr. Elaine Burns,

539
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:08,174
a forensic anthropologist
from the Smithsonian.

540
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:12,460
Ducky was saying
you might be in need of my expertise.

541
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:15,179
lt's French, 1 9th century.

542
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:19,654
Usually worn by Southern gentlemen
to telegraph wealth and status.

543
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:22,535
lt's in fantastic condition.
Where did you find it?

544
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:26,854
On a mummified hand
in a safety-deposit box, l'm afraid.

545
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,695
Sounds like scavengers.
Grave robbers.

546
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,251
We've had more sites ruined
by them than l care to remember.

547
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:34,811
How about the map
we found with it, Abs?

548
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:42,177
Certainly typical
of the Civil War period.

549
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:45,254
lCF stands
for lrregular Confederate Forces.

550
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:48,300
Oxbow may be referring
to a prominent Virginia family.

551
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,373
Where did they live?

552
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:52,612
Manassas.
Their mansion was destroyed

553
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:55,091
in the Second Battle of Bull Run
by the Union.

554
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,730
Remember how we found
Boone's dumping ground, Gibbs?

555
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:02,214
l could run the vectors between
these features and satellite imagery.

556
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:04,293
- Do it.
- Well, if it is Manassas,

557
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:07,374
l've had several digs there. l'd be
more than willing to serve as a guide.

558
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:13,654
That is, if Dr. Mallard
would be willing to accompany me.

559
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:17,058
Boss, his club checked in
with the park rangers.

560
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:18,860
Judd Kearns is there now.
Are we rolling?

561
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:21,775
No, not yet.

562
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:25,380
Gear up.

563
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:49,498
- Bring back memories for you, Tony?
- lt looks like fun.

564
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:51,699
You know what
little Anthony DiNozzo's job was

565
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,216
during these re-enactments, Ziva?

566
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:55,338
- Little drummer boy?
- No.

567
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:58,301
l would carry around a bucket
so these guys could take a dump in it.

568
00:35:58,462 --> 00:36:00,532
They called me their ''little poo boy.''

569
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:04,621
Kearns is out here somewhere
dressed as a Union sergeant.

570
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,370
You two with me.

571
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,420
See if you can match up
any of the landmarks on the map.

572
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,775
Any suggestions, doctors?

573
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:16,098
Let me look.

574
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,972
By the orientation of the map,
l suggest we start

575
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:22,531
near some of my old dig sites
to the north.

576
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,420
Unless... May l?

577
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,131
During times of war,
mapmakers often add terrain

578
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,294
or change the declination of north
and south in order to confuse--

579
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,891
Confuse the enemy
before it fell into the wrong hands.

580
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,654
Yeah, very good, Ziva.

581
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:39,656
Yes, what troubles me about this map
is this Confederate flag in the corner.

582
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:43,337
lt's unfurled in the opposite direction
of most flags.

583
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,299
Precisely.

584
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:49,531
l think we should start
looking to the south.

585
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:02,492
Boss, your 3 o'clock. Red stripes.

586
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:05,378
That's the guy from the bank video.

587
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:08,501
Oh, he's going.

588
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:12,575
- Fast.
- You think?

589
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:14,691
Son of a--

590
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:17,217
Ziva, l really think
we should wait for Gibbs.

591
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:20,180
He is the one that told us
to look for landmarks, Dr. Mallard.

592
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,652
Landmarks, yes. Following them
deep into the woods, probably not.

593
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:29,140
- And please, call me Ducky.
- Okay, Ducky.

594
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:33,255
l believe this is the trail
indicated on the map.

595
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:36,414
l doubt it. Wait. The topography's
completely different today.

596
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,379
We might have better luck
near the site

597
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,453
where the Oxbow mansion
used to stand.

598
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,772
We can try that next.

599
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,171
That's not bad, boss.

600
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:50,061
l thought you were still behind me
until you tackled him.

601
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:52,782
Not likely, DiNozzo.

602
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:55,060
What's his excuse?

603
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:02,933
lt wasn't an X on the map.

604
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:08,137
lt's a cross. This is a graveyard.

605
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:14,180
Ducky, wait here and call Gibbs.

606
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:16,014
Tell him to hurry.

607
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:33,254
We need to hurry this up.

608
00:38:35,782 --> 00:38:37,101
Yeah, that's it.

609
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:49,300
They buried these things
so the South could rise again,

610
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,180
and now they are all mine.

611
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,613
There's gotta be 50 of them here.

612
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:58,580
- At 30 grand a pop, that's--
- One point five million.

613
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,619
Your rifle is ten feet away.

614
00:39:01,102 --> 00:39:02,979
l wouldn't recommend trying it.

615
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,291
l didn't do anything wrong.

616
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:06,374
No? What about resisting arrest,
Kearns?

617
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,975
And what's that other charge,
McGee?

618
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:09,973
Murdering Staff Sergeant
Warren Sorrow.

619
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:12,852
Sorrow's dead? No way.

620
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:14,774
You guys can't pin that on me.
l wouldn't.

621
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,456
They told me
he got scared and took off.

622
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:21,092
He was buried alive
in a coffin, dirtbag.

623
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:24,133
l didn't sign up for this.

624
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:26,538
All she said
l had to do was distract you.

625
00:39:26,702 --> 00:39:28,693
DiNozzo, come on.

626
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,820
Ducky.

627
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:33,574
Ducky, where is Gibbs?

628
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:37,821
Ducky can't answer right now.

629
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,141
Drop the gun.

630
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:41,417
Now. Or he dies.

631
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:45,897
l knew there was a reason
l blocked you out of my mind.

632
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:49,497
Last time l ask. Drop it.

633
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:52,136
Shoot her, Ziva.
She'll only kill both of us.

634
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:58,493
And those weapons?

635
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:01,535
That is why you killed
that poor staff sergeant?

636
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:04,011
He found Oxbow's casket
and the map.

637
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,742
He actually wanted to turn them over
to a museum.

638
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:09,780
The only mistake we made
was killing him before we got the map.

639
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:13,901
You two are going to be
the unfortunate victims of scavengers.

640
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,892
Remind me not to piss her off.

641
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:37,611
Oh, DiNozzo, you have no idea.

642
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:54,018
She's gone, Gibbs.

643
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:56,614
l don't think Kate would mind.

644
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:08,939
l found this, but l have a feeling

645
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:12,576
she would've wanted you
to have it.

646
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,498
See you in the morning.
