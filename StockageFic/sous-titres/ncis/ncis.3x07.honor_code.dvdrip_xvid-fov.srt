1
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,723
Hey, Zach. Zachary.

2
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:12,284
What did l say about wandering off?
You have to be careful of strangers.

3
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,438
- Sorry.
- Here.

4
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:18,122
Dad, balloons are for babies.

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,602
Right. What about
that cotton candy? ls that still--?

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:24,396
Oh, no. That's fine.
We could share it after my ride.

7
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,882
l'll try to save you some.
lt looks awfully good to me.

8
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:30,318
Dad. After the ride.

9
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,316
l'll be watching you.

10
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,719
Dad.

11
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,806
Dad.

12
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,485
A whole hour for a lunch run,
probie?

13
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:10,678
Yeah, while Ziva and l were out,

14
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,156
she asked me to show her
the best routes to work.

15
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,360
Her driving has gotten a lot better.
Barely broke any laws this time.

16
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,036
Let me get this straight.

17
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:20,805
Ziva asked you,

18
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:24,801
who can barely navigate the Navy yard,
to show her the best way to work?

19
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,838
- That's right.
- Well, what about me?

20
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,080
l know every shortcut
in the metro area.

21
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:31,323
l could shave ten minutes off her
commute like that.

22
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:32,721
l don't know what to tell you.

23
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,797
lt doesn't make any sense.

24
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,919
Unless...

25
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,518
...maybe l intimidate her.

26
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,126
Yeah, l'm sure that's it.

27
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:50,443
l've seen it happen before.
lt's a chemical thing.

28
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:53,798
- Hard to explain.
- l do hope you try.

29
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,360
l told you not to do that again.

30
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,599
Sorry. l was so intimidated by your
presence, l must have forgotten.

31
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:03,761
Seriously. l do apologize for not asking
your advice on my commute.

32
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:05,360
Don't worry about it.

33
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,758
lf l would have known you would have
felt so emasculated--

34
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,282
- ls that the word? Emasculated.
- Yes, it is. Emasculated.

35
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,717
l would have asked you first.

36
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,798
lt takes a little more
than an exotic accent

37
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,276
and some stealth ninja moves
to emasculate me.

38
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:21,877
Only a little more?
How disappointing.

39
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:24,966
Don't take sides, probie.

40
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:29,439
Gear up. We have a missing person.
Coleman Park Carousel in Arlington.

41
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:30,875
- A child?
- Father.

42
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:33,043
Lieutenant Commander
Alex Tanner.

43
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,720
Disappeared an hour ago.

44
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:37,885
Do you always respond to
missing persons cases so promptly?

45
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:41,443
Special circumstances, Ziva.
His 6-year-old son called NClS.

46
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:45,037
He's in the park, alone, waiting for us.
DiNozzo, you drive.

47
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:46,600
l think McGee wants to drive, boss.

48
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,879
You know what, Tony?
l would really rather have you drive.

49
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,679
Afraid to run over another
fire hydrant?

50
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,681
l'm sure that wasn't your fault.
lt was, according to the police report.

51
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,242
- l'll drive.
- One more word, you're all walking.

52
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,563
You got it, boss.

53
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:03,799
l deserved that.

54
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,681
Zach.

55
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,004
Hey, l'm Special Agent DiNozzo,
you can call me Tony, okay?

56
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:22,325
That's a smart thing to do,
calling NClS. Good boy.

57
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:26,802
l know this really scary, but l want you
to be brave. Can you do that?

58
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:31,722
Okay, l want you to think back
to what happened today.

59
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,883
Try to remember the details.

60
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,724
There's no wrong answer here.

61
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,885
- What do we know?
- Nothing. l think the kid's in shock.

62
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,566
No, l'm not.

63
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,640
l'm waiting for Agent DiNozzo
to ask me a question.

64
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,603
What kinds of questions
was l supposed to ask?

65
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:52,641
What l saw. Why l called NClS.

66
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,000
What did you see, Zach?

67
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:01,036
Two men were watching us.
l think they kidnapped my Dad.

68
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:03,765
Describe them.

69
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,999
Dark glasses.
One had a military haircut.

70
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,401
One had a shaved head.

71
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:11,963
- How old?
- About your age.

72
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:14,517
They had iPods too.

73
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:18,836
lt's like a Walkman, boss. An iPod.

74
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:23,276
They were only listening
in one ear like this.

75
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,997
Be back in a minute, Zach.

76
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,604
- Dark glasses, earwigs.
- Sounds like feds.

77
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:37,164
You think the FBl would arrest a man
and leave his kid in the park, DiNozzo?

78
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:38,880
Maybe our commander took a walk.

79
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,043
My father left me in the Maui Hilton
for two days.

80
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,886
He didn't realize l was missing
until he got the room service bill.

81
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,964
Sad, but enlightening.

82
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,283
Boss, l just spoke
with the commander's C.O.

83
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:49,761
He's very concerned.

84
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,758
Apparently, Commander Tanner
was working

85
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,883
on a highly classified DOD project.

86
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,406
What project, McGee?

87
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,645
l don't-- He wouldn't say
over an unsecured line

88
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,035
but l'm going to find out.

89
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,600
Footage from the security cameras?

90
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,275
Park Security released them to me.

91
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:08,602
Okay, get ahold of Zach's mom.
And then she can pick him up at NClS.

92
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,758
Boss. Boss.

93
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,843
His mother's dead.
Killed four years ago in a car accident.

94
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,679
Primary next of kin?

95
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,559
There is none.

96
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,205
Just Commander Tanner
and his son.

97
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,080
These guys are definitely pros.

98
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,800
They keep their faces
from the camera.

99
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,362
All we've got to go on
is the kid's description of them.

100
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,523
You know, it doesn't look
like a kidnapping to me.

101
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,323
- They don't have guns.
- Barely touched the commander.

102
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:40,880
They could have threatened his son.

103
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,083
Explains why they left him alone
in the park.

104
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,084
What do we know
about Commander Tanner?

105
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,757
Well, boss, he is a brilliant man.

106
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,640
A dual Ph.D. from Caltech
in Number and Chaos Theory.

107
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:52,286
l was reading his thesis online.

108
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,563
He manages to link
non-relativistic quantum effects--

109
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,720
Well, that's useful
to this case, McGee.

110
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,441
Last three years he's been
the Navy's liaison

111
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:04,286
with a defence contractor,
Q and R Software.

112
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,240
Been the project lead on Honor.

113
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,915
- Which is?
- Classified.

114
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:12,963
l put a call to the head of security over
there. No one's gotten back to me.

115
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,286
So l thought l would pay them a visit?

116
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,483
Yeah, that's a good answer.
Tony go with him.

117
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:22,006
The sketch artist is done
with Zach's descriptions.

118
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,959
The boy has a remarkable memory.

119
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,318
There's also someone here
from Social Security to pick him up.

120
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,803
Services, Ziva.
Social Security is for older people.

121
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,235
Noted.

122
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:35,883
- Do you want me to tell the boy?
- No, l'll handle it. Here, sit down.

123
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:39,116
Put out a BOLO on the composites.

124
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,282
Hey, Zach.

125
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:45,524
- Good job on the sketches, man.
- Thanks.

126
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,600
That's Social Services, huh?

127
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,398
They'll take care of you
until we get your dad back.

128
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,042
l can take care of myself.

129
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:56,801
l don't doubt that.

130
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:02,966
- But l still have to go.
- Yeah, just for a while. Come on.

131
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:07,604
What if you--? What if you don't find
my dad, Agent Gibbs?

132
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,605
l'll find him, Zach. l'll find him.

133
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,160
Hey.

134
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,156
lf you ever need me
or even if you just want to talk,

135
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,158
you call, okay?

136
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,997
l'm sorry we didn't get back to you
right away.

137
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,959
We've been having some problems
of our own.

138
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,635
- What kind of problems?
- Honestly, l don't know.

139
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,236
l'm only Mr. Connell's assistant.
l'm sure he can--

140
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,041
That's been happening
for the last half-hour or so.

141
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:39,636
They should snap back on.

142
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,235
Are you all right, Ms. Osgood?

143
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,165
- lt's Laura.
- Laura.

144
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,925
Ms. Osgood.

145
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,605
l'll take it from here.

146
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,718
- Frank Connell, Q and R security.
- You certainly got here fast.

147
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,442
We just found out about the break-in
ourselves an hour ago.

148
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:05,043
At 0300 this morning,
our network was breached.

149
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:08,876
We didn't detect the intrusion until we
attempted to boot up our main servers.

150
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:11,396
Since then, we've had our hands full
tracking the viruses

151
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,801
they embedded in our system.

152
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,884
Do we know yet
what data's been compromised?

153
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,043
lt's clear they were after
a working copy of Honor

154
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,404
but fortunately it's protected by a key
that exists outside our system.

155
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,677
Key doesn't sound very high tech.

156
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,082
An asymmetric algorithm key
that's committed to memory.

157
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:26,959
Without it, the software won't work.

158
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,283
lt's just random ones and zeros,
completely worthless.

159
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,001
So you see, NClS has nothing
to worry about, gentlemen.

160
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,357
Great. Except that's not
why we're here.

161
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,922
Who has the Honor key
committed to memory?

162
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,083
Our project leader,
Lieutenant Commander Tanner.

163
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:50,477
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>We may have a problem, boss.</i>

164
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,279
- <i>May have?</i>
- The Honor code thingy

165
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:54,557
Commander Tanner was working on
may have been stolen.

166
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,166
<i>l'm trying to confirm it right now.</i>

167
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,723
- What's it supposed to do?
- Break any encryption in use today.

168
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,157
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.
l'd say that sounds like a problem.

169
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,119
<i>And it gets worse, boss.</i>

170
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,806
According to the people here

171
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,759
Tanner's the only one
who can make it work.

172
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,366
<i>All right. l'm heading your way.</i>

173
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,162
Just got to drop off
Zach's pod thing first.

174
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:17,801
Agent Gibbs.

175
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:21,079
You calling about your pod thing
you left on my desk?

176
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,643
No. He's here.
The man from the park.

177
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:26,439
Let me talk to your
social worker, Zach.

178
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:30,606
l'm not in her office.
As soon as l saw him, l took off.

179
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,157
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Outside on the street.

180
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,086
Zach, l'm a few blocks from you.
Stay right where you are.

181
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:39,916
- l can't. He's leaving.
- <i>Zach, listen to me.</i>

182
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,197
- l need you to--
- <i>He knows where my dad is.</i>

183
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,240
We can't let him get away. Hurry.

184
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:46,882
<i>Zach.</i>

185
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,923
Help. Help.

186
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,397
- NClS. Let the kid go.
- Gibbs.

187
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,165
You little bastard.

188
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,478
Go. Go. Go.

189
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,885
lt's okay.

190
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,565
New hires just keep getting younger,
Madam Director?

191
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:05,399
Obviously you didn't get the memo,
Agent DiNozzo.

192
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:06,956
What memo?

193
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,958
The one where it explains
the next person

194
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,595
who calls her madam
gets keel-hauled.

195
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,120
Whatever that is.

196
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,879
- lt's--
- Unpleasant.

197
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,926
Tell Gibbs l want him upstairs.

198
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:26,884
- What did the director want?
- You.

199
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,119
Upstairs.

200
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,680
l better check on those sketches.

201
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:39,240
l got a BOLO out on a black Chevy
Suburban, boss, but without plates.

202
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:42,559
DiNozzo, you will spend the next
24 personally checking each one

203
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,122
in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C.

204
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,837
That's like an impossible--
l'm on that.

205
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,277
You keep an eye on him for me.

206
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,080
l'll be right back.

207
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:11,998
You know, he was just kidding
when he said keeping an eye on me.

208
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:16,805
l couldn't remember when Gibbs
asked me, but l think l got it right.

209
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:22,445
- Got what right?
- The numbers on the license plate.

210
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,764
l was scared, but l remember
most of the numbers.

211
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,686
All right, Zach.

212
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,878
My man. Come on. Give me five.

213
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:38,763
Come on, meet me up high.

214
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,156
All right. We'll work on that.

215
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,999
Good job.

216
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,358
Always admired your way
with children.

217
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:50,563
Ever think of having
any of your own?

218
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,480
ls that an offer, Jen?

219
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:57,920
No, it wasn't an offer, Jethro.
lt was merely an observation.

220
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:01,005
You know why l get along with kids
so well?

221
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:06,239
Because when they lie, they don't have
the guile to get away with it.

222
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,320
You wanted to see me?

223
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,684
l have spent the last hour on video
conference with the directors

224
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:18,600
of the FBl, NSA
and Homeland Security.

225
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:19,882
Your kind of tea party.

226
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:23,397
lf Project Honor's compromised,
it will cripple our intelligence networks.

227
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,558
They all want jurisdiction
on this one.

228
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,157
- And you said?
- l have my best agent working it.

229
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,118
Now, tell me you have something.

230
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,916
The same men who kidnapped
the commander went after his son.

231
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,397
Have you considered that he might not
have been kidnapped?

232
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,364
- l have. l don't buy it.
- And?

233
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,558
- Your famous gut again?
- No.

234
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,479
His son.

235
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,646
Abs, give me good news.

236
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,447
Oh, my God. l got this e-mail that says
l may have won $50 million.

237
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,842
And l'm really, really psyched.

238
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,520
Oh, you mean about the case?

239
00:14:58,127 --> 00:14:59,879
l've been going through
Q and R security logs.

240
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,322
lt's like the Fort Knox
of computer systems.

241
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,127
Next generation anti-virus software,
intrusion detection.

242
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:08,757
- Crypto processors, ACLs, firewalls.
- Hey, hey.

243
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:11,877
Okay. No one can penetrate
the system, Gibbs.

244
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,955
lt could be disabled if someone had
a high enough clearance.

245
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,278
- lt's an inside job.
- Q and R is monitored 24/7.

246
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,796
All employees have passwords
to gain access to the system.

247
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:24,597
Like digital fingerprints.
Every keystroke recorded for posterity.

248
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:29,005
At 3 a.m. this morning, someone
planted a virus into the network.

249
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,198
lt shut down the security system
exactly one hour.

250
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:35,197
Long enough to breach the network,
remove the software, plant the viruses.

251
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,482
Go.

252
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,764
The virus originated from
Commander Tanner's terminal, sir.

253
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,795
- Someone else could have used it.
- No, sir. The data is very clear.

254
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:47,363
Pointing out that Q and R's security
system was designed to be accurate.

255
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,165
- Under the circumstances--
- Chip.

256
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,046
He's right about the design, though.

257
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:53,761
Who designed it?

258
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,758
Q and R's risk management team.

259
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,566
But all of their people are
former law enforcement and military.

260
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,685
- At the highest level.
- Tanner was at the highest level too.

261
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,997
Tony is reviewing statements
from the employees.

262
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:08,080
l'm reviewing the computer terminals,
but the virus wiped a lot of files.

263
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:10,238
lt doesn't look good
for the commander, boss.

264
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,361
Wipe that dirt off your lip.

265
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:17,796
Dirt?

266
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,882
l feel like l've wasted your time,
Agent DiNozzo.

267
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:31,524
- Bite your tongue. You've been great.
- l just feel bad for that poor little boy.

268
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:32,961
Well, listen.

269
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,116
lf you think of anything...

270
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,119
...you give me a call

271
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,402
day or night.

272
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,006
Home phone number's on the back.

273
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:49,559
Where have you been? l could've used
your help with those interviews.

274
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,962
You look like you had your hands full
with her.

275
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,556
Watch your sexual innuendo
around the kid. He's had a hard day.

276
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:57,759
He's taking it better than most adults.
He's resilient.

277
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,202
Do you see the way he's been acting
around me?

278
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,284
l think it's because
he doesn't like you, Tony.

279
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,846
Kids dig me.

280
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:06,124
No they don't.

281
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,280
Zach. Zacharoo, buddy.
Come on over here, man.

282
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,763
l was gonna wait until tomorrow
when everyone was here

283
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:18,085
but considering
what a brave little boy you've been

284
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
and how much you've helped us,

285
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:25,477
l'm gonna make you
an honorary NClS agent.

286
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,155
Thanks. l've got to go to the head.

287
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,360
Yes, Tony. l was mistaken.

288
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,724
Your way with children is only rivalled
by your way with women.

289
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,241
He's under a lot of stress.

290
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:42,564
- Where's Zach?
- Potty break, boss.

291
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,955
You gonna speak?

292
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:51,678
l got an lD on one of our suspects.
His name is Vincent Pazzo.

293
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:56,756
ltalian-born. Freelance mercenary.
Black ops mostly. Some wet work.

294
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,241
How'd you find out about that?

295
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,200
l sent Zach's sketches to some people
who owe me a favour.

296
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,086
lf he's got the Honor program and the
guy who knows how to make it work,

297
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:05,601
then why'd they go after his kid?

298
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:06,876
To force him to cooperate.

299
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,003
There's a possibility
Commander Tanner set this up

300
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:10,726
to make it look like kidnapping.

301
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,082
Keep your voice down.

302
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,118
That's what l would do
if it were my op.

303
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:20,165
Authorities are looking for a kidnapper,
they should look for a traitor.

304
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,079
lt doesn't feel right, Ziva.

305
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:25,364
lt doesn't have to feel right
to be right, Gibbs.

306
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:36,400
Gibbs, can l ask you a question?

307
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:38,641
Yeah, shoot.

308
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:43,562
How are you going to get this
out of here when it's finished?

309
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:48,000
Good question. l don't know.
l haven't thought about it much.

310
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,284
l think maybe you could use a crane
or something.

311
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,644
Yeah? l could dig a ramp.

312
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,037
Knock that wall out
and hoist it out of here.

313
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:02,404
l went sailing once with my dad
and Commander Wilder.

314
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,239
Didn't go too well.

315
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,557
- Did you get seasick?
- My dad did.

316
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:09,597
Commander Wilder thought
it was funny.

317
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,924
You know,
my dad being in the Navy and all.

318
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,202
Yeah.

319
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,396
- You're going to find him, right?
- Oh, yeah. We'll find him.

320
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,960
- Promise?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,597
l promise you.

322
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,598
Wanna give me a hand?

323
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:31,797
- Don't know how.
- Come on over here.

324
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:33,235
l don't wanna ruin it.

325
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,007
You're not going to ruin anything.
Come here.

326
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:40,162
See, you always want to go
with the grain of the wood.

327
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,164
Put your hand there.
Put your weight behind it.

328
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,843
Back and forth, real even.

329
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,366
- Where's Gibbs?
- Home with Zach. What's up?

330
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,683
Commander Tanner's
bank statement.

331
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,918
Do Americans usually empty out
their bank accounts

332
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,646
before they take children
to the park?

333
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,041
You're kidding.

334
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:02,802
Savings, checking, money market,
$23,000.

335
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:04,639
Gibbs is not gonna like this.

336
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:06,399
Are we solving this case
to please him?

337
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,000
l got a trace
on the Chevy Suburban.

338
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,365
Zach missed two numbers on the plate
but l found the vehicle.

339
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,561
Rental car out of Maryland.

340
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,520
lD's fake. Credit card was stolen.
But that's our other kidnapper.

341
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,486
Does the car have a navigation
system? We could use the GPS.

342
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,241
Two words for you, McGee:
Lo and Jack.

343
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,596
That's one word.

344
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,197
- A what?
- lt's a-- Whatever.

345
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,359
l tracked it down to a parking lot
a couple miles from here.

346
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,084
Good job, McGee.

347
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,800
What?

348
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,878
Come on, let's roll.

349
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,526
Where's the child?

350
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:43,525
Now, keep your eye on the coin.

351
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,798
Yeah, like his.

352
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:51,477
Now that, my young friend,
is magic.

353
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:55,602
Now, a true magician doesn't reveal
the mysteries of his craft

354
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,407
to anyone else
but another magician.

355
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,797
But would you like to learn?

356
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:03,478
lt's in that hand.

357
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:05,602
lsn't it?

358
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:09,840
So it is.

359
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,841
He's quite observant.

360
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:15,677
Does he remind you of anyone?

361
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,841
Very good.

362
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,117
Got it, boss.
Black SUV, no rear window.

363
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:27,000
One visible suspect in the vehicle.

364
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,242
Should we take him now?

365
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:31,680
Wait. l'm almost in position here.

366
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:34,079
Copy.

367
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,277
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather be partner with McGee?

368
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:44,086
The two of you seem to click,
and we're about to storm this vehicle.

369
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,842
- Who knows what's gonna go down.
- Don't worry, Tony. l got your back.

370
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,522
My back. Listen, lady, if anybody
is getting anybody's back,

371
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,796
it's me getting yours.

372
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,241
ln position, DiNozzo.

373
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,244
Take him down.

374
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:25,359
- Ziva, what a pleasure.
- Dr. Mallard.

375
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,246
- Oh, Ducky, please.
- Ducky.

376
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:30,364
Are you two done
with the name game?

377
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:34,799
Yeah. Our guest departed this world
only a few hours ago.

378
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,642
But he was in a great deal of pain
before he died.

379
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,236
Seems he was wounded.

380
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:42,166
Single round.
The bullet lodged under his scapula.

381
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:44,716
- The shoulder blade.
- Doc, l'm gonna guess

382
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,117
- that slug's from my safe.
- Yeah.

383
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:53,442
As to the fatal injury, this circular burn
around the entry wound suggests--

384
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,926
A silencer was used.

385
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:57,726
lt was done in haste by someone
with little, if any, experience.

386
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:01,078
lf a professional did this,
he would have not left his weapon.

387
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:02,959
lt's untidy. Marks of an amateur.

388
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,038
lf it were me,
l would have not been so obvious.

389
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:08,245
There are literally dozens
of effective ways to eliminate a target

390
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:09,920
without raising suspicions.

391
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:14,405
Heroin overdose is popular,
but it requires a history of prior use.

392
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:16,962
Of course, something like insulin
or potassium can be used

393
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,079
to suggest death by natural causes.

394
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:24,606
l really must ask you over for dinner.
Mother would love to talk with you.

395
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,401
They cleaned house. l wounded him
when he tried to grab Zach.

396
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:28,966
After that he was a liability.

397
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:31,721
Once again, l suggest
Commander Tanner may be involved.

398
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,764
All the evidence says
he stole the software.

399
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,197
He cleared out his bank accounts.

400
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:39,001
He likely killed this man.

401
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:40,799
From an investigator's point of view,

402
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:45,040
the pieces fit together quite well.

403
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,560
Or not.

404
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,117
- Abby.
- Ballistics lab, sir.

405
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,039
- Serving in the military?
- No, sir, l was--

406
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,681
- Stop standing at attention.
- lt's good posture, sir.

407
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:03,237
- What? No Zachster?
- Abby, you're yelling.

408
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,166
- Oh, sorry. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

409
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:10,565
He's a cool kid. Reminds me of you.
He's like a mini-Gibbs.

410
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,600
- Austin Powers?
- You calling Zach a Mini-Me?

411
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,235
Gibbs, l am so impressed
with your pop-culture reference.

412
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,596
Tell me about the weapon.

413
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,035
All right. lt's a Makarov .380.

414
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,920
lt matches the hollow point slugs
from the body downstairs.

415
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,199
And this bad boy that we pulled
from his shoulder matches your SlG.

416
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,039
- Any prints from the .380?
- Dead guy's.

417
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:28,566
- You have something else?
- l have.

418
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,796
- What?
- Chip shaved.

419
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,804
l didn't notice.

420
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:34,320
He didn't notice?

421
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:36,683
He doesn't notice
unimportant things, Chip.

422
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,120
Sorry, Chip. Didn't mean it.

423
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:53,997
- You getting off, director?
- Looking for you actually.

424
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:00,395
l saw Ducky's report
on the body downstairs.

425
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:03,525
- That was fast.
- One of the perks of being director.

426
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,445
l get to read all the good reports.

427
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:08,037
What's next, Jethro?

428
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,715
Finishing this conversation.

429
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:15,401
- Don't give me a hard time.
- l didn't realize l was.

430
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,766
The man who supposedly kidnapped
Commander Tanner

431
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,565
is lying dead in our autopsy room.

432
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:24,356
Tanner is looking
less and less like a victim.

433
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,206
You want back in the field again,
Jen?

434
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,275
Tanner has technology

435
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,915
that could set back
our intelligence monitoring 30 years.

436
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:33,440
Pardon me for taking an interest.

437
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:37,481
And here l thought you just wanted
an excuse to spend time together.

438
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:41,805
l just want to know that this is about
more than a fatherless child to you.

439
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,076
Boss.

440
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:46,404
Didn't you notice we're in the middle
of a conversation, Agent McGee?

441
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,086
Sorry. Should l come back?

442
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,839
- No.
- Yes.

443
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:54,318
l'm simply trying to solve
your case here, director.

444
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,556
Speak.

445
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,437
Commander Wilder is here.

446
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:01,444
He works with Commander Tanner
at Q and R.

447
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,239
Commander Wilder.

448
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:14,083
l went by his house
to grab some stuff for him.

449
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:18,001
Your agents wouldn't let me in, so
l bought him a Nintendo to play with.

450
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,556
That's the DS.
lt's an excellent system.

451
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,840
l've heard.

452
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:27,882
This is a hell of a situation.

453
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,362
Zach's been through so much
in his life already.

454
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,360
ls there a reason you wanted
to see me?

455
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:35,719
Tanner is a close friend.
l was hoping for information.

456
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,605
At Q and R,
they're saying he's a suspect.

457
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,357
Do you know the sacrifices he's made
to serve our country?

458
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,000
l do.

459
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,045
l don't care
what the computer log says.

460
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,919
Commander Tanner is no traitor.

461
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:48,243
- What's it gonna take to prove that?
- Finding who is.

462
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,875
Then you should look
at Q and R's civilian employees.

463
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:54,124
They're falling all over themselves
to try and protect their collective asses.

464
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,717
What about Zach,
where's he staying?

465
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:58,962
With me.

466
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,965
l'm the closest thing he has to family.
l can take him home with me.

467
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,886
Can't do that.
He's under protective custody.

468
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,323
You mean they're after Zach too?

469
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,483
We'll take good care of him,
commander.

470
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:12,399
l'm just gonna say goodbye.

471
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,760
Boss, so did you tell him
we think Tanner's innocent?

472
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:22,122
We don't know he is.

473
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:24,684
Do you have something to say,
McGee?

474
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:29,280
l've been going through the evidence
we bagged from the vehicle.

475
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,360
Prepaid burn phone. Guess
whose number's on the caller lD.

476
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,837
Frank Connell, Q and R office.

477
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:42,405
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- l couldn't stop them.

478
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:45,599
lt's not her fault.
She's overwhelmed by search warrant.

479
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,878
This is out of line.
l've been cooperative.

480
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,040
Explain why you called the kidnappers
from this office

481
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:53,600
the day the Honor code
went missing.

482
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:56,241
- That's a ridiculous accusation.
- Denying you were here?

483
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,477
l said in my statement
l was working late that night.

484
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,365
So you made the call.

485
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,798
Someone's tampered
with this hard drive.

486
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,197
Tried to erase the command logs
morning of the robbery.

487
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,915
We had a virus.
lt corrupted thousands of files.

488
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,476
- ls that what happened?
- Can't tell until we get to the lab.

489
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,083
Okay, bag and tag.

490
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:16,085
You cannot remove that computer
from this building.

491
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,444
- Don't worry. You're going with it.
- Go up and call the lawyers.

492
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:21,644
You have the right to remain silent.

493
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,315
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

494
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:25,562
Hey.

495
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,917
- Gibbs got Connell talking?
- His lawyer won't let him,

496
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,840
so Gibbs is giving him the old stare.

497
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,720
Gibbs does it much better.

498
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,280
- Apple for teacher?
- For McGee.

499
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,280
He's been very generous with me.
Helping me adjust to this new city.

500
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:39,840
So you're giving him an apple?

501
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:41,685
lt's a small gesture.

502
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,923
lf you wanna thank him,
why don't you get him a date?

503
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:47,125
Gibbs wants to know if you've got
anything he can use on Connell.

504
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,879
Frank Connell's a deacon
at his church.

505
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,357
Never had a moving violation,
let alone a parking ticket.

506
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:53,961
He calls his mother every Sunday.
The man is spick-and-spam.

507
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,877
The saying is spick-and-span.
Spam is lunch meat.

508
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:02,639
- What exactly is span, then?
- Span is--

509
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,320
l'll get back to you on that.

510
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:07,245
ln my opinion,
Frank Connell's not involved.

511
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:11,720
Good. l'll let Gibbs know right away
because he loves to hear our opinions.

512
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:13,485
He's distracted by his affections.

513
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:16,804
- Gibbs doesn't get distracted.
- What do you call it, then?

514
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,362
The boss moves in mysterious ways.
Get this to him.

515
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:23,401
- Why me?
- l'm gonna go see your buddy McGee.

516
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:26,963
- Hey, put that back.
- l'm just bringing it to him.

517
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,756
Progress report, McGee.

518
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,999
l think that Frank Connell put a trace
on Commander Tanner's computer.

519
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,526
- Think?
- Well,

520
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,678
l've got scraps of code,
protocols, commands.

521
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:46,959
He might have put the trace in,
collected Tanner's passwords,

522
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:48,322
stolen the software.

523
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:51,719
''Might have'' and ''think''
are not going to make Gibbs happy.

524
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:55,203
Whoever wiped his files did a good job.
There is nothing left but fragments.

525
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,843
Can't Gibbs just bring Connell
in interrogation?

526
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:00,601
Not with a $500-an-hour defence
attorney breathing down his neck.

527
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:01,922
Puts it on you, McGee.

528
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:04,243
Nothing l have found contradicts
any of the evidence

529
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:06,603
we have against Commander Tanner.

530
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:10,439
l'm with you, probie. But he's feeling
pretty strong about this one.

531
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:14,402
Has anyone considered the fact
that Gibbs may be wrong this time?

532
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,723
McGee, bite your tongue.
Gibbs knows what he's doing.

533
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,606
- We just have to show him love.
- We show the love, Abby.

534
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:23,439
Just don't want to let the bad guys
get away while we're doing it.

535
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,044
Almost blocked my shot there,
Chipper.

536
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,363
- Ever play ball?
- College.

537
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,597
Yeah? Me too.

538
00:30:31,807 --> 00:30:34,719
- Tony ran point for Ohio State.
- What conference did you play in?

539
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,839
- We didn't exactly have a conference.
- Division?

540
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:41,926
Not really.
lt was more of an intramural thing.

541
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,843
Skins and moustaches?

542
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:48,561
What do you got for me?

543
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:51,280
Chip?

544
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:53,000
Fingerprint analysis results.

545
00:30:57,047 --> 00:31:00,323
- You're free to go, Chip.
- l don't mind staying late, ma'am.

546
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,436
Go home, Chip, please.

547
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,802
- ls that an order?
- Yes. Go.

548
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,965
l don't know how you concentrate
around him.

549
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:17,204
l know. No, no, no.

550
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,921
No. l'm too good at what l do.

551
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,555
No, you're not.

552
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:26,959
- l am. Gibbs is going to hate me for it.
- What happened?

553
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,719
l was following up
on the murder weapon.

554
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,878
- Double-check for anything l missed.
- Was there?

555
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,123
- Fingerprints.
- On the gun?

556
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,363
- On the rounds in the magazine.
- That's great.

557
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,683
Most people get obsessed
cleaning the grip and trigger.

558
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,678
They don't think twice
about the bullets.

559
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:41,684
Now we've got a nice partial thumb,
a forefinger

560
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,043
- and a perfect index print.
- Amazing.

561
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,045
- Yeah, l know.
- So whose prints are they?

562
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:49,760
Commander Tanner's.

563
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:00,840
Yeah.

564
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:04,244
Yeah. At this rate we'll have her
seaworthy in no time.

565
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:08,557
Maybe my dad can help
when he gets back.

566
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,800
Hubba-hubba.

567
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:14,920
Dinner at the White House?

568
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:16,446
A date, actually.

569
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:19,480
Must be an important guy for you
to get all decked out.

570
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,965
l'd prefer if you just told me
that you liked my dress.

571
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,123
l haven't decided yet.

572
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,757
Do you mind giving us a moment?

573
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,879
Zach, why don't you go upstairs
and grab a soda.

574
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,919
How long are you planning
on keeping Frank Connell locked up?

575
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:47,721
You make a house call
to reprimand me, Jen?

576
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,997
You got Commander Tanner's
fingerprints on the bullets

577
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,596
- of the murder weapon.
- Well, l'm not sure he did it.

578
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:56,436
Why? And don't tell me
your famous gut again.

579
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,404
Zach is a great kid, Jethro.

580
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,438
Doesn't mean
his father's not a bastard.

581
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,683
He might be,
but Zach's our only link to him.

582
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:09,037
He might make another attempt
to get Zach back?

583
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:10,805
lf he does l'll be waiting for him.

584
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,645
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,884
lt's a complicated situation.

586
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:19,839
- lt's not.
- Zach.

587
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:23,119
Zach, there is evidence
he did something wrong.

588
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:24,442
lt doesn't matter.

589
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:28,356
l know in my stomach
he didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,876
You promised
you'd bring him back to me, Gibbs.

591
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:32,566
Please.

592
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:41,956
- Where's Zach?
- Ducky's.

593
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:47,363
Listen, l spent half the night taking
Frank Connell's hard drive apart.

594
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,526
There's nothing. We need to accept
Commander Tanner sold the software.

595
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:53,399
l'm not accepting anything.

596
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,642
- Boss--
- Look at this a different way.

597
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:58,678
l agree. l just talked to the ClA.

598
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,115
They were very cooperative.

599
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,683
- They were?
- He owed me a favour.

600
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,320
How many people owe you favours?

601
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,563
How many dates
does Tony go on a month?

602
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,239
This is from Kosovo
in the late '90s.

603
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,199
The man with the shaved head
is Vincent Pazzo.

604
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:14,523
The one on the left is Willis Hirst.

605
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:17,686
They were mercenaries
for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

606
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,639
- Freedom fighters.
- Not exactly.

607
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,077
They worked for a warlord
as specialists.

608
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,846
- What specialty?
- Coercion.

609
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,396
Torture.

610
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,403
But the evidence we have
against Commander Tanner?

611
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:34,485
This is a covert operation.
Take nothing at face value.

612
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:36,803
They framed Commander Tanner
as a diversion.

613
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,079
While they torture him
for the access code.

614
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,558
Maybe he won't talk.

615
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,837
Have you ever been tortured,
McGee?

616
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:47,278
There's only so much torment
a human body can bear.

617
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,796
Strong men break in a few days,
nobody holds out forever.

618
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,366
Not even
Gibbs.

619
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,637
To a trained interrogator,
can be done in less time.

620
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,520
l can get that code in hours.

621
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,360
They've had him for two days.

622
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,797
He's running out of time
if he hasn't talked already.

623
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:02,326
A few hours, huh?

624
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:05,005
Give or take.

625
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:09,205
l'm putting you in a room with
Frank Connell, you have 40 minutes.

626
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,477
- l'd hold off on that, boss.
- Where have you been?

627
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:13,678
Tracking down the store
where our dead guy

628
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:16,401
purchased his cell phone.
Not easy, by the way.

629
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:20,122
The language barrier between me and
Mr. Singh was no piece of cake either.

630
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,517
Once l convinced him l wasn't
going to shut down his store

631
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:24,638
he gave me his
surveillance video tapes.

632
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,124
- ls this poppy seed?
- Where is the video?

633
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:30,717
Abby's lab. Sorry, boss.
She's scanning the tapes now.

634
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:34,200
The phone was purchased with cash,

635
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:36,363
a week before Commander Tanner
disappeared.

636
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,639
Pause the tape.

637
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:42,601
That woman's got four phones
in her hands.

638
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,198
Zoom in, Abs.

639
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:51,238
Oh, yeah. The lips and the angle
of the chin, the curve of the neck.

640
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,881
Okay, we got it, Tony.
She's attractive.

641
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,396
lt's Laura Osgood.
Frank Connell's assistant.

642
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:58,438
l'll make you a print.

643
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,284
l hate it when they do that.

644
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,756
What's going on?

645
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:17,084
You bought phones connected
to a robbery, kidnapping and murder.

646
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,287
Her number matches several calls
on the kidnapper's phone.

647
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,038
You're done.

648
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:27,636
Only way to help yourself
is tell us everything you know.

649
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:30,442
l want a lawyer.

650
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:40,198
Commander Tanner's been gone
for 4 7 hours.

651
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,840
lf he's not dead yet,
he soon will be.

652
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,561
Maybe we can convince her
to change her mind about the lawyer.

653
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,246
l can convince her
far more than that.

654
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:47,436
How long?

655
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:48,841
Not long.

656
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,800
McGee, are you thirsty?

657
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,676
Come on.
l'll buy you a cup of coffee.

658
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,837
Boss, what exactly is Ziva
doing in there?

659
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,645
l don't want to know.

660
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:23,281
lt was a three-man team.

661
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,842
l was on the inside.

662
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:30,279
l put a trace on Commander Tanner's
computer to get his passwords.

663
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:33,160
l planted the virus using his log-in.

664
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:35,403
Keep going, Laura.

665
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:39,481
Pazzo and Hirst grabbed Commander
Tanner to get the access code.

666
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:42,520
- Who set it up?
- l don't know.

667
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:46,438
We were contacted separately.

668
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:50,640
Money was wired. lnstructions
e-mailed on an anonymous server.

669
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,405
Where is he?

670
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:56,355
Commander Tanner,
where is he being tortured?

671
00:37:57,447 --> 00:38:00,007
That wasn't part of my assignment.

672
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,842
Please, they'll kill me.

673
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:11,556
lt's a garage near Coleman Park.

674
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,085
- Yeah?
- Code checks out.

675
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,642
- Proceed as planned.
- All right. l'll go clean up.

676
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,485
Clear.

677
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:02,805
Commander Tanner.

678
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:07,320
- Zach?
- All right. He's safe. We've got him.

679
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,764
They told me they had him.

680
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:12,878
lf l didn't give them the code,
they'll kill him.

681
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,362
- You gave them the key?
- l had to.

682
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:19,480
They had my son.
They showed me proof.

683
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:20,636
What proof?

684
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:35,597
Agent Gibbs?
What in the hell's going on?

685
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,918
l'm not resisting.

686
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,162
Too bad.

687
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:43,838
l could have never hurt Zach.
lt was strictly business.

688
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,446
We'll be sure to let him know that.

689
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,480
Are you okay?

690
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,359
l guess.

691
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:17,478
Commander Wilder was my dad's...

692
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:20,286
He was my friend, Gibbs.

693
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,517
l should have known.

694
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:28,439
l shouldn't have let him
fool me like that.

695
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:32,438
Zach, sometimes really bad people

696
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:35,203
are good at fooling you.

697
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:38,878
Anybody bad ever fool you?

698
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:41,442
Oh, yeah. More than once.

699
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:48,846
Someday l'm going to find them
and put them all in jail.

700
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,515
l believe you will.

701
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:53,356
Zach.

702
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,684
Dad. Daddy. Daddy.

703
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,479
You're all right.

704
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:00,325
l knew you'd never leave me.

705
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:03,803
- l'm all right. Everything's all right.
- l love you, Daddy.
