1
00:00:01,342 --> 00:00:03,458
<i>Previously on</i> NClS:

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:05,334
Galib, has Abu infiltrated Sealift?

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:10,013
They are about to. Our radio man,
Pinpin Pula is Abu Sayyaf.

4
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:13,771
He plans to blow the <i>Cape Fear</i>.
This will be as bad as 9/1 1 .

5
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:16,695
You didn't know him
when he was wounded

6
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,460
- in Desert Storm?
- No.

7
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,141
He seems to be repeating
that trauma,

8
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:22,139
the coma that he doesn't wanna
wake up from.

9
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:26,096
<i>lf Galib had intel on Abu's plans,</i>
<i>did he have time to tell Gibbs?</i>

10
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:28,372
Maybe. They were together
when the bomb went off.

11
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:31,255
<i>Let's hope Gibbs comes out</i>
<i>of this coma in time.</i>

12
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,101
Jethro doesn't talk
much about the past.

13
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,294
l know very little about his life
before we met.

14
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:02,622
- Welcome back, Jethro.
- You were in an explosion.

15
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:04,500
l remember.

16
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,774
l don't know him.

17
00:01:57,022 --> 00:01:58,853
- You don't know Dr. Mallard?
- Ducky.

18
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,375
Ducky. Do you know Ducky?

19
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,538
l'm disappointed, Jethro.

20
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:09,575
The last time someone forgot me,
l was a baby.

21
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:12,933
My mother left me on the ferry
from Orkney to John o'Groat's.

22
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:15,980
She was on the bus halfway
to Thurso before she missed me.

23
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:20,296
l've often wondered if l inspired
the Liechtenstein T-shirt.

24
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:23,221
- ''Oh, God. l left the baby on the bus.''
- Quite.

25
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:25,942
Remember my telling you that,
Jethro?

26
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,740
l remember the T-shirt.

27
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:32,974
But not me.

28
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:37,779
No worries. lt'll come.

29
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:40,536
Absolutely. Temporary memory loss
is to be expected.

30
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,899
Don't let it worry you.
You breathing comfortably?

31
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:49,419
Good. Let's switch
to the nasal cannula, Maria.

32
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,732
- Okay.
- You're doing fine.

33
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,295
l'm just gonna to take this off.

34
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,137
Most traumatized brain injuries

35
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,941
produce short-term
retrograde amnesia.

36
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,491
But to erase years of memory,

37
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,937
his medial temporal lobes or
hippocampus should be damaged.

38
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,451
No, his CAT scans
and EEG are normal.

39
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,816
And he remembered the explosion.

40
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,577
And l've never had a retrograde
amnesia patient remember the trauma.

41
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,181
Never.

42
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,893
Okay, there you go.

43
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,492
l don't think
it's retrograde amnesia.

44
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,811
l think it's dissociative.

45
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,542
An emotional repression
of memory?

46
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:30,216
With no physical damage to the brain,
it must be psychological.

47
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:31,497
- No.
- But, doctor,

48
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,573
you said Gibbs
hasn't spoken of his past.

49
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,302
- Hardly ever.
- Perhaps it's too painful.

50
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:39,340
lt could explain
the prolonged coma in '91 .

51
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,732
But the present coma
is the result of an explosion.

52
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,335
How could it be psychological?

53
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,895
What if the latest coma
caused a relapse?

54
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:55,810
So how are we doing?

55
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,021
Confused.

56
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:02,252
Let's see if we can clear up
some of those cobwebs.

57
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,696
Do you remember the explosion?

58
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:06,417
Yes.

59
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,613
But where were you
when it happened?

60
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,576
Kuwait.

61
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,095
<i>l have good news.</i>

62
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,016
Gibbs has regained consciousness.

63
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:21,175
That's great.

64
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,855
However, there's also a problem.

65
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,979
He has some memory loss.

66
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:29,619
Retrogressive amnesia
is totally normal after severe trauma.

67
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:31,818
Happens every time the boss
smacks me on the head.

68
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,893
You know,
l had amnesia after my car crash.

69
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,053
Your bumper car
got T-boned at Legoland, probie?

70
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:39,100
No, Tony. l told you about when l
totalled my Camaro when l was 1 6.

71
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,695
That day is still a blank to me.

72
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:43,695
Well, Gibbs' blank
is the last 1 5 years.

73
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,173
To him, it's 1 991 .

74
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:50,379
and he's a Marine gunny sergeant
wounded in Desert Storm.

75
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:53,297
He doesn't know
he's an NClS special agent?

76
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:54,861
l doubt it.

77
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,614
He didn't recognise Ducky.

78
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:00,291
Wait. lf he doesn't know
who Ducky is, then there's no--

79
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:01,941
He'll never remember us.

80
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,616
l am sure it's a temporary condition.
ln the meantime,

81
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:08,058
we have an Abu Sayyaf terrorist
to apprehend.

82
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,133
l really don't know anything more,
Abby.

83
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,655
Can l go visit him?

84
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:16,140
Not just yet.

85
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:19,100
His neurologist, Captain Gelfand,
will let us know when he's up to it.

86
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,737
Can l run to the restroom?
l'll come right back.

87
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,940
lf anyone else needs a potty break,

88
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:30,412
now's the time to do it.
We meet at 1 7 1 0.

89
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,381
You know what that means?

90
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,214
The director's taking over
the investigation.

91
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:39,818
Probably. But l was thinking if Gibbs
doesn't remember the last 1 5 years,

92
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,374
he'll be a probie.

93
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,578
Gibbs would never let her take over.

94
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,778
Not the old Gibbs.

95
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,773
Probie Gibbs.

96
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,774
- Director Shepard?
- Yes, DiNozzo.

97
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:54,739
l want you to understand
that in Gibbs' absence,

98
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,700
as the team's senior special agent,
this investigation is mine.

99
00:05:57,902 --> 00:05:59,540
- ls it?
- Yes, it is, ma'am.

100
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,579
And if l were to dispute
that assumption?

101
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,494
Then you would be a fool.

102
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,857
And you are no fool, director.

103
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,820
This will be a long,
tough investigation.

104
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:12,461
You're overloaded as it is,
and no one knows this team

105
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:15,096
better than me,
except for the boss.

106
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:17,732
Which evidently isn't me.

107
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:21,292
l was speaking, of course,
of the team boss, Gibbs.

108
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:24,778
You are the agency boss.

109
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:28,379
Not if you keep telling me
what l can and cannot do.

110
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:32,820
- l would never do that, ma'am.
- Then what is it that you're saying?

111
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:37,740
You take care of the big picture,
and let me handle the two-reeler.

112
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,221
l always intended to, Tony.

113
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:46,455
Then why did you make me say
all that just now?

114
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,056
l just wanted to see
if you had as much guts as Gibbs.

115
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,696
What's the first thing you remember
after the explosion?

116
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,771
<i>Did you know when Jethro</i>
<i>was married he had a daughter?</i>

117
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,612
No, that's not possible.

118
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:20,331
l know all three of Jethro's ex-wives.
They had no children.

119
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:23,016
With his first wife, Shannon, he did.

120
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,020
They married in '82

121
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:31,175
and had a daughter, Kelly,
who was born in '84.

122
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:35,656
l can't believe it.

123
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,938
There's more.

124
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:42,055
They were murdered when Jethro
was fighting in Desert Storm.

125
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:45,578
Shannon witnessed the shooting
of a Marine in Oceanside.

126
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:49,576
She identified the killer
as Pedro Hernandez,

127
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:52,131
a Mexican drug dealer
working Camp Pendleton.

128
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:54,896
An NlS agent was assigned
to protect her.

129
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:59,101
A sniper shot him in the head
while he was driving their van.

130
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,580
He died instantly.

131
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:05,735
Shannon and Jethro's
8-year-old daughter Kelly

132
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,614
were killed in the crash.

133
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,098
That is so awful.

134
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,530
Kelly looked a lot like Jethro,
didn't she?

135
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:20,533
Yes, a bit.

136
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,060
She's a beautiful child.

137
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,974
Very.

138
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:27,851
So was Shannon.

139
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,856
Jethro always did like redheads.

140
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,500
Was Hernandez ever caught?

141
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,301
No. He fled to Mexico.

142
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:39,975
NlS tried to extradite,

143
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,015
but the Mexican authorities
always claimed they couldn't find him.

144
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,175
lt's in our cold case files.

145
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,175
Well, you can close it.

146
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,098
- What do you know?
- Jethro would have pursued

147
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:53,299
the killer of his wife and daughter
to hell and back.

148
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,460
Jethro got his revenge.

149
00:08:56,622 --> 00:09:00,217
After conducting the autopsy,
Ducky is virtually certain

150
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:03,852
Abog Galib was inside the oil drum
when the explosive detonated.

151
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,053
Why would he be
in a laundry oil drum?

152
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,894
Maybe he was looking
for his laundry.

153
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:11,054
- This is serious, Abby.
- Listen to the pot call the kettle black.

154
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,053
- Got that right, didn't l?
- No.

155
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,735
Yes.

156
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,860
Probie,
why was Galib in that oil drum?

157
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,256
He was hiding.

158
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:24,296
- From who? Gibbs?
- Maybe. He ran from Gibbs,

159
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,817
even though the plan was
to get arrested in front of the crew.

160
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,450
Another question.
How did Pinpin Pula know

161
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:31,738
Gibbs and Galib
would be in the ship's laundry?

162
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:35,736
Right. Because they would have had
to put the bomb inside the oil drum

163
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,893
- before they got there.
- Gibbs knows.

164
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:39,859
Gibbs also thinks
the Giants won the Super Bowl

165
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,536
and <i>Dances with Wolves</i>
is an Academy Award nominee.

166
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:44,021
- l loved that movie.
- Me too.

167
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,059
Those Native Americans
were so macho in their--

168
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:47,541
Enough.

169
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:50,381
Abby, l want a reenactment
of the explosion, okay?

170
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,021
Using crime-scene photos,
measurements,

171
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,615
- Ducky's--
- Ducky's autopsy findings?

172
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,977
l know how to do
a computer reenactment, Tony.

173
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:59,421
Ziva, what did you get out of the cook,
what's-his-name?

174
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:03,575
Alon Atu. From the same
Filipino village in Basilan as Pinpin.

175
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:05,494
He's hardcore Abu Sayyaf.

176
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:07,733
- He won't talk unless l--
- No torture.

177
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,221
He won't talk.

178
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:12,141
- Try.
- Okay. But you're tying my feet.

179
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:15,331
- Hands.
- Those too.

180
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,413
McGee, Pinpin's photo
get added to the BOLO?

181
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,413
- Yes, Tony.
- Sealift Command get it?

182
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,254
They are faxing it to all 1 1 0 ships.

183
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,901
No way he's gonna infiltrate Sealift.

184
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,939
He blew up Galib
and put Gibbs in a coma.

185
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:27,855
Rule Number 3:
never underestimate your opponent.

186
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:32,812
- No, actually Rule Number 3--
- DiNozzo's Rule <i>Numero Tres</i>, probie.

187
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,654
Gotcha.

188
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,699
Never underestimate your opponent.

189
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:56,936
Hey, Galib.

190
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,817
<i>Today, technology stocks</i>--

191
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,974
He's trying to catch up
on 1 5 years by watching TV.

192
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,860
Jethro hates television.

193
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:18,172
He can't believe
we're still fighting in lraq.

194
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:19,457
<i>He's not alone.</i>

195
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,781
Does he remember being
an NClS special agent?

196
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,935
No.
Dr. Mallard's still a stranger to him.

197
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,172
He won't know me then.

198
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,259
Ducky worked with him
years before l did.

199
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:32,259
<i>Well, who an amnesiac remembers</i>

200
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,251
depends on their prior relationship.

201
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,778
Have you found any Marines
he served with in Desert Storm?

202
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,775
Two so far. One's dead.

203
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,012
The other's a
regimental commander in lraq.

204
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,571
Well, Gibbs recalls visiting his wife
and daughter's graves.

205
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:49,937
So his memory is up to at least
June of '91 ,

206
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:51,854
when he was released
from Bethesda.

207
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:54,331
He joined NlS that August.

208
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,180
<i>How about somebody he knew</i>
<i>at NlS?</i>

209
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:02,135
Special Agent Michael Franks
headed the murder investigation.

210
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,179
l'll start with him.

211
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,582
- Thanks, Todd.
- When are you coming to see him?

212
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,494
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

213
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,614
l'll be here.

214
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:44,214
Special Agent Franks retired in '96.

215
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:47,419
He left no forwarding address
or phone number.

216
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,775
- Yes, he did.
- He did?

217
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:54,537
Find out where OPM
mails his retirement cheques.

218
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,134
l just got paid.

219
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,418
Then you can pay me
for the groceries.

220
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:30,493
You owe me 320 pesos.

221
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:39,697
Your hand is greasy.

222
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,096
- Who you calling?
- <i>Operator.</i>

223
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,741
- l don't know.
- <i>How may l help you?</i>

224
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:45,494
Collect call
from Senor Miguel Franks.

225
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,580
- <i>One moment.</i>
- They called you at the cantina.

226
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:51,859
- Who called me?
- <i>Connecting.</i>

227
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:55,291
Who the hell is this?

228
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,177
Director Shepard's assistant,
Mr. Franks.

229
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,731
- Director of what?
- <i>NClS, sir.</i>

230
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,419
Why the hell didn't you ask me?

231
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,937
They said it was <i>muy importante</i>.

232
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:09,900
What is the <i>problema</i>? lt's free.

233
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:17,180
- Speak.
- One moment. l'll connect you.

234
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:20,211
Mr. Franks?

235
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:23,215
How many damn assistants
does the director have?

236
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,491
- Just one.
- Then who the hell are you?

237
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:28,732
Director Shepard of NClS.

238
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,741
Charlene, is this you?

239
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:40,373
No. My name is Jenny Shepard
and l am director of NClS.

240
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,937
- Thank the Lord.
- <i>That mean you approve?</i>

241
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:48,380
Means all my thoughts
at early retirement was a mistake,

242
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,653
just proved themselves wrong.

243
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:54,292
l didn't call you to discuss
your opinions of a female director.

244
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:55,736
Didn't think you did.

245
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:57,976
l need your help,

246
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,216
Special Agent Franks.

247
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:02,978
Ain't been that for 1 1 years.

248
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:06,618
- Goodbye, director.
- Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

249
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,373
Can you imagine
how scary that would be

250
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,134
to lose the last 1 5 years of your life?

251
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,701
- Oh, my God.
- What?

252
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:17,181
You'd still be in high school.

253
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:21,182
Zits. Braces. Raging hormones.

254
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:24,061
l used to walk around all day
with my notebook in front of my--

255
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,856
ln front of your what, McGee?

256
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,620
The laundry room is off.

257
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:35,741
lt should actually be
3.962 metres wide. Not 26.

258
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,534
- Better?
- Yeah.

259
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,101
Gotta be accurate.

260
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:45,336
Absolutely. So was it
one of those tiny spiral notebooks

261
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:49,415
or one of those big three-ring binder
kind of ones, Timmy?

262
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,140
And where were you 1 5 years ago,
Abby?

263
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,770
So where did you find Gibbs?

264
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,216
Afraid l'm gonna find out--

265
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,901
- What was that for?
- Distracting me.

266
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:59,576
- l was not distracting you--
- Gibbs.

267
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,653
Between the dryer
and the bulkhead.

268
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,340
A little closer to the bulkhead.

269
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:08,893
The autopsy report indicates
that Galib was sitting on the bomb.

270
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:12,816
Which consisted of 1 1 3 grams
of Semtex.

271
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:15,621
You can compute the amount
of Semtex used that accurately?

272
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,056
l am a scientist, McGee.

273
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:18,780
l can compute anything accurately,

274
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,331
including the size of the
notebook required to--

275
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,935
Stop.

276
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,820
Can you detonate the bomb,
please?

277
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:32,060
Sorry.
l forgot to tell you l added sound.

278
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,532
Yeah. Can we try that again
without sound?

279
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,055
Yeah, it was a little loud, huh?

280
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,415
Yeah. And let's go frame-by-frame
so we can see what happened.

281
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,140
Of course.

282
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:43,816
ln the first microsecond,

283
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:46,496
less than the time
it takes for you to blink your eye,

284
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:49,654
the bottom of the barrel
and Galib's lower body are atomized.

285
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,620
The oil drum is disintegrating,
but retains enough integrity

286
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:55,535
to blow what remains of Galib
into the overhead.

287
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,021
ln the following microseconds

288
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:00,497
the oil drum disintegrates.

289
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,254
Galib is impacted into the overhead

290
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,778
and Gibbs is...

291
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,620
- ...dead.
- Dead.

292
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,738
lf Gibbs had been standing
when the bomb detonated,

293
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,416
he'd have been blasted into the
bulkhead and shredded by shrapnel.

294
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,538
Gibbs had to duck for cover
before the bomb went off.

295
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,135
- He knew.
- Yeah.

296
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,655
What's wrong with this picture?

297
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,211
Nothing. McGee and l triple checked
all the numbers to make--

298
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,816
Not your picture.
Did l make another idiomatic mistake?

299
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:29,213
No. You mean something's wrong
with what we know.

300
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,170
Exactly. We know Galib ran.
We know Gibbs pursued him.

301
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:34,741
We know they were
in the ship's laundry.

302
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:37,814
We know Galib sat on a bomb
inside the oil drum.

303
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:39,381
And thanks to Abby and McGee,

304
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,658
we know Gibbs knew
that a bomb was about to explode.

305
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,540
Oh, and we know Pinpin,

306
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:47,377
a missing crewman on the <i>Kamir</i>
<i>Bakir</i> is an Abu Sayyaf terrorist.

307
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,498
Probably the one who planted
and detonated the bomb.

308
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:51,493
You left out Pinpin Pula means
''rice paddy dike'',

309
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:53,493
but other than that,
damn good summation.

310
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,857
- Thank you.
- So as Ziva said,

311
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,819
what is wrong with this picture?

312
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,700
Gibbs knows.

313
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,376
But he doesn't remember.

314
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,019
Jethro?

315
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,736
Shannon?

316
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:19,690
No, Jethro. lt's me, Jenny.

317
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,380
You still don't remember me?

318
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:42,060
Maybe.

319
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:43,775
l'm Jenny.

320
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,259
We were partners.

321
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,892
After Shannon died.

322
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,461
Yes.

323
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:57,981
Did l marry again?

324
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,100
Three times.

325
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:05,412
- No way.
- Afraid so.

326
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,737
Oh, you're an ex-wife?

327
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:13,132
Oh, God no.

328
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:17,656
l'm the director of NClS.

329
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,931
For a moment l thought
you were somebody else.

330
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:32,291
You remembered us making love,
didn't you, Jethro?

331
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,577
At least that's a start.

332
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,699
Do you recognise this man?

333
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,852
lt's like a name on the tip of my tongue
and l can't remember.

334
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,536
- Calm down. lt'll come.
- lt's important, isn't it?

335
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:24,818
- Yes. Very.
- lt's life or death, right?

336
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,893
Don't get upset, Jethro.
You won't remember.

337
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,051
Give me a name.

338
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,937
Pinpin Pula.

339
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,939
That's not his name.

340
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:36,411
That can't be his name.

341
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:38,493
- Are you sure?
- No. l'm not sure.

342
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:40,971
l don't remember.
How can l be sure?

343
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,534
- What's happening?
- l'm sorry. lt's my fault.

344
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,691
1 0 milligrams of morphine.

345
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:46,614
Agent Gibbs, your blood pressure
is spiking.

346
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:49,012
l'm not Agent Gibbs.
l don't know Agent Gibbs.

347
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,774
l don't wanna know Agent Gibbs.

348
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,302
l want my family. l want Shannon.

349
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:56,455
l want...

350
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,820
...Kelly.

351
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,939
l miss them.

352
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:05,297
l miss them so much.

353
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:15,897
Normally we'd move you
to a regular room, but for once

354
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,581
the hospital is full up,
and lCU isn't.

355
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:23,298
Having the sound off
isn't gonna help your memory.

356
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:27,421
Nothing new. Same war.
Same crime. Same politics.

357
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:31,419
Aren't you surprised The Terminator
is the governor of California?

358
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,460
No. The Gipper was president.

359
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:36,861
l'll be right back with your dinner.

360
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:40,617
And none of that baby food, okay?
A steak. Rare would be nice.

361
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,010
And French fries, please?

362
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,218
Maybe tomorrow.

363
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,658
Tomorrow l won't be here.

364
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,339
Hello, probie.

365
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:57,814
<i>My brother and l</i>
<i>married the same woman twice.</i>

366
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:01,292
- Twice.
- She was a hell of a woman, probie.

367
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,180
Hey, boss.

368
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,651
Damn, you got old, Marine.

369
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:12,290
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

370
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,979
lf you hadn't been in a coma...

371
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:19,859
They're dead, Mike.

372
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:24,380
Shannon and Kelly,
they're both dead.

373
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:25,976
l know, Jethro.

374
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:32,297
lt can't have been 1 5 years.

375
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:35,774
Can it?

376
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:43,259
God, it feels like l just got the news
in Kuwait a couple of months ago.

377
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:51,220
You investigated Shannon's murder.

378
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:53,498
That's how l met you.

379
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:55,858
Camp Pendleton.

380
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:59,780
You were
the special agent in charge.

381
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,140
Yeah.

382
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,092
l became an agent because of you.

383
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,934
You left the sniper folder
on your desk so l could--

384
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,336
So l could join NlS.

385
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,011
l liked the blue better, boss.

386
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,380
NClS. The Navy changed the name
that same year.

387
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:31,491
1 990? 90...?

388
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,300
Two.

389
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:35,813
We investigated crime scenes.

390
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,891
l investigated crime scenes.

391
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:41,336
You schlepped.

392
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:43,458
ln Nam l packed twice
what you're carrying

393
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,971
through monsoon mud
with Charlie shooting at my ass

394
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:48,019
and still went faster than you.

395
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:53,333
You taught me how to be an agent.

396
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:56,381
No. l didn't teach.

397
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,533
You observed.

398
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:02,654
<i>Nineteen U.S. servicemen killed,</i>
<i>37 2 wounded.</i>

399
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,255
<i>Khobar Towers.</i>

400
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:10,213
<i>Semper fi.</i>

401
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:15,741
Khobar Towers.

402
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:21,734
You warned them about Bin Laden.

403
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,259
They didn't listen.

404
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:26,613
And you quit.

405
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:28,375
l didn't quit.

406
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,374
l retired.

407
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:34,091
You were pissed
that they wouldn't listen, Mike.

408
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:37,780
Pissed that all Clinton did was lob
a couple of cruise missiles

409
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,615
at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.

410
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,939
You quit, Mike.

411
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:49,897
l didn't get calluses on my ass
flying from Mexico to argue, Jethro.

412
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:53,900
Okay.

413
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,733
You're right. l'm sorry.

414
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:00,497
Never say you're sorry.

415
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:04,371
- lt's a sign of weakness.
- Why are you here, Mike?

416
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,333
Your director called me in.

417
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:11,415
What's with the female
NClS director crap?

418
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,493
l don't know.
l only remember Jenny as a--

419
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:16,130
- Jenny?
- Yeah.

420
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,572
Jenny.
She said she was my partner.

421
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,535
What kind of partner?

422
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:23,179
You can't smoke in here.

423
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:26,937
l forgot l was in a hospital.

424
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:29,332
lt's against the law to smoke
in any public building.

425
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:31,094
You're kidding.

426
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,256
Another good reason
to live in Mexico.

427
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,015
You were right, Dr. Mallard.

428
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,501
For once?

429
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:44,415
- No, doctor. You--
- What am l right about this time?

430
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:45,856
Galib and the oil drum.

431
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:47,455
Abby's computer re-creation looks

432
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:49,692
exactly like he's been shot
from a cannon.

433
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:54,458
Well, it's a risky occupation
even without explosives.

434
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,090
They don't use explosives
to shoot people out of cannons?

435
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:58,934
A man of your age and education?

436
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:00,535
Really, Mr. Palmer.

437
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:03,136
l know that they don't use
high explosives.

438
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:05,418
l thought maybe black powder.

439
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:08,699
Compressed air
or spring-driven catapults

440
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:11,854
shoot our intrepid
cannonballer into the air.

441
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:15,253
David ''Cannonball'' Smith
set the record.

442
00:26:15,422 --> 00:26:20,052
Yes, he even was fired across
the Mexican-United States border.

443
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,338
He carried a passport,

444
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:25,175
although today one wonders why.

445
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:29,779
lt's a sad fact that 60 percent
of all human cannonballs

446
00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:31,375
are eventually killed.

447
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,579
Well, if they don't use explosives,
then why do so many of them die?

448
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,417
They miss the net, Mr. Palmer.

449
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,696
They miss the-- Oh, my.

450
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,375
What is it, doctor?

451
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,056
Galib wasn't sitting in the oil drum.

452
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:49,659
He was stuffed in it.

453
00:26:50,462 --> 00:26:51,781
Look.

454
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,261
The neck bone's cut.

455
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:00,778
Cervical vertebrae was cut
very deeply.

456
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:03,376
You were slashed from ear to ear,
weren't you?

457
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,975
A machete or a bolo knife.

458
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:08,532
Yes, l believe
the Filipinos call it a parang.

459
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,932
Whatever they're called,
it answers one of our questions.

460
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,615
And poses a new one.

461
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:14,340
lf Galib was dead--

462
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:17,300
Who did Gibbs follow
into the laundry?

463
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,573
- Clear.
- Clear.

464
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,975
Got a pulse.
Give him a mil of atropine.

465
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,861
- Got him at 82 over 58.
- Getting better, ladies.

466
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:28,651
Blood pressure is coming up.
Death is not my jam.

467
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,172
You haven't touched your dinner,
Special Agent Gibbs.

468
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:40,818
No steak tomorrow
if you don't eat your Jell-O today.

469
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:45,010
You got your knife, Mike?

470
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:47,101
Security took it at the airport.

471
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,419
Was it more than three inches long?

472
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:51,891
They changed that rule after 9/1 1 .

473
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:53,734
9/1 1 ?

474
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:56,939
September 1 1th, 2001 .

475
00:27:57,102 --> 00:28:01,812
Hey, boss. lt's '96
and you just retired.

476
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,820
Damn, this is good.

477
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:06,581
l owe you.

478
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,098
Had to be a hijacking, huh?

479
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:14,139
They never change security
until it's too late.

480
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,614
Al Qaeda hijacked four airliners.

481
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:30,892
Two hit the World Trade Centre.

482
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:33,417
One the Pentagon.

483
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,774
Fourth was to take out
the White House.

484
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:41,773
Some gutsy passengers
fought them.

485
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,739
They went down in Pennsylvania.

486
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,297
Twin Towers are gone.

487
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,933
Pentagon's fixed.

488
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:55,812
Three thousand some dead.

489
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,931
Nearly as many wounded.

490
00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:07,821
Sir?

491
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:12,377
- Are you all right?
- He's okay.

492
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,692
Got some bad news.

493
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:28,778
That nurse is right.

494
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:31,502
l'm not ready for a steak yet.

495
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:37,821
Well, tell me we did more than
toss a couple of cruise missiles.

496
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:40,537
We did more.

497
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:41,976
Bin Laden?

498
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:44,702
- l don't know.
- How the hell can you not know?

499
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:52,131
Remember that beach
in Baja we fished?

500
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:56,859
Yeah. South of El Rosario.

501
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,537
l built a little place there.

502
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:03,377
No TV, no radio, no newspapers.

503
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:06,614
l fish. l drink beer.

504
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:09,171
Listen to old eight-track tapes.

505
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:13,335
Drive to a cantina up the coast
when l want company

506
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:14,901
when the pickup's running.

507
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:17,337
This is the first time

508
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:21,177
l've been to <i>El Norte</i> in 1 0 years.

509
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:24,937
Don't ask me for a sit-rep, Jethro.
l don't know.

510
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,770
You don't wanna know.

511
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,812
That's right. l don't wanna know.

512
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:31,734
You feel guilty because you quit.

513
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:36,375
lf you hadn't quit
maybe you're the one that stops it.

514
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,378
You didn't quit.

515
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:12,213
Hey, Galib. What are you up to?

516
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:14,174
Stretching my legs.
lt's too windy on deck.

517
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,492
Hey, why don't you join
the poker game tonight?

518
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,061
You never leave
that damn radio room.

519
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:20,338
l talk to ham radio operators
at night.

520
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,538
And you'd rather do that
than play poker?

521
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:25,493
- They're all girls.
- Right.

522
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,856
You insist this is Pinpin Pula.

523
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:42,332
lnsist. Yes.

524
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:45,699
l like this word.
l insist this is Pinpin.

525
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,659
l don't believe you.

526
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,699
Why would l lie to you
when you threaten to kill me?

527
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:53,411
lt is not a threat.
l will kill you if you lie, <i>capitan.</i>

528
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:54,810
l believe you.

529
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:56,734
l'm the one who has doubts.

530
00:31:58,022 --> 00:32:00,217
lt is Pinpin. l swear.

531
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,573
That's not loaded, is it?

532
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:08,893
Would Gibbs allow Ziva
to carry a loaded weapon in there?

533
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:12,372
- No.
- And l'm not Gibbs, right?

534
00:32:13,062 --> 00:32:14,495
<i>So,</i> capitan.

535
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,094
You're positive?

536
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:23,891
l am positive. Absolutely positive.
How many times do l have to tell you?

537
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,491
Once more.

538
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:30,658
- Take a good look.
- l don't need to look.

539
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:32,813
The man was on my ship
for months.

540
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,495
lt's Pinpin Pula.

541
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,414
Was he Abu Sayyaf?

542
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,174
Yes. He was Abu Sayyaf.

543
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:42,130
- Who ran from customs?
- Yes. Yes. He ran when your guy--

544
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:47,300
You knew it was Pinpin,
not Galib, at the custom's gate.

545
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,253
Yes, l knew. l knew.
They paid me. l was quiet.

546
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:53,855
They paid me to be quiet.

547
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,933
But Pinpin never told me
there was a bomb.

548
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:58,013
l never knew that. l never knew--

549
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:03,901
That's the NClS lD photo
of Special Agent Abog Galib

550
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:05,939
that l showed Gibbs.
What's your point, DiNozzo?

551
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:07,330
A scary one, director.

552
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:11,773
Captain Mahir admitted to Ziva
that Pinpin passed himself off

553
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:13,421
as Galib at the custom's check.

554
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:15,174
And Gibbs would have
expected Galib

555
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:16,980
to change his appearance
going undercover.

556
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:20,179
Growing his hair, maybe a moustache,
dirty himself up.

557
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:23,539
So when Pinpin handed him Galib's
passport it was good enough.

558
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,454
- To pass the mustard.
- Muster, not mustard.

559
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:29,376
Galib's documents are vetted
to get him on any crew in the world.

560
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,975
lncluding the <i>Cape Fear</i>
or <i>Cape Horn</i>.

561
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,939
We sent a second BOLO
with Pinpin's photo.

562
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,013
Both ships confirmed,
he was not onboard.

563
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,379
Send it again a.k.a. Abog Galib.
Get me the crew rosters

564
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,816
- from Sealift Command.
- On it.

565
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,292
DiNozzo, call MTAC.
l want the NSO, Pentagon, FBl, ClA,

566
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:46,056
hell, everyone on ASAP.

567
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:48,340
My gut tells me
we're missing something.

568
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,650
Gibbs.

569
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:53,896
Yeah, Gibbs.

570
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:18,739
- Yeah?
- Ziva.

571
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,010
- Do we work together?
- Yes.

572
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:26,855
l'm a Mossad officer
attached to your team.

573
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,217
Mossad?
When did they start doing that?

574
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:30,940
lt's been a year.

575
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,334
Don't feel bad.
l worked with that M.E.--

576
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:36,617
Ducky. 1 0 years.

577
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,897
And you don't remember him.

578
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:39,461
Do you always finish
people's sentences?

579
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:41,180
Only when l'm in a hurry.

580
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:46,373
Abu Sayyaf is planning
a terrorist attack on the Navy.

581
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,056
- lt will be as devastating as--
- 9/1 1 .

582
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:51,374
You remember 9/1 1 ?

583
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,941
My boss told me.

584
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,058
- Director Shepard.
- No. No, my boss.

585
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:58,498
lt doesn't matter. What can l do?

586
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:00,141
Remember.

587
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:02,862
l've been trying to since l woke up
in this room.

588
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:04,011
Well, try harder.

589
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,335
Good. That's a start.

590
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,213
- What is?
- The old Gibbs stare.

591
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:13,738
You gave it to all of us.
McGee, Tony, me.

592
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,935
What are you talking about?

593
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:27,500
Ari.

594
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,213
Ari killed Kate.

595
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:35,450
And l--

596
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:40,137
l killed Ari.

597
00:35:48,742 --> 00:35:50,494
Your brother.

598
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,461
Yes.

599
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,700
You killed your brother...

600
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:58,855
...to save me.

601
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:16,611
- l'm sure he remembers you, Ducky.
- Ziva's driving him here now.

602
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:18,534
l don't know.
Maybe she pulled her signal in.

603
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:20,340
- Ziva's bringing him.
- He's coming back.

604
00:36:20,502 --> 00:36:22,538
- He will remember you, absolutely.
- He insisted.

605
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,499
Any minute now.

606
00:36:25,302 --> 00:36:26,894
- Boss.
- McGee.

607
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:30,657
- Boss, no, l'm McGee.
- Gibbs.

608
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:32,854
Hey, Abby.

609
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:34,535
l do remember you, Abs.

610
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,497
Ducky, how can l forget
your mother left you on a bus?

611
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,459
l have no idea, Jethro.

612
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:41,419
- Should you be out, Gibbs?
- l don't have time.

613
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:43,413
l'll talk to you both later.

614
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:47,820
l should have known it wasn't Galib.

615
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:49,335
Oh, no.

616
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:51,015
l'd have made the same mistake.

617
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:52,661
Well, yeah, DiNozzo. l know.

618
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:54,096
That's why l'm so pissed.

619
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:57,133
You didn't forget me.

620
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:01,817
The <i>Cape Fear</i> is loaded
with 20,000 tons of munitions,

621
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,017
Deputy Director Welch.

622
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,252
<i>Which is why we cannot permit her</i>
<i>to reach Gibraltar</i>

623
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:06,901
<i>without boarding</i>
<i>a Navy search team.</i>

624
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:10,850
Agreed. But if that frigate signals a
heave-to and prepare to be boarded,

625
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:14,219
Pinpin Pula will blow the <i>Cape Fear</i>.
No one will survive.

626
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,737
<i>lf he's on board</i>
<i>and if he's a suicide bomber.</i>

627
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,292
<i>You're risking 19 civilian lives</i>
<i>on ifs, Director Welsh.</i>

628
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:22,737
<i>ln the Med he could explode</i>
<i>near a cruise ship.</i>

629
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,097
<i>Nineteen will seem</i>
<i>an acceptable loss</i>--

630
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:27,298
No death is acceptable
when it's unnecessary.

631
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,418
Deputy Director Welsh,
Special Agent Gibbs.

632
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,215
This terrorist isn't after
a cruise liner.

633
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,179
<i>lslamic terrorists love soft targets.</i>

634
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:37,094
No, he wants
the Marine assault ship

635
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,741
the <i>Cape Fear</i>'s replenishing
in the Gulf.

636
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:41,052
<i>You don't know what he wants.</i>
<i>He's a terrorist.</i>

637
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:44,294
- <i>A cruise ship, the Suez Canal</i>--
- He told me.

638
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,054
<i>He told you?</i>

639
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,019
Pinpin Pula is an arrogant
son-of-a-bitch.

640
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,173
He thought the bomb
he'd planted would kill me.

641
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,219
<i>So he's not a suicide bomber?</i>

642
00:37:52,382 --> 00:37:54,976
For God's sakes,
order that frigate to break off.

643
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:58,978
<i>l can't do that.</i>

644
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,258
ls everyone up there
as stupid as you?

645
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,336
Pinpin Pula is on the <i>Cape Fear</i>.

646
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:05,776
He's the radio man.

647
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:07,614
He intercepts every BOLO
we send him

648
00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,613
and he replies ''No Pinpin here.''

649
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:11,818
<i>We got that, Special Agent Gibbs.</i>

650
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:15,531
<i>lt's why we didn't communicate</i>
<i>with</i> Cape Fear <i>until...</i>

651
00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:17,256
<i>...now.</i>

652
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,935
Jeff. Thank God you're there.

653
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:21,536
Can you get your SEALs
onboard without being seen?

654
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,658
<i>We can execute a HALO insertion</i>
<i>within 1 0 hours.</i>

655
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,416
<i>The</i> Cape Fear <i>will have entered</i>
<i>the Med. That's unacceptable.</i>

656
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:29,380
<i>lf anything happens,</i>
<i>it'll be on some tourist video camera.</i>

657
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,976
The sailors on that frigate
have video cameras.

658
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:34,053
<i>We can confiscate those videos.</i>

659
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:38,056
What?
You don't want this being seen?

660
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:41,771
<i>An accident at sea</i>
<i>is better than an act of terrorism.</i>

661
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,221
lt's too late.

662
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:46,701
Cape Fear, <i>heave-to.</i>

663
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:48,739
<i>Stand by to be boarded</i>
<i>for inspection.</i>

664
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,974
<i>Heave-to. Stand by</i>
<i>to be boarded for inspection.</i>

665
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:54,660
You bastard.

666
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:22,100
l was wrong.

667
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:26,976
You weren't wrong.

668
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,698
l was angry at Mike.

669
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:34,215
l never understood
how he could quit...

670
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:41,734
...until now.

671
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:54,372
Oh, l got them, boss.

672
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:57,773
l got them from the medics
when they took you.

673
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:00,494
Appreciate it.

674
00:40:05,742 --> 00:40:07,334
You'll do.

675
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:16,133
lt's your team now.

676
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,939
Tim, you're a good agent.

677
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:28,093
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

678
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,014
l won't, boss.

679
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:34,020
Gibbs.

680
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:52,781
l owe you, Ziva.

681
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:55,980
l'll collect, Jethro.

682
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:01,894
- Give me a ride home, Duck.
- Of course.

683
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,333
<i>Semper fi.</i>
