1
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:38,655
Be patient, boys.

2
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:14,534
Now listen, l need a table
on the terrace for Friday at 9:00.

3
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:18,815
Not negotiable. Tell Valentino
it's Anthony DiNozzo, we're friends.

4
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,017
Ciao.

5
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:23,450
Valentino's, huh?

6
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:27,541
- Must be a special occasion.
- l'm taking Monica for her birthday.

7
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,979
l know a place in Georgetown.
Just as romantic, half the price.

8
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,776
That's a good idea, probie, but
Monica's not the Applebee's type.

9
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,532
l've never seen you like this.
You really like this girl.

10
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:41,940
Well, she's got the whole package.
Beauty, class, sophistication.

11
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:45,139
All that's left is to decide
on the perfect gift.

12
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,577
l thought you gave all your girls
Honey Dust.

13
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,777
How do you--? Probie,
something you want to tell me?

14
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,098
- lt's not my fault.
- Don't be embarrassed, Tony.

15
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:58,733
l find the taste of Honey Dust
to be extremely erotic.

16
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:01,576
- What a coincidence, so do l.
- l don't.

17
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,376
Gear up. We're heading for Dumfries.
A corporal's wife is missing.

18
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:06,857
Local police think
she may have been abducted.

19
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:09,092
What did l tell you about
my personal life?

20
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:10,251
She tricked me again.

21
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:12,333
Why don't you tell her
how l lost my virginity?

22
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,180
l've been meaning
to ask you about that.

23
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:18,574
How does a 1 5-year-old boy
go about meeting a coquette?

24
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,250
She means Rockette, boss.

25
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,781
Where did these people
come from?

26
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:30,542
Didn't you see the signs?
lt's yard sale day.

27
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:33,614
l see.
And do Marines sell their yards often?

28
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:36,012
No, it's when people gather
stuff they don't want anymore

29
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,501
and sell it in their yards.

30
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,613
Why would anyone want to buy
somebody else's junk?

31
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,534
One man's junk
is another man's treasure.

32
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:42,970
ln lsrael, we have a saying:

33
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,736
Crap is crap.

34
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:49,257
Her name is Jamie Carr.

35
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:52,301
Police got a call from the neighbour.
No one's seen her in two weeks.

36
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:55,016
- Why are they assuming abduction?
- Back door's kicked in.

37
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:57,093
- McGee, you take the perimeter.
- On it.

38
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,293
Ziva, check with the neighbour
who called it in.

39
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:00,491
Tony, you're with me.

40
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:03,495
ls there a reason
l'm always the one taking statements?

41
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,579
Obviously you're good
at getting people to talk.

42
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:07,653
Don't blame McGee.
l was merely being curious.

43
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:10,217
- About my sex life?
- About American customs.

44
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:13,101
Some of the men l've been meeting
seem to be a little,

45
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:16,021
how you say, uptight?

46
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:17,815
Define uptight.

47
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,492
- Today, DiNozzo.
- On your six, boss.

48
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:32,452
l feel like l just walked into
page eight of the lKEA catalogue.

49
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,021
Used to shop there
back in college.

50
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:36,138
- Really reasonable prices.
- Get to work, DiNozzo.

51
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:43,492
- l take it the husband's deployed.
- lraq.

52
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,051
- Six months into his second tour.
- They bringing him home?

53
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:47,621
Depends what we find here.

54
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,855
DiNozzo, have McGee
break out the luminol.

55
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:01,933
- You got blood?
- Someone decided to clean up

56
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,013
a 1 2-inch spot on this carpet.
What do you think?

57
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:08,660
You need to relax your eyes.

58
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:10,972
lt's a hidden 3-D picture.

59
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:13,138
lf you look at it just right,
a palm tree appears.

60
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:14,971
l think it is broken.

61
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,415
Hey, l'm watching you guys.

62
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,971
Kids from down the street.
They've got sticky fingers.

63
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:21,621
Tell me about Mrs. Carr.

64
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,500
She pretty much keeps to herself.

65
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:25,374
Never clicked
with the rest of the wives.

66
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,413
Are you in the military, Mr. Powell?

67
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,056
No, my wife is.
She's a staff sergeant in the Corps.

68
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:32,611
- Deployed?
- Yeah, to Wal-Mart.

69
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,221
She should be back
in an hour or so.

70
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:36,338
- What do you do?
- Well, Corps takes up

71
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:39,654
most of my wife's time, so l take care
of the kids and the house.

72
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:42,700
You are a domesticated
househusband?

73
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,735
Well, l never heard it
put quite like that,

74
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,699
but, yeah, l suppose l am.

75
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:50,217
- ls crime a problem around here?
- Are you kidding?

76
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,259
lt's a Marine neighbourhood.
We have no crime.

77
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:54,293
l wouldn't say that.
You're about to get robbed.

78
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,573
Have your wife give me a call.

79
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,256
- Come on, get out of here.
- Run.

80
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:16,420
- So much for gone but not forgotten.
- Husband's away at war, DiNozzo.

81
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,778
People cope in different ways.

82
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,261
She's found at least
one way to cope.

83
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,737
Careful.
You could poke an eye out with that.

84
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:35,093
Twist the end, Tony.

85
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,974
Haviar Christian Number Five.

86
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:48,297
lt's a perfume. Big in France.

87
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,578
Maybe that's what l'll get Monica
for her birthday.

88
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:54,020
- lt's $2,000 an ounce, Tony.
- Sounds steep.

89
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,661
She's not really
a perfume kind of gal.

90
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:58,382
l meant for a corporal's wife,
DiNozzo.

91
00:06:58,622 --> 00:06:59,975
l knew that.

92
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,140
l found some blood drops out back.

93
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,735
Hidden underneath some bags
of mulch.

94
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,580
Looks consistent
with a dragged body, boss.

95
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:07,811
Where exactly, McGee?

96
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,331
On the concrete patio.
l taped off the area.

97
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,741
Something wrong, McGee?

98
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:21,860
He's fine. He's just never been
in a woman's bedroom.

99
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,375
l've seen this room before.

100
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,013
- ln a video clip.
- Like a porno?

101
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:38,972
No, girlfriend is always e-mailing me
these lnternet videos.

102
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,252
She sent me one
of this room last week.

103
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,980
Why do l find that hard to believe?

104
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:46,213
You never get forwarded
weird videos to your e-mail?

105
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,936
All the time. l meant the part about you
having a girlfriend.

106
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:55,015
This clip showed a woman supposedly
being murdered live on the lnternet.

107
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,655
Why didn't you report it, McGee?

108
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,215
l assumed it was a hoax,
a badly made snuff film.

109
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,612
You know what happens
when you assume, McGee?

110
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,376
Yeah. Gibbs is going to kill me.

111
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,260
Again.

112
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:21,653
Doesn't look like a hoax to me,
McGee.

113
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,131
- Boss, l'm sorry. lt didn't occur to me--
- Abby, talk to me.

114
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,054
l was analysing the file, Gibbs.

115
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:30,335
lt's a compressed MPEG-4,
both fields are rendered using a Kodak

116
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,375
- that scales down the number of--
- ln English, Abby.

117
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,891
Well, from what l can tell,
it looks like the image is real.

118
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,377
There's no signs
of layered special effects or tampering.

119
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,021
Sorry, McGee.

120
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,898
l want to know where it came from.
You've got an hour.

121
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:45,736
Boss, l don't need an hour.
l scanned through Jamie's hard drive.

122
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,301
l found it.

123
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,655
That is Jamie Carr, or Rain,
on the right.

124
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,733
Her webcam ran a direct feed
into this website.

125
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,933
She was running a sex site
from her bedroom, Gibbs.

126
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,053
And her murder was recorded
during a live session

127
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,611
- and distributed throughout the net.
- By who?

128
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:03,933
Anyone that could have been logged
on to the site at the time.

129
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,656
- lt could be hundreds of people.
- Or thousands, Gibbs.

130
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:08,574
There's a big market
for desperate housewives

131
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:09,936
performing behind closed doors.

132
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,572
- Some of these ladies got rich doing it.
- Or dead, Abby.

133
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:15,534
- Who's the other girl?
- Net name's Skyler.

134
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,011
She runs the site.
l traced her webcam feed

135
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,979
back to the same neighbourhood
as Jamie Carr.

136
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,976
lt's the residence of Sergeant Jake
Roberts, also deployed in lraq,

137
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,370
his wife, Leanne, lives alone.

138
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:27,652
- Get the car.
- You got it, boss.

139
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,974
You know, it's not his fault, Gibbs.

140
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:36,250
lf we investigated every weird video
on the lnternet, l mean, you know?

141
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,058
Okay, you don't know, but trust me.

142
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:44,092
Cyberspace is crammed full
of all kinds of bizarre things.

143
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:47,817
lt's a whole new world in there, Gibbs,
and a lot of it ain't pretty.

144
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,542
You can say the same thing
about this one, Abs.

145
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,020
- l can't believe l didn't call it in.
- Don't beat yourself up, probie.

146
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,452
- Same thing happened to me once.
- Really? When?

147
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:05,099
Last month, frat brother e-mailed me
a video of a dachshund skateboarding.

148
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:06,695
l was positive it was a fake.

149
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:08,779
Then l turned on the TV
a few nights ago,

150
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,173
l saw the exact same dog
skateboarding on <i>Letterman</i>.

151
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:15,175
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?
- Probably not as much as you did

152
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:16,661
when you told Ziva my life story.

153
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:19,290
There's nobody home.

154
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,621
Hasn't been for a while.

155
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,535
Clear.

156
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,935
Clear.

157
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:51,974
lt's going to be a long night, McGee.

158
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:06,139
We have two crime scenes,
one website, zero bodies.

159
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:09,015
- l want some answers.
- Jamie Carr, Leanne Roberts,

160
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:11,975
started the Naughty Naughty
Neighbors website nine months ago.

161
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:15,930
The site has over 2,000 members
and records about 50,000 hits a day.

162
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,332
- ls that a lot?
- Let me give you some scope here.

163
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,652
Playboy.com, 5 million hits a day.

164
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,780
The official NClS website,
less than 400.

165
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,933
Which proves
what l've long suspected.

166
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,378
Despite the conservative image,
Americans really love their porn.

167
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,936
l mean, l was just saying basically
that Americans--

168
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:36,013
Continue, DiNozzo.

169
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,138
When Naughty Naughty Neighbors
debuted,

170
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,855
it's just a couple
of girls in lingerie.

171
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:45,577
Membership fee was 9 bucks, which
is average for this kind of content.

172
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:50,173
As the clothes came off,
the admission fee went up.

173
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,379
And up. And up.

174
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:58,058
Today the fee stands at $23.95,
which is kind of high.

175
00:11:58,262 --> 00:11:59,820
But platinum membership?

176
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:04,134
We're talking private chats and shows,
they want 45 bucks a month.

177
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:07,339
l mean, can anyone say rip-off?

178
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,818
- What?
- That's a lot of research, Tony.

179
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,371
- l've been working from home.
- l want detailed profiles

180
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:17,813
of anyone who's ever been a member
or is a member of that site.

181
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,620
That's like thousands of people,
boss.

182
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,460
Then you better get started, huh?

183
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,857
You really believe this
is an obsessed voyeur?

184
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,859
The women's identities
were protected by masks.

185
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,694
- Half a mask.
- The odds of finding him

186
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:30,818
- off a list that size--
- Are better than the odds

187
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:32,256
of you winning this argument.

188
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:37,218
Good news, boss. Naughty Naughty
Neighbors has a webmaster.

189
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,095
- Web what?
- Webmaster. lt's a person that is hired

190
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:42,457
to design and update the page.

191
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,094
His name is Carter Finch.

192
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,862
ls this guy like a <i>Super Fly</i>
cyberpimp?

193
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,775
No. l got off the phone with
his mother. He lives in her basement.

194
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,735
- Oh, that's kind of depressing.
- Tony, take Ziva with you.

195
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,893
McGee, pull financial records
on both women.

196
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:58,337
Already done. Both have
joint accounts with their husbands.

197
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,333
Neither has any indication
of additional income.

198
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:03,050
- Profits?
- Probably routed through a third party.

199
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,536
Oh, the page master?

200
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,779
- Who?
- This guy?

201
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,014
Yeah-- No. Definitely not.

202
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,372
No, he has less than $200
in his account.

203
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:15,335
Been that way for the last year,
so the money could be anywhere.

204
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,061
l'm going to find it.

205
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:26,500
l have no idea how.

206
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:39,980
What are you doing, Dr. Mallard?

207
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:42,610
Performing an autopsy, Mr. Palmer.

208
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,541
- Shouldn't we have a body?
- Usually.

209
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:50,498
Sometimes, however, one is forced
to play the cards one is dealt.

210
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:55,976
Often our greatest accomplishments
come from our most trying moments.

211
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,019
The '97 NBA Finals.

212
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,931
Jordan has food poisoning.
Still hits the Jazz up for 40.

213
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,259
l was thinking of something
with a little more historical significance.

214
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,977
The landings at Normandy,
for example.

215
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:10,451
- Oh, D-Day.
- Yes.

216
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:14,496
You know, the fighting went far
beyond the beaches, lasted for weeks.

217
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:18,331
My uncle was there,
Major Monty Mallard.

218
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:23,612
Yes, fatigued and injured,
he turned to his troops and said--

219
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:27,616
''The French wine in this particular
region is terribly overrated.''

220
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:30,177
Anyone would think you'd heard
that story before.

221
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:33,857
- What do you make of the video?
- We're dealing with an amateur.

222
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:36,656
Anyone with any kind of training
would have used far more pressure,

223
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,813
making sure
the trachea was severed.

224
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:40,210
She survive long, Duck?

225
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,741
Yeah, well, a cut that shallow,

226
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:44,661
the victim would go in and out
of consciousness for several minutes.

227
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:50,255
The poor girl died a slow
and excruciating death.

228
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,975
This is the first l've heard
about any snuff video.

229
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:57,811
- l just knew that Jamie was missing.
- Not just Jamie, Leanne too.

230
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,052
Do you think it has something to do
with the website?

231
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:01,701
That would make sense, now,
wouldn't it?

232
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,171
How did you not see the video?
Don't you run the site?

233
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:07,459
Well, l maintain it, but l'm far too busy
to watch all the content.

234
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:10,654
Well, l'll bet you weren't too busy
to see the new <i>Star Wars</i> six times.

235
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:15,299
Careful with that Wookiee.
lt's a prototype from 1 978.

236
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:19,978
Aren't you a little too old for toys?
These aren't toys, they're investments.

237
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,980
There are only three '78 Wookiees
equipped with an ammo belt,

238
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:24,780
and l have one of them.

239
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,933
You don't even want to know
how much it's worth.

240
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,296
You're right. l don't.

241
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:32,461
Six hundred bucks,
but l'll sell it for twice that online

242
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:35,819
via UltraCollectiblesandAuctions.com.

243
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,013
l see you are also saving money
on rent.

244
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:40,298
l can afford my own place.

245
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:46,253
l just live here for my mom, you know.
She feels safer having me close by.

246
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:48,692
l'm sure you provide
a high degree of protection.

247
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:52,658
- Tell us about Jamie and Leanne.
- We're business associates.

248
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,780
l manage their website and,
in exchange, get paid $1 00 a week.

249
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:58,098
A hundred bucks?
The site has over 2,000 members.

250
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,776
- At 24 bucks a pop, that's--
- Forty-eight thousand a month.

251
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:04,696
Yeah, that's good. Sounds like
the girls are ripping you off.

252
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,097
lt's only one of several websites
l've designed.

253
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,736
l also do Dungeons and Demons,
Buxom Bimbos,

254
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,620
and FriendsofFurries.org.

255
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,290
- You designed Buxom Bimbos?
- How did the three of you meet?

256
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,380
Leanne always flirted with me
when l delivered her paper.

257
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,899
And one day l was talking about
my website, and she asked about--

258
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,256
Back up a step there.

259
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:25,778
You were a paperboy?

260
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:30,493
l used to be a news distributor, okay?
''Paperboy'' is such an archaic term.

261
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:34,371
- Nine-year-olds don't mind it.
- How did Jamie get involved?

262
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,693
l guess she wanted to make
some extra money.

263
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,773
That's one reason
l'll never get married.

264
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,054
l can think of a couple others.

265
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:44,016
When was the last time
either of them contacted you?

266
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:46,492
lt's been like a month.
l mean, with a design like mine,

267
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,579
the site pretty much runs itself.

268
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,452
ls your mother wondering
why we're here?

269
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,496
l kind of told her
this was for a job interview.

270
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,975
l'll be in the car.

271
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:09,537
- What do you have, Abs?
- A Ph.D. in porn.

272
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:12,341
l spent the last six hours searching
through webcam files

273
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:14,936
trying to find some kind of lead,
and l have consumed more porn

274
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,570
than Tony has in his lifetime.

275
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:20,660
Okay, maybe not,
but l have watched a lot of smut.

276
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,181
You learn anything?

277
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,737
l'm not nearly as flexible
as l should be.

278
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:28,617
- Anything about the case?
- Right. l was getting to that.

279
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,699
l filtered through all of Jamie's files,

280
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,534
and l found the original feed
of her murder.

281
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,334
- This helps?
- That it does.

282
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,534
By coordinating the original stream
with the hard drive, l obtained the date

283
00:17:37,702 --> 00:17:39,181
and time that the file was written.

284
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,658
l know when Jamie Carr
was murdered.

285
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:48,170
Eight days ago at 9 p.m.

286
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:53,172
- To you that would be 21 00 hours, sir.
- That's good work, Abby.

287
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,100
l do what l can.

288
00:17:55,302 --> 00:18:01,650
And as a reward, l will treat myself
to more exciting girl-on-girl action.

289
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,017
Ms. Sciuto.

290
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,936
- Okay, that was quieter than Gibbs.
- Oh, that's my high-tech Model Fives.

291
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,700
Yeah, they're designed
to dampen ambient sound.

292
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:14,696
- Nice shoes. Who are you?
- Charles Sterling.

293
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,174
- Your new assistant, ma'am.
- l did not order a new assistant.

294
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:22,219
Well, that's strange.

295
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,378
Human Resources told me
to report tonight.

296
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,339
That's great. l tell them
that l do the work of ten people

297
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:32,979
and l need a raise, and l get this.

298
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:38,375
l don't know about your raise, ma'am,
but l am a huge fan of your work.

299
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,534
<i>Journal of Forensic Sciences.</i>

300
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,535
Deducting drop size and velocity
from circular blood stains.

301
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,382
l did not know anyone
actually read that.

302
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,975
Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:52,413
Anytime l undertake a mission,
l recon the situation

304
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,619
so l can best adapt myself
to the surroundings.

305
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,011
Ma'am.

306
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:02,498
- Okay, do me a favour, Chip?
- lt's Charles, ma'am.

307
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,254
- Charles.
- Charles.

308
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:05,935
Don't call me ma'am. lt's Abby.

309
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:09,100
And can you just hang tight here
for a second?

310
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:11,611
Because l need to make
a short moustache--

311
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,774
A quick, a quick phone call.
l need to make a phone call.

312
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,540
l'll be right back.

313
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:21,810
Gibbs, l have a problem down here.

314
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:27,617
- You needed to see me?
- Abby Sciuto's new assistant.

315
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:30,178
Abby's overworked.
She needed help down there.

316
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,942
You haven't been here long enough
to know what she needs yet, Jen.

317
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:35,900
The girl practically
mainlines caffeine, Gibbs.

318
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:39,811
The guys in the mailroom call her
Energizer Abby.

319
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:42,255
She works best alone.

320
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,738
She's a lot like you.

321
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:46,335
Very hands-on.

322
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:51,851
Give it a month, Jethro.

323
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:54,895
lf she's still unhappy,
we'll talk about it.

324
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:01,577
- You can give me a month, can't you?
- lt's not me you have to worry about.

325
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,615
- Abby works alone for a reason.
- Which is?

326
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,255
Something you should ask her
yourself.

327
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,100
l will.

328
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:12,491
l'm briefing SECNAV
in about an hour.

329
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,533
Anything on the two
missing Marine wives?

330
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,892
- Not yet.
- l need more than that, Jethro.

331
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,530
Well, you can tell him
they were running an lnternet sex site

332
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,137
while their husbands were deployed
and, as a result of that,

333
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,735
they may have been murdered.

334
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:28,414
l guess l can hold off briefing him
for a little while.

335
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:30,851
Good call, Madam Director.

336
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,253
Gibbs.

337
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,741
- Chow's getting cold, McGee.
- No time.

338
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,615
Gotta find where this Naughty Naughty
Neighbors website money went

339
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:46,256
because if l don't,
Gibbs might decide to kill me this time.

340
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:49,098
- He has an excellent point.
- This doesn't make sense.

341
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:50,775
They made almost $500,000.

342
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:53,257
- lt just can't disappear.
- Money changes hands, McGee.

343
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,418
- Rarely does it disappear.
- Money maybe,

344
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,891
but there are only two people
who had access to this cash,

345
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:00,337
- and both of them have vanished.
- Not anymore.

346
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:03,810
Dumfries Police Department
found Leanne Roberts.

347
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:20,498
l'm sorry, Jethro.
There's just too many parameters.

348
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,693
Fully clothed,
sealed in the back of a car.

349
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:24,893
lt's been a pretty cool and dry week.

350
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:28,219
l couldn't even give you an educated
guess as to when she died.

351
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:29,411
- The wound is deep.
- Yes.

352
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,738
Consistent with a combat
or hunting knife.

353
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:33,421
Like the one on that lnternet video.

354
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:37,937
Yeah, it could be.

355
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:41,493
Sweep the yard. See if the dog reacts
to any other human remains.

356
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:43,776
Hey, buddy.

357
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,299
She doesn't like people.

358
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:54,776
Maybe it's just me.

359
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,812
How long is Gibbs planning
on keeping us here?

360
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:01,253
As long as it takes to find
the other missing wife.

361
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:02,690
Assuming she's even here, Tony.

362
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,052
lt could take days
to search this place.

363
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:07,617
Why don't you tell Gibbs that?
He loves our input.

364
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:15,975
You sure these are
corpse-smelling dogs?

365
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:18,696
Of course.
That's why they're alerting to McGee.

366
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,415
He's been a dead man
since yesterday.

367
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,294
Very funny stuff there, Tony.

368
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:25,062
- Still working on it.
- How did you end up here, McGee?

369
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,060
Well, l rode in the back of the van.
You may have noticed my screaming

370
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,099
as Tony ran that light.

371
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:31,815
Not ''here'' here.

372
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,171
At NClS.

373
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:36,055
- l know Tony's story, what's yours?
- Do you want the long version

374
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,656
- or the short version?
- Oh, there's only one version.

375
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:41,092
McGee showed up on our doorstep
like a little lost poodle.

376
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:43,378
- That is not true, Ziva.
- No, you're right.

377
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,220
lt was more like a Saint Bernard.

378
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:48,141
DiNozzo. Ziva. We're out of here.

379
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:49,980
- Thank you, God.
- What about me, boss?

380
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,138
You're heading the search.
Find me that other body.

381
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,014
Why me?

382
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:57,380
l'm not the newbie anymore.

383
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,618
Don't you think this is maybe a job
for Ziva?

384
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:03,373
l need a trained investigator
running this site, McGee.

385
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,777
Do you think Ziva fits that bill?

386
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:07,697
l guess not, boss.

387
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,693
Hey, quit feeling sorry for yourself.
Do what you do best.

388
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,381
- What, you mean screwing up?
- No.

389
00:23:15,582 --> 00:23:17,095
Finding answers
where no one else can.

390
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,011
That was nice of you.

391
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,655
Never kick a probie
when he's down.

392
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:25,820
- l thought the expression was dog.
- lt's the same difference.

393
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,456
You've been through the wars,
my dear.

394
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:32,211
Murdered in your own home and then
discarded like yesterday's rubbish.

395
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:33,451
What's the time of death?

396
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,779
Based on decomposition
and bloating, ten, 1 2 days ago.

397
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,376
- She was killed prior to Jamie Carr.
- X-rays, doctor.

398
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:40,776
Thank you.

399
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:44,252
What's this translucent gel
leaking under the table?

400
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,821
Silicone, Mr. Palmer.

401
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:50,061
lt appears our young lady's
left implant ruptured.

402
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,653
As l suspected, cause of death--
Compound fracture of the skull.

403
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:57,501
My guess would have been on the
8-inch gash across her throat.

404
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,181
Then you'd have been wrong,
Mr. Palmer.

405
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:02,414
Such a gash should have resulted
in enough loss of blood

406
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:04,573
that would have covered
her entire torso.

407
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,818
- Should have, Duck?
- Yes, when l cleaned the body,

408
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,893
there was little to no external blood.

409
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:12,890
She died of blunt force trauma.
Once her brain function ceased,

410
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:15,411
the cardiovascular system
shut down.

411
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,374
Explaining the lack of blood loss.

412
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:21,370
lndeed, Jethro. Leanne Roberts died

413
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:24,858
and then the knife
was taken to her neck.

414
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,540
You never cease to amaze me.

415
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,255
l probably would have gone pro

416
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:32,054
if l hadn't blown out my knee
senior year.

417
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,060
l was referring to the numerous ways
in which you entertain yourself.

418
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:38,855
- Like what?
- Computer solitaire, paper airplanes,

419
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,734
last week's rubber-band war.

420
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:44,575
Well, in all fairness,
that was McGee's fault.

421
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,101
- How?
- He's the one who brought

422
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:47,695
the rubber bands
from the supply room.

423
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,415
Should have known better.

424
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:51,981
l think he learned his lesson.

425
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:55,936
l never knew a rubber band
could leave such a welt.

426
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:58,053
lt's all in the release.

427
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:06,332
lt's astounding you actually find
the time to do your job.

428
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:11,297
- That's the creative process.
- What's that?

429
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:13,936
While you were getting
your little Banana-Rama thingy,

430
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:15,370
l was finding us a lead.

431
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,901
lt's Berry Mango Madness.

432
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:21,416
- And l'm listening.
- This dude had platinum membership

433
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,971
to the website, restraining order
filed against him last year

434
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:25,370
and lives in the Dumfries area.

435
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,061
- Name?
- Robert T. Sullivan.

436
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:29,218
Checked him out.
He's been in South Beach, Florida,

437
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:32,658
- for the past six weeks.
- South Beach is an exotic place.

438
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:35,820
Beaches, babes. Bingo.

439
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:41,658
Mr. Sullivan is in a spiritual retreat.

440
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,494
He's a Jehovah's Witness.

441
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:46,294
That would explain
the restraining order.

442
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:49,653
Well, only 4,338 to go.

443
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:01,813
This has been the longest two days
of my life.

444
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:04,173
Popcorn, Chip?

445
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:06,860
- Chip, are you with us?
- Oh, yeah.

446
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:09,656
Sorry, ma'am.
l guess l zoned out for a minute.

447
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,580
lt's Abby, and it was like an hour.

448
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:15,695
Look, l-- l'd feel more comfortable
being assigned to another project.

449
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:17,938
What? You don't like
watching porn with me?

450
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,576
Sorry l'm not one of the fellas,
but l'm doing the best l can.

451
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,216
l don't really watch explicit material
with my peers, ma'am.

452
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:28,018
Abby. Abby, l don't watch it at all.

453
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:29,541
Not buying it, Chip.

454
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:32,017
- And why is that?
- Two reasons. One, you're male.

455
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:33,701
- Two, you're breathing.
- l find that

456
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,056
to be an unfair generalisation.

457
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,134
Not all men engage themselves
in those kinds of immoral activities.

458
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:41,175
- That's not what Tony says.
- Yeah, well.

459
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:43,498
l prefer to spend my time
more constructively.

460
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:46,381
l have a detailed routine designed
to strengthen my mind and my body.

461
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:49,301
l do callisthenics in the morning,
and l do brain teasers at night.

462
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,220
- Home-schooled.
- How did you know?

463
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:54,971
Wild guess. Oh, look at that, Chip.

464
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:57,855
Oh, yes. Video's done.
We're done.

465
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,974
Nope.
That was just Jamie Carr's feed.

466
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,978
Now it's Leanne Roberts'.

467
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,381
Fantastic.

468
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,537
Having problems, Officer David?

469
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,539
At Mossad, we used Mac.

470
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,733
l'm yet not accustomed
to this operating system.

471
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,335
lt's like l've told Gibbs,
that approach never works, Ziva.

472
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,340
My approach makes me feel better.

473
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,770
You found Jamie Carr's body?

474
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:37,418
Negative. The police and MPs
are continuing the search tomorrow.

475
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,975
We haven't had much luck either.

476
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:42,094
Most of the subscribers for Naughty
Naughty Neighbors are out of state.

477
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:43,451
l didn't say l had no luck.

478
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,779
About an hour ago, l found my ticket
back to the land of the living.

479
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,578
Buried under scrap metal
about 50 feet

480
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,573
from where we found
Leanne Roberts' body.

481
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,181
Where's Gibbs?

482
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,692
<i>l want you to understand, ma'am,</i>
<i>Sergeant Roberts is a good man.</i>

483
00:27:56,902 --> 00:28:00,417
Understood, captain, but my people
still need to talk to him about his wife.

484
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,136
<i>l'd like them to do more</i>
<i>than just talk, ma'am.</i>

485
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:05,333
- <i>They have to stop him.</i>
- From doing what, captain?

486
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,180
<i>From ruining his life, sir.</i>

487
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:10,454
<i>My sergeant major told me</i>
<i>to contact you, Special Agent Gibbs.</i>

488
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:13,938
<i>Sergeant Roberts requested</i>
<i>emergency leave two days ago.</i>

489
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:16,178
We just found his wife's body.
How's that possible?

490
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,657
<i>He doesn't know she's dead yet, sir.</i>

491
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,978
<i>He requested leave</i>
<i>for another reason.</i>

492
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,412
- Which was?
- <i>A personal matter, ma'am.</i>

493
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,453
We know about the sex site,
captain.

494
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,618
<i>Well, then you should know</i>
<i>that Sergeant Roberts</i>

495
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,778
<i>blames one of his neighbours for it.</i>

496
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,900
<i>According to his squad,</i>
<i>he's planning on killing the man.</i>

497
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,218
And you sent him home to do it,
captain?

498
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,300
<i>l was unaware of his intentions</i>
<i>until this morning, ma'am.</i>

499
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:40,572
<i>Look, l just need your help.</i>

500
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:43,979
<i>Now, the neighbour's name</i>
<i>is Bart Powell.</i>

501
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,740
When's the sergeant scheduled
to land?

502
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,456
- <i>Tomorrow, sir.</i>
- Check his flight manifest.

503
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:51,051
<i>He just needs a cool-down period,</i>
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

504
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,220
<i>And like l said, he's a good man,</i>
<i>and an even better Marine.</i>

505
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,458
We're on it.
We'll pick him up at the airport.

506
00:28:56,662 --> 00:29:00,257
<i>Thank you, sir. My sergeant major</i>
<i>said that we could count on you.</i>

507
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:04,296
- He get that bottle l sent him?
- <i>He did.</i>

508
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,892
<i>He told me to tell you</i>
<i>to keep them coming.</i>

509
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:11,253
Alcohol is contraband in lraq.

510
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:14,900
- l thought it'd take longer, Jen.
- Longer for what?

511
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:18,460
For me to see you as a director
and not a field agent.

512
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,333
Ma'am, Sergeant Roberts
changed his itinerary.

513
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,254
He left West Germany last night.

514
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:27,976
- When's he due in?
- He arrived two hours ago at Dulles.

515
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,057
We're here to stop Sergeant Roberts,
not kill him.

516
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:40,776
- But what if--?
- l said, stop him, Officer David.

517
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:42,415
Got it.

518
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:44,294
You take the right.

519
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,021
- l didn't do anything.
- Where is she?

520
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,336
- Where's my wife?
- l don't know.

521
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,010
- Where's my wife?
- l don't know. l swear.

522
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,417
She told me what you made her do.

523
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,258
l'm going to gut you
like the pig you are.

524
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:07,298
Drop the knife, sergeant.
Special Agent Gibbs, NClS.

525
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:08,821
We'll take it from here.

526
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:12,892
- Do you know what he did to my wife?
- l do.

527
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,536
- We're here to take him into custody.
- He deserves to die.

528
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,300
l can't let you do that, sergeant.

529
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:24,020
Sergeant.

530
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:30,138
My house. There was police tape,
blood inside.

531
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,821
Leanne's dead, isn't she?

532
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,414
l'm sorry, Marine.

533
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:41,011
You killed her.

534
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:51,379
What now, sir?

535
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:54,053
What am l supposed to do now?

536
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,574
l did not kill Leanne Roberts.

537
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:02,058
This is-- This is insane.
l barely knew her.

538
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,654
He wants you to run the tape.

539
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:09,253
- l guess it was worth it, then.
- Worth what?

540
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:12,818
Watching over 20 hours
of porn with Chip.

541
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:15,292
- Who the hell is Chip?
- Her new assistant.

542
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:19,780
- That l didn't ask for, Madam Director.
- Abby, it's director or ma'am,

543
00:31:19,982 --> 00:31:20,971
not madam.

544
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,059
How is Mr. Sterling working out?

545
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:25,298
All l can tell you right now, ma'am,

546
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:27,618
is that he's easily excitable.

547
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,941
Barely knew her?

548
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,656
All l see is some shadow
climbing through her window.

549
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:38,572
What do you see now?

550
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:45,937
Okay, so we had an affair.
l mean, that's not a crime.

551
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:48,975
But you know what is? Blackmail.

552
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,936
Sergeant Roberts got a letter in lraq
last week from his wife

553
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:55,531
- explaining everything.
- About what?

554
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,256
You found out about her website.
Threatened to tell her husband

555
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:00,458
- unless she'd sleep with you.
- Oh, God. No. No.

556
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,613
l wouldn't have.
l was just fooling around.

557
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:05,455
You killed her and you killed her
website partner, Jamie Carr.

558
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:08,932
- No, l didn't kill anyone.
- You're a liar and you're a predator.

559
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:12,293
And you think anybody is gonna
believe what you have to say now?

560
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,894
lt's been a while since l've seen
you in interrogation, Jethro.

561
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:22,217
You haven't lost your touch.

562
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,219
l should've let Sergeant Roberts
kill him.

563
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,619
Bad news, boss. Hi.
Powell's alibi checked out.

564
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,455
The week Leanne Roberts was
murdered, he was at Disney World.

565
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:32,220
Did you tell Sergeant Roberts yet?

566
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:35,220
l thought it would be best
if it came from a fellow Marine.

567
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:36,775
So if Powell didn't do it, who did?

568
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:39,297
That's what we're going to find out,
Agent DiNozzo.

569
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,135
Running a little late this morning?

570
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:59,055
Stopped at the mall to pick up Monica's
gift. lt was completely packed.

571
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:01,452
Scott Baio's cutting the ribbon
at a new Pottery Barn.

572
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:03,135
- Who's Scott Baio?
- Exactly.

573
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:04,331
Morning, probie.

574
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,618
- What's with him?
- He's been that way all morning.

575
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,892
l do not believe he went home
last night.

576
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:15,020
- Where's Gibbs?
- He left for coffee.

577
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,340
What do you think?

578
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:20,816
lt's not your colour, DiNozzo.

579
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,813
- l was just showing Ziva--
- You're late.

580
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:25,377
Yeah, l had to run an errand.
lt was important but--

581
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,016
- lt won't happen again.
- Boss, l located the money.

582
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:32,774
A Cayman account set up to put into a
U.S. account on the 1 5th each month.

583
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:35,212
- Whose account?
- Her name is Hazel Davenport.

584
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:37,691
- We got an address?
- Royal Manor Retirement Home.

585
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:41,298
She's 86 years old, happens to be the
maternal grandmother of Carter Finch.

586
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:43,453
See what happens when
you show up to work on time?

587
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,459
He emptied the account last night

588
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:48,170
and walked out with close
to half a mil in cash.

589
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,414
What are you waiting for?

590
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:52,493
Bring me Finch.

591
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:56,978
- Now.
- Right.

592
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:58,331
You pulled an all-nighter?

593
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,898
- Sergeant Roberts deserves answers.
- Should've told me. l would've stayed.

594
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:03,694
l know you would've.
So why were you late?

595
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:06,097
Stopped by the mall to pick up
Monica's birthday present.

596
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:08,658
Did you see Scott Baio?

597
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:11,580
Not the knife in the video, Chip.

598
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:12,771
How do you know for sure?

599
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:16,977
Because it's obvious.

600
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,290
See the butt of the knife?

601
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,655
Not the same.
This is a Marine KA-BAR.

602
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,494
See the blade?

603
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,215
- Not the same?
- Not the same, Chip.

604
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:33,775
There are no serrations.

605
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:37,776
A different knife killed Leanne Roberts
than killed Jamie Carr.

606
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:40,177
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Doesn't make any sense.

607
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:44,176
- Good, Chip.
- l really hate being called Chip.

608
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,617
l really hate that Ozzie got fat
and stupid. Live with it.

609
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,852
Now here is what really
doesn't make sense.

610
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:53,577
Hunting knives, kitchen knives,
military knives, ceremonial knives.

611
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:55,693
Four hundred and twenty-three
different kinds.

612
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,215
And none of them match this one.

613
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:01,259
- That's strange.
- Wrong response, Chip.

614
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:04,730
Nothing matches yet.

615
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,216
Now you're making sense.

616
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,210
Laptop's gone.

617
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:12,492
- Left in a hurry, boss.
- Did you talk to his mother?

618
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,732
Said that she hasn't seen him
since we talked to him.

619
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,011
Tony and Ziva spooked him.

620
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,571
You want to set up surveillance,
make sure when he comes back?

621
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,177
He's not coming back.

622
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:23,016
<i>l checked his cell-phone records.</i>

623
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:26,692
He's not made or received a phone call
since Wednesday of last week.

624
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:28,779
l can't imagine
he has a lot of friends.

625
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:31,854
He doesn't need them, considering
he has half a million dollars in cash.

626
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:34,662
That he picked up
over 1 8 hours ago.

627
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:36,933
l could be in Rio de Janeiro
right now.

628
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:38,370
Good thing he's not you.

629
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,897
Okay, this guy's not smart enough
to cover his tracks.

630
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,495
He's done pretty well so far.

631
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:48,820
He does online auctions
from his laptop.

632
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:52,134
- Super Collectibles.
- UltraCollectiblesandAuctions.com.

633
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:55,617
- Can we trace him?
- lf we can pinpoint some of his items.

634
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,699
- Do you know what he sells?
- <i>Star Wars</i> stuff.

635
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,858
That narrows it down to, like,
50 million people.

636
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,055
Some kind of figurine.

637
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:04,655
- There's only three of them.
- Yoda?

638
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,739
C-3PO? Stormtrooper?

639
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:10,258
Wookiee. There's a special edition
prototype from 1 978.

640
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:12,572
lt's equipped with an ammo belt.
There are only three.

641
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:14,579
- You're a <i>Star Wars</i> junky.
- Not especially.

642
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,380
She has a photographic memory,
probie.

643
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:17,776
Not a social disorder.

644
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,979
Okay, there is one '78
Wookiee posted.

645
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:22,501
Only one with an ammo belt.

646
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:26,251
- High bid was over $1 ,200.
- Was?

647
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:28,180
He shut down the auction
early this morning.

648
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:29,895
Guess he no longer needed
the cash.

649
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:32,172
- Can you find him?
- l'm tracing the host-computer

650
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:34,253
lP address now.

651
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,731
Looks like he last logged on
six hours ago.

652
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,462
Broadband connection at the
Freemont lnn in Woodbridge, Virginia.

653
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:43,217
That's 20 minutes from here. Ziva,
you're with me. McGee, call Gibbs.

654
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:47,220
lf things get hairy,
just follow my lead.

655
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:49,535
- Ladies?
- l don't need a babysitter.

656
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,334
l've been in hundreds
of these situations.

657
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:53,811
Never with me. As far
as l'm concerned, you're a probie.

658
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:56,582
l've never had sex with you either.
Does that mean l'm a virgin?

659
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,898
Trust is a virtue that's earned,
not given.

660
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:01,576
- Profound.
- l try.

661
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:07,052
- Nice ass, yes?
- Something like that.

662
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:09,577
Federal agents.

663
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,535
Looks like we missed quite a party.

664
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:20,100
l think you want
to take a look at this.

665
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:33,052
The knife's a KA-BAR,
a Marine fighting knife.

666
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:36,095
l told Gibbs not to let Sergeant Roberts
go home last night.

667
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,701
What do you think of that? Blood?

668
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,341
Do you smell that?

669
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,055
Haviar Christian Number Five.

670
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,414
You think you're the only one
with a memory?

671
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,495
That's not blood.

672
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,091
lt's hair dye.

673
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:02,060
- Have you seen Gibbs?
- Gibbs, it's Abby.

674
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:05,339
l need to talk to you, pronto.
Now you may speak, McGee.

675
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,817
- Do you know where Gibbs is?
- He was with the director.

676
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:10,092
- l really need to talk to him.
- Not as much as l do.

677
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:11,934
He better have a reason
for not answering--

678
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,093
How's briefing
the secretary of the navy, McGee?

679
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:16,981
- Does that one work for you?
- Sorry. lt's just that we found Carter.

680
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,894
Tony and Ziva
are probably there now.

681
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:20,336
- Where?
- The Freemont lnn.

682
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:21,935
- Gibbs?
- Get DiNozzo on the phone.

683
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:23,700
- Now.
- Right.

684
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,692
Gibbs.
l can't work like this anymore.

685
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,252
The knife? lt's fake.

686
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:37,459
Two hundred and forty-three dollars
at your local magic shop.

687
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:40,253
Jamie Carr...

688
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:45,971
...faked her own death.

689
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,817
Jamie Carr?
l liked you better as a blond.

690
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:57,218
That is probably not a good idea.

691
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:04,932
- You're probably familiar with these.
- You wish.

692
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,221
- DiNozzo.
- <i>The knife in the video</i>

693
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:18,055
- is a fake, DiNozzo. Jamie Carr is--
- <i>Alive.</i>

694
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,371
We're looking at her right now.

695
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,975
- What about Carter--?
- <i>Finch? Dead.</i>

696
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:23,457
<i>She offed him in the hotel room,</i>
<i>took all the money.</i>

697
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,574
She's a naughty little kitty cat.
Anything else, boss?

698
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:31,017
Now you know how l feel, Gibbs.

699
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:36,055
She claims it was an accident.

700
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:38,890
They fought
when your wife wanted out,

701
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:41,451
tell you about the lnternet site.

702
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:44,614
lt's my fault.

703
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:48,019
- l was away for too damn long, sir.
- Trust me.

704
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:51,219
Marine, none of this is your fault.

705
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,614
Leanne wanted to start a family.

706
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:01,775
l told her we couldn't afford it.

707
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:04,612
Maybe when l made staff sergeant,
you know?

708
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:08,821
l never thought that she'd--

709
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:11,700
l know exactly how you feel.

710
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:14,899
How do you--?

711
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,059
How do you live with it, sir?

712
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:25,577
You ask yourself that question
every day until you find the answer.

713
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:29,099
And what did you find, sir?

714
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:44,178
- How did Sergeant Roberts take it?
- He's on his way back to lraq.

715
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,934
You think that's wise,
sending a Marine

716
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:47,979
who just lost his wife
back into combat?

717
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:51,051
Wise? No, but it's what l'd do.

718
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:53,614
- Are you heading out?
- Yeah.

719
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:56,211
Good. l'll walk you to your car.

720
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:10,254
Tony, it's almost 9:00.
lsn't tonight your big birthday dinner?

721
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,858
- We broke up.
- Why?

722
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:17,576
Apparently, her husband didn't think
it was a good idea.

723
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:19,693
She's married?

724
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,614
Knew she was too good to be true.

725
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,298
Do you still have
those dinner reservations?

726
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:29,771
My treat.

727
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,261
l guess l could drown my sorrows
in surf and turf.

728
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,577
That's a good attitude.

729
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:41,740
l'll catch up.

730
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:43,857
You will not be needing that.
