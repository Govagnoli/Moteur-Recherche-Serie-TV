1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:07,046
We're thrilled you
decided to stay with us,

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,199
and just so you know,
we got free local phone calls,

3
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,483
daily in-room coffee
and an AM-FM radio.

4
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,366
- ls it clean?
- Of course, it's clean, Lillian.

5
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:18,166
Well, the last time we were here,
l saw a cockroach, Albert.

6
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,079
That wasn't a cockroach.

7
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,078
All of the sudden, you're an expert?

8
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,078
l'm an entomologist, 32 years.

9
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,919
l think l'd know a cockroach
if l saw one.

10
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,681
l assure you, our rooms are maintained
to the highest standards of--

11
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:31,326
Cockroach habitability?

12
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,678
l was gonna say
cleanliness and neatness.

13
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:37,843
However, if you folks are unhappy
with the room in any way--

14
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,918
Stay single.

15
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:43,045
Just let me know and l can see
about getting you an upgrade.

16
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,802
l think we'll take that upgrade.

17
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,197
ln my opinion,
the risk of serious injury is substantial.

18
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:45,245
l agree. But there are protocols
that have to be followed.

19
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,638
Which are useless if it doesn't impart
a tactical advantage.

20
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:54,366
Don't underestimate appearances.
l have known entire missions to fail

21
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,246
because an asset
didn't button her lapel properly.

22
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,404
l see your point.

23
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,763
So we are in agreement?

24
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:07,441
- Heels.
- Heels.

25
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,320
l hate court.

26
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,479
Your sacrifice is noted
and appreciated.

27
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:17,915
Let's talk outfits.

28
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:20,445
l say you just go with the heels.

29
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,841
Was that inappropriate? Sorry.

30
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,119
Nice Jimmy Choo's there, Abs.

31
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,005
Can we help you, Agent DiNozzo?

32
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,158
Yes, l've come to collect
Officer David.

33
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,521
Boss got the Bat-signal.

34
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:34,801
l showed up just in time.

35
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,527
Another minute and you guys would've
been braiding each other's hair.

36
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,643
And who knows where
that can lead to, Tony.

37
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,286
- Where are we going?
- Little Creek.

38
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:45,201
- Little Creek Base?
- lt's a off-base Navy lodging facility

39
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:48,404
used mostly by TDY personnel
and visiting family.

40
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,159
Apparently, there was
some kind of bloodbath.

41
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,806
Mondays. What's the body count?

42
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,923
Who said anything
about a body, DiNozzo?

43
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:02,922
Redrum?

44
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:07,842
All we're missing is a kid on
a Big Wheel and a man in a bear suit.

45
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,919
And in your head
that makes sense to you?

46
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:14,397
Yeah, it's <i>The Shining</i>, Ziva.

47
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,240
Now that you mention,
what was that guy doing in a bear suit?

48
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,796
l'm just saying that this wouldn't
have happened at the Marriott.

49
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,243
Excuse me for not checking
the axe-murderer policy.

50
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,524
Did you request this specific room
when you called the lodge?

51
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:31,077
No, we requested the one
with the eviscerated squirrels,

52
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,316
but this is all they had.

53
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,079
What the hell kind
of question is that?

54
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,362
Our last one.

55
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,400
Did l mention we have over a hundred
channels in crisp, clear cable?

56
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,556
Talk to me, DiNozzo.

57
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:42,400
Occupants checked out two days ago.
Room was cleaned yesterday,

58
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,558
- then locked tight.
- No sign of forced entry?

59
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,719
No, but a previous guest could have
kept the key. We're going over lists.

60
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:51,004
- Field test says the blood was human.
- We don't know what parts those are.

61
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,601
Dr. Mallard is still working
on the bathroom.

62
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:58,446
l'd take an umbrella
if you go in there.

63
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:06,485
lt doesn't make sense, does it, boss?

64
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,797
lf it's a prank,
it should be animal blood.

65
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,357
lf it's a Satanic ritual,
where are the pentagrams?

66
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,358
Could've been
an interrogation out of control.

67
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,486
Or a drug deal gone bad.
Look at this.

68
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:21,117
How bad does a drug deal have to go
for you to leave the drugs behind?

69
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,519
Find out what happened here.

70
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,917
l know something of what happened.

71
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:32,602
All this scattered,
organic detritus is human fascia,

72
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:36,442
fibrous connective tissue
that anchors skin to muscles.

73
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:41,920
lf you look closely you see
neither skin nor muscle.

74
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah, l'll take your word for it.

75
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:46,520
All of this tissue
was skilfully extracted,

76
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:51,317
possibly during extensive
post-mortem procedure.

77
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:52,886
Someone was
dissected here, Duck?

78
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,362
More likely three someone's.

79
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:56,926
And whoever the guilty party is,

80
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:59,476
he didn't get his technique
from the lnternet.

81
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:03,640
You're looking
for a trained medical practitioner.

82
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,765
Well, no doctors or surgeons stayed
at the lodge in the last two months.

83
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,403
Now checking surrounding ho--
Hotels.

84
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:19,361
You missed again, Tony.

85
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,279
Did l, McGee?

86
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,803
Remember, goals are deceptive.

87
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:28,516
The un-aimed arrow never misses.

88
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,202
What kind of loser wrote that?

89
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,279
- l think it's good advice.
- Really?

90
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,916
Well, then l have
the perfect one for you.

91
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,723
ln great attempts, it is glorious

92
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,915
even to fail.

93
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,521
Didn't Vince Lombardi say that?

94
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,676
l'll hold onto that one.
But the rest of these are worthless.

95
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:52,836
Nice calendar, McGeek.

96
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,965
- Hey.
- Relax, this stuff will melt your mind.

97
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,600
lt's not good for you.
Makes you weak.

98
00:05:57,767 --> 00:05:58,882
Tony, it was a gift.

99
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:00,799
From who? Your wet nurse?

100
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,845
No. From me.

101
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,682
lt's a nice calendar, boss.

102
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,963
Anybody find me my doctor yet?

103
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,846
Not yet. But we do know
how he got in the room.

104
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,123
A maid had her master key
stolen two days ago.

105
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,880
- She see anything?
- No.

106
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,484
l ran prints from the crime scene,
1 5 total, all from registered guests.

107
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,763
- Only two were in the area last night.
- Bring them in.

108
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:27,079
Unfortunately, they both have
airtight alibis.

109
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,920
Looks like the un-aimed arrow
missed after all.

110
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,361
Now that amateur hour is over,

111
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:34,246
l draw your attention to the plasma
screen in the middle of the room.

112
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,637
Psychopathic blood splatter,

113
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:40,004
usually randomly scattered.
Take a look at the drips on the wall.

114
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,684
lt's a little Jackson Pollack,
but notice anything?

115
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,246
They're emanating
from a central point.

116
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,366
Step off, McFlower Power.
You've had your chance to speak.

117
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:55,840
They're emanating
from a central point.

118
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:00,764
Then there's the TV. lt looks like
it was knocked off the bureau

119
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,804
in a struggle of some sort, right?

120
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,755
Except that Abby found CRT shards
in a bath mat.

121
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:08,836
So?

122
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:13,319
So, Dr. Giggles laid the television on
the floor, covered it with the bath mat

123
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,125
to muffle the sound, and broke it.

124
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:17,960
Crime scene was staged, boss.
Victims were killed someplace else.

125
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,766
- Where?
- What, l gotta do all the work?

126
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,355
- l'm gonna get right on that.
- Do that, DiNozzo.

127
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,797
You're doing most of it anyway.

128
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:37,763
l think it best to start
with a corner piece, Mr. Palmer.

129
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,157
- Doctor?
- Haven't you done a jigsaw puzzle?

130
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,806
You always start with the corners.

131
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:47,197
- May l suggest the plantar fasciae.
- The feet?

132
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,916
Yes, and then build it up from there.
The anterior fasciculus--

133
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:57,003
Of the ankle. And then
the fascia crusis of the lower calf.

134
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,681
Well, thank you, doctor.
That's a very helpful analogy.

135
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,476
And a fitting one too, considering
the original term for jigsaw puzzle

136
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,160
was ''dissected maps.''

137
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:10,242
So named by the Europeans
in the late 1 760s.

138
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,001
They used to take maps
and cut them up into irregular pieces

139
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,635
for their children to reassemble.

140
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:19,004
- Hello, Jethro, right on schedule.
- That predictable, Duck?

141
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:22,040
- That thorough.
- Are we still talking three bodies here?

142
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:24,767
Well, that's why we call
it ''preliminary findings.''

143
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:27,043
Actually, we have the remains

144
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,722
of at least four individuals
and perhaps considerably more.

145
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:34,084
At first we thought
there might be a serial killer.

146
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,680
Not that that is a good thing.

147
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,884
Unfortunately, Mr. Palmer's
private hopes were dashed

148
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:41,720
when l noticed
in our latest meat puzzle,

149
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:45,482
traces of vascular tissue.
lt's exactly what you would see

150
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:49,162
if you looked into a medical
disposal bin after surgery.

151
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,204
That is, if you cared to look.

152
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,245
Which apparently
our perpetrator did.

153
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,965
Are you saying these
are medical waste?

154
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:59,358
lt explains the precision
of the incisions.

155
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,360
All or these pieces of tissue
were removed by a surgeon,

156
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:06,440
disposed of, rescued,
and then put on display for reasons--

157
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,923
Well, l will leave you to ponder.

158
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,163
- We're being set up.
- So it seems.

159
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,557
But set up for what?

160
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,004
Sigmund Freud, eat your heart out.

161
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,325
McGee, no lurking without a permit.

162
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,880
Sorry.

163
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,881
Just checking to see if you finished
the analysis on that powder yet.

164
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,400
Field test said it was cocaine, but--

165
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,798
l told you l was gonna e-mail you
the results when l was done.

166
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,638
Yes.

167
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,160
Don't you have court today?

168
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,797
l'm finished.
All l had to do was give a deposition.

169
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,283
So don't have to go back
or anything?

170
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:03,996
McGee.

171
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:07,917
You came all the way down here
to see me in my court suit.

172
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,918
- No.
- You totally did.

173
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,918
- No, l did not.
- Your mouth lies,

174
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,557
but your red ears
are telling the truth.

175
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:17,925
- What? What's wrong?
- Do you smell that?

176
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,476
No.

177
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,919
lt's almonds.
We have to get out of here.

178
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,520
- What's going on?
- Cyanide gas.

179
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,638
Hydrogen cyanide gas.

180
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,162
Another three minutes in here,
game over.

181
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,442
How did this happen?

182
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,644
Abby said the coke was bad.

183
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:05,367
Contained potassium cyanide,
which turned gaseous

184
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,722
when she added the--

185
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:12,642
The acidified cobalt thio...

186
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:16,197
- Cobalt thiocyanate.
- Cobalt ''cyothianate.''

187
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, from her drug test kit.

188
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:19,955
So this was an accident.

189
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,482
- Abby doesn't have accidents.
- Abby also doesn't have enemies.

190
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,638
l mean, it's not like we're talking
about Agent DiNozzo.

191
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:26,081
Hey.

192
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,602
- Ma'am.
- The crime scene was a setup.

193
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,803
And right now Abby's our best lead.

194
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,446
While she and McGee
were in the showers,

195
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:36,122
Ziva and l took a walk through
the world of Sciuto.

196
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,323
Our mistress of the dark
is keeping secrets from us.

197
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,996
This is so embarrassing.

198
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,727
Okay, in my defence,
what self-respecting drug dealer

199
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:51,799
cuts its cocaine
with potassium cyanide?

200
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,162
Obviously one that doesn't care
about repeat business.

201
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,759
Luckily, your exposure
to the gas was brief.

202
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,442
l don't anticipate
any long-term ramifications.

203
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:04,280
Better not be. You two
don't have permission to be sick.

204
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,766
We're fine, Gibbs.

205
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,918
The only damage done
was to my ego.

206
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:10,043
lt was a newbie accident.

207
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,636
What?

208
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:14,957
We're not so sure
it was an accident, Abs.

209
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:16,641
''Not sure'' meaning what?

210
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,367
We think whoever set up the
crime scene might be after Abby.

211
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,119
Me?

212
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,085
Who would wanna kill me?
l mean, Tony l understand--

213
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,236
Hey.

214
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:26,965
The name Mikel Mawher ring a bell?

215
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:31,925
lt should. He placed over 200 phone
calls to you in the last four months.

216
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,884
One of them
right before the accident.

217
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,164
- You went through my records?
- And your credit card bills.

218
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,966
Did you really buy this guy Mawher
a straitjacket for his birthday?

219
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,516
- Okay, slow down.
- lt sounds like you two were serious.

220
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,643
Until she filed a restraining order
against him.

221
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,002
l'd say the straitjacket
was a red flag there, Abs.

222
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,442
How come we never heard
about this gentleman?

223
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:54,078
Okay, l dated him last year
and things just got a little out of hand.

224
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,761
- Did l mention the restraining order?
- Okay, a lot out of hand.

225
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,999
Why didn't you come to me, Abby?

226
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,477
Because, Gibbs,
l wanted him restrained.

227
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:07,003
l didn't want him beaten
to a pulp with a baseball bat.

228
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,640
And l'm embarrassed.
lt wasn't great taste in boyfriends.

229
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,684
Yeah, l saw the Web shrine
dedicated to you.

230
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:17,557
- www.myhotdarkangel.com.
- Okay, it's creepy.

231
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,479
But that's not dangerous.

232
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,719
He just can't accept
that it's over between us.

233
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,037
But he's not a violent type.

234
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:27,323
The guy cleans up crime scenes
for a living, Abs.

235
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,079
l know.
That's what l liked about him.

236
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,317
But l'm telling you, Gibbs,
he's not your man.

237
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,685
You're gonna pay him a visit anyway.

238
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,523
Could you pick up my red studded
dog collar when you're there?

239
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,325
''Free decomposition odour removal
included in all double homicides.''

240
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,284
l can see why she fell for the guy.

241
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,085
They even have
the same taste in music.

242
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,401
Hey!

243
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:15,362
You ruined my shot.

244
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,798
l take that back. Not bad.

245
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:27,562
l'm actually redoing my before
and after shots for my new brochures.

246
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:30,366
You know, ''name the crime scene,
we wipe the grime clean.''

247
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,322
So, what do you got, huh?
Huh, sub accident?

248
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,843
Explosive decompression?
Never worked with NClS before.

249
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,840
Yeah, the restraining order probably
made that kind of difficult, huh?

250
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,804
Yeah, l don't know
what you're talking about.

251
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,286
The only reason
you're able to walk

252
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:47,802
is because l never heard
about you until today.

253
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,356
Okay, that restraining order.
Look, this is not necessary, okay?

254
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,760
All right, l shouldn't have called her
earlier. l just wanted to apologise.

255
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,118
You got something to apologise for,
do you?

256
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,118
Yeah, l was a little crazy before.
l was in therapy.

257
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,563
Okay, l found that l was projecting
my own obsession onto Abby,

258
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,797
and therefore she did not
wanna reciprocate it.

259
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,323
l wanted to call and apologise for any
pain and suffering l put her through.

260
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,687
- ls Abby in some kind of trouble?
- You tell me.

261
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,476
Oh, my God.

262
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,201
Look familiar?

263
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,846
No. But for two grand
l can make it look--

264
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,201
- Hey.
- Okay, look.

265
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,358
l don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,199
Okay, l'm cured now. l'm good.

267
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,279
l'm on antidepressants.
l have a new girlfriend.

268
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,925
Well, now all you need is an alibi
for the last two days and you're golden.

269
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,605
Well, then l'm golden, you know?

270
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,316
lt's been drive-by central
since the full moon, man.

271
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:39,321
- All the crazies are out, you know?
- And that makes you golden how?

272
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:43,002
Because l've been with DC Metro
for two whole days. That's why.

273
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,120
The lunar effect is a myth.

274
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:49,243
There is no statistical correlation

275
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,717
between the phases of the moon
and human behaviour.

276
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,843
That's why it would never work
with us.

277
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,599
Because the lunar effect is a myth?

278
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,998
No, because l'm a scientist
and he plays with voodoo dolls.

279
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,158
But you play
with voodoo dolls, Abby.

280
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:03,965
l meant it metaphorically, McGee.

281
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:07,881
l don't think they actually do anything.
l play with them, you know, to relax.

282
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,641
Well, it looks like you can put away
your Mike Mawher doll, then.

283
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,399
Metro confirmed Mawher's alibi.

284
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,445
He cleaned eight crime scenes
over the past four days.

285
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,675
Been surrounded by homicide
detectives the entire time.

286
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,599
Did any match
what we found at the Navy Lodge?

287
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,041
Nope. Not even close.

288
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:23,196
Then l'm off the hook.

289
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,244
Not necessarily.
He could've had an accomplice.

290
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,443
Oh, leave it to the assassin
to rain on my parade.

291
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,438
Or maybe it was just a lab accident.

292
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:31,643
l mean, really,
who would wanna kill Abby?

293
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,877
That's true.
lt's not like someone was after Tony.

294
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,766
Now, that's a suspect list
l wouldn't want to run down again.

295
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:40,879
- l think the joke's over. We get it.
- And our suspect list, Ziva?

296
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,685
We don't have one.

297
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,723
But l can contact
the local medical-waste facilities,

298
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:50,799
- see if anyone reported a break-in.
- DiNozzo.

299
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,639
l'll background check
the lodge employees.

300
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,844
Maybe someone's got a vendetta
against the cleaning staff.

301
00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:00,876
- McGee.
- Well, l can-- l can go check on--

302
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:03,636
Boss, l'm not really sure
what l should do.

303
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,367
Go home. Take Abby with you.

304
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:11,200
Gibbs, l'm fine. l only have
one stalker and he has an alibi.

305
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,278
l don't want you
to be alone tonight, Abs.

306
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:16,439
- You're going with McGee.
- Great.

307
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:19,201
Like l haven't been
traumatized enough today.

308
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,559
Nothing like a nice, relaxing
video game to calm the nerves.

309
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:34,036
Pretty good, huh?

310
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,358
l've seen better.
Did you change your refresh rate?

311
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,961
l downloaded new
OpenGL drivers for you.

312
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:41,038
You're getting
a way higher FPS now.

313
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,163
But l was in the bedroom,
like, a minute.

314
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,397
l also optimized
your TCP/lP settings.

315
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,842
lncreased your throughput
by 50 percent.

316
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,843
Bedtime.

317
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:54,081
l am going to take the sleeping bag.

318
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:55,362
We're adults, McGee.

319
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,245
We can share the same bed.

320
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,279
lf you promise
to keep your hands to yourself.

321
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:07,919
Clearly you haven't been.

322
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,159
Your shirt smells like JLo Glow.

323
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,880
l can't find my toothbrush.
l think it fell out in your car.

324
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,402
That's all right. Your old toothbrush
is still in my bathroom.

325
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,285
You kept my old toothbrush?

326
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,041
That's a little creepy, McGee.

327
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,558
Maybe you should take
the sleeping bag.

328
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:31,400
What is creepy about it?
l just never bothered to throw it out.

329
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:35,484
- What?
- This is not my toothbrush.

330
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,840
Well, then l must have bought a
second one and forgot about it.

331
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,197
lt's a ladybug toothbrush, McGee.

332
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,597
That's for cute girls
named Gina Marie

333
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,519
that bake cookies
and wear JLo Glow.

334
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:50,077
Not for a quasi-manly federal agent
who carries a gun.

335
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,475
You wanna use it or not?

336
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,524
An anonymous toothbrush?

337
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,600
l would rather remove my own tonsils
with Typhoid Mary's straight razor.

338
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:01,843
- Where you going?
- To get my toothbrush.

339
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,520
No, no.
You're not leaving the apartment.

340
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,247
Why not, McGee? We both know
Gibbs is just being over-protective.

341
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,443
l'm not worried about you.
l'm worried about me.

342
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,201
- and if Gibbs finds out l let you leave.
- That's a good point. You go.

343
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,559
l am not leaving you alone, either.

344
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,117
Fine, then.
l'll just use your toothbrush.

345
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,960
Don't open the door for anyone.

346
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,443
- What?
- l told you not to open for anyone.

347
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,120
- What'd you forget?
- My keys.

348
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:46,996
- Why do you need keys if l'm here?
- My car keys.

349
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,840
Now listen to me.
You do not open the door. Okay?

350
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,760
- Not for anyone. Or l will tie you up.
- Really?

351
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:06,517
Hi, Abby.

352
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:19,155
l forgot how beautiful you are.

353
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
- l mean, up close, l mean.
- What are you doing here, Mikel?

354
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,639
- You're in terrible danger.
- l got that.

355
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,321
- Oh, no. l'm here to save you.
- What are you saving me from?

356
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,159
How could you ask that
after what happened?

357
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,876
Oh, right. My lab.

358
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,246
- How did you know about that?
- Can we not do this now?

359
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:38,046
Wait. There you go,
playing the frightened victim again.

360
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,118
- McGee!
- Could you not cast me as a stalker?

361
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:43,120
- Believe me, the role is yours.
- Well, l'm sick of it, okay?

362
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,879
l thought almost dying
would make you realise

363
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:47,277
how much you cared about me
and how much l care about you.

364
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:50,438
But l realise l was wrong.

365
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,997
Maybe l was foolish
for trying and trying and trying.

366
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:58,638
But l'm telling you,
you're gonna thank me. Okay?

367
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,963
You still carry the handcuffs
l gave you.

368
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:08,677
That's really great because
l still have the key.

369
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,798
l'm never picking up a guy
in a cemetery again.

370
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,435
Listen, Abby,
l just wanna start over.

371
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:20,086
Mikel, go away!

372
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,362
We had fun, didn't we?

373
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,722
Until you bugged my phone,
you nut-job.

374
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,526
Well, l could pick a lock too.
You forgot about that.

375
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:50,802
McGee.

376
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:03,000
Nothing on the statewide BOLO yet.

377
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,080
Get off your knees.
lt's just a typewriter, McGee.

378
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:11,286
No ATM transactions.
Hasn't touched his credit cards.

379
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,075
Was a typewriter.

380
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,238
And she messed up
my motherboard so badly,

381
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:17,398
the BlOS got screwed up
and l had to do a hard reset.

382
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,478
How traumatizing for you, McGee.

383
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,719
Go easy on him, boss.

384
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:25,402
Even a hair out of order
traumatizes McGee.

385
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,275
Put this on the plasma.

386
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,280
- Where's your chair?
- He doesn't deserve to sit.

387
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:32,766
With that ass?

388
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,957
Didn't find Mawher, boss.
Guy's totally disappeared.

389
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,118
But l found this in his apartment.

390
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,965
He's been tracking her for a while.

391
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:49,325
- So much for that restraining order.
- l spoke to his supposed girlfriend.

392
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,079
They went on one date,
he talked about Abby.

393
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,044
l'll find out more.
We're having dinner.

394
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,721
No, you don't eat until you find
the guy trying to kill Abby.

395
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,003
Boss, actually,
l have an idea about that.

396
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:01,079
l've been analysing the incoming
packets on Abby's system.

397
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,556
There appears to be a shellcode.

398
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:08,361
l think that Mawher's been worming
into Abby's computer

399
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:09,721
to monitor her communications.

400
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,685
- You think you can trace the worm?
- lf he tries to access it again, yeah.

401
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,282
Coordinate with Abby.

402
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:18,161
Boss, you're gonna have to try
and get her out of the elevator first.

403
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,326
Hey, Gibbs.

404
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,883
Did you know that only five

405
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:54,165
of the two and a half million deaths
every year occur in elevators?

406
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,082
No.

407
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,761
Ziva gave me this.

408
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:05,600
And Cynthia gave me
the pepper spray.

409
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,881
The knuckles
are Director Shepard's.

410
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:16,443
No one is going to hurt you, Abby.

411
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,845
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

412
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,201
Did it?

413
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,003
Yeah. Can you say it again?

414
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,964
Nobody's gonna hurt you, Abs.

415
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,561
Can l stay at NClS
until you catch him?

416
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,885
l'll move your whole lab into the
elevator if it'll make you feel better.

417
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:52,564
- Singapore has infiltrated Abu Saif.
- Good.

418
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,479
Forward this
to Sealift Command, ASAP.

419
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,683
Right away, ma'am.

420
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,567
l picked a bad week
to cut out caffeine.

421
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,885
Abu Saif?

422
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:05,561
Singapore's mole believes
that they've infiltrated

423
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:08,525
a prepositioned ship at Diego Garcia.

424
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,242
l'll fill you in later. How's Abby?

425
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,637
She's scared.

426
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:18,322
l thought that Mawher fellow
had an airtight alibi.

427
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:21,160
- Alibi, yes. Airtight--
- ls that

428
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:24,205
Jamaican blend? Yeah.

429
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,005
Alibi, yes. Airtight, no.

430
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:29,159
Last thing a homicide cop worries
about is his clean-up guy.

431
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,046
Yeah, well, your clean-up guy
just made an interesting play.

432
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:33,799
Abby's been subpoenaed again.

433
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,400
l thought she was done
with the court.

434
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,001
She was until the defence
got an anonymous e-mail

435
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,237
saying that the consultant
for the prosecution

436
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,682
- had gone into protective custody.
- Mawher must've found out.

437
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,883
You don't use cream and sugar,
do you?

438
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,636
Mawher must've found out
about the case from Abby's computer.

439
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:53,082
And now he's trying to lure her out.

440
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,442
Does the defence know
they're being used?

441
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:56,722
They don't care.

442
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,959
My guess is that they're gonna use
Abby's restraining order

443
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:03,563
to claim that her judgment is faulty.

444
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,885
- Her judgment?
- Yeah.

445
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,244
The defence is gonna argue
that she makes bad choices.

446
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,557
l don't know this defence lawyer.
l've never dealt with her,

447
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:15,116
but obviously she likes to win.

448
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,405
- She does.
- You know her?

449
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,920
Yeah, l thought l did.

450
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,123
lf she wants to talk to Abby,
she can do it here.

451
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,279
Yeah, agreed. l'll pass it on.
Jethro, could you leave--?

452
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,005
l already did, Jen.

453
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:33,155
- Any luck with that trace yet, McGee?
- Nope.

454
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:36,239
Maybe we should widen
the perimeter of Mawher's BOLO.

455
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,796
- Hey, Tony.
- Not so loud.

456
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,879
l was up all night scrounging through
that guy's garbage, for Pete's sake.

457
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,525
l'm Jack Kerouac, baby. l'm beat.

458
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,679
So the drive wasn't so bad.

459
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:52,920
At 400 an hour, l'm sure you'll
reconsider when you get my bill.

460
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,402
l'll take it from here. Thanks a lot.

461
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,559
Hi. May l help you?

462
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:03,757
Yes. First eat a breath mint.

463
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:06,646
And then you can take me
to the over-protective candy-ass

464
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:09,799
who made me come all the way
down here for a simple deposition.

465
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,235
He's over there.

466
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,480
l should've known.

467
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,163
- Hello, Jethro.
- Hello, Ginger.

468
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,204
Or should l say overzealous
defence attorney

469
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,245
who came all the way down here
to harass my forensic scientist?

470
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,001
Do they know each other?

471
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,566
Nothing gets by you, does it?

472
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,445
Harassment is illegal.

473
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:37,040
- Whereas l have a subpoena.
- How about that. So do l.

474
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,245
You want the e-mail that tipped us
to the restraining order?

475
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:47,762
Why?

476
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,838
We're hoping there's routing
information in the header

477
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,326
that can help us trace it.

478
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:53,398
Going after the whistle-blowers
now, are we?

479
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,876
- No, just stalkers.
- Wait, wait, slow down a second.

480
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,197
- Who's being stalked?
- Her name is Abby.

481
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,961
And your lawyer is going
to try to use her bad taste in men

482
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,799
to impregnate her credibility.

483
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,605
- ''lmpugn,'' Ziva.
- Yes.

484
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,235
What does any of this have to do
with the embezzling charges?

485
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,516
Embezzling. Nice.

486
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,036
How much?

487
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:15,516
They say ten million,
but l'm innocent.

488
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,006
- l was framed.
- Framed.

489
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,401
Yes. ln your case
l actually believe that.

490
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,000
Don't say another word.

491
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,957
- Where's my witness?
- Where's my e-mail?

492
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,756
Hi.

493
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,517
Well, the e-mail will help
narrow down the DNS server

494
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:55,279
but we still have a ways to go
on the trace.

495
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:58,007
l thought computers were supposed
to make things go faster, McGee.

496
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,397
They do. lt's just that
the X-originating lP address

497
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,125
leads to a public lP address.

498
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,846
l'll let you know
when l have something.

499
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,677
Ziva, go home.

500
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:13,081
- l'm staying if you're staying.
- l'm staying.

501
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,362
- Well, l'm staying.
- l'm staying too.

502
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:19,645
l'm sure Abby feels safer already.

503
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:26,083
l see you've vacated the elevator
for the evening.

504
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,478
lt wasn't quite so cosy in there
after an hour with Queen Boudica.

505
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,355
Did you know that the five people that
die in elevators every year,

506
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,246
they only spend an average
of 60 seconds in there a day?

507
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,159
And you've already been in one
for six hours.

508
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:41,000
Exactly. lncreasing my risk
by a thousand fold.

509
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,441
l'm lucky to be alive, Ducky.

510
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:45,997
Well, it's not luck when you have
Leroy Jethro Gibbs looking after you.

511
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,239
However, one cannot be too careful
so l brought you a present.

512
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:50,635
lt's a safety whistle.

513
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:53,367
Emits a 1 20-decibel blast.

514
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:58,282
One good blow of this and your
attacker's eardrums are shattered.

515
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,161
Thank you, Ducky.

516
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,597
Boss, getting a verification ping
on my tracer program.

517
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,246
Trying to back trace.

518
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:10,919
Do you think you can type
any harder, McGee?

519
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:13,726
This guy's good. He's bypassed
all our authentication routines.

520
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,196
- Ziva, you getting this?
- Yes. lt looks like Mawher

521
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,005
accessed Abby's accounts
30 minutes ago.

522
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,646
- McGee.
- Yeah?

523
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:21,445
Used her terminal
to send an e-mail to--

524
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:23,956
The Pass and lD office
on the Navy yard?

525
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:26,919
He was giving himself a drive-on.

526
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:30,196
Security.

527
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,721
Jimmy, you don't have
to keep calling me. l'm fine.

528
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,162
<i>lt's Mikel, Abby. Don't hang up.</i>

529
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:42,919
Oh, great. My biggest fan.

530
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,078
<i>Look, l know we got off</i>
<i>on the wrong foot.</i>

531
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:46,760
The wrong foot?

532
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,885
The only right foot
is my foot up your--

533
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:51,958
<i>Abby, Abby. Listen.</i>
<i>l need to see you.</i>

534
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,480
You really are insane.

535
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:56,286
<i>lf you just trust me,</i>
<i>l promise, nothing will happen to you.</i>

536
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:57,641
And if l don't? What?

537
00:30:57,807 --> 00:31:00,685
You're gonna tear up that nice
collage you were making for me?

538
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:05,477
Let's just say you're not as safe
as you think you are.

539
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,760
<i>Abby, somebody tried to kill you in</i>
<i>your own lab. You're not safe in there.</i>

540
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:17,962
Oh, and let me guess.

541
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,243
You're the only person
who can protect me.

542
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:21,999
See, you're starting
to understand. Good.

543
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:26,246
Kind of like that time somebody broke
into my house and stole my mail?

544
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:27,840
<i>Yeah, that was pretty scary, huh?</i>

545
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,726
Yeah, and that crazy freak
that kept slashing my tires.

546
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:33,082
Yeah, l was really worried
about you then, Ab.

547
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:36,603
Mikel, that was you. You slashed
my tires. You stole my mail.

548
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,678
<i>What does that matter,</i>
<i>as long as it made you realise</i>

549
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,599
you know, your true feelings
for me, Ab, huh?

550
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,123
No, no, no. Try using the SlD instead
of the ESN for registration request.

551
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:49,476
That's a good idea.

552
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,964
- Hey.
- Abby, down!

553
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,163
- He was right there.
- He's here, McGee, on the move.

554
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,557
<i>MPs on scene, Tony.</i>

555
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:03,126
- Are you okay?
- No.

556
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,959
- Clear.
- Clear.

557
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:06,799
Ziva, lock down the yard.
No one in or out.

558
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,765
- We'll find him, Abby.
- Well, then l can't stay here, Gibbs.

559
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,600
- Definitely not staying at McGee's.
- No place is safe.

560
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,723
lf he can get on the Navy yard,
he can get anywhere.

561
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:18,766
Not anywhere. Not anywhere.

562
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:26,881
Nothing like a nice, quiet, dungeon-like
basement to calm the nerves.

563
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:41,921
You need to sleep, Abby.

564
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,757
l know. l tried.

565
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:47,316
Every time l close my eyes,
l see Mikel.

566
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,125
With the grain.

567
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,479
l thought l was.

568
00:32:56,167 --> 00:33:01,924
l don't understand why people drink
alcohol when they're depressed.

569
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:04,647
Because alcohol is a depressant.

570
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:09,119
Now l'm still depressed

571
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,275
and l'm nauseous.

572
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:16,278
And really drunk.

573
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:24,921
Which means that tomorrow l have to
go fight a hangover while l'm in court

574
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:31,481
while some ambulance-chasing
attorney tries to attack my credibility.

575
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,842
What is wrong with me, Gibbs?

576
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,244
What did l do to deserve this?

577
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,562
lt's not about you, Abby.
lt's about him.

578
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:45,604
Then why do l feel so guilty?

579
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,997
l don't know. Why do you?

580
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,556
Because

581
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,845
l think this might all be my fault.

582
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:56,796
Maybe it is.

583
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:01,041
How could you say that
to me, Gibbs?

584
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,516
l didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:09,285
Just because some defective lunatic

586
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,484
can't get it through
his thick skull that l think

587
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:17,846
he is a defective lunatic.

588
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:23,997
That is not my fault, Gibbs.

589
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:28,318
That's not my fault at all.

590
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:30,955
This is not my fault.

591
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,038
lt's not my fault.

592
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,603
l see why you like
to work on your boat, Gibbs.

593
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,076
lt's very, very cathartic.

594
00:34:57,607 --> 00:35:00,360
Suddenly having a stalker
on the loose isn't so scary.

595
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:02,006
He's not on the loose, Abby.

596
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,318
That's what l came down here
to tell you. DiNozzo called.

597
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:08,320
The Coast Guard picked up
Mikel Mawher

598
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:11,047
trying to cross the Anacostia.

599
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:12,196
This is harassment. Okay?

600
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,562
l'm gonna file a restraining order
against your department.

601
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,084
Knock yourself out.
They did wonders for me.

602
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,681
- lt's over, Abby.
- Not until he finds another loophole

603
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:23,805
to crawl out of.
He will. You don't know him.

604
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:25,480
- No.
- <i>Sit down and shut up.</i>

605
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:26,875
But l know Gibbs.

606
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,241
Excuse me, director?

607
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,797
The Federal Marshall
is here for Abby.

608
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,765
- Just when it was getting good.
- <i>All right, l'll sit.</i>

609
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,202
- Judges don't like to be kept waiting.
- <i>But l want it on record</i>

610
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,757
- <i>that it was under extreme duress.</i>
- <i>Noted.</i>

611
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:44,077
- Let me know how it turns out.
- Don't worry.

612
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:47,045
Gibbs won't let him crawl out
of anything.

613
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,917
You guys have it all wrong.
l'm not the one trying to hurt Abby.

614
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:53,600
No, you're just
the misunderstood lover

615
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,327
who flies in at the last second
to be her saviour.

616
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,717
- That how the game's played?
- This isn't a game.

617
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:02,084
- Okay, l'm trying to protect Abby here.
- lnteresting way of showing it.

618
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,158
No choice. lt's the only way
l can get her to listen.

619
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,397
Abby and l have been
going through a rough patch lately.

620
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,001
Hey. There is no Abby and you.

621
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,283
And rough patches don't
usually include cyanide.

622
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:12,482
That wasn't me.

623
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:15,115
l didn't know Abby was in trouble
until after you came to my office.

624
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,443
Look, l'm not the one trying
to hurt Abby.

625
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,922
But l know who is.

626
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:26,077
Not his name, but his picture.
Right there.

627
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,157
After you guys came to see me, l
started to go through all my old photos.

628
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:33,922
Exhibits A through G of you violating
your restraining order?

629
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:35,759
lt's not illegal if l stay
1 00 yards away.

630
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,885
lt is if you harass, follow or threaten.

631
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:41,197
Semantics, okay?

632
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,164
Anyway, l'm going
through all my old photos,

633
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,283
and the same guy kept popping up
over and over again.

634
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,041
That's gotta be your guy.

635
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,323
There. Right there. Him.
The scary guy right there.

636
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,279
That scary guy?
The really scary guy right there?

637
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,562
No, no. The other guy.

638
00:36:56,727 --> 00:36:59,366
Zoom in on the other guy.
Yeah, keep going.

639
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,404
Keep going. Keep rolling.
You see what l'm saying?

640
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,886
l wasn't the only one following her.

641
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:06,722
The only reason l was able to worm
into Abby's computer in the first place

642
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:11,324
is because somebody had cracked
the authentication protocols before me.

643
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:16,606
Thanks for the lift.

644
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:20,236
l could really use it
after the week l've had.

645
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,762
Don't forget your seatbelt.

646
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:29,475
He's right, boss. Mawher's worm
didn't penetrate Abby's system

647
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,036
<i>until after the authentication calls</i>
<i>were cracked.</i>

648
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:34,403
- Who cracked them?
- Well, that's gonna take some time.

649
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:35,716
We don't have time.

650
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,481
That was the federal marshal
who was supposed to pick up Abby.

651
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,524
- Supposed to?
- Someone slashed the tires

652
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,678
on his transport. He hasn't left yet.

653
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:48,397
So l guess the lesson is to always trust
your instincts, you know?

654
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:52,401
Like with you. You scare me.
So we could never date.

655
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:55,604
But don't feel bad.
l mean, you're a federal agent.

656
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,839
You should scare people.
That's your job. You--

657
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:08,241
No answer on her cell phone.

658
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:09,522
Running a trace.

659
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,279
State police have been notified.

660
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,084
- <i>Still no answer, Gibbs.</i>
- Keep trying.

661
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,158
- How far could he have gotten?
- Far enough.

662
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,919
lf he knows his window's small.

663
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,647
- McGee, l'm not gonna ask again.
- <i>Location's coming up.</i>

664
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:22,923
Sending GPS coordinates
to your PDA.

665
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:26,796
Okay, l got it. This can't be right.
lt says we're right on top of her.

666
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,400
That's because we are.

667
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:44,795
DiNozzo.

668
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,366
l'll be with you in a minute, Gibbs.

669
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,038
And don't look up my skirt!

670
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:10,442
Okay.

671
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:12,995
- So how'd it go?
- Horrible.

672
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,000
The judge ruled all
of my physical evidence inadmissible.

673
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,282
Then threw out the case.

674
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,960
Hit you hard, huh?

675
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,277
Actually, no. She didn't bring up
my bad taste in men.

676
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:24,439
- She attacked the science.
- lt always was about the science.

677
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,723
l only questioned you
on the restraining order

678
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:29,276
to throw the prosecution
off my real game plan.

679
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,836
Human-scent detection
is a viable forensic tool.

680
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:34,202
Which has yet
to be fully vetted and peer-approved.

681
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,164
- Lucky for me.
- Scent evidence

682
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:39,205
is the only physical evidence tying
the defendant to the money he took.

683
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,085
We're saying
you're a very smelly man.

684
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:43,283
Hey, l was proven innocent,
remember?

685
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,678
Actually, you just weren't found guilty.
There's a difference.

686
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,839
l'll keep that in mind while l'm getting
a tan on the beaches of Bora Bora.

687
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,157
Don't take it so hard.
l knew it was going to end like this

688
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:53,760
right from the very beginning.

689
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:55,997
- Too bad your client didn't.
- Yeah.

690
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,158
You should have
trusted your lawyer there, Giggle-man.

691
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,557
lnstead of spending
all of that money hiring a hit man

692
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:03,195
to take out the star witness,
a.k.a. me.

693
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:05,399
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.

694
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,159
You paid him to kill.

695
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:09,363
You didn't pay him
to keep his mouth shut.

696
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:13,122
That dude even gave you credit for
the bloodbath at the Navy Lodge.

697
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:17,766
- You guys think you're so smart.
- Terry, don't say a word.

698
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,118
Back in the car. Let's go.

699
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,003
l was right, wasn't l?

700
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:45,365
That's right. Abby would be dead
by now if it wasn't for me.

701
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,486
ls that what you think?

702
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,327
l think Terry Spooner never
would've gotten as close as he did

703
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,796
without you as a distraction.

704
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,844
That the real danger here was you.

705
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,680
No, no. People accuse me
of playing mind games. No.

706
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:04,801
Metro Cops found your car.

707
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,719
They found the gun.

708
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:10,837
Found the suicide note you wrote
in Abby's handwriting.

709
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:12,645
That was just a last resort.

710
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:16,004
Look, l love her.
l love her, you know?

711
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,123
You don't get it, do you?

712
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:23,321
She wants everybody to believe
that she doesn't love me.

713
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,603
<i>Hell, l think she</i>
<i>even believes it sometimes.</i>

714
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,678
Tell you what,
if you don't care about me,

715
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:31,203
<i>then how come you can't take</i>
<i>your eyes off me right now?</i>

716
00:41:32,807 --> 00:41:36,038
You can lie to the rest of the world,
you can't lie to your heart.

717
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:37,196
Can you, Abby?

718
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:43,645
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

719
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,125
Abby! Abby!

720
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:51,999
Look, l know you're in there. Abby!
