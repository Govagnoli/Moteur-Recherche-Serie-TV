1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,240
Transport 334, we're hearing a
tractor trailer flipped over on 295.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,440
It's a parking lot.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,680
334, roger that.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Tell the judge we're going
to be a little awhile.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,840
We'll peel off at New Kent.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,640
I'll take King Williams to River Road.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,160
Nah, just take stay on 17 the whole way.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,520
Yeah, wait one.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,200
My wife is giving me directions.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,400
I don't want to take
the damn scenic route.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
You got all those
stoplights in New Kent.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,960
Oh God, I can't breathe!

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,040
Richie?

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:42,880
Stop the bus.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,920
Just pull it over to the side.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,320
Richie!

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,200
You okay?

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,680
Come on. Let's get out of here.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,200
How'd it go?

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Perfect.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
Didn't feel a thing.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
Did White seem to buy it?

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,920
He bought it, all right.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,640
He was scared.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,480
You could smell it.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,240
Hey, Gibbs.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah, I'm calling about
the VW convertible.

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
What?

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,920
The '92 VW for sale.

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,320
got the wrong number.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
Come on, Kate. We're moving.

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,080
Hello.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,000
You got him?

34
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
Are you honestly asking me that?

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,440
No, Abbs, I called to flirt.

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,520
Do you think I would
send our helpless boy

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,560
out there in the world without
knowing exactly where he is?

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,160
Have you got a video?

39
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,560
I tought you said you had him.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,960
The GPS system has his
position within four feet.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,600
You don't have him in the car?

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
No, Abby, I do not!

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,120
Okay, I got him now.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,920
You forgot to turn it on.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Put McGee on.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,920
He wants you.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
How'd he know I was here?

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Because he's Gibbs.

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
Uh, yes, boss.

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,000
I got people calling me every five
minutes asking if I have a VW for sale.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
A VW?

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,440
It's a car, McGee.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
No, no, no. I know.

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
I just didn't know that you owned a VW.

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,640
Do I seem like the kind of guy who
would drive a squishy little car?

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,120
No. You know, it's probably a
used car listing in the paper

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,440
with the wrong number that
is, unfortunately, your number.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,480
Do you think?

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
You already figured that out.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,040
Fix it!

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
How does he want me to fix it?

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,480
You can't.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,840
You're doomed.

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,880
So you better get back to the case.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
Okay, so where did you
finally put the GPS?

66
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,960
I thought about subdermal implantation.

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,880
Under the skin?

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Yeah, like, maybe in his neck.

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,880
Tony wouldn't go for it.

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,440
But I would have loved
to have done that.

71
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,560
Didn't consider a suppository?

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,360
I thought of it.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,960
Tony balked.

74
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,760
Surprising.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,320
Yeah.

76
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,160
I put it in his shoe.

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
It's really boring.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Wait.

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,080
I can't...

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,960
I can't keep going.

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Get up and run!

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's go.

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
Hey! I just killed a guy back there.

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
I am not getting caught.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,040
Let's get up and run!

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,560
Move it!

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Let's go!

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
If you kill me, you're
going to have to drag me.

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,360
Okay. What's your name?

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,840
Jeffrey.

91
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm Tony. You ever see
The Defiant Ones, Jeffrey?

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,800
What?

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,360
The movie, The Defiant Ones.

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Tony Curtis, Sidney Poitier?

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,000
I think I'm having an asthma attack.

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a great movie.

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,160
These two guys, right?

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
A black guy and a white guy
escape from a Southern chain gang.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
They're chained together,
just like we are.

100
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,320
We're not black.

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
My grandmother was black.

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh. Okay, so, what happens?

103
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,160
They fight each other
every step of the way.

104
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,640
Tony Curtis has an infected
wrist, a bullet in his shoulder...

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,720
Really?

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
Yeah. He had guts.

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,320
Guts, Jeffrey.

108
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
He doesn't want to live in a cage.

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,040
I don't want to live in a cage.

110
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,400
So we're going to get up.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,760
Jeffrey, we're going to get up
and we're going to get out of here.

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,000
Who's Tony Curtis?

113
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
Who's Tony Curtis?

114
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
You are. Let's go.

115
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,520
Where's Gibbs?

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,640
Who needs to know?

117
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm the new Senior MTAC Control Officer.

118
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Where is he?

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
He is in the field.

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,000
The Director's Office called.

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,560
In five minutes, the Deputy
Secretary of State, Anna Elliott...

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
The Deputy Secretary
of the United States?

123
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
No, Norway.

124
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,400
She's coming on an MTAC.

125
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
She's going to be the State
Department rep on the investigation.

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,040
Get Gibbs fast.

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
I don't have a VW for sale!

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Yeah, I-I know, boss.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,080
Switching to the car feed.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,680
The Deputy Secretary of
State is coming on an MTAC

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
in five minutes and she
wants to speak with you.

132
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Handle it, McGee.

133
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,680
Uh, excuse me?

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,760
You are the highest-ranking member of
our team in the office. Deal with it.

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
Do you think that's a good idea?

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,760
This is a very powerful and
important government official...

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,240
Boss? Boss?

138
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
Agent Gibbs?

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Uh, no. No, ma'am.

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
Agent Timothy McGee.

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
Are you in charge of this investigation?

142
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Uh, at this moment, uh...

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
here at NCIS headquarters, I am.

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,760
Agent Gibbs is unreachable in the field.

145
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay, give me the short version.

146
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,760
Well, since the beginning of
the war, many very valuable Iraqi

147
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
antiquities have been
smuggled out of Iraq.

148
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,480
Roll it.

149
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
You should be seeing
them on your screen now.

150
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
FBI and Customs have sd many
of these pieces in the U.S.

151
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,520
They were collected
and stored at Norfolk

152
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,600
Naval Station for shipment back to Iraq.

153
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,880
Many of these artifacts date
back from the Sumerian period.

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
They're about 5,000 years old.

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Is this the short version?

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Y- Yes.

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,200
Shorter.

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,200
Faster and's skip the
whole Sumerian period.

159
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
Okay. Okay.

160
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,960
Uh, they were stolen by
two civilian employees

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,440
who were hired to crate them
for shipment back to Iraq.

162
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
And how many pieces were taken?

163
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,440
Eighty-seven.

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,040
They were stolen in-in a large Conex
container roughly... 18 hours ago.

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,560
One of the thieves,
Jeffrey White, picked up on

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,880
a traffic violation minutes
after an APB went out.

167
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
He is in custody... sort of.

168
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,320
The other is Lane Harrison.

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
He is, he is at large
with the Conex box.

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,920
What does that mean,
"In custody, sort of"?

171
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,480
If the Iraqi antiquities are not
recovered within 48 hours, statistically,

172
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,880
they will probably be sold into private
art collections and lost forever.

173
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
Okay, I'll ask again.

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
What does that mean
"In custody, sort of"?

175
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,800
Sorry. Uh, Jeffrey, Jeffrey refused
to talk, so we let him get away with an

176
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,960
undercover agent, hoping that he
would lead us to the Conex box.

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,840
You let the one that
you had in custody escape

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,000
With an undercover
NCIS agent, yes, ma'am.

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,160
They did this in The Defiant Ones.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,400
Chain represents the
unbreakable bond between all men.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Every scene in that movie is a metaphor.

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,560
You don't talk like a criminal.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,520
What'd you do?

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
Okay, I didn't do anything.

185
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,480
Let's get that crystal clear.

186
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,920
I was landing my plane in Virginia Beach

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
on my way back from
the Dominican Republic.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,000
You're a pilot?

189
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah, I was flying in this rich couple.

190
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,280
Customs found four keys
of cocaine in the luggage.

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
It was the rich couple's.

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,280
I never saw it before.

193
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,840
It's a tough break.

195
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,840
Yeah.

196
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,200
I was locked in at 25 to life.

197
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
I wasn't going to let that happen.

198
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,480
And this isn't working.

199
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,240
All right. We gotta keep moving.

200
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
You ready to be Tony Curtis again?

201
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,320
All right. Here we go.

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
This way.

203
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
That's it. That's it.

204
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,360
You are Tony Curtis.

205
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,200
They're moving.

207
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah, baby.

208
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
That's our ticket out of here.

209
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
All right, let's find
out if anybody's home.

210
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,800
Watch it! Watch it!

211
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,960
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Shush!

212
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,120
I guess, I guess no one's home, huh?

213
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
They would have heard us, right?

214
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,440
You figured out yourself
to put that all together!?

215
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,640
Hey, was there anything like this,
like in the water, in The Defiant Ones?

216
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:50,400
Yeah. Yeah, there was a scene where the two
of them nearly drowned but that was a river.

217
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,800
This is a river.

218
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,480
No, this is not a river Jeffrey.

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,680
You know what this is?

220
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,840
It's a stream.

221
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
And you can't drown in a stream, ok?

222
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,480
You can get wet and you can get
fucking freezin', but you can't drown!

223
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,160
You look mad.

224
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
Why are mad? We survived.

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
Surviving in two feet of water
is not a heroic accomplishment.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
It is when you have
a phobia of drowning.

227
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,720
You look cold.

228
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
I am cold.

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,120
Okay. Let's see if we can get inside.

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,760
Lost him.

231
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,640
I lost him, too!

232
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,360
There's something wrong with the GPS.

233
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,920
God...

234
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
The chicks are going to love you.

235
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,240
That'll be the day.

236
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Am I sensing a lack of confidence here?

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,240
Well, look at me.

238
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,400
What have I got to be confident about?

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,120
Hey, pump a little iron,
get a tan, contact lenses...

240
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,960
...caps, maybe a little plastic
surgery, and you'll be fine.

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,720
Jeffrey, it's our lucky day.

242
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,720
You know, you've only been
with me four hours, Jeffrey.

243
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,560
You realize how much
your life has changed?

244
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,560
You're out of prison,
you got new threads,

245
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,320
and you're riding in a
tricked-out GMC Sierra.

246
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,160
We got a signal from the truck.

247
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
We're back in business, Gibbs.

248
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,360
Good call on the trailer.

249
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
Cash, clothes and a car.

250
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Everything Tony loves.

251
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,720
Let's just hope he's
not headed for Vegas.

252
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,120
Would you slow down?

253
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
If I go any slower I'll be
going backwards, Jeffrey.

254
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,120
Ah, these cuff are chaffing me.

255
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
Maybe we should stop
and get you some lotion.

256
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,600
Really?

257
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,320
No, not really, Jeffrey.

258
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,200
We're criminals on the run, and criminals
on the run don't stop and get lotion.

259
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,040
Right.

260
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,640
Okay, listen, just relax.

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
I know some people down in Florida.

262
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,000
We can drive down there.

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Problem is, we can't stay
in this truck forever.

264
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,000
It's probably LoJacked.

265
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
I have a friend who could help us.

266
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,880
He's near here.

267
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
You have a friend near here?

268
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,800
And you were going to tell me this when?

269
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,360
Sorry.

270
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,760
I just thought of it.

271
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,920
Let's find a pay phone.

272
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,120
Star. How can we help you, Mr. Reynolds?

273
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,160
Hi, yeah, we'd like to make a call.

274
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,200
I'd be happy to place that call for you.

275
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,440
What is the number?

276
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Hold on a second?

277
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,440
Let's get out of these cuffs, Jeffery.

278
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
What's the number?

279
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,720
Come on.

280
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,440
Watch out!

281
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,880
Gibbs, it sounds like
Tony was in an accident.

282
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,040
Got it, Abby.

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,600
We're on it.

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
I wasn't going to hit him.

285
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
I saw him the whole time.

286
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,160
I think I have a concussion.

287
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,560
You didn't hit your head on anything.

288
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,800
The sticker says the
"airbags can be fatal."

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,520
For children.

290
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,720
You okay?

291
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Yeah, we're cool.

292
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,520
I called 911.

293
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,680
Kate?

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,280
Oh, no.

295
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,840
Who's Kate?

296
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:38,840
My dog.

297
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,640
She must've jumped out.

298
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,240
Kate!

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Kate!

300
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Come here, girl!

301
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,120
My leg.

302
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,080
Can you move it?

303
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,920
Wait here.

304
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,480
I'll get her.

305
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,840
What does she look like?

306
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,480
A... shih tzu.

307
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,040
A what?

308
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,240
Long, brown hair, kind of mangy.

309
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,680
- Put your arm around.
- What?

310
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay, under. all right?

311
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
Hey, what are you doing?!

312
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,440
Hey! Hey, hey!

313
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,520
My bike was stolen.

314
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,040
You gotta help me.

315
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:39,880
Who stole it?

316
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,920
Two guys their truck went off the road.

317
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,880
I was helping find their dog.

318
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,760
They had a dog?

319
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
A shih tzu named Kate.

320
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
They had a dog named Kate?

321
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,520
What's a shih tzu?

322
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,800
It's a little, annoying dog.

323
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Did they describe it?

324
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah, they said it had long, brown hair.

325
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,120
Kind of mangy.

326
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm going to shoot him.

327
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
How much gas do you
have left in your tank?

328
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Almost nothing.

329
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,360
Half-gallon, tops.

330
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,280
Let's go.

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,720
Hey, what about my bike?

332
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,960
We're going to find it.

333
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,720
Great, that's great.

334
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,360
What should I do?

335
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,760
Find the dog.

336
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Loosen your grip.

337
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,520
What?

338
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,920
I can't breathe!

339
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
My hand is numb, I can't move it.

340
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Stop it.

341
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm going to fall off.

342
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
You're not falling, Jeffrey.

343
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,240
I can't ride without hugging.

344
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,040
Stop it.

345
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
You and I are going to have a
long talk after this, Jeffrey.

346
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Come on, guys.

347
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,960
Give me something to work with.

348
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,800
Hah!

349
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
It happened on the way to arraignment.

350
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,080
I had no choice.

351
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,960
Why the hell'd you run?

352
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,160
I was handcuffed. What
was I supposed to do?

353
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,120
Don't you sell that without me, Lane.

354
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,560
Okay.

355
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,480
I know.

356
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,320
Lane is not happy you're with me.

358
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Well, we cut the chain,
you'll never see me again.

359
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,560
Could you fly me and
Lane out of the country?

360
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,200
It's tricky, Jeffrey.

361
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,680
We'd have to fly below the radar.

362
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
No transponder.

363
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,160
Limited range.

364
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,160
Won't be cheap.

365
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,400
I could come up with the money.

366
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,360
It might make Lane like you.

367
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,960
I don't need Lane to like me.

368
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
We get out of these cuffs, you
can come with me, if you want.

369
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,040
Without Lane.

370
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,520
Thanks. But I can't.

371
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,440
Hey, could I drive?

372
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm getting a cramp in this position.

373
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:49,840
No.

374
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,960
You didn't even think about it.

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,600
Well, you ran into a tree.

376
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Trust me, you shouldn't be...

377
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,600
...operating heavy machinery.

378
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Haven't seen 'em.

379
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,360
Well, here's our number if they come in.

380
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Sure.

381
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,400
What?

382
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,560
You're worried.

383
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,160
About what?

384
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Tony.

385
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
You are. I can tell.

386
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm worried about the job, Kate.

387
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't confuse the two.

388
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
I sold it.

389
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
Where is Special Agent Gibbs?

390
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
He... he is still in the field.

391
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,720
Is he planning on coming back
or am I doomed to speak to you

392
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,520
for the duration of this investigation?

393
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,840
Ma'am, he is... he is
searching for a missing agent.

394
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,960
The agent chained to Jeffrey White?

395
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,400
Yes.

396
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
When a fellow officer is in trouble...

397
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,520
So, you lost the agent who
is chained to Jeffrey White?

398
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,400
Well, yes, but...

399
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,680
Using the transitive
property then that leads me to

400
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,760
the conclusion that NCIS
has lost Jeffrey White.

401
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
No.

402
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,080
No? Then you have
Jeffrey White in custody?

403
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,600
Well, I-I...

404
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,160
I...

405
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,920
Call the minute you find him.

406
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,480
Or whenever your mouth
begins to work again.

407
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,920
Whichever comes first.

408
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,640
I am not having this
conversation with you, Jeffrey.

409
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,480
For the 300th and final
time, shut your pie hole.

410
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,520
Okay. Okay, okay.

411
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,080
Just... just wait, wait.

412
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,040
Hey, Lane.

413
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:48,920
Hey.

414
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,040
That's Tony.

415
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,800
How you doin'?

416
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:54,800
Okay.

417
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,480
She's not as comfortable as she looks.

418
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,520
Trust me.

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,800
You killed a federal marshal?

420
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I don't know that I killed him.

421
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,760
You don't strike me
the type to kill a man.

422
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,360
Sorry to disappoint you.

423
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,800
Did Jeffrey tell you
what we have going on?

424
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,840
Ah, he just said that you wanted
me to fly you out of the country.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,360
That's all?

426
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,680
Yeah, that's all.

427
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Jeffrey... manipulates easy.

428
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm not manipulating...

429
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,880
No?

430
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,600
No.

431
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
You want me out of here, I'm gone.

432
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,560
There's no need to rush off.

433
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,760
Unless you want to.

434
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,080
Gotcha.

435
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,160
Their names didn't bring
up any criminal records.

436
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,680
That's because this print
doesn't match Lane Harrison

437
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,640
or Jeffrey White.

438
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
Meet Billy Collins.

439
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,440
Oh, no.

440
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,320
Yeah? Gibbs.

441
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,160
We've got an ID.

442
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
Boss, Lane Harrison is an alias.

443
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,640
He has done time for
armed robbery and is wanted

444
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,280
for three murders in the Seattle area.

445
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,080
What's his M.O.?

446
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,800
According to the autopsy reports...

447
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,440
Abby?

448
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,440
He was a regular Mack the Knife, Gibbs.

449
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,320
Their throats were cut from behind.

450
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,640
There's a bed.

451
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,760
It'll help you sleep.

452
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Thanks.

453
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,780
We now believe that
Jeffrey White and Lane

454
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,100
Harrison are not who they say they are.

455
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,940
We've linked them to several murders.

456
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,100
You put your agent with murderers...

457
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,540
Yes, but we didn't know.

458
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,860
...and then you lost contact
with your agent, Yes, but...

459
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,780
and you still have no idea
where in the world he is.

460
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,820
No, but...

461
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,900
And you have no idea where
the Iraqi antiquities are.

462
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,300
Well, no-no,
we-we don't.

463
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
Not a clue?

464
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,300
Not a clue.

465
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,220
You ever worked at the
post office, Agent McGee?

466
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,260
No, ma'am.

467
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,540
You ever clean toilets
at a federal campground?

468
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,500
No, ma'am.

469
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,260
If these antiquities are
not found immediately,

470
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,340
you will not even be able to get
those two federal government jobs.

471
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,700
Am I clear?

472
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,540
He's leaving bread crumbs.

473
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,420
McGee.

474
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,100
Hey.

475
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Pull the records on a
pay phone number for me.

476
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,860
Ready.

477
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,860
The number is
804-555-0178.

478
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,500
Seven, eight.

479
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,180
Okay, got it.

480
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,020
Compare the numbers to the ones we
have on Jeffrey White or Lane Harrison.

481
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,300
Family, friends, anything.

482
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,980
Uh, look, boss,

483
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,060
the Deputy Secretary of
State, she-she keeps calling.

484
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,180
She keeps threatening things.

485
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,420
Things? What kind of things?

486
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,380
Not letting us clean
toilets, other jobs like that.

487
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,780
Hey, McGee, calm down.

488
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,820
Okay.

489
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,300
Sorry. I'm calm now.

490
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,980
Okay, I'm going to tell
you how to handle this.

491
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Next time she calls, you give her two
words from the bottom of your heart.

492
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,700
Two words.

493
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,300
Stick it.

494
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,220
"Stick it"?

495
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,140
I- I'm not sure that I...

496
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,620
Morning.

497
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,460
What's the matter?

498
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,020
I'm not used to waking up this
close to a man's face, Jeffrey.

499
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,780
We got to get out of here.

500
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,860
Lane took off.

501
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,420
Where did he go?

502
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,780
Last night we fought.

503
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,260
Over you.

504
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,580
Really don't like the
way that sounds, Jeffrey.

505
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,140
He wanted to get rid of you.

506
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,140
I wouldn't let him.

507
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,860
Oh, now that sounds good.

508
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,740
You've been decent to me.

509
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,580
Not a lot of people have.

510
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,940
Where did he go?

511
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,140
I'm going to lay it out for you.

512
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,220
All right.

513
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm about to make a lot of money.

514
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,300
But I need a partner.

515
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,660
Talk to me.

516
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,740
Lane and me stole some stuff.

517
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,780
Very valuable stuff.

518
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,820
I kind of figured that.

519
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,340
What is it, drugs?

520
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,300
Stuff from Iraq.

521
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,100
Like from a hundred thousand years ago.

522
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,340
There were no people then, Jeffrey.

523
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,460
Whatever. It's old.

524
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,940
We got it off this Navy
base we were working at.

525
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,780
What's it worth?

526
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,260
Three million.

527
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,060
You're kidding.

528
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,140
We got a buyer this guy from Japan.

529
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,060
The stuff's going to be
on a ship to Tokyo tonight.

530
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,460
So when do you get the money?

531
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,540
Eight hours.

532
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,900
Okay.

533
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,940
Lane took off to sell it out
from under you, didn't he?

534
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,980
We got to get to those
buyers before he does.

535
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,340
Where's the stuff?

536
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,700
Someplace safe.

537
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,620
You with me?

538
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:48,700
I can't face Lane alone.

539
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,340
I'm with you.

540
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,660
Let's break the pattern.

541
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,740
What pattern?

542
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,740
"Dishonest silence" pattern.

543
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,260
I'll start.

544
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,140
I'm worried for Tony.

545
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,740
There. I said it.

546
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,260
I dropped my guard for two seconds,
I got it out, now I'm happy.

547
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,580
That made you happy?

548
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,340
Yes.

549
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,580
Don't you want to be happy, Gibbs?

550
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
I am happy.

551
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,140
You don't look happy.

552
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,140
We're done with this.

553
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
I thought we were.

554
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,420
Yeah, McGee?

555
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,460
Switch to car feed.

556
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,700
Boss, I got the list of numbers
dialed from the pay phone.

557
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,180
One was placed to a hunting
cabin outside of Richmond.

558
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,380
It was the only phone call made
from that pay phone all afternoon.

559
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,700
I'm feeding you the GPS coordinates now.

560
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,740
How soon can you get the plane?

561
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,180
Well, I know a guy that can
arrange a charter to Key West.

562
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,340
From there, we can get a
King Air 350 twin engine.

563
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,060
That'll get us to Mexico.

564
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,580
I'm glad Lane took off.

565
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,580
We're gonna make a good team.

566
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,300
Better get going.

567
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,580
Lane took the bike.

568
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,740
He must've pushed it down the road.

569
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,220
He didn't want us to wake
up when he started it.

570
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,460
My father used to
have a cabin like this.

571
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,540
He used to bring me and my sister here.

572
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,900
Good times?

573
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,660
Used to beat the crap out of me.

574
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,460
Your parents are supposed to
help you, Tony, not hurt you.

575
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,420
Your father hurt you?

576
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,620
No, he was too drunk to hurt anyone.

577
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:04,980
I hate it here.

578
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,820
Then let's get out of
here, make us some money.

579
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,220
Hell, yeah.

580
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,700
Let's go make us lots of money.

581
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,300
Either I speak to Agent Gibbs
and get a full accounting

582
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,700
of this investigation or I've
been authorized to pull NCIS

583
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,180
from the investigation and put
it under the FBI's jurisdiction.

584
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,980
You're getting in the way.

585
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,220
Excuse me, Agent McGee.

586
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,620
We are working very hard.

587
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,940
We have an undercover
agent who is missing.

588
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
He's risking his life, and
your constant interruptions

589
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,860
are keeping me from doing my job.

590
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,700
You lost your prisoners.

591
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,620
You lost your agent.

592
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,580
That is not true.

593
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,420
That's what you told me.

594
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,740
Look, the truth is,

595
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,940
that while Agent DiNozzo is lost,
Jeffrey White is still with him,

596
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,860
so Jeffrey White, technically, is
with an NCIS agent and therefor,

597
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:05,700
technically, is still in custody.

598
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,060
Well, you've clearly been
empowered to tell me off.

599
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,100
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,700
And what exactly did Agent
Gibbs tell you to say to me?

601
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
He told me to tell you to...

602
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,660
stick it.

603
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,500
You're telling me to...

604
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,580
Stick it.

605
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,100
Thank you, Ms. Deputy
Secretary of State.

606
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,220
Our conversation is now over.

607
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:21,183
Clear.

608
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,100
Clear.

609
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,580
We're too late.

610
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,060
Search it.

611
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah? Gibbs.

612
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,700
Special Agent McGee speaking.

613
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,660
Hey, McGee.

614
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,380
Yes, boss.

615
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Run the phone records for
the land line at the cabin.

616
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,420
On it.

617
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,900
Oh, and, uh, boss, I told her...

618
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,900
the Deputy Secretary of State.

619
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,100
Yeah? How'd it work?

620
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,620
Well, she submitted a formal
complaint to the Director.

621
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,780
McGee...

622
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,220
good job.

623
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,620
Gibbs!

624
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,340
Over here.

625
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,020
Throat's slashed to the spine.

626
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,300
Lane Harrison didn't kill
those two guys in Seattle.

627
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,820
Jeffrey White did it.

628
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,220
Tony has no idea who he's with, Gibbs.

629
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,020
Wasn't much of a struggle.

630
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,460
Only these abrasions on his cheek.

631
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,820
The head was grabbed from behind and
immobilized, and with the other hand...

632
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,460
...came around and
cut across the throat.

633
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,940
From the look of things, he was experienced
in this method of execution, Jethro.

634
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,700
We think he's responsible for
three other murders, same M.O.

635
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,260
And Tony's with the bastard?

636
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,300
Is he aware?

637
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,140
Probably not.

638
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,620
But we have to think Tony
didn't know anything about this.

639
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,500
He would've never allowed it to happen.

640
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,420
Unless...

641
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,580
We checked the rest of the area.

642
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,500
No other bodies.

643
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,860
Tony's still alive.

644
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,180
"Lynchburg across from Wal-Mart."

645
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,860
Mean anything?

646
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,820
Yeah. Gibbs.

647
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,340
I do not have a VW.

648
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,860
Still getting the calls, huh, boss?

649
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,900
What do you got, McGee?

650
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,460
Well, I got the local message
units dialed from the cabin.

651
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,980
Nothing there.

652
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,860
Long distance?

653
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,380
The exchange has mechanical switches,
so it's going to take some time.

654
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,540
They may be headed to
Lynchburg to make the sale.

655
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,940
I need the location of
all Wal-Marts in the area.

656
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,540
Fast.

657
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,260
On it.

658
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,740
We're pulling over.

659
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,500
But we don't want Lane showing up
first we should get to the buyer.

660
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,420
We got time.

661
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm gonna take a little nap.

662
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,820
You want me to drive while you sleep?

663
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,300
You think we ought to keep moving?

664
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,900
I do.

665
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,300
You got my back, Tony?

666
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,980
You know it.

667
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,060
You know...

668
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,500
...I feel like I've been

669
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,340
running my whole life...

670
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,780
...just to get to this moment.

671
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,740
Finally doing something right.

672
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,140
Found the Wal-Mart.

673
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,100
There's a storage
facility across the street,

674
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,180
with Conex boxes in the parking lot.

675
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,740
Call the local LEOs.

676
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,420
Make sure they understand there's
a federal agent working undercover.

677
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,060
You got it.

678
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,060
Nothing in the Conex boxes.

679
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,300
What about the long distance
records on the cabin?

680
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,380
Working on it, boss.

681
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,220
Work faster.

682
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,220
It was a misdirect.

683
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,220
He knew that we would search the body.

684
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,500
What do we do?

685
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,660
Yeah. Gibbs.

686
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,500
God...

687
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,300
God...

688
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,500
McGee.

689
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,620
Hey! McGee!

690
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,220
Listen up...

691
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,460
Boss, it's only been, like, ten seconds.

692
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,460
I'm know I'm good,
but I'm not that good.

693
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,620
I just had a hang-up.

694
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,900
Check the last incoming call on my
cell and have Abby run a GPS location.

695
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,740
This isn't about the VW, is it?

696
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,340
No!

697
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,980
It's where DiNozzo is!

698
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,900
It's Lane Harrison's cell phone.

699
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,700
Highway 14, just past
Newport News, Virginia.

700
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,660
Stay on the phone and guide us there.

701
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:09,860
You all right?!

702
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,780
Gibbs is driving.

703
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm saying a prayer in many languages.

704
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,980
How we doing?

705
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,020
You scared the hell out of me.

706
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,580
That's part of my charm.

707
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,220
Tony.

708
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,260
Tony.

709
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,900
He's coming down 14th,
headed for the west side.

710
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,220
Take a right.

711
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,660
What the hell's that?

712
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,300
It's in my bag.

713
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,380
I thought I turned it off.

714
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,860
Battery's dead.

715
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,820
Well, turn it off.

716
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,820
They can trace a cell phone.

717
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,740
Off.

718
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,260
I lost the signal!

719
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,340
930685-7.

720
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:24,940
That's her.

721
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,460
History of the world in a box.

722
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,900
I don't see Lane.

723
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,900
I've always wanted to scuba dive.

724
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,660
I'm gonna scuba dive.

725
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,940
What do you think of that?

726
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,260
Well, you can't swim, Jeffrey.

727
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
There's that, yeah.

728
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,500
You can teach me.

729
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,940
That's him.

730
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Now, you're gonna watch my back.

731
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
I'm gonna go get the cash...

732
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,540
...and then we're gonna get out of here.

733
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,220
You ready?

734
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,740
I want you to listen to me, Jeffrey.

735
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,020
Okay.

736
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,020
I'm a federal agent.

737
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,100
Good one, Tony.

738
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,380
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

739
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,500
Don't say that.

740
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,340
Wish I didn't have to.

741
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,140
Need the long distance
numbers from the cabin, McGee!

742
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Working on them!

743
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,380
Never lost an agent undercover, Kate.

744
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,580
I am not about to let
DiNozzo screw that up.

745
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,180
Everyone's gonna know you
wanted to turn yourself in.

746
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,300
That you drove me here voluntarily.

747
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,580
You testify against Lane,
they're gonna cut you a deal.

748
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,700
W- w-what
do I do?

749
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,260
Okay, you sit tight.

750
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,140
I'll arrest the buyer, then we
call my boss and he'll pick us up.

751
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:12,820
Okay.

752
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,820
One call: Dr. Haru Owagawa.

753
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,220
Ph.D. in Art History at GW.

754
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,020
It's gotta be the buyer.

755
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,180
We need a GPS location on his cell.

756
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,780
12 blocks from your
location, head due west.

757
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,540
I know you don't have any backup, Tony.

758
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,660
How do you know that, Jeffrey?

759
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,180
I thought you might be a cop.

760
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,140
That's why we took
that swim in the stream,

761
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,860
and that's why I crashed the truck.

762
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,220
No bugs.

763
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,220
There's a reason Lane
isn't here, isn't there?

764
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,900
You're having naughty thoughts, Tony.

765
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
Just so you know...

766
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,780
...when I said

767
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,460
no one ever treated me like you did...

768
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,180
I meant that.

769
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,660
I know.

770
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,660
Step away from your car!

771
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,380
Hands in the air!

772
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,020
I really liked him.

773
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,260
Yeah...

774
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,860
yeah, I can see that.
