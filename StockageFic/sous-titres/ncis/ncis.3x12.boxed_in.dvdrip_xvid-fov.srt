1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,259
You should've been there last night,
you would've loved it.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,580
Two warriors
squaring off in the ring.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,308
l had plans with McGee.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,984
Mud glistening off their thongs.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,902
Wait, back up a second.
You were with McGeek?

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,947
No, he was with me.
l was making him dinner.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,467
Why would you make
McGeek dinner?

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,905
- l like to cook.
- You cook?

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,186
- Jimmy seemed to like it.
- Palmer?

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,308
l've never even been to your place
and you're cooking dinner for McGee

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,983
and the autopsy gremlin?

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,459
At what point did the Earth
come off its axis?

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,789
Perhaps now, Tony.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,269
What's wrong with that picture?

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,341
Containers aren't unloaded
at the dock.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,180
Clear.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,981
Custom seal's been broken.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,944
Tony!

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,143
Get inside.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,784
l think we've just been screwed
in here, Tony.

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,829
The term is ''bolted.''

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,628
Same difference.

23
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,063
l tried that. Bolted from the outside.

24
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,458
l knew your idea was stupid.

25
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,344
My idea?

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,308
Yes. Taking up a defensive position
inside a metal box. Yes.

27
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,665
- You're not panicking on me, are you?
- l don't panic.

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,623
This is me, mad.

29
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,742
l'm not getting any reception.
How about you?

30
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,828
- l'm braless.
- l noticed that earlier.

31
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,266
- But on your phone they're ''bars.''
- Don't you have anything better to do

32
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,624
than correct my English?

33
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,300
- Like what?
- Like getting us out of this box

34
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,825
- you trapped us in.
- Okay, first of all,

35
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,699
this is not my fault.

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,421
Second of all, l like dark,
tight spaces.

37
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,860
Unless, of course, they insist
on some form of commitment.

38
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,428
l was referring
to my childhood bedroom.

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,270
lt looks like our smugglers
have removed most of the cargo,

40
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,500
so they're probably
not coming back.

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,903
We're still locked in a box
and freezing to death.

42
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,708
Somebody might have heard
the gunfire.

43
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,225
Yeah, well, if they did,
they'd be here by now.

44
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,905
You know what we could do? Fire
a couple of rounds out of these shafts.

45
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,106
- Maybe someone will hear us.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,228
Maybe they didn't hear
the massive firefight.

47
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,824
So let's just waste
the little ammunition we have.

48
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,106
You know what?
You're brilliant. Genius.

49
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,980
Sarcasm is the refuge
of a shallow mind.

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,826
What do you suggest we do?

51
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,142
l suggest we bust out of here now.

52
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,222
Okay, Bugsy, l'll take care of the
security guard and go through the--

53
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,699
- This is not funny. lt's not funny.
- l know.

54
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,945
What we need to do is relax
and remain calm,

55
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,746
and wait.

56
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,538
For what?

57
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,903
For them to come in
with reinforcements?

58
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,949
For Gibbs.

59
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,863
Trust me, he'll find us.

60
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,981
l believe you.

61
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,186
The question is,

62
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,262
will it be before
we freeze to death?

63
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,781
<i>Our intel was wrong, Gibbs.</i>

64
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,622
<i>The container isn't filled</i>
<i>with small arms,</i>

65
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,860
- <i>it's a shipment of explosives</i>--
- C-4?

66
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,067
<i>Worse. Unexploded</i>
<i>KMGU cluster bomblets.</i>

67
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,186
- From where?
- <i>lraq.</i>

68
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,989
<i>Al-Qaeda pays kids 50 cents a day</i>
<i>to collect the bomblets.</i>

69
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,789
<i>Most of them end up dead,</i>
<i>the lucky ones, crippled.</i>

70
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,225
- <i>These bomblets are</i>--
- Highly unstable.

71
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,221
Yeah, l'd say that's worse.

72
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,779
<i>French intelligence out of Dakar</i>
<i>believe they may have been loaded</i>

73
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,101
- <i>onto a Senegalese ship last week.</i>
- Last week?

74
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,621
Why are we just hearing
about this today?

75
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,621
<i>Have you ever worked</i>
<i>with the French, Gibbs?</i>

76
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,022
Yeah, a few times.

77
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,465
<i>Then you know what l'm up against.</i>

78
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,786
l've got two agents down
at the docks.

79
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,588
l need more than
''They may have been loaded

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,822
- on a Senegalese ship,'' Tom.
- <i>We're working on it, Jethro.</i>

81
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,584
- <i>Just tell your people to be careful.</i>
- Where are they now, McGee?

82
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,502
Tony said that they were relocating.

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,423
- Why?
- Said that they had new intel.

84
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,660
Are you waiting for me
to say please?

85
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,822
l couldn't really make it out.
The phone reception was already hinky

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,265
- before l lost them.
- Well, un-lose them.

87
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,945
l don't want them touching anything
without a bomb squad present.

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,586
Pinch me now.

89
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,060
Another crate of movies.

90
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,308
Look at them all.

91
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,065
Maybe there's a crate
full of DVD players in here.

92
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,425
Let's not forget
the battery operated generators

93
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,421
and the popcorn machines.

94
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,626
l'm open to all things cinema.

95
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,942
They're East lndian. Bollywood.

96
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,701
No subtitles.

97
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,179
lt's low on the list of genres,
l know,

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,783
but extremely babe-heavy.

99
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,107
Where are the small arms?

100
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,707
l mean, why would they shoot at us
over copies of <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai?</i>

101
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,701
Does it matter?
We need to get out of here, Tony.

102
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,430
Yeah, l heard that
the first 50 times you said it.

103
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,341
- You're not claustrophobic, are you?
- No.

104
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,866
Because l'm telling you, that would
be another nail in the shoe of my day.

105
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,909
What if we blow a hole at the bottom
of this door, near where the bolt is?

106
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,027
lt might enable us to jam something
under it and force it open.

107
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,308
Not liking it. Firing a bullet
in the air and it's bound to ricochet.

108
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,539
As l was saying,

109
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,180
there's a good chance
the bullet might ricochet

110
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,988
- and kill one of us.
- Sorry.

111
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,940
- Why are you on top of me?
- l'm protecting you, Tony.

112
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,702
- Don't.
- Well, you didn't seem to mind

113
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,144
when we were undercover.

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,746
That might have something to do
with the fact that you were naked.

115
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,868
Perhaps if it were warmer in here.

116
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,948
Let me rephrase the question.

117
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,665
Why are you still on top of me?

118
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,143
Our last contact with them was here,
the North Expansion.

119
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,700
They were checking out a West African
cargo chip that pulled in two days ago.

120
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,986
What about the GPS stuff
in their phones?

121
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,061
Well, see, that's the strange thing.

122
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,186
Their cell phone reception is bad
around the docks

123
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,063
but GPS chip should not be affected.

124
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,380
They run on a separate satellite
networks, we should be able

125
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,939
- to pick them up anyway.
- Should, McGee?

126
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,623
For some reason we can't.

127
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,699
Phones-- Phones could be turned off.

128
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,547
Chips could be disabled.
They could be in a structure

129
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,986
that is blocking the GPS signal.

130
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,108
- Like the hold of a ship?
- Possibly. You know,

131
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,783
l'm thinking
that they might be waiting

132
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,386
to get into a better cell reception area
before calling in.

133
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,107
Maybe doesn't cut it, McGee.
You should have let me know.

134
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,699
l know.

135
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,623
See, the thing is you were busy,
boss. You were in the restroom.

136
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,463
You ever had a conversation
in the head, McGee?

137
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,828
One time l did. The person that l was
talking to were so distracted my shoes

138
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,629
they kind of got--
Sorry, l should have let you know.

139
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,781
Don't apologize.
lt's a sign of weakness.

140
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,825
Let's find them before DiNozzo
blows both his arms off.

141
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,544
This doesn't make any sense.

142
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,224
Maybe this isn't the container
they used to smuggle their weapons.

143
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,143
This is the only container that wasn't
sealed. The rest of them are closed.

144
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,346
- They off-loaded them already?
- That might explain

145
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,943
how they got automatic weapons.

146
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,420
- We're missing something.
- Besides warmth?

147
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,258
Ziva David, does this space
seem different to you?

148
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,545
Define different.

149
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,669
Does it seem smaller
than the outside dimension?

150
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,099
Usually containers are 40 feet long.
This one's only 34 on the inside.

151
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,380
Somebody's been doing renovations.

152
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,585
Plywood.

153
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,143
Not bad.

154
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,107
- l can almost forgive you now.
- For what?

155
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,342
- For locking us in this box.
- Ladies first.

156
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,379
What do you see?

157
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,139
Trouble.

158
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,663
Arabic script.

159
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,827
- What does it say?
- ''This end up. Handle with care.

160
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,426
Caution: explosive ordinance.''

161
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,343
- A bomb?
- l think so, yes.

162
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,344
And what does this say exactly?

163
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,064
''Death to America.''

164
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,744
Great.

165
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,741
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?

166
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,667
Perhaps, if it involves
a violent and painful death.

167
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,348
Careful.

168
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,978
This may be booby-trapped
a dozen different ways.

169
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,423
- So why are we opening it again?
- Because if it is a bomb,

170
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,023
it may be armed.

171
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,665
Hey, listen, if this thing goes off

172
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,742
- l just want you to know--
- This is not your fault. l know.

173
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,828
No, l was gonna say

174
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,465
your life would have had
more meaning if you'd slept with me.

175
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,098
lf you had anything else on your mind,
perhaps l would have.

176
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,909
- Really?
- No.

177
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,538
- Ready?
- Hold on.

178
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,819
All right.

179
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,305
Up an inch.

180
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,062
No visible wires. Proceed.

181
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,259
- Oh, my God.
- Well, l didn't expect to see that.

182
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,621
There's gotta be millions in here.

183
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,749
More than enough to bankroll
one hell of a terrorist op.

184
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,019
These DVDs were just decoys
to get through Customs.

185
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,663
l'll tell you what.

186
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,303
When we get out of here,
l'm gonna buy you a house.

187
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,741
But it's gonna have to be
a fake house

188
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,309
because these are counterfeit.

189
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,383
How can you tell?

190
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,907
The Treasury ran a workshop with us.

191
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,504
First, they're freshly printed.

192
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,423
Your Treasury
prints millions everyday.

193
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,058
So do countries like Syria
and North Korea.

194
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,539
Hundred dollar bill hasn't
been redesigned since '96,

195
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,019
which makes it very vulnerable
to this kind of counterfeit.

196
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,340
Still, that doesn't explain
how you know they're fake.

197
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,388
The ink. lt smells.

198
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,747
Yes, like ink.

199
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,788
Well, our money doesn't smell.

200
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,588
Here.

201
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,342
Try it.

202
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,224
Give it a little sniff.

203
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,941
Oh, God.

204
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,108
That smells like stale alcohol and...

205
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,822
...your armpit.

206
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,303
Yeah. The point is,
it doesn't smell like ink.

207
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,625
Now, there's only one way
to know for sure.

208
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,988
lf it burns orange, it's real.

209
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,304
lmpressive,

210
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,587
but irrelevant. Real or not,
our friends are coming back for it.

211
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,264
They may already be here.

212
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,987
Your people
checked in with me at 7:06.

213
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,822
DiNozzo and David, right?

214
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,982
They were surveilling containers for
illegal contraband from West Africa.

215
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,186
- That's them.
- Well, they're staked out by the dock

216
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,908
- on the North Expansion.
- Not anymore.

217
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,583
- They changed their post.
- Now this--

218
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,105
l've got to tell you something.
l made it very clear to them

219
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,945
that any change of plans goes through
this office. Where are they now?

220
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,227
That would be the purpose of this visit,
Mr. Lake. We lost contact.

221
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,665
For all we know, they're out
wandering around somewhere lost.

222
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,422
My people don't get lost.

223
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,468
Agent Gibbs, this is one of the
largest ports on the East Coast.

224
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,905
Believe me, it happens all the time.
Matthew?

225
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,185
- Sir?
- Do me a favour.

226
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,499
We've got two missing Feds.

227
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,104
Take your team and sweep the sectors
by the North Expansion.

228
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,305
Call me when you find them.

229
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,222
You're welcome to wait here
while we locate them.

230
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,029
lt would be helpful if we could review
the security camera footage.

231
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,703
Sure. l'll have
one of my techs work on it.

232
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,781
Hey, what kind of contraband
were they looking for?

233
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,589
- Arms shipment. Explosives.
- What ship?

234
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,310
We'll have to lock it down,
and search it container by container.

235
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,620
Our intel indicates
that it might be Senegalese.

236
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,860
Might be?
Meaning you don't have any idea?

237
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,543
No, not yet.

238
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,382
Do you have any idea
how busy we are here?

239
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,906
Right now l've got three ships
sailing under the Senegalese flag.

240
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,106
Two more coming in on Thursday.

241
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,749
Well, how accurate
is your intelligence?

242
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,307
Do you guys know how many intel
BOLOs l get in one week?

243
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,267
How many of them
turn out to be false alarms?

244
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,024
l'm going to need more than chatter
before we disrupt the port.

245
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,259
Yeah?

246
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,102
Well, l need to find my people.

247
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,741
- Abby?
- ls he always like that?

248
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,025
Yeah, pretty much.

249
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,025
One million, 820.

250
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,547
- One million--
- Counting your riches, King Cole?

251
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,504
Midas.

252
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,581
King Cole had a merry old soul.

253
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,345
That's 1 20 million.

254
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,383
Thanks.
You made me lose count again.

255
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,222
Good.

256
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,062
Now you can put your soul
to good use.

257
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,868
- Doing what?
- Helping me set up

258
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,622
this defensive perimeter.

259
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,783
Actually, l was warming to your
earlier idea of getting us out of here.

260
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,510
- lf we burn these bills--
- We'll die of smoke inhalation, Tony.

261
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,547
Oh, no, no, no. Look up.

262
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,268
Heat rises, right?

263
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,388
So the smoke is gonna go out through
these ventilation slots

264
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,180
and draw attention to our position.
Not to mention the added benefit

265
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,864
- of heat production.
- Are you serious?

266
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,702
Well, it makes more sense
than firing a gun

267
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,862
inside a metal box now, doesn't it?

268
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,141
Don't worry about a thing.

269
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,949
The worse thing that can happen
is it gets a little smoky in here.

270
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,186
lt's kind of fun.

271
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,864
lt's a little crazy, actually.

272
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,949
- Now, that feels good.
- Okay, well, it's a little warmer.

273
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,783
Hey, that's a lot of fire.

274
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,862
Here we go.
Out the ventilation shaft.

275
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,781
lt's okay. lt's okay.

276
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,386
l can barely hear you, Gibbs.
Where are you?

277
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,587
Norfolk Port Authority.
We're sending over surveillance--

278
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,627
- Surveillance what?
- Videos.

279
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,748
l want you to look at this morning's
recording of the North Expan--

280
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,185
- --<i>and three.</i>
- For what, exactly?

281
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,467
- Anything of Tony and Ziva.
- Tony and Ziva aren't here, Gibbs.

282
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,222
l know that, Abby.
We're looking for them.

283
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,379
Are they missing?

284
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,707
Hold on, okay?
l got another call coming in.

285
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,105
- Abby Sciuto, NClS--
- Find Tony and Ziva, Abs.

286
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,420
The videos are on their way
to you right now.

287
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,909
- Can l talk to McGee?
- Why?

288
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,586
Because l need to know what codec
they use for encoding their video.

289
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,306
- Hello?
- What happened to Tony and Ziva?

290
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,662
Abby, it's not a really good time
right now.

291
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,139
You'd better call me as soon
as you're Gibbs-free, McGee.

292
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,500
- <i>l will. l will.</i>
- Promise me.

293
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,501
Abby, l promise. Okay?

294
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,228
Okay, transfer is complete.

295
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,780
Copy of all of our security footage
since the time that your agents arrived.

296
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,508
Where are those
Senegalese ships docked?

297
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,138
Piers Five Alpha, Three Tango,
and Six Delta.

298
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,147
- l want to see them.
- l think that means we go with him.

299
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,949
Definitely your worst idea yet.

300
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,147
No, my worst idea was challenging
a date to an oyster-eating contest.

301
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,902
The air in here is like soup.

302
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,262
Hey, do you want
to give me a hand, please?

303
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,909
Sure.

304
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,826
So riddle me this, Batgirl.

305
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,509
How does one wrangle an invite
to dinner at your place?

306
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,060
Why?
You feel a little left out, Tony?

307
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,506
l mean, McGee l can understand.
He's a good guest.

308
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,740
l'll bet he brought a bottle of wine.

309
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,539
And dessert.

310
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,621
Yeah, big surprise there.
But Palmer...

311
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,782
l've had more stimulating
conversations with cats.

312
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,625
l like him.
And he was very helpful to me.

313
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,303
How?

314
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,542
He tuned my piano.

315
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,663
l used to play piano.

316
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,419
But not anymore?

317
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,625
My mother forced me to take lessons
from this woman

318
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,624
who used to hit me with a ruler
every time l made a mistake.

319
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,339
l haven't played since.

320
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,708
Were you any good?

321
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,029
Yeah, she was.

322
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,978
l need you to re-sample
the histopathology for me.

323
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,219
ls something wrong?

324
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,660
- Why does he do that, Ducky?
- Who?

325
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,269
Gibbs.

326
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,909
Why does he withhold?

327
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,419
He wants me to check
the Norfolk Terminal security video

328
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,818
for Tony and Ziva.

329
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,026
- Oh, it's probably nothing.
- Oh, no.

330
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,859
lt's something.

331
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,261
Gibbs can smell the rotten cabbage
in the middle of the pile.

332
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,307
Do you think Tony and Ziva
are in trouble?

333
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,620
l'm thinking
that's what Gibbs is thinking.

334
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,899
Then we do have cause for concern.

335
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,302
Very well done, darling.

336
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,030
But where
are we going to put the divan?

337
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,987
Actually, you know,
it looks pretty good.

338
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,546
l particularly like your firing slots.

339
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,947
Of course, against automatic weapons
it'll disintegrate in 30 seconds.

340
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,429
Yeah.

341
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,583
What is it about danger and
uncertainty that makes me feel so--

342
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,149
Horny?

343
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,825
Hungry. l'd kill for a pizza right now.

344
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,189
What?

345
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,749
You don't have to joke about it.

346
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,386
lt's all right to admit you're scared.

347
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,663
You've obviously never seen
a Steve McQueen movie.

348
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,220
Why must you equate everything
in life to your stupid movies?

349
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,429
Now, see, that's your problem.
You have no fantasy life.

350
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,549
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Yeah. Really?

351
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,261
Okay, well then, throw one out there.
Let's hear a Ziva David fantasy.

352
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,069
- lt concerns you.
- l'm all ears.

353
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,219
And a sumo wrestler.

354
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,543
You can stop there.

355
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,463
You see, it's all about hot women
and brave men to you.

356
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,746
Anything deeper
and you shut it down.

357
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,309
That's not true.

358
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,949
l like a lot of deep movies.

359
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,862
Pick a genre, any genre.

360
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,543
Okay. Best dating movie.

361
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,462
<i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>
l'm kidding.

362
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,143
<i>Tom Jones.</i>

363
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,380
Eating as sex.

364
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,268
- Best sex movie.
- <i>Body Heat.</i>

365
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,500
William Hurt, Kathleen Turner.
Smart noir.

366
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,299
l like the whole sweaty,
chairs-through-glass-doors thing.

367
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,189
Yeah. l prefer the air conditioner on.

368
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,944
And if anybody threw a chair
through my door

369
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,989
l would probably shoot them.

370
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,869
Did you just reveal something
about your sex life?

371
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,065
Obliquely.

372
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,505
l'm stunned because
you never talk about yourself.

373
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,023
Why is that?

374
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,623
Maybe l like a little privacy.

375
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,021
No, l understand.
But we could die here.

376
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,068
l mean, you know,
we're in a cold metal box.

377
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,539
So give me something.
Happiest moment?

378
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,825
Most embarrassing moment?

379
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,550
First time you realized
Daddy wasn't perfect.

380
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,665
- Okay, l'll tell you mine.
- We're not sharing.

381
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,738
We're being lifted by a forklift.

382
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,503
See if you can
find their vehicle, McGee.

383
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,183
On it.

384
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,748
What time's that ship scheduled
to get underway?

385
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,299
They're still off-loading,
so some time tomorrow afternoon.

386
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,539
Hey, boss, l found it.

387
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,259
lt's locked.

388
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,103
Find them, McGee. Spread out.

389
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,739
How many times do these containers
come and go on a given day?

390
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,821
On this dock, thousands.

391
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,309
You know what this is?

392
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,789
That's a blood trail.

393
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,149
Do you still think
this is just chatter, Lake?

394
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,100
- Boss?
- What do you got, McGee?

395
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,899
Now, this is where
the blood trail stops, boss.

396
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,583
You mean starts.

397
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,661
Yes, that's what l mean.

398
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,661
Now, l've broken the area
into four sections.

399
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,546
Area one, over here,

400
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,621
is where all the action
seems to have been centred.

401
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,463
We've recovered
three different types of brass.

402
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,820
lt must have been
one hell of a gunfight.

403
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,187
Yeah, well, l'll bet Tony
and Ziva thought so, McGee.

404
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,305
They were right here.

405
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,659
Well, we recovered the other
two types of brass from over there

406
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,219
where the blood trail started.
Back there.

407
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,145
- They were caught in a crossfire.
- Now look, boss. Boss.

408
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,870
You don't--
You don't think they're--

409
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,622
Should we put divers
in the water or--?

410
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,506
They're not in the water.

411
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,981
McGee, if they were in the water,
they'd be dead.

412
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,266
lf they were dead, l'd know about it.
They're not dead.

413
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,388
My people have been
rounding up dock workers.

414
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,869
So far, no one's heard any gunfire.

415
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,941
l wanna find out if there were
other containers here.

416
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,419
Yeah, well, we're compiling a manifest
of every container

417
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,502
off-loaded from the ship.
lf they've left the port, we'll find them.

418
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,467
- lf not?
- Are you asking me

419
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,428
- to search every container still in port?
- No, l'm ordering you.

420
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,262
Make it happen, McGee.

421
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,465
They shot him three times.

422
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,063
At least they got one of them, Duck.

423
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,381
Can l ask where they are?

424
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,789
- Not if you're expecting an answer.
- What does your gut tell you?

425
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,020
- Tell me about this guy.
- Twenty-five to 35 years old.

426
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,943
Mortally wounded.
He was able to run about 50 yards

427
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,863
before a massive loss of blood
brought him down.

428
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,305
And someone dragged him in here.

429
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,143
- Foreign born.
- You got his l.D.?

430
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,663
No dental work.

431
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,141
No caps or crowns.

432
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,266
The work is primitive.

433
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,990
And l thought England was bad.

434
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,978
Third world?

435
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,381
l should say so. Oh, something else
you may be interested in.

436
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,110
His hands are soft.
No discernible calluses.

437
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,347
He's not a dock worker.

438
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,388
Well, l'll know more
when l get him back.

439
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,700
You'll find them, Jethro.

440
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,622
A question or statement, Duck?

441
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,979
More of a prayer.

442
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,544
Under normal circumstances,
this would be considered fun.

443
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,224
Yeah, well, l can't tell
where we're going.

444
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,301
There's only three ways
we're gonna get there.

445
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,789
- Train--
- That's quaint.

446
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,305
We could be like the homos
in those old movies.

447
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,064
''Hobos,'' not homos.

448
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,629
That would be my third choice.

449
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,746
- A ship?
- That was my second choice.

450
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,309
Days without food or water.

451
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,300
- Sounds like a truck.
- That's my first choice.

452
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,066
- Hey, let us out of here.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

453
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,382
- Stop.
- What? Okay.

454
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,825
lf l fire a shot out of here,
they'd know that we were in here.

455
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,867
That's not a good idea.
lt's not a good idea.

456
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,907
- Okay.
- You're assuming whoever's driving

457
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,059
doesn't know we're here.

458
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,141
lf they do, they can't leave the port
with us aboard.

459
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,620
They'll take us back inside
and they'll deal with us first.

460
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,143
Right.

461
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,619
Right. Okay, l have a plan.

462
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,102
We build a time machine.

463
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,623
We could leave a trail.

464
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,179
Sorry, Gretel, l left all
my breadcrumbs back at the office.

465
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,387
Well, then, it's a good thing
we've got all this dough.

466
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,946
l'm starting to get
really freaked out here, Gibbs.

467
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,182
l found Tony and Ziva on the port video
but l don't think it's enough.

468
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,308
- lt's all right, Abs.
- l just feel like l'm failing them and l--

469
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,381
Just take us through it.
Start with pier three.

470
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,381
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Are you getting this too, McGee?</i>

471
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,142
Yep. Transmission is good.

472
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,425
All right.

473
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,979
Their car pulled up at 7:57.

474
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,549
They got out,

475
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,990
and then they leave two minutes
and 32 seconds later.

476
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,708
Anyone else in the car?

477
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,139
No.

478
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,107
<i>Take me to the other location, Abby.</i>

479
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,302
Okay.

480
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,065
You stick with that. l'm going to see
if the reception is any better.

481
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,461
Nothing.

482
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,541
What we need is a better antenna.

483
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,339
Any kind of wire would work.
Any kind of conductor, really.

484
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,307
Hey. Your necklace.

485
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,621
We can attach it to the end of the
antenna and slip it out of the slot.

486
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,827
Cell phone antennas are vertical.
The wire can't dangle.

487
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,987
Well, we need to stiffen it, Ziva.

488
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,219
l've heard that before.

489
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,020
Work with me here.

490
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,901
We can slice the spines off these
DVDs and sandwich it in between.

491
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,903
- You okay?
- Yes.

492
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,142
- l still need something to reflect off.
- The side of the container.

493
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,868
The angle needs to be precise, Tony.

494
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,069
The response l'm looking for here is,
''Cool, Tony!''

495
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,989
l'm saying it might work.

496
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,983
When this is all over, we're gonna
watch <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</i>.

497
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,902
This is where it gets disturbing.

498
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,106
<i>lt's like looking at an Escher print.</i>

499
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>l was able to isolate four segments.</i>

500
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,980
At 8:1 6 l have them getting out
of the North Expansion sector.

501
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,459
Then at this point
they walk out of frame.

502
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,190
Another camera
picked them up at 8:1 9.

503
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,703
You see them here...

504
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,222
<i>...and then here.</i>
<i>And they have their guns drawn.</i>

505
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,950
<i>The problem is, there's another</i>
<i>container blocking the camera.</i>

506
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,783
Now, look at the bottom left corner
of your screen.

507
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,180
Boss, that's our dead guy.

508
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,138
l ran his photo
and l got a positive lD, Gibbs.

509
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,818
lnterpol identified him
as Moussa Senghor,

510
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,823
a Senegalese citizen. He's on
the international terrorist watch list.

511
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,824
Boss, Moussa Senghor
has ties to Wilson N'Diaye.

512
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,901
- He's--
- Al-Qaeda money man.

513
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,425
Financed the attack
on four Bali night clubs last year.

514
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,619
- lt's a good job, Abby.
- <i>The bad news is he wasn't alone.</i>

515
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,538
- There's no lD on him yet.
- <i>What else you got, Abs?</i>

516
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,022
Just this.

517
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,623
They shot the camera.

518
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,180
Abby, can you rewind it
and pull back to the wide angle?

519
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,585
<i>Can you freeze it there?</i>

520
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,107
Boss, l think l know what happened.

521
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,226
These are the crime scene photos
from the dock.

522
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,381
And this is from
the security camera taken earlier.

523
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,507
The container by Ziva is missing.

524
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,423
- lf they were in a crossfire--
- They took cover inside.

525
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,145
Abby, put another CAFF-POW
on my tab.

526
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,584
Just one, Gibbs?

527
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,184
You haven't found them yet.

528
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,227
- How's it coming?
- My fingers aren't working.

529
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,142
Do you want me to do it?

530
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,268
l've got it. Just give me one
of your little hair squinchie things.

531
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,022
The term is ''scrunchie.''

532
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,820
Thank you.
Now l've just got to figure out

533
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,901
how to attach this thing
to the cell phone.

534
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,982
We may not need to.
We now have

535
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,745
several hundred thousand
dollars out there floating around.

536
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,582
lt's a matter of time
before they find us.

537
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,458
The symbol's from the company
that uses this type of container.

538
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,541
l tell you, the problem is
without a tracking number,

539
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,541
- l can't tell you where this one went.
- McGee.

540
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,986
We've got six teams
covering the gates out on the port.

541
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,947
They're intercepting containers
with the markings.

542
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,704
- What about the ones still in port?
- Used by this same company?

543
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,658
Approximately 862.

544
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,390
- l only need one.
- They're spread all over the complex.

545
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,939
- lt would take days to search them all.
- We won't have to.

546
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,499
- How much does one weigh?
- l don't know. About five tons.

547
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,501
l can't imagine they're easy to move.

548
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,103
No, of course not.
There's only two ways.

549
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,022
A crane or a top-loader forklift.

550
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,067
No, there's no crane
in range of the crime scene.

551
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,619
lt had to be moved by a top-loader
and we only have 1 0 of those

552
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,384
with maybe 20 qualified operators
to drive them.

553
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,428
Kristen. Get me a list of the top-loading
forklifts that operated

554
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,468
in the North East Expansion today.
Plus, l want names of all the drivers.

555
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,063
- Right away.
- We find that forklift--

556
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,265
We find who moved it.

557
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,498
We're backing up. Almost done?

558
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,138
l just got to figure out
how to attach it.

559
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,501
l may be able to help you with that.

560
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,189
What?

561
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,069
- Friction burns?
- Yeah, what difference does it make?

562
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,982
lt doesn't.
l'm just wondering how you got them.

563
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,869
Well, if you live long enough,
maybe l'll tell you some day.

564
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,385
You know,
l can only take it two ways.

565
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,461
Were you, McGee and Palmer
playing Twister last night?

566
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,779
What's a Twister?

567
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,781
Exactly.
That means you were having--

568
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,186
lf you're gonna make that phone call,
now is the right time to do it.

569
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,589
The grooves match.

570
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,429
All three rounds that you pulled out
of toothless downstairs

571
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,579
came from Tony's weapon,

572
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,310
and none of the blood samples
taken from the dock

573
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,062
match Tony or Ziva's blood type.

574
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,504
l think they're going to be okay.

575
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,424
Tony is only one
of our very best agents and Ziva,

576
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,344
she's basically a trained killer, right?
l mean, she could take care of herself.

577
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,788
And l got a direct link
to four different GPS satellites.

578
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,544
Either of them get an area
with reception again, bam.

579
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,026
We got them. l really don't think that
there's any reason to worry, Ducky.

580
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,942
They're gonna be fine.

581
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,980
l need you to tell me
they're going to be okay.

582
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,707
Of course they are.

583
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,220
l want every building swept,
room to room.

584
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,743
Start with the vacant ones first.

585
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,309
Cell reception's unreliable in the area

586
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,347
so all movement
will be coordinated by radio.

587
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,262
Tactical frequency is two,
admin is four.

588
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,863
- Go. Go. Find them.
- Hey, Gibbs.

589
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,863
l only have two top-loaders working
in the Northern Expansion today.

590
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,305
One here in pier seven
off-loading a ship

591
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,665
and the other one
is at an auxiliary warehouse.

592
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,821
Now, the drivers
should still be with the rigs.

593
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,982
- l'll send some of my people--
- No, we got it. Let's roll, McGee.

594
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,620
- You understand that gibberish?
- A little.

595
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,339
What's he saying?

596
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,468
They're either discussing letting us go
or the best way to murder us.

597
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,819
lt's a complicated language.

598
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,550
- Well, l'd go with number two.
- Me too.

599
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,383
- Get any reception?
- Negative.

600
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,587
l'm gonna have to stick this antenna
out one of the ventilation slots.

601
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,779
lf you want to live you will
come out of the container now.

602
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,941
What was that? Speak up.

603
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,424
l said, come out now, woman.

604
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,941
Come out now or we will come in.

605
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,258
What is your answer?

606
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,818
This.

607
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,942
She shot me.

608
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,301
She shot me!

609
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,699
Make your call. We only have
a couple of minutes now.

610
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,946
Okay, l think we turn up here,
past this next row of warehouses.

611
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,225
You think, McGee?

612
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,302
Well, boss,
maybe if you slowed down a little l'd--

613
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,182
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- <i>Boss, it's me.</i>

614
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,419
- Tony.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

615
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,464
Boss, it's a long story,
but the really short version is

616
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,190
that we're trapped in a container
with millions in phoney U.S. bills

617
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,944
- in some port building.
- You're coming in broken, DiNozzo.

618
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,099
Say again.

619
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,908
<i>lf you can hear me,</i>
<i>we left a trail of money.</i>

620
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,788
- Money?
- <i>Follow the money.</i>

621
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,188
- <i>Phone Abby.</i>
- Tony, get down.

622
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,386
- They're coming again.
- DiNozzo.

623
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,701
Keep the damn phone on.
Abby will find you.

624
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,622
<i>You can look for it.</i>
<i>We're out of time. Hurry.</i>

625
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,826
- <i>We're low on ammo</i>--
- <i>Tony.</i>

626
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,389
Damn it.

627
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,110
See if you can get him back
on that thing.

628
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,063
l knew it, Ducky.
l knew they were alive.

629
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,587
Okay. l just need a second
and l'll be able-- No, no, no!

630
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,264
- What's wrong?
- l lost him again.

631
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,264
- But there they are. On the map.
- No, that's just a general fix.

632
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,627
Means they're somewhere
within a 500-metre radius.

633
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,429
- lf l had one more second l could've--
- Five-hundred metres

634
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,105
is better than we were a moment ago.
You'd better tell Gibbs.

635
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,265
l can't get through
to Gibbs or McGee.

636
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,025
Did you try them
through the port security office?

637
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,660
l was just about to do that.

638
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,939
Port security.

639
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,102
l need to speak to Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs, please.

640
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,181
He's not here right now.
lf you want, l can

641
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,863
pass the message to him
over the radio.

642
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,305
We've got a GPS fix
on our missing NClS agents.

643
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,019
Hold on. Hey.
They got a fix on the missing Feds.

644
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,863
- What are the coordinates?
- <i>They're on the south side,</i>

645
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,387
within a 500-metre radius
of warehouses one through four.

646
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,619
Okay. Hey, thanks.

647
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,547
l'm down to four rounds. You?

648
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,383
- Six, but it doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

649
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,746
Because a few more bursts like that
and we're dead.

650
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,942
l've got an idea.

651
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,708
How come that doesn't comfort me?

652
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,383
We found your money.

653
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,347
Cease fire or we start burning it.

654
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,787
He's bluffing.

655
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,825
Stop! Stop!
What are you proposing?

656
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,264
Surrender.

657
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,148
Then throw out your weapons.

658
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,540
- Not us, you idiot.
- No!

659
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,698
l think not.

660
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,826
There's $50 million in there.

661
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,546
You'll be dead
before you can burn half of it.

662
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,701
He's got a valid point.

663
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,464
We just have to stall long enough
for Gibbs to find us.

664
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,149
l just need to talk to my partner
about that for a second.

665
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,222
That's a solid copy.
We're heading that way now.

666
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,108
Those warehouses
are about two clicks from here.

667
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,783
We make a left
past these loading docks.

668
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,260
- Did you see that?
- That guy back there?

669
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,349
Yeah, McGee.
The one stuffing money in his pockets.

670
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,227
- NClS.
- l didn't steal it. l swear.

671
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,142
l found it.

672
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,309
Where?

673
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,941
There was a container truck.

674
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,226
lt had money
just floating out the back.

675
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,903
Which way?

676
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,426
Which way?

677
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,869
lt went that way.

678
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,706
- Let's go.
- Boss, that's the wrong direction.

679
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,986
- According to the GPS fix--
- Not according to DiNozzo.

680
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,981
He said follow the money.

681
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,102
l'm empty.

682
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,623
This is your last chance.

683
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,903
Come out or you die.

684
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,583
So about those friction burns?

685
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,790
Only when l'm absolutely positive
we're going to die.

686
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,539
Okay. l've got two minutes.

687
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,058
And Tony?

688
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,467
l'm sorry l didn't invite you
to dinner last night.

689
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,224
- What is your decision?
- Freeze. Port security.

690
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,062
Get your hands in the air.
Get on your knees.

691
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,142
- Do it! Agent DiNozzo. Agent David.
- Lake?

692
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,983
You two had a lot of people worried,
let me tell you.

693
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,385
- Where's Gibbs?
- He's on his way.

694
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,665
Hey, do me a favour.

695
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,821
Cover them
while l radio for some help.

696
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,821
We're out of ammo.

697
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,027
Gee, that's too bad.
Come on, Wilson. Get up.

698
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,704
Get the money.
Get it into the van. Quickly.

699
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,986
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry up.

700
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,149
When this is over,
the woman is mine.

701
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,380
We'll see, Wilson.
l'll be perfectly honest with you,

702
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,188
l don't know
if they're gonna be alive then.

703
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,739
You know, you two
almost cost me $50 million.

704
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,140
Actually, by now
it's more like 1 0 or 1 2.

705
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,343
We burned some of it.

706
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,465
- Do you think this is funny?
- Not me, personally.

707
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,303
But l do. Drop it.

708
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,499
Hey, what are you doing--?

709
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,542
- You two okay?
- Let us out!

710
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,223
No.

711
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,379
Oh, God.

712
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,428
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me.

713
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,060
- Where are you going?
- l've been locked in a box all day.

714
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,061
The ladies' room.

715
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,539
You missed a little spot
by my left ear there.

716
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,349
l'd do it myself,
but my wound here prevents it.

717
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,182
Yeah, wound.

718
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,148
- lt's a two-inch scratch.
- l was grazed by a bullet.

719
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,859
Another six inches to the left
and bam! No more DiNozzo.

720
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,429
Under the chin too.

721
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,546
You know what? l'm done.
Do it yourself.

722
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,859
Fine.

723
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,590
Just don't come to me looking for
sympathy the next time you get shot.

724
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,583
Okay, you did not get shot.
l talked to Ziva.

725
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,423
- You cut it on a wooden box.
- Hey.

726
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,184
There was a lot going on
in that container.

727
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,068
Nobody's exactly sure
what happened.

728
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,347
All l know is l was running
for my life in a hail of gunfire.

729
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,228
Tony.

730
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,180
l was so worried about you.

731
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,624
Oh, my God, are you okay?

732
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,663
Gunshot.

733
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,149
McGee.

734
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,619
- Why didn't you tell me?
- lt's barely a scratch.

735
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,709
Oh, poor baby.

736
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,504
- Who's gonna drive you home?
- l am.

737
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,581
l'm making him dinner tonight.

738
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,222
- What was that for?
- l'm glad you're not dead.

739
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,746
- Me too.
- So, what are you making him?

740
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,707
- ltalian.
- You cook ltalian?

741
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,781
Her cooking rocks, Tony.

742
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,510
What was the name of that dish
you made last night at your party?

743
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,379
Cholent. Slow-cooked beef
with potatoes and beans.

744
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,268
lt wasn't bad.
