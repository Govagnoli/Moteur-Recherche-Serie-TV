1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,360
VA Beach, here we come!

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,560
Now you're sure this girl
has a friend, Westfall?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,960
Would I lie to you?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,640
In a heartbeat.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,400
You know what?

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,040
That hurts.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Yes, she has a friend.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,080
Yeah?

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,840
What's she look like?

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,520
Karen says she's very blonde.

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Mentally or physically?

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,120
Look, we're out to have fun.

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,120
Right.

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,000
So, how dumb is she?

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, 38DD.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,680
Oh, damn it.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,400
How fast were you going?

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,600
Seventy-five.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,840
That's what you get for
screwing a buddy over.

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,480
Hey, pull out your military I.D.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,080
Maybe he'll let us slide with a warning.

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,000
Sorry about that, Officer.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,520
My friend and I were on our way to...

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,460
Is that Tony?

25
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:53,380
No.

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,900
Well, you sure?

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,860
It really looked like...

28
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,060
Is there a reason you've been
haunting my desk all week?

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,500
Uh, no, I was just...

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,100
Or maybe you just decided
to take over DiNozzo's job

31
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,700
of annoying me while he's on sick leave.

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,340
I- I just wanted to check
that everything was okay.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,180
Why wouldn't it be?

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,780
Well, you and Tony were
close, and... you know.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,260
No, I don't know.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,780
What?

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,260
He almost died.

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,700
We're NCIS agents, McGee.

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,500
There is a chance one of us might die
every time we walk through the door.

40
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,340
Yeah, but I'm the idiot that handed
him an envelope filled with plague.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,180
Tim...

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,340
it's not your fault.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,225
Look, if you want to think
about something, why don't you

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,260
think about all the times Tony has
insulted us, invaded our privacy.

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,300
The fact he almost
died owing us all money.

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,580
That's true he can be pretty obnoxious.

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,980
You miss him as much as I do?

48
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,180
More.

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,220
It's part of his charm.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,020
He's like an X-rated Peter Pan.

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,140
You know he told all the girls
downstairs you're gay, right?

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,980
Said it would cut down
on the competition.

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,660
That bastard.

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,300
Hold onto that feeling, and
you're going to be just fine.

55
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,260
You want to know what he said about you?

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,100
That you tried to sleep with
him when you were in Paraguay.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,820
I will kill him.

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,980
You're sure yore up for this?

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,940
Never felt better.

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,180
Yeah?

61
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,620
Yeah.

62
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,860
You look like crap.

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,820
I missed you too, boss.

64
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,020
You've got another week
of sick leave coming, Tony.

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,020
You should take it.

66
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,060
I was going crazy at home.

67
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,060
Maybe I'm not 100%, but you need me.

68
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,900
Okay, what about Kate and McGee?

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,300
They're practically lost without me.

70
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,980
They've gotten more work done in the
last two weeks an they have all year.

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,140
But they did miss me, right?

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,540
Yeah, something like that.

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,540
I can't wait to see their faces.

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,180
You did the right thing.

75
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,100
Where is the car, exactly?

76
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Hi, Kate!

77
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,540
Sorry about that, Captain.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,620
Where'd you say the car was?

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,900
Must be important.

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,780
Probie, did you miss me?

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,380
Long time no...

82
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,060
Thank you, Captain.

83
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,900
What's wrong with him?

84
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,860
Virginia State Police
just got a 911 call, Gibbs.

85
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,780
Two dead sailors.

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,465
Where?

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,220
In a car off Route 17 in Fredericksburg.

88
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,340
Let's roll.

89
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,020
Gas the truck.

90
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,140
Sure th...

91
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,940
On it, boss.

92
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,980
Maybe I did die.

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,540
You feel that?

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,420
Feel what?

95
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,460
Oh. You're still alive.

96
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,620
Welcome back, DiNozzo.

97
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,900
Two victims.

98
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,060
Looks like the shooter knew
what he was doing, Gibbs.

99
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
Tight groupings, three rounds each.

100
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:49,580
Every one of them a kill shot.

101
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,060
Passenger's Curtis
Janssen, Pensacola, Florida.

102
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,580
No military I.D.

103
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,660
Credit cards and money are intact.

104
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,820
So, it wasn't a robbery?

105
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,340
Depends.

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,140
On what?

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,820
On what else is missing, Kate.

108
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,340
Looks like the killer tried to clean up.

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,060
Not exactly.

110
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,020
You know he took at least two
things with him when he left.

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,780
He needed his prints?

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,020
Bag it.

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,180
Boss! State cops ran
the Mustang's plates.

114
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,660
It's a rental car out of Dulles Airport.

115
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,100
I got a call into this...

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,860
Are you okay?

117
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,900
Just trying to catch my breath.

118
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,820
You should have taken that
extra week off, DiNozzo.

119
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,740
Help him up, Kate.

120
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,900
I'm gonna see what's keeping Ducky.

121
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Did that hurt?

122
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,180
Yup.

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,260
Good.

124
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,420
Where the hell are they, McGee?

125
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,940
Palmer must have taken
a wrong turn again, boss.

126
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,860
I was facing the rear...

127
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,060
Doctor, I just turned the way you said.

128
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,300
You should have known
"right" meant "left."

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm terribly sorry, Jethro.

130
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,060
Mr. Palmer got usost again.

131
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,900
Doctor, you had the map.

132
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,860
You gave it to me!

133
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,700
Sir, for the record, I-I...

134
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,460
Looks like a professional hit.

135
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,100
Probably took the hands
to confirm the kill.

136
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,260
McGee told me what you said.

137
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,660
Did he, now?

138
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,380
Oh, come on.

139
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,220
I was joking around.

140
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,500
I didn't think he'd really believe me.

141
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,020
Really? And why is that?

142
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,380
Anyone looking at you can
tell your breasts are real.

143
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,020
Wha... you told him
I had breast implants?!

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,940
No.

145
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,620
You know what, Tony?

146
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,340
I can't even believe
I worried about you.

147
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,980
You are nothing but a...

148
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,420
Snake.

149
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,380
Yeah, exactly.

150
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,660
No, a big-big-big-big
snake, down there.

151
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,180
Tell me it's not poisonous.

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
I think it is.

153
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,060
Ew! What is it doing?!

154
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,620
It's wrapping around your leg.

155
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:14,820
Do something, Tony.

156
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,020
I'll try and grab it.

157
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,540
Just don't make any
sudden moves, all right?

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,140
Ah! What if you miss it?

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
They do this stuff on the
Discovery Channel all the time.

160
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,660
How hard can it be?

161
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,580
Oh, no, screw it; I'm going to shoot it.

162
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,460
Put that gun away.

163
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,500
You're going to blow your foot off.

164
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:32,940
Let me do this.

165
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,860
God. My life in your hands?

166
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,220
I knew it was going to end this way.

167
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,140
Quiet. You're making me nervous.

168
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,780
Easy now.

169
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,860
About there...

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,660
Get it off!

171
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,620
Oh, God.

172
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,900
Gotcha!

173
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay, I'll give you this much.

174
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,740
You do have your moments.

175
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,020
So, are we friends again?

176
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,260
Oh, cool, a corn snake.

177
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,260
Can I hold him?

178
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,660
No, it's poisonous, McGee.

179
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,860
No, actually they're-they're not, Kate.

180
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,140
Yes, they are, McGee.

181
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,820
What about that one you caught in

182
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,660
Shenandoah State Park?

183
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,540
You had it around your neck

184
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,060
for, like, an hour.

185
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,420
That near-fatal illness

186
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,060
may have clouded my memory.

187
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,540
You're such a loser.

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,500
All right, get back to work.

189
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,620
McGee,

190
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,460
check the trunk.

191
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,020
Nobody touch the dead bodies

192
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,460
until Ducky says all clear.

193
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,460
All right.

194
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,460
Freeze, McGee; don't move!

195
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,020
TONY:

196
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,460
The car's wired to explode.

197
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,380
It looks like the detonator's

198
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:42,100
tied to the trunk.

199
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,660
What?

200
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
How far did you turn the key?

201
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,456
Uh, I'm not sure.

202
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,635
Almost all the way, I think.

203
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,780
Okay, don't let it snap back.

204
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,500
All right?

205
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,020
Yeah.

206
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,580
Let go.

207
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:50,820
Okay.

208
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,100
Okay, both of you run.

209
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,740
No, Tony, we're not
leaving you standing...

210
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,020
I'm a lot faster than you are.

211
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,900
I'll be right behind you.

212
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,780
This is not a debate, okay?

213
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,580
This thing might be primed already.

214
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,140
Anthony, you should have
taken that extra week.

215
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,820
It's the car!

216
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,740
It's wired to ex...!

217
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,260
Tony!

218
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:35,740
Boss...

219
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,980
you remember when I
said I never felt better?

220
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,460
I lied.

221
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm telling you I'm fine.

222
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,960
136/84 is not fine for you, Tony.

223
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
Your blood pressure is high.

224
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Almost getting blown up
tends to do that to me,

225
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,080
not to mention hanging around Kate
when she's in one of her moods.

226
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
This isn't funny, DiNozzo.

227
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,160
No, it's not.

228
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,920
If I didn't come in to work
today, you and McGee'd be

229
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
lying on one of those tables over there.

230
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
At least your temperature
is pretty normal.

231
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, I'm good to go.

232
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
Oh, muscle soreness?

233
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Only when I move or breathe.

234
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,400
Yes, clearly, you haven't quite
recovered from your bout with Y. pestis.

235
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,360
You need a rest.

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
NoI need to get back to work, Ducky.

237
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
Damn it, Tony.

238
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,720
I should just take you
home and get you in bed.

239
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
Okay, that didn't come
out the way I intended.

240
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,280
What didn't, Kate?

241
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,560
Oh, I-I was just saying...

242
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,840
Kate was just, uh, expressing
our concern for Tony, here.

243
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,240
Yeah?

244
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,680
How is he?

245
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,760
Stubborn, pigheaded, and
unaware of his own limitations.

246
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,880
Sounds about right.

247
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
I haven't finished with you yet.

248
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Got a positive I.D.

249
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,480
here yet, Duck?

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,240
You want to buy me dinner
first, or should we go to your...

251
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
Fortunately, the skulls
remained relatively intact.

252
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
The problem is sorting out
which parts belong with whom.

253
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Yeah, I can see that, Palmer.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
The dental records were conclusive.

255
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,160
Passengers were Navy lieutenants
Dean Westfall and Curtis Janssen.

256
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Well, that checks.

257
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,400
According to the car rental place,
Westfall rented a Mustang two months ago.

258
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Kate, pull up their service records.

259
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,120
Have McGee find out
who made that 911 call.

260
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,640
On it.

261
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,200
Tony.

262
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah?

263
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Go lie down before you pass out.

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm not going to pass out.

265
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,240
I might cry a little, maybe feel sorry
for myself, but DiNozzos do not pass out.

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,600
Coming, boss.

267
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,840
Can't you do something, Duck?

268
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,280
Yes, well, I'm doing it right now.

269
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,320
What?

270
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,640
Praying.

271
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,560
You going to be okay?

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,320
Sure.

273
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,680
Not looking so hot.

274
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Well, at least that's an improvement.

275
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,400
Over what?

276
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,800
According to Gibbs, I look like crap.

277
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
You know, Kate really
been worried about you.

278
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,600
Kate worries about everything.

279
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,680
No, no, no, I mean, really worried.

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,920
What's your point, probie?

281
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
Well, you think that maybe...

282
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,680
you know.

283
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Me and Kate?

284
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Never happen.

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Why not?

286
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
She's too smart for that.

287
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:10,480
You know what?

288
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,160
You don't believe me?

289
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,320
She's coming right now. Shh.

290
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,960
Gibbs wants to know who made
that 911 call this morning, Tim.

291
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,880
On it.

292
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
Where's DiNozzo?

293
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
Uh, I think he's laying down somewhere.

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,560
Oh, good. He needs it.

295
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
You care a lot about
him, don't you, Kate?

296
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Well, he's my teammate.

297
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,480
What do you think?

298
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,520
I don't know, sometimes I think
it might be more than that.

299
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,400
Tony?

300
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,800
Are you kidding?

301
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
Well, come on, you
never thought about it?

302
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,040
Well...

303
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,840
I guess there are times
when Tony can be charming,

304
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,480
warm, not completely obnoxious.

305
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
Right. So if he wasn't

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,600
your teammate?

307
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,880
Ooh, that's a tough one.

308
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,400
Well, on the plus side, he is...

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
smart, brave, not to mention...

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,680
kind of hot.

311
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Hey, you know, in a different world,

312
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I could see myself
marrying someone like him.

313
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,560
Very funny.

314
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
I thought I told you to lie down.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,400
I was.

316
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:15,640
I am.

317
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,440
Not here.

318
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,720
Well, hey, there, little lady.

319
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,640
Tony! You're back!

320
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I missed you!

321
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh, what's wrong?

322
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
Did I hurt you?

323
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
I'm fine.

324
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,280
Just a little sore, you know,
from the explosion and all.

325
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,600
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Do you want to sit down?

327
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,640
Well, I was kind of
thinking about lying down

328
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
next to your little
refrigerator thingy over here.

329
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,120
Sure, sure.

330
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, yes.

331
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,520
Here.

332
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,000
You can use Bert as a pillow.

333
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,560
He's supposed to make that noise.

334
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,880
You have a stuffed animal that farts?

335
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Yeah. It's cool, huh?

336
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,040
Yeah... in a disturbing way.

337
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,200
So, what did I miss?

338
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,680
Gibbs has been cranky
since you've been gone.

339
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,880
Think his knee's bothering him.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
And, uh, Kate broke up with some
lawyer guy, which is really good,

341
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,960
'cause he wasn't very big
on personal hygiene, and...

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,800
About the case, Abbs.

343
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
I got a glimpse of the bomb.

344
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
It was definitely a pro job.

345
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,520
You are correct, sir.

346
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,320
I've run ten samples.

347
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,200
The main electric charge is C-4.

348
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
It's primed with det
cord and blasting caps.

349
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,160
So we should be able to trace
its source to the manufacturer.

350
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
You'd think so, but no.

351
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Abby, every military explosive
over the last 20 years

352
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,360
has had taggants mixed in
for identification purposes.

353
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,040
Yep, but these don't.

354
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,720
You telling me this guy
made this stuff from scratch?

355
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,160
The compositions are
exact as off the shelf.

356
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,080
That's not possible.

357
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
How's that possible?

358
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,720
It shouldn't be possible.

359
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
Oh, it's possible.

360
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
That was the stuffed animal, boss.

361
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,240
Right, Abby?

362
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,200
What stuffed animal?

363
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,520
Abbs...

364
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
are you sure these
explosives aren't traceable?

365
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,320
Um, so far, but I'm still checking.

366
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,600
What about the detonator?

367
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Also weird.

368
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,200
The electronics are fairly simple, but
there's no serial numbers on anything.

369
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
It's like it's been sanitized.

370
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,600
Let's go, DiNozzo.

371
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,360
We got problems.

372
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
Someone's trying to kill us again.

373
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
I don't think he meant that literally.

374
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,760
Okay, thanks, Sergeant.

375
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,640
We'll, uh, still need a
copy of the dispatch tape.

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Boss, uh, according to State
Police, the 911 call was...

377
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,080
Anonymous?

378
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
Yes, and it was also...

379
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,880
Untraceable.

380
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,840
Yeah.

381
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,040
Uh, they're sending a
tape with the call over.

382
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,960
Kate, what do you know
about the lieutenants?

383
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
They're both pilots, Gibbs.

384
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,280
Lieutenant Curtis Janssen's
an instructor in Pensacola.

385
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,440
What's he doing in Virginia?

386
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
According to his unit, he was on leave

387
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,640
visiting his friend,
Lieutenant Dean Westfall.

388
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,640
Also out of Pensacola, but for the
last two months, he's been T.A.D.

389
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
at the Aberdeen Proving
Ground in Maryland.

390
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,280
Proving ground?

391
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,160
It's where they test new military
equipment and technology, probie.

392
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Maybe they used Westfall's
prints to access the base.

393
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,520
I checked, Tony.

394
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,840
None of Aberdeen's security systems
rely on fingerprint or palm scanners.

395
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
What was he working on there?

396
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,680
Classified.

397
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,680
I will find out.

398
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,280
So, what's going on, boss?

399
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,240
Car didn't have any military decals.

400
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,720
Lieutenants were wearing civvies.

401
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,000
A- And the 911 caller specifically
said that it was two dead sailors.

402
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,080
Someone wanted NCIS to
investigate the scene.

403
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,360
Why?

404
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
The same reason they rigged
the car to explode, Kate.

405
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,900
We were set up.

406
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,220
So someone really is trying to kill us?

407
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah, and they came pretty damn close.

408
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,900
You're absolutely certain
about this, Jethro?

409
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,660
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to try to get us out there

410
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,700
on that road today, Director.

411
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,500
For what purpose?

412
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,980
Unclear, but what concerns
me is the explosive used-

413
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,660
military, high-grade,
extremely difficult to trace.

414
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,940
Tough to get outside of certain circles.

415
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
You're not suggesting another agency?

416
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I'm not suggesting anything, sir.

417
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,540
All I know is I've pissed off
a lot of people over the years.

418
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,180
I would ask you to keep
your suspicions to yourself.

419
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,820
Can I ask why, sir?

420
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,020
There may be other factors involved.

421
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Like what, sir?

422
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,460
Currently, I'm not at
liberty to discuss it.

423
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,340
I almost lost my entire
team out there today.

424
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,380
If the's something I should know...

425
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,740
This is not open for
discussion, Agent Gibbs.

426
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,660
Yes, sir.

427
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,900
You're dismissed.

428
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,260
You have a good evening, sir.

429
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,780
Get me the director of the FBI.

430
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,500
Yes, sir.

431
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,660
You want some?

432
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,540
No, thank you.

433
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,620
Passed on free food.

434
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,740
Maybe he is dying.

435
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,180
Well, I haven't had much
of an appetite lately, Kate,

436
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,060
on account of having
the pneumonic plague.

437
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,940
Yeah, I know, Tony.

438
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,740
I was there.

439
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
You don't have to keep bringing
it up every five minutes.

440
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,260
It's not every day you escape the
clutches of the Black Death, Kate.

441
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,740
It was a life changing experience.

442
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,540
How so, Tony?

443
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,740
Ask Kate-
she was there.

444
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,380
Hey, I want to know what Westfall was
doing at Aberdeen by the time I get back.

445
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,180
Where you going?

446
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,620
Out.

447
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,900
McGee...

448
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,060
I want other reasons why someone
would chop off his hands. Tony?

449
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Eat something.

450
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,940
Why take someone's hands?

451
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,860
Trophies?

452
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,260
Okay, but why leave
the other lieutenant's?

453
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,540
If he's chopping hands
off, I don't think

454
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,980
we can expect him to be rational, McGee.

455
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,300
We've got trouble.

456
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
What was your first hint?

457
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,860
The two dead bodies downstairs
or the explosion, McGee?

458
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,540
No, I mean FBI trouble.

459
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,260
Fornell?

460
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,380
We must be in worse
shape than we thought.

461
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,020
Where's Gibbs?

462
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,020
He's not here.

463
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,740
Where is he, Agent Todd?

464
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,380
He's out.

465
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,420
Try him on his cell.

466
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,380
I d.

467
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:10,860
He's not answering.

468
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,500
What's going on?

469
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,340
Ari Haswari is back in country.

470
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,060
You let that psycho back in
the States without telling us?

471
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,100
He was supposed to be helping us uncover
an Al Qaeda cell in the D.C. area.

472
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,980
What do you mean,
"supposed to," Fornell?

473
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,140
We now think he's here
for more personal reasons.

474
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,940
He's planning on killing Gibbs.

475
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:54,020
Washington is such a lovely
city this time of year.

476
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,011
Don't you agree, Special Agent Gibbs?

477
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,380
Not much of a conversationalist, are we?

478
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,380
I am mostly waiting here, Ari.

479
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,220
Oh, for what?

480
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:08,620
A reason to shoot you again.

481
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,780
Someone tried to kill my team today.

482
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,860
I'm thinking it was you.

483
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,580
You wound me, Gibbs.

484
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,220
If it was me, they'd be dead already.

485
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,900
You're still coming in
with me for questioning.

486
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,260
Unfortunately, I've made other
arrangements for the evening.

487
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,380
It wasn't a request.

488
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,580
I know.

489
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,100
That's why I took the precaution of planting
an explosive device under one of these tables.

490
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,620
You be a good NCIS agent,
I may even tell you where.

491
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,220
What are you doing here?

492
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,340
An Al Qaeda cell is planning
an attack in Washington.

493
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,140
I'm here to stop it.

494
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,780
Yeah?

495
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,340
What's the target?

496
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,580
I don't know.

497
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,300
Where's the cell located?

498
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,420
Wish I knew.

499
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,180
You're doing a hell of a job
for a Mossad double agent.

500
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,140
I can, however, gain access to that
information, but it comes at a price.

501
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,620
One you may not be willing to pay.

502
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,780
Try me.

503
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,820
Al Qaeda sent me here to
conduct my own mission.

504
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,540
It's a test.

505
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,620
I pass, and I'm allowed
into the Washington cell.

506
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,700
They want me to kill you.

507
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,740
You don't seem surprised?

508
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
It means I'm doing my job.

509
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,580
Yes.

510
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,700
And in order for me to
do mine, you have to die.

511
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,125
I wonder, what would
you do in my position?

512
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,180
Kill myself.

513
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,080
Sadly, not an option.

514
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,600
It's the one part of my
religion I subscribe to.

515
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,480
I could help you out with that.

516
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,440
A kind offer to be sure.

517
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
I also have one for you.

518
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm listening.

519
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,480
You have 24 hours to find
and eliminate the cell.

520
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,200
If you fail...

521
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
I appreciate the heads-up.

522
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
It's the least I could do.

523
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
How's Caitlin, by the way?

524
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,360
I've thought of her
often since my last visit.

525
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,920
Go near her, and I don't
care what government agency's

526
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,400
watching your back, I
will kill you this time.

527
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,760
I wouldn't have it any other way.

528
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,720
Where's the device?

529
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, I almost forgot.

530
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,680
I lied.

531
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,440
There is none.

532
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,040
Please call me back.

533
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,000
That's 20 messages I left.

534
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,040
We should look for him, McGee.

535
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,840
Look for who?

536
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,520
We've been calling you
for the last hour, boss.

537
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,080
Well, yeah, my ringer
thing got turned off.

538
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,680
You're never going to
believe who's back in town.

539
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,400
Ari.

540
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,760
Maybe you will.

541
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
Fornell said that he's here to...

542
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,200
Kill me. Yeah.

543
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,840
I know.

544
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,400
I just had coffee with him.

545
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,680
So... what happened?

546
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,080
He tried to kill me.

547
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
We find out what Westfall's
doing in Aberdeen yet?

548
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,720
Uh, boss, aren't you gonna
elaborate a little bit first?

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
Well, yeah, McGee, I'm alive.

550
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,640
Now tell me about Westfall.

551
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,920
Uh, he was only attached to Aberdeen.

552
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,640
He was actually working
with an aerospace

553
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,520
contractor in Maryland-
Danborn Avionics.

554
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,320
Doing what?

555
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Testing field service modules, or
something like that I have no idea.

556
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,920
The FBI sent a team over to the
company to investigate their security.

557
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,880
The FBI?

558
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
A lot's happened in the last hour.

559
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Where's Fornell?

560
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,840
MTAC.

561
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,760
Make the ringer thing work.

562
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Is it me or did he take the
whole Ari situation really well?

563
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,200
That's 'cause he's
looking forward to it.

564
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,120
Looking forward to what?

565
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Finally getting to kill him.

566
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,480
How long did you know
that bastard was here?

567
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,520
We had our reasons, Gibbs.

568
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,720
How long?

569
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,880
About a week.

570
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,960
We didn't know what his cover
mission was with Al Qaeda until today.

571
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm taking him down.

572
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,480
Not this time.

573
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
The FBI can handle this.

574
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,840
The civilians in the coffee shop
that he tried to blow up today

575
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,320
would probably disagree
with you, Tobias.

576
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,240
Look, if it was up to me, I'd
put a round through his forehead.

577
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,840
It's not.

578
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,000
You're sitting this one out.

579
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,560
You gonna try to stop me?

580
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,400
No.

581
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,120
No, not me, Jethro.

582
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
Ari has been declared
off limits NCIS will have

583
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
no further involvement in the case.

584
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,880
You're kidding, sir.

585
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,840
I've also been ordered to place
you under protective custody...

586
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
for your own safety.

587
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Meaning for Ari's?

588
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,960
Take it for what it is, a
direct order, Agent Gibbs.

589
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,400
And you damn well tter
follow it to the letter.

590
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:31,840
Yes, sir.

591
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,240
I'd also like to take this opportunity
to offer you my resignation, sir.

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,520
And I will accept it, after
you've completes your current case.

593
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,240
Sir?

594
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
Have you found any
evidence connecting Ari

595
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,520
to the murder of our two Naval officers?

596
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,040
No, we haven't, sir.

597
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,160
I will now hand you over
to our federally certified

598
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,920
protective custody expert, Agent Todd.

599
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,480
I hear she used to
protect the President.

600
00:25:55,515 --> 00:25:56,240
You should be flattered.

601
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,760
He's all yours.

602
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,800
I expect you to follow her orders
to the letter, as if they were mine.

603
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,280
That last part?

604
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,600
He meant.

605
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,880
In his home, two
teams, six-hour shifts.

606
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,760
Alternating radio
checks every ten minutes.

607
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,320
Outside, I want a mobile foot patrol
and two permanent observation posts.

608
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,160
Gibbs is not gonna like that.

609
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,760
Well, screw what he likes, Tony.

610
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm not going to let that psycho
within five miles of Gibbs.

611
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,680
McGee, I need full audio and
video surveillance, inside and out.

612
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,640
Everything tied back in MTAC.

613
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,320
You got it, Kate.

614
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Go home. It's late.

615
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,400
Uh, Gibbs, I don't think
we're gonna be going home.

616
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm staying here.

617
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,760
I do not need an army of agents staying
up all night watching me build a boat.

618
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,480
You won't leave the building?

619
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,040
If I do, I'll call you.

620
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
Go. Go home.

621
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
Get some sleep.

622
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,080
First thing tomorrow
morning, we're gonna check out

623
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
Danborn Avionics, find
out what the FBI missed.

624
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,640
Go.

625
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Did you miss me?

626
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Gibbs.

627
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,400
You dream about Gibbs?

628
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,680
What? No. God, no.

629
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,920
You just said his name.

630
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,160
No, I didn't.

631
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,760
Yes, you did.

632
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,920
What's going on?

633
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Kate dreams about Gibbs.

634
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh, what was it about?

635
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,440
No, I didn't dream about Gibbs.

636
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,640
She screamed his name.

637
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Really?

638
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:37,720
Here you go.

639
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,760
Look, if you want to check
out the defense contracting

640
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
company with us today,
you're wearing a vest.

641
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:47,720
I can live with that.

642
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
That's kind of the point, Gibbs.

643
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,680
Lieutenant Westfall was the military
liaison for Danborn's Modular UAV project.

644
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
And like I told the FBI, I really doubt
his murder had anything to do with it.

645
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,320
Modular UAV?

646
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,160
It's an unmanned aerial vehicle
we're developing with the Navy.

647
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,760
It can be reconfigured for
different missions in the field.

648
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
What kind of missions?

649
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,120
Reconnaissance, nuclear and biological
agent testing, uh, ground attack.

650
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,520
So it can be used as a weapon?

651
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,200
Some day.

652
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,640
It's only a prototype.

653
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,400
Oh, and, uh, before you ask, we changed

654
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,840
all our security codes and removed
Westfall's from the system last night.

655
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
Follow me.

656
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,400
Any chance of your
modular UAVs is missing?

657
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,920
Nope we only have one and
that's her in the hangar.

658
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,960
What are these?

659
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,000
Scale models we use
in wind tunnel tests.

660
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,160
Any of your security systems rely on fingerprint
or palm-scanningtechnology, Mr. Eberlee?

661
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,640
Why?

662
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,040
Lieutenant Westfall
was missing his hands.

663
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,640
Someone hacked them off.

664
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,640
the FBI didn't mention that.

665
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,440
We did.

666
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,080
What's the answer?

667
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,680
Our radio flight control
systems use biometrics.

668
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Only pilots entered into
the system can fly them.

669
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Like Westfall.

670
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
Yeah, but we only have one
flyable UAV and that's it.

671
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,440
What about these?

672
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,320
Those are target drones.

673
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,760
Danborn Avionics got its
start making them in the 1970s.

674
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
They're relics, they're not operational.

675
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,120
Looks like one's missing.

676
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,880
It was, uh, it was probably moved.

677
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,120
Where?

678
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,320
We sometimes use them for spare parts.

679
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,400
Look, it's not possible.

680
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
I mean, you'd need a team of engineers
to get one of these aps in flying shape.

681
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,000
Not to mention, you need
a radio flight control.

682
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
And I'll bet Lieutenant
Westfall's is missing.

683
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,360
According to these schematics,
the drone's pretty outdated

684
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,680
from a tech perspective, Gibbs.

685
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
So is a hand grenade.

686
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,040
Excellent point.

687
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,720
The Danborn TX-Bravo is
basically a jet-propelled

688
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,880
RC plane, meaning it's manually
controlled by a radio transmitter.

689
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,480
The transmitter they
stole was for a modern UAV?

690
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,040
They might not be able to fly it.

691
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,880
True, true, but Danborn's
flight codes are based

692
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
on the original software,
so a few tweaks...

693
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,280
What's the range?

694
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,160
40 miles.

695
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,160
Unless if they load it
down with explosives.

696
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,920
Oh, they will.

697
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,680
Payload would haveo be pretty small.

698
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
25 pounds or less if they
want to get it off the ground.

699
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
Not a lot of bang for your buck.

700
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,840
It is if you're going
after a soft target, Abbs.

701
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,880
Soft target?

702
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,760
People.

703
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,400
Any way to stop it if it's launched?

704
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,240
It wouldn't be hard to
destabilize the system.

705
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,720
I have the operational frequencies.

706
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,600
Another controller
could probably jam it.

707
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,880
t me another controller.

708
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,240
But, Gibbs, there's a catch.

709
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,440
You'd have to be within
a 40-mile range to jam it.

710
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,440
I had a weird dream
about Tony last night.

711
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,200
Not the one where you two
are at the zoo, and he...

712
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,800
No, no.

713
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,520
He's fully clothed in this one.

714
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680
But he had blood all over his face.

715
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,160
I woke up crying, Kate.

716
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,800
I never cry.

717
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,720
Never, ever, ever.

718
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,920
Hey, it was just a bete noire.

719
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,440
Gotta go.

720
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,960
What do you got?

721
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,920
A shot of our drone thieves from Danborn's
security footage from two nights ago.

722
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,440
The day the lieutenants were murdered.

723
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,320
Can you I.D. them?

724
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Well, they're both wearing
ski masks, but check this out.

725
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,120
Maybe I'm paranoid, but
does that guy look familiar?

726
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
You're not paranoid.

727
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,960
That bastard's Ari.

728
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,160
He's not looking for an Al Qaeda cell.

729
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,920
Hell, no.

730
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,680
He's running it.

731
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
You get Fornell in here.

732
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,960
How much should I tell him?

733
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,600
Tell him he's about to make the
second biggest mistake of his life.

734
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,880
What...

735
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:12,880
My second biggest mistake, Jethro?

736
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,520
That's very dramatic.

737
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,080
What was the first?

738
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
When you married my second wife.

739
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,840
You could have warned me.

740
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
I did.

741
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,800
In my own defense, I
thought he was exaggerating.

742
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
He wasn't.

743
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,920
Where's Ari?

744
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,520
What part of, "Sit this
out," don't you get?

745
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,840
The part where he steals a Navy UAV and
kills a whole bunch of people with it.

746
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,520
My people checked out Danborn Avionics.

747
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Their only UAV is accounted for.

748
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,320
He stole a target drone, Fornell.

749
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,240
Pull it up.

750
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,000
Pack the nose of that with Semtex,
he's got a poor man's cruise missile.

751
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,720
Guess your boys missed it.

752
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,640
Ari's playing you.

753
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
He's no double agent he never has been.

754
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,000
Where is he?

755
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,160
All we've got is an encrypted
spook cell phone number.

756
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,880
Call him.

757
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,040
You can't trace it from here, Gibbs.

758
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
Need a high-level NSA intercept.

759
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,720
Patch us through.

760
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,520
You're talking dedicated
satellite time and...

761
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,120
I've got two NSA satellites in range
for the next five minutes, Gunny.

762
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,200
What's the number?

763
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,520
Are you sure about this?

764
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,080
As sure as when I told you she would
clean out your bank account when she left.

765
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Patching it through now.

766
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Sure he's going to answer?

767
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Put my name on his caller I.D.

768
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:40,640
He'll answer.

769
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,380
Special Agent Gibbs, now,
how did you get this number?

770
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,420
I pulled some strings.

771
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,940
Yes, your friend Fornell.

772
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,300
I imagine he's there with you.

773
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,500
Nope.

774
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,820
Nope. I've been thrown off the case.

775
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,180
It's for the best.

776
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,580
I really wasn't looking
forward to killing you.

777
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,580
I wish I could say the same thing, Ari.

778
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,500
I've resigned from NCIS.

779
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,420
I hope it wasn't something I said.

780
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,620
Next time we meet, Ari,
will be the last time.

781
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,580
There won't be anybody to stop me.

782
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Gibbs, I'm honored.

783
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,660
I had no idea you made so much of a...

784
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,780
He's on a cell phone grid
30 miles out of Norfolk.

785
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,860
Newport News area.

786
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,100
Let's go.

787
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,580
I've got it isolated down
to a two-block radius.

788
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,660
What the hell is he doing in Norfolk?

789
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,060
You know how to work that if
we have to jam the drone, McGee?

790
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,860
Uh, well, Abby explained it to me but
I to got to be honest with you, boss...

791
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,180
I'll figure it out.

792
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,580
What's today's date, Kate?

793
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,220
Uh, May 24th.

794
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,940
Paula Cassidy's ship gets
back from the Gulf today.

795
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,300
We're hooking up this weekend.

796
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,340
Well, don't you think you should
concentrate on the terrorist attack first?

797
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,060
The whole Marine Amphibious
Strike Group returns today, Kate.

798
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,860
Five ships, all of
them headed to Norfolk.

799
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,700
Tony, I doubt that a drone,
even one packed with explosives,

800
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,420
could do any real damage to a warship.

801
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,100
The pier will be packed
with Navy families, McGee.

802
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,500
Welcoming them home.

803
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,220
You want to give him a teddy bear?

804
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:47,820
Yeah.

805
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,980
Huh? Look at this.

806
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah.

807
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,780
Locator beacon is set.

808
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,780
You figured it out?

809
00:36:59,463 --> 00:37:00,020
I did.

810
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,622
The, uh, drone is on one
of three radio frequencies.

811
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,858
It'll take a few minutes to
jam each of them, but when

812
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:07,060
I hit the freq it's on the
drone should go off-target.

813
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,740
It's gonna take hours to
search these warehouses, boss.

814
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,740
Give me the shotgun.

815
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,150
Tony, take the fire escape.

816
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,950
Kate, with me.

817
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,990
McGee, start jamming.

818
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,430
Boss, they fired the drone.

819
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,310
Jam it, McGee!

820
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,830
I can do this.

821
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,110
I can do this.

822
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,390
Miss me?

823
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,590
Got one down, boss.

824
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,950
No visual on anyone else.

825
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,110
Let's do it.

826
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:16,327
Clear.

827
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:19,230
McGee, this thing is still flying!

828
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,630
Okay, one freq down, two to go!

829
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,910
Boss, one of them shot my transmitter.

830
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,510
You know how to fly this thing?

831
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,070
No, but I know how to crash it.

832
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,190
McGee, you okay?

833
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,350
I got one terrorist inside.

834
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,550
I don't know if I got him,
but he stopped shooting.

835
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,590
Hold your position; we'll flush him.

836
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,270
Okay.

837
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,910
I'm out.

838
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,750
Me, too.

839
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,270
Shooter!

840
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:07,950
Kate!

841
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,430
You okay?

842
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,030
I just got shot at
point-blank range, DiNozzo.

843
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:22,950
What do you think?

844
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,950
You're not gonna be going
to Pilates class tomorrow?

845
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,310
Protection detail's over, Kate.

846
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,230
You did good.

847
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,230
For once, DiNozzo's right.

848
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,430
I thought I'd die before I ever heard...

849
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,988
Sorry, Caitlin.

850
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,405
Ari.
