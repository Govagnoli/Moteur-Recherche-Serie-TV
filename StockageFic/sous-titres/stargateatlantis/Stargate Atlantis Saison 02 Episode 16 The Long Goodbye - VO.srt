1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,547
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,552
Dr. Weir, we're ready to go.
We'll meet you at the rendezvous site.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,808
Your identification code was used
to access this city's operating system.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,520
You think that I'm working for the trust?

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,314
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,415
And people just sit and watch
this box for hours at a time?

7
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,210
- Yeah, people do.
- Is it that engaging?

8
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,461
It depends what's on it.

9
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,423
There are lots
of programs on dozens of channels every day, all day.

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,887
Most of which are fictional representations
of ridiculously attractive people in absurd situations.

11
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,516
<i>There are educational programs,</i>
<i>all sorts of documentaries...</i>

12
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,519
not many people watch 'em, but, well, they're on.

13
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,897
And that's what everybody
on your planet does for entertainment.

14
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,691
Watch a box.

15
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,445
Not everyone, although I will confess
to the occasional half-hour of Jeopardy.

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,407
- Jeopardy?
- It's the name of the show. Jeopardy.

17
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,117
Sounds dangerous.

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,203
Double Jeopardy... that's twice as dangerous.

19
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,624
It's a proximity alarm.

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,126
Something's out there.

21
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,252
A ship?

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>No...</i>

23
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,423
there's two of 'em.
There's another one in a lower orbit.

24
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,467
- Another what?
- I don't know, but...

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,053
it's big enough to hold a person.

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,930
Maybe it's a coffin.

27
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,100
Perhaps jettisoned from a ship?

28
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,060
Space burial?

29
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,353
<i>No.</i>

30
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,106
It's definitely not a coffin.

31
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,151
<i>I'm reading life</i>
<i>signs coming from inside of both of them.</i>

32
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,944
<i>Whoever's in there...</i>

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,030
they're still alive.

34
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,214
<i>Dr. Weir, the first pod is ready.</i>

35
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,174
I'm on my way down.

36
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,053
Colonel Caldwell.

37
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,388
I see you have arrived without your ship.

38
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:23,310
Yes, well, Hermiod's doing some repairs
to the hyperdrive that requires traveling
in a wide orbit around the solar system,

39
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,103
so while my ship flies in circles,

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,690
I thought I'd beam down early and
see if I could do a little repair work of my own.

41
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,485
- That's not necessary.
- I think it is.

42
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:37,241
The host to a Goa'uld parasite is aware
of what's happening to them.
I won't soon forget what I was forced to do.

43
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,827
Still, you can't be held responsible for your actions...

44
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,205
- whereas I can.
- No.

45
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,832
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>
<i>Lives were at stake.</i>

46
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,086
I would have done the same thing
had the situation been reversed.

47
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,300
Colonel Sheppard's team just discovered
something very interesting in the Kohal system.

48
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,220
I was on my way down to see.
Do you care to join us?

49
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,764
I would love to. Thank you.

50
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,817
Dr. Weir.

51
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,195
- Oh, Colonel Caldwell. Welcome back.
- Thank you, Doctor.

52
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,739
- Colonel, what do we got?
- We think it's

53
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,741
a life pod of some kind.

54
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:24,371
It appears to be designed solely for the purposes
of maintaining a single human life in stasis.

55
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,248
<i>This one's a female.</i>

56
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:31,295
There was another one in a decaying orbit, but
we could only fit one inside the Jumper.

57
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,173
<i>I've already sent Lorne in Jumper 6</i>
<i>to recover the second pod.</i>

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,717
Ronon and Teyla went along
to help him locate it.

59
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,678
Okay, I'm ready to crack her open.

60
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,847
Hey.

61
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,932
Hello, Doctor.

62
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,240
She's alive.

63
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,283
Barely.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,245
<i>It appears we found her very near the end.</i>

65
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,956
<i>All the major organs are shutting down.</i>

66
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,876
How long was she out there?

67
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,544
There's no way to tell for certain.

68
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,175
- So she could be an Ancient.
- The pod design makes me doubt that.

69
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,512
It's a shame she can't speak with us.

70
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,848
Just imagine what she could tell us about her people

71
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,142
and about what happened to her.

72
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,270
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

73
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,356
Medical team to lab three, stat!

77
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,680
- This is not my fault.
- We were all there. Relax.

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,932
She's coming around.

79
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,906
You okay?

80
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,533
Dr. Weir is fine.

81
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,954
Dr. Weir doesn't talk about
herself in the third person.

82
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,792
She was simply overcome by
the effects of the imprinting.

83
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,586
Security team to the infirmary.

84
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,546
<i>That's not necessary, Colonel...</i>

85
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,964
Caldwell.

86
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,011
She is merely harboring my consciousness.

87
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,680
- Here we go again.
- And you are?

88
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,307
I am Phoebus.

89
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,643
We are a race of explorers.

90
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,937
On our journey home, our vessel was attacked.

91
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,188
By the Wraith?

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,439
Yes.

93
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,777
<i>We were forced to abandon ship</i>
<i>and launch our life pods.</i>

94
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,363
If this has happened to me...

95
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,785
then I have been adrift for some time and the pod
has determined my body is beyond resuscitation.

96
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,954
You're quite correct.

97
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,040
Then for all intents and purposes,
I am already dead.

98
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,125
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,837
So am I.

100
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're all very sorry. Where's Elizabeth?

101
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,341
She is here also.

102
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,261
And I suppose you'd like us
to take your word for that?

103
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,137
Would you like to speak with her?

104
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,139
Yes, we would.

105
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,563
Dr Weir?

106
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,399
It's okay, Carson. I'm...

107
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,818
I'm fine.

108
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,320
Elizabeth...

109
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,198
I'm not sure if you're aware of this,
but there's another...

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,534
I know. Her name is Phoebus.

111
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,120
You seem remarkably sanguine about all this.

112
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,207
Well, the imprinting will only last a matter of hours.

113
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,625
<i>The other pod...</i>

114
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,462
Phoebus urgently desires to be here
when we bring the other pod back to Atlantis.

115
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,881
Why?

116
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,050
- She believes it's her husband.
- Husband?

117
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,262
<i>He escaped the ship, she's certain of it, and...</i>

118
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,348
The rush of emotion is...

119
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,767
it's overwhelming.

120
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,062
- I can imagine.
- No, no, you can't.

121
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,314
No.

122
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,107
I can't.

123
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,526
John, I'd like you to try.

124
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,655
Phoebus has a favor she'd like to ask of you.

125
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,881
As I understand it,
the beam that hit Elizabeth was part of
a failsafe feature built into the pod's system.

126
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,842
As cellular failure progressed, the pod...

127
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,429
stored her consciousness in a sort of flash memory.

128
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,892
But why? What good is the technology
if the effects are temporary?

129
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,852
It's a black box.

130
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,562
That makes sense.

131
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,442
Even if the body is incapable of being revived,
the survivor can still report what happened to their ship.

132
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,487
<i>A rescue team could interrogate them even if</i>
<i>they were incapable of regaining consciousness.</i>

133
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,782
You're talking about a human flight recorder.
That's pretty dark.

134
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,951
Pretty useful thing in times of war.

135
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:58,747
It could also be the means for
two survivors to say one last goodbye.

136
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,961
Are you sure she's up for this?

137
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,714
Physically, she's perfectly fine.

138
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,216
Besides...

139
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,428
- Elizabeth wouldn't take no for an answer.
- Love is a powerful thing, Carson.

140
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,558
- You're a hopeless romantic, you know that?
- Well, you're just as hopeless.

141
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,852
Otherwise, you wouldn't have agreed.

142
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:25,315
I've gone over their respective E.E.G. patterns,
and I can say with some degree of confidence that this...

143
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,734
"imprinting," that Dr. Weir's...

144
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,320
temporary occupant calls it...

145
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,282
- won't last more than a few hours.
- You can guarantee that?

146
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,741
<i>A day at most.</i>

147
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,493
Well, I'm sold.

148
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,078
Shall we?

149
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,496
And...

150
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,673
<i>He's still alive.</i>

151
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,302
<i>Same as before.</i>

152
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,430
Life signs even fainter than the first one.

153
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,682
<i>If we're going to do this, we should do it now.</i>

154
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,311
I'd prefer if this alien consciousness weren't armed.

155
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,812
Right.

156
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,944
<i>Colonel Sheppard...</i>

157
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,198
you'll have to be in close proximity
to the pod for the transfer to happen.

158
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,949
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

159
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,202
But you're not moving.

160
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,456
You know they were husband and wife.
Anything could happen.

161
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,711
I promise to be discreet,
Colonel.

162
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,796
Well...

163
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,423
I guess...

164
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,176
I'll see you guys later.

165
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,761
Have fun.

166
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,067
Give him a moment.

167
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,407
Thalan...

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,326
it's me.

169
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,621
Phoebus?

170
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,291
It's alright. These people recovered our pods.

171
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,508
We may well be the very last of our kind.

172
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:19,137
These generous people have allowed us
to be together one last time.

173
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,434
You consented to this?

174
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,520
One last chance...

175
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,815
to say goodbye to my husband.

176
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,917
That's not what I expected.

177
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:53,797
I know this body is different,
but I assure you, Thalan, it's me.

178
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,050
Is it possible for us to be alone,

179
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,928
- just for a few minutes?
- No, absolutely not.

180
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,349
- Oh, don't be so heartless.
- Look, they are two consenting adults...
- That's not what I'm concerned about, Doctor.

181
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,562
- The colonel is right.
- Dr. Weir is in charge of this facility.

182
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,565
I'm just saying there should be
an armed guard just outside the door.

183
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,816
Two guards.

184
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,276
One at each door.

185
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,112
I've already taken that precaution.
They're right outside.

186
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,947
Of course they are.

187
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,335
Security to lab three!

188
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,298
Rodney, don't shoot! That's colonel Sheppard!

189
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,966
I'm sorry! I...

190
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,221
You two need some very
serious marriage counseling.

191
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,225
He's not my husband, he's the enemy.
Drop your weapon.

192
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,855
Now radio security and tell them everything is fine.

193
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,191
Everything's not fine.

194
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,111
Rodney?

195
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,030
Security, this is Dr. Rodney McKay.

196
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,032
Everything is fine. Never been better.

197
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,619
- Colonel Caldwell was kidding when
he said what he said...
- Oh, forget it.

198
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,415
This is Dr. Weir.

199
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,917
Attention, all personnel.

200
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:18,298
Colonel Sheppard is not,
I repeat, not who he pretends to be. If you find him,
secure the area and contact me immediately.

201
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,592
I'll deal with him myself.

202
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,772
- Heard there was trouble.
- Yes, major. It's colonel Sheppard. He's not himself.

203
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:38,151
- What exactly does that mean?
- It means he's a threat to the city.
We have to find him. Your team's with me.

204
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,695
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,496
We have a medical emergency in lab three.

206
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,330
You alright?

207
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,623
Stunner blast. I'm fine.

208
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,457
What happened?

209
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,001
She was playing us from the beginning.

210
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,253
- Weir?
- Sheppard too. It's both of 'em now.

211
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,882
Control room, patch my radio
through to security teams only.

212
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,341
This is Caldwell.

213
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,680
Both Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard are under
the influence of alien entities. If at all possible...

214
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,683
subdue and contain them with non-lethal force.

215
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,310
We can track them down faster.

216
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,978
There's a medical team on its way.

217
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,854
Go.

218
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,236
You know,

219
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,656
it would help a lot if
we knew more about what was going on.

220
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,203
Ma'am...

221
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,709
I'm gonna need you to hand over that weapon.

222
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,173
Did it occur to you that colonel Caldwell might
be under the same influence as colonel Sheppard?

223
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:42,466
You weren't there.

224
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,093
Hand over the weapon.

225
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,887
Now.

226
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,140
I guess you leave me no choice.

227
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,045
Report.

228
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,964
We just lost contact with major Lorne.

229
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:26,176
Alright, I want all non-essential
personnel to return directly to their
quarters and remain there until notified.

230
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,428
The only people I want moving through
the city are my security teams.

231
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,971
Yes, sir.

232
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,473
We may be able to track their progress
using the life signs detectors.

233
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,017
How? They'll read as human. You
won't be able to differentiate...

234
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,686
security teams travel in groups of two or more.

235
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,730
They'll be the only individual
signals traveling through the city.

236
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,315
<i>Let's go.</i>

237
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,693
What are you waiting for?

238
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,904
Look, I don't want to get all
"chain of command" on you here, but

239
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,739
I am a senior member of this expedition,

240
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,825
so with Elizabeth and colonel Sheppard
out of the equation, then...

241
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,076
- I'm in charge.
- No, no, no, no.

242
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,162
See, I don't think that's technically true, because
you're here for, what, like, one week out of six?

243
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,791
Is it possible that because I was host
to a Goa'uld, you don't trust me, Doctor?

244
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,667
I didn't say that.

245
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,796
I'm the highest-ranking military officer here,
and this is clearly a military situation.

246
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,631
Does that clear things up for you?

247
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,344
Fine.

248
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,182
Weir to Sheppard.

249
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,059
I'm assuming you can hear me.

250
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,314
Yeah, I can hear you, but if we keep using
these radios, it'll only help them find us.

251
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,524
<i>We don't have much time, Thalan.</i>

252
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,152
The imprinting is temporary,

253
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,821
and these people are gonna try to stop us.

254
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,074
We've got all the time in the world, and
there's only one of them I'm worried about.

255
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,535
<i>We both want a shot at the same thing.</i>

256
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,329
You mean each other.

257
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,625
And neither one of us will get
that chance if you keep running.

258
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,795
Sir, I'm picking up some chatter
I think you'll want to hear.

259
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,255
Put it on speaker.

260
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,549
You're the one who likes to run.

261
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,093
My ship ran out of fuel before
I could even get a clean shot.

262
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,012
That was my plan.

263
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,430
<i>You didn't have a plan.</i>

264
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,598
You just wanted me dead.

265
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:55,641
<i>Still do.</i>

266
00:16:56,099 --> 00:17:01,563
As a matter of fact,
I can't wait to see that look of defeat on your face

267
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,065
just one last time.

268
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,945
You mean the look on my face when you rammed my
fighter, making sure neither one of us would win?

269
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,113
That was hatred, not defeat, Phoebus.

270
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,574
Is that any way to talk to your wife?

271
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,284
Thalan?

272
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,205
Run all you like,

273
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,541
<i>but the moment I find you...</i>

274
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,209
<i>you die.</i>

275
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,045
Well, they're headed straight for divorce.

276
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,463
That whole thing was a ruse.

277
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,341
In fact, I doubt very much if we
were ever speaking with Dr. Weir.

278
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,343
It was a remarkable impression, I'll give you that.

279
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,429
From the sound of it, we have two fighter
pilots who don't know that their war's over.

280
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,265
<i>It is much worse than that.</i>

281
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,225
They know everything about this city...

282
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,644
I mean, the layout, defensive systems,
how to access weapons...

283
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,689
we just need to find a way to stop
them without unduly harming the hosts.

284
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,315
"Unduly"?
What does that mean?

285
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,901
Well, obviously, some force may be necessary.

286
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,782
Contact any teams that may be offworld.

287
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,535
Let them know that we're suspending
all gate activity until further notice.

288
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,162
We're going to full alert status.

289
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,040
I think I just located one
of them near the power room.

290
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,504
Are you kidding?

291
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:02,809
How'd she know?

292
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,144
Intuition.

293
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,730
Alright, we need to split up. I'll
take Sheppard. You go after Weir.

294
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,481
Why?

295
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,484
Because I know how he thinks. I don't
have the slightest clue how she thinks.

296
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,860
Very well.

297
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,114
What happened?

298
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,910
The whole city just went dark.
Tell me you had someone guarding the power room.

299
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,328
Two marines from Daedalus.

300
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,413
Hutchinson, this is Caldwell. Report.

301
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,174
Where's auxiliary power?

302
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,843
Naquadah generators aren't kicking in.

303
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,594
He or she must've damaged the backups.

304
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,554
We've lost everything?

305
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,515
Shields, communications,
long range and biometric sensors...

306
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,809
The sensors from the Daedalus.
If we can contact them...

307
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,061
Subspace communications are also down.

308
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,189
I need you for you to get down to the power
room, Doctor. Restore primary systems.

309
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,858
I should go along, too.
Marines could be hurt.

310
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,527
Exactly. Marines may have been injured.
We can't go down there.

311
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,280
I will send two of my people
along with you, just in case.

312
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,615
How do we know that Sheppard isn't
down there waiting in ambush?

313
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,826
Because he's not trying to kill us.
He's trying to kill Dr. Weir.

314
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,788
- Oh, that is so much more comforting.
- This is not a request, Dr. McKay!

315
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,917
Let me know the moment
you have a damage assessment.

316
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,211
Well, go!

317
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,762
Ronon?

318
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,016
You in there?

319
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:26,852
Ronon?

320
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,896
You there?

321
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,195
<i>Look, I came here looking for you, buddy, so...</i>

322
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,239
<i>don't shoot or you'll ruin my entire plan.</i>

323
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,452
What did Caldwell tell you?

324
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,623
<i>That you're not who you say you are.</i>

325
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,458
Yeah, well, consider the source.

326
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,586
<i>If there are two alien entities</i>
<i>running around, it's him and Weir.</i>

327
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,962
I'm the good guy here.

328
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,131
So who cut the power?

329
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,177
Okay, I admit, that was me.

330
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,261
<i>Why?</i>

331
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,971
I'm just trying to stay alive here.

332
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:08,143
<i>Caldwell is giving the orders, and you're the</i>
<i>only one I can trust not to shoot me on sight.</i>

333
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,229
What about Weir?

334
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,897
<i>Her you can shoot.</i>

335
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:16,693
And by shoot, I mean stun, and
only because she's not herself.

336
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,322
Can you prove you're you?

337
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,074
No, I can't.

338
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,832
- What would Sheppard watch on TV?
<i>- No, that won't work.</i>

339
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:31,792
Why not?

340
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,796
Because if there was an alien consciousness
in my head, he'd know the answer was football.

341
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,008
- But only Sheppard would admit that, so...
<i>- Right.</i>

342
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,304
Look,

343
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,389
just help me

344
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,225
find her before they do.
That's all I'm asking.

345
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,395
Give me the gun.

346
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,648
Can I keep my stunner?

347
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,608
<i>Yeah.</i>

348
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,488
Well, the good news is the ZedPM is still intact.

349
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,573
And the bad?

350
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:49,536
Well, the control systems have been
damaged by some well-placed weapons fire.

351
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,205
How soon till it's operational again?

352
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,290
I just got here. I have no idea.

353
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:54,583
<i>Report when you can.</i>

354
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,379
Alright...

355
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:05,886
She's not here.

356
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:06,845
Keep moving.

357
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,744
Sorry, buddy, plan didn't work.

358
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,373
She got away because all I had
was this stupid little thing.

359
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,587
At least you're out of the way.

360
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,005
You're not...

361
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,341
<i>Not Sheppard, no...</i>

362
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:49,346
but I tell you what, he is screaming
in my head right now like you wouldn't believe.

363
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,433
Medical team to the south port cargo hold.

364
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,185
You have a man down.

365
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,493
Who called in the man down?

366
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,121
I don't know, sir, but it
sounded like colonel Sheppard.

367
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:18,208
Alright, send in a medical team, but tell
them to be careful not to walk into an ambush.

368
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,501
McKay, report, please.

369
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:21,545
Still working.

370
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:25,799
It doesn't have to be pretty, Doctor.
Just get the primary systems up and running again.

371
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,926
Yeah, that is what I'm doing.

372
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:31,847
Instead of running after them with bloody
guns, why don't you try talking to them?

373
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,056
<i>And say what?</i>

374
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,766
I don't know. Just stall them.

375
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,687
We know it's only a matter of time before
Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard are themselves again.

376
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,564
Yeah, I'll take that under advisement, Doctor.

377
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,900
In the meantime, I think you
should return to the infirmary.

378
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,359
I'm sending you a patient.

379
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,527
On my way.

380
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,946
Rodney, I could use some light down there as well.

381
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,698
Yes. Working.

382
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,899
He was unconscious when we found him.

383
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,275
He's been shot.

384
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,445
I can see that, son.
Now go drum us up a few more torches.

385
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,364
Flashlights. Off you go.

386
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,783
Bloody dark ages.

387
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,076
Gloves.

388
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,750
Colonel Caldwell, this is Teyla.

389
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,628
I'm at the base of the central
tower, tracking Dr. Weir.

390
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,421
Understood. I'll send reinforcements.

391
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,215
I can handle Dr. Weir...

392
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,717
but if she is here...

393
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:54,596
Colonel Sheppard is also close by.

394
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,479
Just a little more light over the wound.

395
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,773
Thank you, dear.

396
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,775
Come on.

397
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,695
There it is. You little bugger.

398
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,198
One bullet.

399
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,788
Now to stop the bleeding.

400
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,705
Will you people stop getting in the way?

401
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,758
Go ahead and expend all your ammunition,
just like you did last time!

402
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,302
<i>Your people don't know how to fight, Phoebus.</i>

403
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,930
That's why we're going to win the war!

404
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,683
This war is not over yet!

405
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:35,280
Colonel Caldwell, I'm ready
to attempt a partial power-up.

406
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,657
Give me everything you've got, Doctor.

407
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,660
I have report of automatic weapons fire
and Teyla's not answering her radio.

408
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,744
Here we go.

409
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,549
Of course now they come on.

410
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:58,220
Right, let's get him under a scanner.
I want to make sure I didn't miss any tissue damage.

411
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,347
<i>Lovely work, everyone.</i>

412
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,278
There's more than one way in, Phoebus.

413
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,802
- Now what the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

414
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,471
Sections of the city have begun
automatically sealing themselves off.

415
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,347
Move.

416
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,073
It's not letting me override.

417
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:05,037
Because the moment the power came back up, she used
a remote computer terminal to take control of the city.

418
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,417
She's put us into a total
lockdown under her command code.

419
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:11,502
Can you invalidate her code?

420
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:14,505
Maybe I could have before the lockdown,
but the command's already been given.

421
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,798
Look, somebody should have thought of that?

422
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,800
You mean I should have thought of that?

423
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,094
Can you hack it somehow override her code?

424
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,930
You do know who you're talking to?

425
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,056
So that's a yes?

426
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,558
I'm just saying if anyone can, I can.

427
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,434
I helped design the system.

428
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,769
Then do it, please.

429
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,312
Alright, but I'm using my command code.

430
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,022
Why, because you still don't trust me?

431
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:35,943
No, because it is a 16-digit
alphanumeric code that I will have to enter

432
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,987
God knows how many times and
I haven't got around to memorizing yours yet.

433
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,783
Just get me control of the city back.

434
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,535
Fine.

435
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,623
Caldwell, can you hear me?

436
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:50,874
Go ahead.

437
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,044
<i>By now you're aware the city</i>
<i>is entirely under my control,</i>

438
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:58,382
and there are several bulkhead doors
between me and your nearest search team.

439
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,467
<i>You can't possibly get to me.</i>

440
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:02,678
Yes, we're well aware.

441
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:07,057
<i>I'm sure Dr. McKay believes he can override</i>
<i>my command code, and it's possible.</i>

442
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,520
In a matter of several hours, he could,
but I don't have that kind of time.

443
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,106
We'd be more than happy to wait this out.

444
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:20,487
Who knows what kind of trouble I could
cause with life support while I wait.

445
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,323
Or maybe I'll just send
a signal to the Wraith

446
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,491
like you did.

447
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:27,661
What do you want?

448
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,747
I want Sheppard.

449
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,042
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you with that,
Is there something else I can do for you?

450
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,171
Don't screw with me, Caldwell,
at the very least, I can kill Weir.

451
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,551
When you get him, contact me.

452
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,970
<i>Colonel Caldwell.</i>

453
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:50,559
We have three signals on two separate
floors at the base of the tower.

454
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:54,313
Weir has to be the one in the science lab,
which leaves these other two over here.

455
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,689
The other one is Teyla.

456
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,983
And the other one has to be Sheppard.

457
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,943
<i>Teyla, this is Caldwell.</i>

458
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,156
I was unable to capture Dr. Weir.

459
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,157
<i>So were a lot of people.</i>

460
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,534
<i>Weir's put the city under a lockdown.</i>
<i>I want you to go after Sheppard.</i>

461
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,704
<i>You and he have been locked into</i>
<i>the same section. He's one floor up.</i>

462
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,501
I will contact you as soon as I have him.
Teyla out.

463
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,132
Is this what you wanted, Phoebus?

464
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,301
Another stalemate?

465
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,803
I thought you wanted to finish this.

466
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,847
<i>What's wrong, Thalan?</i>

467
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,557
<i>You can't get out?</i>

468
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,159
This is Teyla.

469
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,744
I have colonel Sheppard.

470
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:53,539
Good work, Secure him and
stand by for further instructions.

471
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,832
The next move is hers.

472
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,803
Caldwell, do you have him or not?

473
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,888
<i>I'm losing patience.</i>

474
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,181
I'm working.

475
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,307
We're working on it.

476
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,851
<i>I don't buy it, Colonel.</i>

477
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,352
Well, I'm telling the truth.

478
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,854
Oh, please.

479
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,314
Even Weir thinks you're hopeless.

480
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,983
She can't hide it.

481
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,235
We're close.

482
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,320
We're not close.

483
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:34,913
I have found an interesting way of rerouting your
new halon fire suppression system all the way
from hazmat storage to personnel quarters.

484
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,128
<i>Now, that's where the majority of</i>
<i>your city's population is holed up, isn't it?</i>

485
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:42,963
You know it is.

486
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:49,011
Ironically, Dr. Weir was concerned when
the system was installed that halon gas

487
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:52,848
extinguishes people as well as fires.

488
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,141
<i>So...</i>

489
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:58,228
<i>shall we take it to the point that I start</i>
<i>counting down from an arbitrary number?</i>

490
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:04,526
We have him.

491
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:07,404
I thought you might.

492
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:14,203
There's a new security camera in the
northern most stairwell of that part of the tower.
I want him taken there so that I can see him.

493
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,205
Kicking and screaming, if possible.

494
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:21,001
Teyla, we've been requested to put the
colonel in front of the nearest security camera.

495
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,545
I'm doing that right now, Colonel.

496
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,136
I'm not surprised that you're the
only one that managed to get to him.

497
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,391
What do you want?

498
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,186
We're just going to wait
until he regains consciousness.

499
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,024
Are you making any progress?

500
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,192
Yes.

501
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:46,777
Really?

502
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,071
I would just like to state for the record

503
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,157
that it is astounding to me that once
again I find myself in the position

504
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,409
of having to save this city when you and your

505
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,079
space marines can't figure
out how to track down two people.

506
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,292
They're two people with the skills and resources of
Dr. Weir and colonel Sheppard, who probably
know this city better than anyone else,

507
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:05,337
and also for the record, I was
against this from the very beginning.

508
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,505
Yes...

509
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:08,549
yes, you were.

510
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,510
Thank you. Please, continue.

511
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,642
He is regaining consciousness.

512
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,774
Teyla, it's me.

513
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:32,698
Do not waste your breath trying
to convince me you are John Sheppard.

514
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,157
I do not believe you.

515
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,450
Don't you see what they're doing?

516
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,995
They're pitting us against each other.
You know me.

517
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,246
<i>Oh, please.</i>

518
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,290
<i>You call that acting?</i>

519
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,001
Phoebus.

520
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,381
There's that look of defeat I love.

521
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,259
Sir, I have colonel Sheppard on my screen.

522
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:53,927
<i>Wrong again.</i>

523
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,304
Still hatred.

524
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,431
I guess I'm satisfied with this.

525
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,391
Teyla?

526
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,020
Yes?

527
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:04,688
Kill him.

528
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,779
Don't listen to her.

529
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:18,202
Kill him now, or I vent halon fire suppressant
into all the living spaces in Atlantis.

530
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,829
- McKay?
- I know, I know. I'm almost done here.

531
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:23,290
<i>Colonel, can she do this?</i>

532
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:23,832
Yes.

533
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,753
She's created a shunt between the fire
suppressant system and life support.

534
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,172
<i>I believe so.</i>

535
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,174
How many people are at risk?

536
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,843
<i>Three-quarters of the expedition.</i>

537
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,766
Why are you doing this?

538
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:46,021
I have spent my entire life
at war with his world.

539
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,192
Thousands have died with no hope for victory,

540
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:54,154
both sides reduced to a mere handful of fighters.

541
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,658
If he really is the last...

542
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,912
then in the end, my people will have won.

543
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,207
Don't believe her.

544
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:09,336
Believe me when I say I have
absolutely nothing to lose.

545
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:14,049
In a very short time, I will feel
excruciating pain, this body will convulse,

546
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,094
and I will cease to exist.

547
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,139
That's what is ahead for me.

548
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:26,228
All I can hope for now is
to achieve victory for my people.

549
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:30,482
Phoebus, your people are long dead.

550
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:34,278
Who lost or won a war so many
years ago it does not matter.

551
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,823
It matters to me.

552
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,787
If you kill me...

553
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,164
you kill him.

554
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,795
He cares for you more than you know.

555
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,469
- Please do not make me do this.
- You don't have to.

556
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:04,766
Shoot him, or I release the gas and
just hope it reaches the both of you.

557
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,021
<i>She has the capability</i>
<i>of doing what she claims.</i>

558
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,230
Teyla...

559
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,111
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

560
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:17,779
<i>I am.</i>

561
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:19,865
Kill him.

562
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,269
Sheppard doesn't believe you'll do it.

563
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:57,986
Forgive me, John.

564
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,448
I've got it!

565
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,741
I'm overriding her code now.

566
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:03,450
Are you sure?

567
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:04,451
It's done! Go!

568
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:08,163
Teyla, this is Caldwell. Do not fire.
I repeat, do not fire.

569
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,636
Can you maintain the lockdown in
the science lab, keep Weir where she is?

570
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,638
Nope. The only way to do it was to override everything.

571
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,849
Nobody's in control now.
She is long gone.

572
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,976
All security teams, this is Caldwell.

573
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,311
<i>Resume your search for Dr. Weir.</i>

574
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,230
Teyla!

575
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:34,773
Come on.

576
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,193
You can't leave me like this.

577
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,864
I will not let her harm you.

578
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:45,701
You don't know how determined she is.

579
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:51,790
You can't let her win.

580
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,628
He is going into convulsions.

581
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,547
Do not release him,
no matter what happens.

582
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,861
Teyla?

583
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,488
Is that really you?

584
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,533
You're never going to believe me, so...

585
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,328
I'm not even gonna try.

586
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,832
Stand away from him
and up against the wall.

587
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,502
He is unconscious.

588
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:41,840
I don't know how many bullets I have left
in this thing, or I would have already shot you.

589
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,259
I said back off!

590
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,232
Unconscious or not...

591
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,360
I want to see his face.

592
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,334
You alright?

593
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,460
Yes.

594
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,419
It is over.

595
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:22,756
Sorry we took so long. We got
stuck in that damn corridor for two hours.

596
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,467
Call a medical team and have
them both taken to the infirmary.

597
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,260
You got it.

598
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,720
This is Lorne.
I need a medical team to my location, now...

599
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:32,099
- How'd you know it was me?
- I still do not.

600
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,061
Keep his hands bound until
Dr. Beckett tells you otherwise.

601
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,190
If you didn't know,
why'd you give me the stunner?

602
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:44,570
Because you would have shot her either way.

603
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,458
Good morning.

604
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,007
Good morning.

605
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:09,511
What's-her-name
sure hung in there for a while.

606
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:10,637
When did she...

607
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,598
Sometime in the middle of the night,

608
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,641
kicking and screaming.

609
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,897
That... that was...

610
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,817
the strangest feeling, no?

611
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:29,781
The entire time, I was shouting to everyone, but
nothing I wanted to would come out of my mouth.

612
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:30,949
I know.

613
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:32,659
It was a real nightmare.

614
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,703
Especially when you shot Ronon.

615
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,873
- Oh, God, but I wasn't...
- I know. I know.

616
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,541
It was her.

617
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,210
How is he?

618
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,711
He's fine.

619
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,631
Teyla and Rodney just went
to see him in post-op.

620
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,426
Did they believe you were...

621
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,719
you?

622
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,721
To be honest,

623
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,724
I think the only people
who believe 100% are Beckett...

624
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,101
you...

625
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:00,896
<i>And me.</i>

626
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,025
In fact, I can safely say that I know how you feel.

627
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,194
Yes, sir.

628
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,279
Thank you, Colonel,

629
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:12,491
for keeping a potentially explosive
situation under control.

630
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,744
Yeah, well, it was a lot closer
than I would like to admit.

631
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,955
For what it's worth...

632
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,792
- McKay says you did a good job.
- Did he?

633
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,126
Well...

634
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,838
maybe there's still hope for me yet.

635
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,339
Oh, God, no.

636
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,008
- Don't believe anything she might have said...
- I'm kidding.

637
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,844
Don't give it another thought.

638
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:37,057
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm sure you'll
both agree that the paperwork on
this is going to be a nightmare.

639
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,143
Especially that kiss.

640
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,397
Yes, sir.

641
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,150
Well, try not to kill each other while I'm gone.
