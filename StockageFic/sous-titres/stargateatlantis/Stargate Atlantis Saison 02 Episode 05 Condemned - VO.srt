1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,636
Look familiar?

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,803
No.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,347
Me either.

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,557
I do not believe I have been to this planet before.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,519
There's no sign of any settlements,
or at least nothing recent.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,480
Other than the smoke from that camp fire.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,776
Oh,

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,069
yes well,

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,612
other than that.

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,408
I'll land within a few hundred yards

11
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,592
It's primitive, definitely primitive.

12
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,011
Probably not even worth making contact.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,888
What is that smell?

14
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,106
- It appears they left in a hurry.
- They're not used to friendlies coming out of the Gate.

15
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,818
<i>What are you?</i>

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh my God, he's tasting it!
You don't know what that is.
That could be their laundry!

17
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,157
Pretty good.

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:20,289
Oh yes, good idea. And when you're finished
with their porridge, why don't we try their beds.

19
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,624
Want some?

20
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,587
- How good is it?
- Leave it be Goldilocks.

21
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,426
<i>Take cover!</i>

22
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,816
<i>What the hell's in those sling shots?</i>

23
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,947
You alright?

24
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,199
Fine!

25
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,164
You know this is not
the way to make new friends!

26
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,793
But we'll leave if you want us to!

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,382
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's go back to the Jumper. Teyla you're on point.

28
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,093
- I'll take the six. McKay help Ronan.
- Don't worry about me.

29
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,971
I'm a worrier. Let the man give you a hand.

30
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,683
Fire!

31
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,766
Alright move, move!!

32
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,663
- Everyone in one piece?
- Yeah, thanks to that ship.

33
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,873
Be still.

34
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,708
Yeah, I like their timing.

35
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,252
- No kidding, you see that thing?
- Yeah, I saw that thing.

36
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,670
<i>Unidentified ship.</i>

37
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,508
<i>This is the security vessel Borus.</i>
<i>Follow us immediately and we will lead you to the city.</i>

38
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,093
<i>Understood Borus.</i>

39
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,053
<i>Thanks for the help back there.</i>

40
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,265
That's how you make new friends.

Saison 2 - Episode 5
Condemned

44
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,087
Welcome to Olesia.

45
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,547
I am Marin.

46
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,549
Lt Col. John Sheppard,

47
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,052
Teyla Emmagan, Dr Rodney McKay,

48
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,428
Ronon Dex.

49
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,264
Please, follow me.

50
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,770
I sent a security detachment as soon as
we detected your presence on the island.

51
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,732
- The prisoners there can be quite hostile.
- Yeah, we definitely got off on the wrong foot.

52
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,069
- Prisoners?
- Yes. The island is a penal colony.

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,238
The prisoners usually don't cause much trouble,

54
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,908
- as long as you don't try to land there.
- You could put up a sign.

55
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,830
The stargate is on the island. Does this
not affect your ability to trade with other worlds?

56
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,332
Yes of course.

57
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,085
As a result we have needed to be
almost entirely self sufficient.

58
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,795
Then why put a prison there?

59
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:59,466
I believe the Magistrate is better suited to
answer these questions. He's very eager to meet you.

60
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,678
<i>Your ship is a most intriguing design.</i>

61
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:09,393
I must admit I'm surprised to find others
in this galaxy who's technology rivals our own.

62
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:14,481
- Aside from the Wraith, I mean.
- It's funny. I was about to make the exact same comment.

63
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,149
Where do you come from?

64
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,193
Until recently,

65
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,987
Atlantis.

66
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,030
- The Ancestral city.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,409
Unfortunately it was destroyed
by the Wraith a short time ago.

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,035
How tragic.

69
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,538
Yeah, we're pretty broken up about it.

70
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,000
We are a part of a small group
of people that were able to escape.

71
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,085
- How fortunate for you.
- Yes, yes, yes, very fortunate.

72
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:40,215
Look, getting back to the technology thing. I'm just
curious. How have you been able to make such
advancements without the Wraith stepping in?

73
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,969
The Wraith have chosen to leave us alone.

74
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,097
Why?

75
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,849
I don't know.

76
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,517
They never come here?

77
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,395
The Wraith have been here many times.

78
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:58,233
But with the Ancestral ring on the island,
the Wraith have always been,

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,113
how should I put this,
satiated with the prisoners living there.

80
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,658
The Wraith have no need to venture any further.

81
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,620
Well that would explain why you put the prison there.

82
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,079
The island

83
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,416
has been a penal colony for hundreds of years.

84
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,212
It's location there has benefited my people greatly.

85
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,714
- Not all your people.
- I assure you.

86
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,884
Only the most violent criminals are sent there.

87
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,968
As...

88
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,553
you've discovered.

89
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,850
- It's a good crime deterrent.
- Crime...

90
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,021
is virtually non-existant on Olesia.

91
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,943
Unlike the prisoners,
we pride ourselves on being a most hospitable

92
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,153
and civilized people.

93
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:51,620
This section of the city is
devoted to scientific research.

94
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:59,127
Our scientists have recently attained success in
the enrichment of a fissionable, yet non radioactive,
material to be used in generating power to the city.

95
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,340
Fissionable, yet non radioactive. Well that, that,
that, that, is that even possible? What kind of materials?

96
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,758
It's an ore.

97
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:11,640
They extract it from a mineral found on our planet.
It's quite volatile and yields great promise.
I'd be very happy to show you the laboratory.

98
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,225
I'd be very happy to see it.

99
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,227
I'd be very happy to go back to our ship.

100
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,355
Our people are due to check in with us
in a little while over the radio.

101
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,982
We'll have to get back within range.

102
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,442
You can link with one of our radio relay stations.

103
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,696
There should be enough power to reach
the island, if that's your concern.

104
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,366
- So we'll be speaking privately?
- Of course!

105
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,000
And you believe they might be willing
to share some of this mineral?

106
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,212
<i>Well, they seem open to it. They don't getlmany trading opportunities coming through the Gate.</i>

107
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,547
Sounds promising.

108
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,594
There is however, the minor
moral hiccup of their form of capital punishment.

109
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,013
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- They have an island.</i>

110
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,932
It's their own version of Alcatraz,
where they send the worst criminals.

111
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>And the Gate is on the island so...</i>

112
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,104
So the Wraith feed on the prisoners.

113
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,314
<i>Yep.</i>

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,566
Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.

115
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,403
I prefer lethal injection, although I do
have a certain fondness for the electric chair.

116
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,988
Call me romantic.

117
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,617
The Wraith get what they want
and the Olesians get left alone.

118
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,118
I'm surprised it works.

119
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,542
He did however say
that only the most violent criminals get sent there
and that it has been this way for hundreds of years.

120
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,045
Do you kill all of your violent criminals, on Earth?

121
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,631
Certain countries. Yes.

122
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,758
Do we need to get into this right now?

123
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,594
<i>Well we do if we plan</i>
<i>on doing business with these people.</i>

124
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,805
I wanna know more before I jump to any conclusions.

125
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,145
- We were able to speak with our people. Thank you.
-  Of course!

126
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,441
If you're open to it, we'd like
to discuss possible trade opportunities.

127
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,193
We are very open.

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,154
I'm sure that there is much that
we can learn from each other.

129
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:54,076
Well, Doctor Elizabeth Weir will be the one to begin
official negotiations with you. That's really her thing.

130
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,036
I'm looking forward to meeting her,

131
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,454
and the start

132
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,915
of a promising friendship.

133
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,588
<i>Seriously.</i>

134
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,260
- Aren't you a little creeped out by that guy?
- They're politician's Rodney. They're all creepy.

135
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,687
Prepare to fire?

136
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,234
Margaret Thatcher wasn't creepy.

137
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,777
Although, maybe a little.

138
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:35,075
She resembled an Aunt of mine.
Same hairstyle, facial structure.
Only my Aunt was much taller and remarkably hirsute.

139
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,870
Oddest thing. She had to shave twice a day.

140
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,162
Fire!!

141
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,668
What was that?

142
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,754
- They're shooting at us.
- The prisoners?

143
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,590
- With what?
- Cloak the ship.

144
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,302
I can't, we took some damage.
We'll be lucky to make it to the Gate.

145
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,929
- How close are we?
- Close enough to dial.

146
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,856
- That was close.
- Get ready to send an IDC.

147
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,529
I've lost control systems, hang on!

148
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,829
Have at them!!

149
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,149
- Are you alright?
- I think I chipped a tooth.

150
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,319
Did I chip a tooth? Cos I'm bleeding.
Cos I'm a high risk for endocarditus.

151
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,530
John.

152
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,365
That was...

153
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,535
not one of my better landings. Sorry.

154
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,162
The Gate should still be active for a few minutes.

155
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,705
Alright,

156
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,249
let's go.

157
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,527
Hi folks.

158
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,489
I hope I didn't crash land on anybody.

159
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,834
You should know our people are expecting us.

160
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,213
If we don't show up soon,
they'll come looking for us.

161
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,673
Is that supposed to concern me?

162
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,218
Don't go getting all full of yourself, Chief.

163
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,931
A few canons are no match for the kind
of fire power they'll be bringing with them.

164
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,390
Although,

165
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,393
I should compliment whoever took that first shot.

166
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,104
- It was a good one.
- Yeah, it was nice wasn't it?

167
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,814
What do you want from us?

168
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,734
Well, we've already got your weapons,

169
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,694
<i>now I do believe we'll take your ship.</i>

170
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:02,282
See, we had been planning a little trip
to the mainland, but after seeing you
fly that thing through the Ancestral ring.

171
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,743
You're referring to the ship you just shot down!

172
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,621
One that doesn't stand
a hope in hell of every flying again!

173
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,665
The ship that you're gonna fix, yes.

174
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,584
What am I, MacGyver?
Fix it with what?

175
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,671
Get him up.

176
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,677
You seem like a smart man.
I'm sure you'll think of something.

177
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,762
Maybe all you need is a little motivation.

178
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,399
Maybe you should think about fixing it Rodney.

179
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,737
Good idea.

180
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,074
My friends all tell me
I have a remarkable gift for persuasion.

181
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,707
What happened?

182
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,917
Gate activated. Nothing came through.

183
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,878
- Colonel Sheppard?
- So we assumed.

184
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,379
We received no IDC.

185
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,715
A few moments later, Gate shuts down.

186
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,717
They should have returned by now.

187
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,179
Dial the planet and try to establish a radio link.

188
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,388
Yes ma'am.

189
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,225
Major Lorne? This is Weir.

190
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,602
<i>Go ahead.</i>

191
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:16,857
I may have to go offworld to assist Colonel Sheppard.
I'd like you to assemble a team and
have a Puddle Jumper ready to go.

192
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,066
<i>Yes Ma'am.</i>

193
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,378
- Anyone having any luck?
- Not yet.

194
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,172
These bindings are very secure.

195
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,509
Well, leave it to convicts to know
the best way to tie people up.

196
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,221
Well, eventually I will get free and
when I do, he's gonna pay for this.

197
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,683
Well, listen to me. When you get free,
you get us free and we all get outta here.

198
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,268
Let him find out we're gone,

199
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,353
after

200
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,813
- we're gone.
- You expect me to let them get away with this?

201
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,149
- The operative words are get away.
- After I kill him.

202
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,069
- That type of thinking will get US killed.
- Well if you would return fire!

203
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,696
- The weapons systems were damaged!
- If you say so.

204
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:09,076
I do say so and right now I'm saying knock it off.

205
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,704
Is that an order, Sheppard?

206
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,834
I am beat up, tied up

207
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,337
and couldn't order a pizza right now if I wanted to.

208
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,798
But if you need it to be, yeah!

209
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,424
It's an order.

210
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,887
OK.

211
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:39,690
There is no power getting to any of these controls!
Do you understand? Look, nuthin'!

212
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,524
Why not?

213
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,652
Let me go out on a limb here and say maybe
it had something to do with the crash?

214
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,905
Which of course begs the question,
how the hell did you get your hands on explosives?

215
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,699
Eldon made them.

216
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:53,328
He fashioned a composite out of minerals and
materials he found around the island.

217
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,124
Crude yes, but effective.
We shot you down, didn't we?

218
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,419
- Eldon. Who's Eldon?
- That would be me.

219
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,798
You're a prisoner?

220
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,218
- I was accused of killing one man.
And it was a case of mistaken identity.
<i>- He's a scientist.</i>

221
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,638
Tell you what Eldon, you can tell him
your whole life story. Just help him fix the ship.

222
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,310
Look, I don't know what you expect me to do.
I don't have any of the proper diagnostic tools,
not to mention the fact that...

223
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,395
You'll figure it out.

224
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,147
And if I don't?

225
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,025
Well, I can kill ya.

226
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:31,700
But you strike me as the type of man who,
despite being weak and cowardly on the outside, harbours
a strength of character he doesn't even know he has.

227
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,162
I'm sorry. Was there a compliment in there?

228
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,457
See, the way to motivate a man like you Mr McKay,

229
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,375
is not to threaten your life,

230
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,711
it is to threaten the lives of your friends.

231
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,047
That's right.

232
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,007
Fix the ship.

233
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,552
Otherwise, they start dying one after another,

234
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,930
until you change your mind.

235
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,556
Or until they're all dead.

236
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,308
I don't care.

237
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:13,951
All set?

238
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,285
Ready to go.

239
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,495
It's nothing.

240
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,999
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- I was hoping to negotiate a trade agreement.

241
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,919
Now I'm worry I'll have to negotiate their release.

242
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,629
We don't know that.

243
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,845
Dial the Gate,
but go to stealth mode the moment we're through.

244
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,998
The technology on this ship
is far more advanced than the Olesian's.

245
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,710
How ironic then to have been shot down
by the cast of Braveheart!

246
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,297
I was surprised we were able to shoot you down.

247
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,008
This is the old low tech
versus high tech argument, I suppose?

248
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,260
We've been working on those weapons for years.

249
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,928
Yes well, well done! Good for them...

250
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,723
Now are you going to continue talking or...

251
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,101
Thank you.

252
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,484
Oh give me that!

253
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,695
See, where did that come from?

254
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,972
Those canons.

255
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,183
- Your design?
- No, no, no, no.

256
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:06,522
Well, I chose the material and
helped calculate trajectories.

257
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,317
The ignition mechanisms

258
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,653
and the fuses, of course.

259
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,741
But most of my efforts
went into fashioning the explosive shots.

260
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,034
Ah explosives.

261
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,911
Is that how you killed the man?

262
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,706
I didn't kill him.
I'm innocent, I don't belong here.

263
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,582
Really?

264
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:28,585
I wonder if there's ever been
a convicted felon who didn't claim he was innocent?

265
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:33,131
I don't care if you don't believe me.
I just want off this island.

266
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,050
Oh no.

267
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,179
What is it?

268
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,516
I assume there's no DHD beside the stargate?

269
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:47,312
The Ancestral ring.
Is there some kind of dialling device that turns it on?

270
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,147
No. Nothing.

271
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,609
Oh, of course,
why give the prisoners such an obvious means of escape.

272
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,194
What's wrong?

273
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,032
The main power distribution conduit's been damaged.

274
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:04,788
That effectively cuts all the power to primary systems.
Drive pods, cockpit controls, DHD.

275
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,623
Can you fix it?

276
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,376
Easily, if I had a replacement.

277
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,254
Without one, you and
your friends aren't going anywhere.

278
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,589
Neither are you.

279
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,008
If you don't fix this ship,

280
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:21,471
Torrell's gonna make sure you're the first
the Wraith find at the next culling.

281
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,767
Choose.

282
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,145
Choose what?

283
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,063
Which one of them dies first...

284
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:31,940
Do it!

285
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,612
- I can't do that.
- Well then, I'll choose for you.

286
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,073
Either way, one of them dies unless you
change your mind about fixing that ship.

287
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,451
Well I'm sorry,
but there are some things beyond my capability.

288
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,661
- I don't believe you.
- Well, I know it is hard to believe, but....

289
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:48,665
- No I mean, I think you're lying.
- I'm not. It's broken. You don't understand, broken?

290
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,918
I know your type.

291
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,128
You whine and you complain

292
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,882
and you see to it that your every task
is viewed as some impossible achievement.

293
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:01,637
So that when you do succeed, your gargantuan
efforts are viewed as all the more heroic.

294
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,931
<i>That may be true in some cases,</i>
<i>but this is not one of them.</i>

295
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,266
You are asking me to do the impossible!

296
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,144
Your friends lives are in your hands.

297
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,730
I'll give you some time to choose.

298
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,000
Listen to him, McKay.

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,214
He's killed eleven people. Eight before he was
sent here and three since he's been on the island.

300
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:38,507
So eleven...?

301
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,969
You've got some catching up to do, don't you?
He's only killed one.

302
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,595
Who him?

303
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,056
I told you I'm here because of a mistake.

304
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,767
I'm sure everyone here on this island says that.

305
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,854
Well as a matter of fact, some of us are innocent.

306
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,232
Only a few like Torrell are actual murderers.

307
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,734
You mean they put all their criminals here?

308
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,403
Regardless of the crimes they commit?

309
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,364
Once, only the worst of the worst were sent in here.

310
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:08,662
But the punishment proved to be such a successful
deterrent, that crime rates in Olesia plummeted.

311
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,124
Which meant fewer and fewer prisoners.

312
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,626
Less food for the Wraith.

313
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,044
<i>Exactly.</i>

314
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,630
So they lowered the bar.

315
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,137
They have not returned to the planet?

316
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,183
No, and we haven't been able
to establish radio contact with them either.

317
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:34,438
They didn't return to the city. Perhaps
they travelled through the ring to another planet?

318
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,148
No, they would have radioed first.

319
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,317
Something must have happened on the island.

320
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,611
I'll alert our security teams.
Have them begin a search.

321
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,612
We'll join them.

322
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,907
- I would advise against that.
- Would you?

323
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,285
The island is extremely dangerous.

324
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,412
Our ships are heavily armoured.

325
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,999
We know the terrain as well as the prisoners tactics.

326
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,586
- Don't worry, we'll find them.
- I hope you do Magistrate.

327
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,755
For all our sakes.

328
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,965
Of course.

329
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,603
I think they're loosening.

330
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,318
Take it easy Chewie.
You're gonna cut your damn hands off.

331
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,780
The more we struggle, the tighter the bindings get.

332
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,341
- You need something like this.
- What about the guards?

333
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,968
They stepped away. No-one's watching.

334
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,678
Will you help us?

335
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,846
If you'll help me.

336
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:49,847
How?

337
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,474
Fix the ship.
Let me leave with you.

338
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,768
Oh for God's sake!
How many times do I have to tell you?

339
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,436
I know you can do it.

340
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,690
I could see in your eyes when you were working.
You were holding something back from us.

341
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,983
Rodney?

342
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,860
Nobody could fix it.

343
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:08,156
I don't care who you think I am,
or what you think you saw in my eyes,
but it is totally, completely impossible.

344
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,410
- Torrell and his men are gonna return soon.
- He'll fix it!

345
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,289
- I just said I couldn't!
- You really suck at lying, Rodney!

346
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,332
We have a deal.

347
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:25,174
- There is one SLIGHT possibility.
- See?

348
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,677
I won't actually be able to fix
the ship to fly out of here, but I might be able to...

349
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,305
cobble together enough power from
the secondary systems to activate the DHD.

350
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,724
That way we could dial the Gate and leave on foot.

351
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,350
<i>When I say might, I mean probably not.</i>

352
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,645
It's a long shot at best.
I'd have to bypass the main power distribut...

353
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,439
Get us outta here!

354
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,068
What are you doing?

355
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,030
Give me one reason why I shouldn't cut your throat!

356
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,033
For one, it would make a mess.

357
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:52,784
<i>Look,</i>

358
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,453
we made a deal.

359
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,288
Just let him go.

360
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,052
Careful!

361
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,512
<i>Suck it up!</i>

362
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,165
Why are we stopping?

363
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,668
This is way too easy.

364
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,378
Alright, stay close

365
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,296
and stay quiet.

366
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:47,673
What?

367
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,466
Why does he say that to me?

368
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,695
I didn't know anything about this,
I swear.

369
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,030
We'll never be able to make it to the Jumper.
They have our weapons!

370
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,031
We don't need weapons.

371
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,908
What about the fact
that they seriously outnumber us?

372
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,661
At least we got the element of surprise.

373
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,789
I was beginning to think you were afraid to fight.

374
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:24,501
No. I'm just naturally lazy,
but I will if I have to,

375
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,004
and it's starting to look like we have to.

376
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,757
How much time do you
need to rework the DHD?

377
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,467
Well in a perfect world, two days.

378
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,846
- Rodney!
- Right now... ten minutes give or take.

379
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:39,057
<i>Alright, we need to create a diversion.</i>
<i>We're gonna split up and flank them.</i>

380
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,896
Get them looking everywhere except the Jumper.
Hopefully we can buy enough time
to steal back our weapons.

381
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,942
- Or we can just dial the Gate?
- They fixed the DHD?

382
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,529
- That's impossible.
- I don't think they're the one's who dialled it.

383
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,617
Get down!

384
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,414
- It didn't see us.
<i>- If it saw us, it didn't care.</i>

385
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,792
<i>- Why not?</i>
<i>{Y:i}- Who cares, they left the Jumper.</i>

386
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,879
I'm afraid the news is not good.

387
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:13,800
Our rescue teams had just begun the search
on the island, when the Ancestral ring activated.

388
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,968
The Wraith?

389
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,638
It appears a culling is underway.

390
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:21,725
We're not sure how many ships are involved,
but our teams were forced to fall back.

391
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:25,687
I'm not giving up hope.
I'll send teams back in the moment the Wraith are gone.

392
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:29,983
Hopefully, your friends will have evaded the culling.
I must attend to this.

393
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:51,296
I apologize for my tardiness.
I had an urgent matter to attend to.

394
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,050
A matter which could ultimately benefit us both.

395
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,844
In that case,

396
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,890
apology accepted.

397
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,026
Exceptional as always.

398
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:17,281
I think this is my favourite vintage yet.

399
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:22,160
I hope you find the food acceptable as well.
My new Chef is quite accomplished.

400
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,620
I certainly hope so.

401
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:31,587
Your previous chef unfortunately proved to be
far more appetizing than the meals he prepared.

402
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,720
I must admit,

403
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,724
I still find it intriguing
to watch you eat actual food.

404
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,268
Our lineage may have diverged,

405
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,605
but there are those of us who still retain

406
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,983
an appreciation for finer things.

407
00:28:54,985 --> 00:29:03,744
And although it may provide moments
of pleasure, it does not sustain me.

408
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,497
This arrangement I have made

409
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,586
with you and your predecessors,
has served both of us well.

410
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:19,468
While others of my kind have been
forced to sleep between cullings,

411
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:26,475
I have enjoyed a steady stream
of humans for my consumption.

412
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:31,855
And the taste of their defiance is sweet.

413
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:35,067
You in return have been allowed to live in peace.

414
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,109
And we thank you for that.

415
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:45,494
But throughout the galaxy, hives continue
to wake in far greater numbers than are sustainable

416
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:49,831
and with a hunger that is most pressing.

417
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:55,420
I assure you that I have put measures in place
to augment the population on the island.

418
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:59,466
Then why is it there are
even fewer inhabitants on the island?

419
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:04,847
My kind would have destroyed your entire planet,

420
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:08,308
but I am more civilized than that.

421
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,768
Thank you for your generosity.

422
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,811
<i>Still,</i>

423
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,606
there are interests which must be served.

424
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,359
<i>There are many Wraith who hunger</i>

425
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:20,988
and I have promised to provide for them.

426
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:25,200
The decision you are now faced with is,

427
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,495
on whom shall we feed?

428
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,123
Your needs shall be met.

429
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,542
You have my promise.

430
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,210
Good.

431
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,423
I would hate to see anything happen to you.

432
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,761
I do so enjoy our dinners together.

433
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:53,770
The Dart went back through the Gate.

434
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,523
- Do you not know why it did not cull anyone?
- Maybe he did.

435
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,359
He headed for the mainland when he first came through.

436
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,570
Alright, keep watch.

437
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,031
How's it coming Rodney?

438
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,909
Slower than I expected,
but faster than humanly possible!

439
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,204
Any chance of getting
the cloaking generator powered up too?

440
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,706
Could really come in handy right about now.

441
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,626
OK and how about have a snack?
Maybe you'd like me to make you a nice sandwich?

442
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,252
Only if it's humanly possible.

443
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:23,634
It'll be a miracle if I get the DHD back online,
let alone the cloaking generator. If I can
manage that, the power will be intermittent at best.

444
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,595
OK, well,

445
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:31,767
FYI the Wraith have all gone. So it's just
a matter of time before Torrell and his boys return

446
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,977
with all of our weapons!

447
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:34,937
I get it!

448
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,855
Good!

449
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:46,615
Marin?

450
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,119
What's happened?

451
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,372
No-one must know I'm speaking to you.

452
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,248
Of course.

453
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:57,376
You should leave as soon as possible.

454
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,253
Why?

455
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:04,132
The Magistrate has just rescinded my orders
to send rescue teams back to the island.

456
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,342
What?

457
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,636
Why would he do that?

458
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,764
Several arrests have been made.

459
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:17,062
Many people in the city have been apprehended
for unspecified violations, to be sent to the island
to increase the population there.

460
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,856
To keep the Wraith fed.

461
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:22,234
This has been going on for some time,
but never so bad as this.

462
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,361
The number of arrests is...

463
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,281
I cannot keep quiet any longer,
I have to speak out!

464
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,490
<i>Lies!</i>

465
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:35,747
Seeding fear not only among our own people,
but now our guests?

466
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,374
I cannot allow it.

467
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:41,086
I was only trying to understand
why so many people are being arrested.

468
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:45,716
Your job is not to question
the actions of this government.

469
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,177
No! Wait!

470
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,887
Help me, please!

471
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,890
- Where are they taking her?
- I'm sorry, you had to witness that.

472
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,142
What crime has she committed?

473
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,978
I have recently learned that Marin

474
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,690
has been involved in a group seeking
to undermine the Olesian Government.

475
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:06,236
She has become very adept at spinning lies
to suit her organization's treasonable agenda.

476
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:10,657
Did you or did you not rescind the order
to send rescue teams back to the island?

477
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,491
Why would I do that?

478
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:16,079
That doesn't concern me. My first concern is
with the safety of my people and I promise you, if...

479
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:25,506
Everything is being done to ensure
their rescue and safe return. If there has been
any hindrance at all, it was because of Marin.

480
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:27,633
What's going to happen to her now?

481
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,385
She'll receive a fair trial in our courts.

482
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,804
And then what?
Sent to the island?

483
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,765
I'm sure where you come from,

484
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:37,935
treason is also considered a very serious offence.

485
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,937
So that's a yes.

486
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:44,650
Tell me, what else is considered
a serious offence around here?

487
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,859
Anything

488
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,071
that threatens the welfare of the Olesian people.

489
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,199
Are you sure it's the welfare
of the people that concerns you?

490
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,159
Or just your own?

491
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:57,120
Choose your words very carefully Dr Weir.

492
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,497
Oh I do.

493
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,124
Why, is that a threat?

494
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,501
It's advice.

495
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,588
From one ally to another.

496
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:09,174
Well this alliance,

497
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,510
it's just been rescinded.

498
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,886
We're leaving!

499
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:15,889
What,

500
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,308
you plan to arrest us too?

501
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,567
Because you do not wanna do that!

502
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,883
The party's over

503
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,719
And we were having such a good time.

504
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,518
Alright, let's see if we can hold them off.

505
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:06,148
As soon as you get the DHD back online,
dial the Gate and make a run for it.

506
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,194
When you get back to Atlantis, start working
on those sandwiches, we'll be right behind you.

507
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:11,195
Two minutes!

508
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:13,822
Hold on that long and we're good to go!

509
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,129
<i>Don't move!</i>

510
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,896
That's it! I did it! We're ready to go!

511
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,608
You see that?

512
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,027
I knew you could do it.

513
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,492
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

514
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,535
You don't have to do that!

515
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:46,373
Look, if you want me to dial the Gate for you,
that's fine. I... There are hundreds of
suitable planets out there you can go to.

516
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,461
But, there are hundreds of unsuitable
planets you can send me to, aren't there?

517
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,839
Yeah but, I won't, I won't send you to one of those.

518
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,634
I think our best option is
to just come with you to your planet.

519
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,889
Provided you got more of
these laying around there. Do ya?

520
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,307
Forget it.

521
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,017
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:07,978
We'll dial you another address,
you can go through, but

523
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,105
we're not taking you home.

524
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:15,694
You are aware of the fact that
we have a lot of weapons pointed at you, right?

525
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:20,699
Yeah, well you're gonna murder us
the minute we step through the Gate anyway,
so what difference does it make?

526
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,618
That's very distrustful.

527
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,246
<i>Wait! Look!</i>

528
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,372
Oh no.

529
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:52,189
We've got a Wraith cruiser headed for the island
and I'm picking up several more on approach
outside the atmosphere.

530
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,651
Go to stealth mode.
Let's find our guys, before they do.

531
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,450
What is that?

532
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:04,535
What is that?

533
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:08,539
It's a Wraith cruiser and trust me,
you don't wanna be around when it get's here.

534
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,461
Come on.

535
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,381
- Wait! Wait!
-  Come on.

536
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,132
Dial the Gate.

537
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,093
Stop!

538
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,888
If all the prisoners get off this island,
where do you think that ship will go?

539
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:34,356
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
We got a big problem in here!

540
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:37,651
What's up?

541
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,319
- I lost power to the DHD.
- Why ?

542
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:43,282
I told you power would be intermittent at best!
We should have dialed immediately when it patched in,
instead of standing around and talking!

543
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,575
<i>- Can you fix it?</i>
<i>- I don't know!</i>

544
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,702
- They're right on top of us.
- Look, we could shoot them down.

545
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,788
Neither your weapons nor ours will damage it.

546
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,790
What about the drones?
Can you patch enough power to arm them?

547
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,417
They're not as intricate as the DHD.

548
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,836
- Maybe, maybe, maybe one, given the time contraints!
- Then do it.

549
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,713
Can one drone shoot down an entire Wraith cruiser?

550
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:02,092
- Maybe we'll get a lucky shot. McKay?
- Almost! Just give me one more....

551
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:05,053
OK we're on, go before the power cuts out again!

552
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,355
- See that?
- A drone.

553
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,482
- We scored a hit!
- Great.

554
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,151
That's either going to buy us time
or piss them off.

555
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,153
But we don't know what the ship's gonna do now.

556
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:27,868
<i>Colonel Sheppard? You've damaged the Wraith</i>
<i>cruiser and it's leaving the area, but there are</i>
<i>two more cruisers incoming.</i>

557
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,502
Elizabeth, where are you?

558
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,588
We're in Jumper two, we're cloaked,
directly above you.

559
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,589
<i>You alright?</i>

560
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,049
Our Jumper's disabled.

561
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,762
Right now, I need you to dial the Gate
to one of the back up planets to the Alpha site.
Doesn't matter which one.

562
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,223
Understood.
Do it.

563
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,689
OK, everyone who wanted off this planet,
now's your chance!

564
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,941
Time to go.

565
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,817
And why should we trust you...

566
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,153
You wanna stay here, stay. I really don't give a damn!

567
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:06,156
But you are not coming home with us!

568
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:06,698
But...

569
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,742
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come.

570
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,174
Elizabeth?

571
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:29,263
<i>I need you to keep the Gate open till the last of</i>
<i>them go through, then shut it down, dial Atlantis!</i>

572
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:30,764
<i>We could land and pick you up.</i>

573
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:33,851
Negative!
Just keep the Gate open, we'll take it from there.

574
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,270
<i>Stay in stealth mode</i>
<i>until the Wraith have gone away.</i>

575
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,646
Acknowledged.

576
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,286
Here comes another Cruiser.

577
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,454
Dial Atlantis.

578
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,165
We're dialing, head for the Gate.

579
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,776
They're through.
