1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,936
What a great vacation getaway
in the Pegasus galaxy.

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,687
Where is everyone?

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,066
There is smoke from the chimneys,
they're inside.

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,778
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.

5
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,613
Let's check this out.

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,422
Howdy folks.

7
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,387
Who are you?

8
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,763
Sheppard.

9
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,100
This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay.

10
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,728
You from Matira?

11
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,022
No.

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,233
Over the mountains then?

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,151
A little further.

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,864
Then you've come a long way.

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,616
You'll be in need of food and drink.

16
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,035
Sit.

17
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,090
Take it, you don't get
many strangers around here?

18
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,175
No.

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,386
Especially not those who travel near dark.

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,096
Why's that?

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,266
- You really don't know?
<i>- Callum.</i>

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,897
What's your business here?

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,816
No business really, we're just travellers.

24
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,152
Then you best keep travelling.

25
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,738
Ya...

26
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,829
Alright then.

27
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,122
Wait!

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,168
Goran, you can't send them out there.

29
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,421
They look like they can take care of themselves.

30
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,926
May not even start tonight.

31
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,969
It's been three months,

32
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,680
how much longer do you think it will wait.

33
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,350
Hi, what are you talking about?

34
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,727
The Daemus.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,898
Never heard of it.

36
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,984
It lives in the forest, it'll be feeding soon.

37
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,529
And it is some kind of an animal?

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,698
It's a creature, that has the appearance of a man.

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>But it can suck the very life from your bones.</i>

40
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,746
<i>Leaves only a dead, withered husk behind.</i>

41
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,874
Sounds familiar.

Season 2 - Episode 7
Instinct

45
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,476
Look,

46
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,813
we know you're not used to
deal with strangers, but

47
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,858
we may be able to help you
with this little problem you're having.

48
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,610
<i>We're used to deal with this kind of thing.</i>

49
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,448
We call them the Wraith.

50
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,035
These are the creatures from the old stories,
from the time of the cullings.

51
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,495
So you have heard of them.

52
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,831
Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete.

53
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:30,377
They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky,
but there's no description of the Wraith themselves.

54
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,589
<i>Although there were a few among us who</i>
<i>guessed the Daemus might be one of them.</i>

55
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,673
Why?

56
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,510
Because it too came from the sky.

57
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>It was about 10 years ago.</i>

58
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,398
<i>A bright light appeared above the village...</i>

59
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,944
<i>and crashed in the hills.</i>

60
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,989
<i>We didn't know what that was,</i>

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,034
<i>but the people were terrified.</i>

62
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,994
Hurry, gate in the house.

63
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,458
<i>I went with some of the other men to investigate.</i>

64
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,009
<i>We found the wreckage,...</i>

65
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,638
<i>a few wounded survivors,...</i>

66
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,059
<i>we didn't know what they were.</i>

67
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,522
<i>We decided to take no chances.</i>

68
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,829
<i>We slaughtered them,</i>

69
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>burned the bodies.</i>

70
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,999
Wise decision.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,919
Unfortunately, we didn't get them all.

72
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,840
And although none of us saw,
evidently one of them survived.

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,391
<i>It took it's first victim, that very night.</i>

74
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,687
<i>We tried to hunt it down,</i>

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,730
we couldn't find it.

76
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,483
It's been out there ever since.

77
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,444
It feeds three, four times a year.

78
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,322
<i>Takes two or three people each time.</i>

79
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,287
Two years after the crash it took my own son.

80
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,004
That's it.

81
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,006
One Wraith in the forest.

82
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,174
Yes.

83
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,884
I'll be done by morning.

84
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,889
We all go together. In the daylight.

85
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,974
Are you really going to help us?

86
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,269
Like the man said, it's just one Wraith.

87
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,397
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.

88
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,442
In that case, drinks are on me.

89
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,029
Well...

90
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,572
let's not forget the food.

91
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,957
What?

92
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,169
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?

93
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,587
It looks that way.

94
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:22,174
I heard it has two heads and
it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you.

95
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,800
Well you heard wrong.

96
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,762
My uncle say's it'll come and
take me if I don't do my chores.

97
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,138
He said that?

98
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,683
Well then, if we get rid of it,
you got nothing to worry about.
You'll never have to do chores ever again!

99
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,145
- Really?
- Yes, look, go away!

100
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,566
What?

101
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,486
As far as we know, no-one was taken last night.

102
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,905
But it will strike and soon.

103
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,157
Well, we'll kill it before that happens.

104
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,701
You must be great at parties.

105
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,353
We're talking about 100's square miles of forest.

106
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:20,440
Be patient. Ronon's been going up against the Wraith,
one on one, for the last seven years.

107
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,609
If anyone can track this thing, it's him.

108
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,445
And exactly how is he gonna do that?

109
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,198
<i>I also have good hearing!</i>

110
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,701
Right!

111
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,037
Carry on!

112
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,093
What about you?
You sensing anything?

113
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,262
I am not sure.

114
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,722
What do you mean?

115
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,892
There is a presence here,

116
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,269
but it is different.

117
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,938
I cannot quite explain it.

118
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,284
It's in there.

119
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,871
Ronon!

120
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,539
Dammit!

121
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,125
It's in there.

122
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,210
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,587
- Did you see it?
- No.
- Well, so how do you know?

124
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,882
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.

125
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,367
A female!

126
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,002
Ellia?

127
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,758
- Get out of the way!
<i>- Please don't shoot!</i>

128
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,178
<i>She's not what you think!</i>

129
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,223
She's my daughter.

130
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,943
She means you no harm!

131
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,236
She's a Wraith.

132
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,740
Maybe so.
But she's different, I swear to you.

133
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,326
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?

134
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,952
She doesn't feed.

135
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,913
She's never taken a human life.

136
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,915
How is that possible?

137
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,458
Please...

138
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,462
lower your weapons and
I'll explain it to you.

139
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,639
It's alright.

140
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,768
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.

141
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,317
I raised her as my own.

142
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,027
You live here?
Together?

143
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,363
This was part of a mine,

144
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,406
before the last culling.

145
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,160
It's not much to look at, I know,

146
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,454
but we don't have much choice.

147
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,666
The people of the village would not understand.

148
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,001
Gee! I wonder why.

149
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,548
<i>The villagers told us</i>
<i>there was a Wraith in the forest.</i>

150
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,509
It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago.

151
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,386
Ten years ago?

152
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,472
Ellia was just a child.

153
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:25,185
Do you really think that she could be responsible for
the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?

154
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,354
So you know about that, then?

155
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,399
I was there.

156
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,527
I helped kill the survivors.

157
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,154
<i>But...</i>

158
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:42,619
<i>when I found a young female lying unconscious,</i>
<i>some distance from the crash,</i>

159
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,002
<i>I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.</i>

160
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,630
<i>I brought her here to this cave to</i>

161
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,049
hide her from the others.

162
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:02,389
To this day, the people of the village don't know
and you must promise not to tell them.

163
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,103
She's not responsible for what's been happening!

164
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,813
Well then who is?

165
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,901
I believe another Wraith survived the crash.

166
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,402
An adult.

167
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,739
That's who you should be looking for.

168
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:22,284
If she does not feed, how does she live?

169
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,329
<i>At first I</i>

170
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,081
<i>fed her as you would any child and</i>

171
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,375
<i>that seemed to suffice.</i>

172
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,712
But then something began to change.

173
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,007
<i>The food no longer gave her any sustenance.</i>

174
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,344
<i>There was a hunger growing in her</i>
<i>that would not be satisfied.</i>

175
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:46,850
I heard the stories of the other creature.
Of what it did to survive...

176
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,896
and I was afraid that was what Ellia would become.

177
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,232
<i>And so I...</i>

178
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,901
<i>started to experiment.</i>

179
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,240
I have extensive knowledge of
the chemical properties of various...

180
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,409
<i>medicinal plants that grow in this forest.</i>

181
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,621
<i>Are you interested in science?</i>

182
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm not sure that's what I would call this,
but yes.

183
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:16,213
Ellia's hunger was growing stronger every day and
I wasn't sure that I could do anything for her.

184
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,297
But...

185
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,007
eventually,

186
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,054
I came up with this.

187
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,818
A drug that allows the Wraith
to survive without feeding?

188
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,737
- That's what he said.
- Is such a thing even possible?

189
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,032
We don't know enough about Wraith
physiology to say for certain.

190
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:49,204
Although I must admit,
it's intriguing that this Dr Zaddik claims
that this Wraith survived on normal food for a time.

191
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,372
Why?

192
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,001
Well, if he's telling the truth,
it might be the answer to a very puzzling question.

193
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,629
Right now, our best guess is that
the Wraith evolved from the Eratus Bug.

194
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,257
Like the one that attached itself
to my neck a year ago?

195
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,509
- That's right.
- I hate those bugs.

196
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,219
Trust me, I know.

197
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,222
We speculated that they evolved into the Wraith

198
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,851
when they began to take on the characteristics
of the humans they were feeding on.

199
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,062
Now there are many aspects of human
physiology that are quite useful.

200
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,858
Bipedal motion, opposable thumbs,
large brain capacity.

201
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,404
But the human digestive system
serves no purpose in the adult Wraith.

202
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,114
So why have one at all?

203
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,533
Because they eat normal food when they're young.

204
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,829
Exactly. Then at some point they lose
the ability to sustain themselves with that food.

205
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,708
So it's a teenage thing.
Pimples, rebellion, life sucking.

206
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,626
Something like that.

207
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,045
The question is what causes it?

208
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,047
If it's due to some chemical deficiency like

209
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:45,177
a diabetics inability to process sugar, then it's
possible it may be addressed with some kind of drug.

210
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,346
Zaddik could be telling the truth.

211
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,681
I'd like to go to the planet and check into it.

212
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,308
Is that really necessary?

213
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,434
I'm sure we could get a sample.

214
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,144
Bring it back here for you to analyse.

215
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,313
It's not just the drug I'm interested in.

216
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,024
This young Wraith could be very
important for our research.

217
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,275
What research?

218
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,112
We're working on a retrovirus
that would alter Wraith DNA.

219
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:09,660
Essentially stripping out the Eratus
Bug elements of their genetic code and
leaving only the human aspects behind.

220
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,830
- A drug that turns Wraith into humans?
- Effectively yes!

221
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,499
But so far we haven't had much success.

222
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,253
Apparently, because we lack the living tissue
and blood samples we need, to test it.

223
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,631
You think this girl would be willing to provide them?

224
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,342
Look, I realise we can't bring
her back to Atlantis, but...

225
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,555
I could take the retrovirus and equipment
necessary for the analysis, with me to the planet.

226
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:35,102
A few days with a cooperative test subject
could be worth months of theoretical research.

227
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,562
Elizabeth.

228
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,356
I don't have to tell you how
important this could be for us.

229
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,611
Is she dangerous?

230
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,988
She's a Wraith!

231
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,157
<i>Although, I have to admit,</i>

232
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,827
she does seem a little different.

233
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,629
Now remember, the leaves must
be dried and finely ground.

234
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,298
Like this?

235
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,966
A little more.

236
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:13,891
Now why is distillation an important step?

237
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,730
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?

238
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,815
Precisely.

239
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:26,195
We wouldn't want the serum to send
you into paralytic shock now, would we?

240
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,697
No father.

241
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,162
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

242
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:40,167
No I have not.
She's unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.

243
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,086
What if it's all an act?

244
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,424
If she were a killer, why would he protect her?

245
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,551
Maybe the act is for his benefit too.

246
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,888
No, they live here together, Rodney.

247
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,807
If she were like other Wraith,
he would be her first victim.

248
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,476
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard.</i>

249
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,812
Go ahead.

250
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,106
I just got back with Beckett.

251
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,652
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.

252
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,487
<i>What are you gonna tell them?</i>

253
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,197
I'm still working on that.

254
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,047
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?

255
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,718
Oh, here and there.
Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?

256
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,178
Yes, of course.

257
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,388
Would you like some tea?

258
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,724
Thank you

259
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,729
Oh, no thank you.

260
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,900
- Would you like some?
- No.

261
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,986
Are you sure, it's very good!

262
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,654
I said no.

263
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,583
Maybe some biscuits? I baked them myself.

264
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,001
<i>Gate away from me!!!</i>

265
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,295
<i>Ronon!</i>

266
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,742
It's alright. It's OK.

267
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,745
They hate me, don't they father?

268
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,330
No...

269
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,249
They just don't know you.

270
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,506
Was that really necessary?

271
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:54,259
You can dress her up and teach her table manners,
but it's not gonna change who she is.

272
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,269
<i>Teyla, this is Sheppard. Come in.</i>

273
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,230
Go ahead, Colonel.

274
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,232
<i>Is Ellia still in the cave?</i>

275
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:08,857
<i>Yes.</i>

276
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,484
Has she been there the whole time?

277
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,318
<i>Yes, why?</i>

278
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,487
I just found another victim.

279
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,450
<i>Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours,</i>
<i>which means she couldn't have done it.</i>

280
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,412
Looks as though Zaddik may have
been telling the truth after all.

281
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,294
<i>We must defend ourselves!</i>

282
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,049
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?

283
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,342
We're working on it.

284
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,343
Maybe we could help you?

285
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,261
That won't be necessary.

286
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,846
We're sick of doing nothing.

287
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,764
We're sick of being afraid all the time!

288
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,683
That thing is hunting in daylight, now!

289
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:43,725
We'll never be safe.

290
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,185
Just be patient.

291
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,688
We'll take care of it.

292
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:54,111
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.

293
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,239
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.

294
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,324
Can you confirm that?

295
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,662
Not yet. It'll be a while before
I can complete my analysis.

296
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:07,666
Alright. Well, in the meantime,
there's another Wraith out there.

297
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,837
I believe Ellia may be able
to help us find it.

298
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,297
How?

299
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,633
May I speak with her?

300
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,179
Alright.

301
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,686
<i>May I join you?</i>

302
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,198
Ellia, we need your help.

303
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,161
You can sense the other Wraith.

304
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,208
It is alright.

305
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,422
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
In fact, I have the same ability.

306
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,507
Really?

307
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,844
I sensed you in the forest,
when you were watching us.

308
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,181
And I knew even then that you were different.

309
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,352
<i>Your father has raised you well,</i>
<i>he has taught you right from wrong.</i>

310
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,523
You are not like the other one.

311
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,068
I don't let him in.

312
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,821
I don't like what he shows me.

313
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,281
<i>I know,</i>

314
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,286
but you have to try now.
We need to find him.

315
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:28,997
You don't understand.

316
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,168
I have tried myself,
but I can get nothing.

317
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,380
Please.

318
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:41,927
Alright.

319
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:44,638
Good.

320
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,434
Now concentrate.

321
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,284
Try again.

322
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,060
I saw a river.

323
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,688
<i>Zaddik?</i>

324
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,025
Is there a river nearby?

325
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,902
Yes, just to the East.

326
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,114
Alright, let's go. McKay, stay here and help Beckett!

327
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:47,284
- Medical research, not really my thing.
- And hunting Wraith?

328
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,162
I mean, I could stay help Beckett.

329
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,168
Never could get into biology.

330
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,670
This is too much information about the human body.

331
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:03,842
One time, when I was an undergrad,
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical
conditions, before I had to drop the class.

332
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:04,760
Really?

333
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,763
Yeah. Believe it or not,
back then I was a bit of a hypochondriac.

334
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,265
You know, this does require
a certain amount of concentration.

335
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,434
What?
Am I bothering you?

336
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,771
Maybe I'll go get some air.

337
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,700
This must be the river
she saw in her vision.

338
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,828
Assuming she's telling the truth.

339
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,791
<i>Just cos there's another Wraith,</i>
<i>doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her.</i>

340
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,714
What have you got?

341
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,592
Fresh tracks.
It's him.

342
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,095
Now do you believe?

343
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,640
I still think there's more to this
than she and Zaddik are telling us.

344
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,351
He's heading upstream
into the hills.

345
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,987
Let me ask you something.

346
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:11,243
If you can prove to everyone that I'm telling
the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed.

347
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,954
Do you think the villagers would accept her?

348
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,876
That's what I'm afraid of.

349
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,546
No matter how hard we try to convince them,

350
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,048
they'll always see her as a monster.

351
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,263
I'm getting old, Doctor.

352
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,307
You've got lot's of time.

353
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,102
Never have as much as we think we have.

354
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,647
And when I'm gone,
she'll be alone.

355
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:50,032
I try to teach her about love
and human companionship,

356
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,994
but that's exactly what she'll never have.

357
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,667
Zaddik, there's something I want to show you.

358
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:07,132
I didn't say anything at first,
because I didn't want to get your hopes up.

359
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:15,265
It's a retrovirus.
Something I've been working on.

360
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,142
I don't understand.

361
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,062
Oh God, how am I gonna explain this?

362
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,607
Part of Ellia is human.

363
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,778
And part of her comes from
a creature we call the Erratus bug.

364
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,697
It's the part that makes her look the way she does

365
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,200
and where her desire to feed comes from.

366
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,954
<i>Now it's possible,</i>
<i>by means of this retrovirus,</i>

367
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:41,750
<i>we can strip away those parts</i>
<i>and leave only the human parts behind.</i>

368
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,755
You mean she'd be like you and me?

369
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,423
Yes.

370
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,386
<i>Now I must warn you.</i>
<i>The retrovirus is still experimental.</i>

371
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:57,599
In fact it's only been tested on cell cultures
in a laboratory and so far without much success.

372
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,476
<i>I'm hoping,</i>

373
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,898
that what we can learn from your daughter
will help me perfect it.

374
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,069
We got a problem.

375
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,529
<i>Why didn't you just radio me?</i>

376
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,780
<i>I wanted to radio but...</i>

377
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,247
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.

378
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,916
If they find Ellia, they'll kill her.

379
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,001
<i>Sheppard, this is McKay.</i>

380
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,461
What is it, Rodney?

381
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,048
The villagers are on the move and
it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.

382
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,883
<i>Are they heading for the caves?</i>

383
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,927
Not at the moment, no.

384
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,054
Alright, get back there and sit tight.

385
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,556
We're losing time, guys.

386
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:27,481
<i>Ellia?</i>

387
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:30,609
<i>Ellia?</i>

388
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,320
<i>She's not here.</i>

389
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,240
Good Lord!

390
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:37,449
What?

391
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,409
She took the retrovirus.

392
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:43,413
- You said it wasn't ready.
-  It's not! Not by a long shot.

393
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:44,456
What'll it do?

394
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,543
To be honest, I have no idea.

395
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,593
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

396
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:57,553
Go ahead.

397
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,012
<i> We've got another problem.</i>

398
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,683
Ellia's gone and she's injected
herself with the retrovirus.

399
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,351
Why would she do that?

400
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,353
<i>She must have overheard</i>
<i>us talking about it.</i>

401
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:09,314
I told Zaddik it might be
the key to making her human.

402
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,067
Please. You've got to find her before the villagers do.

403
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,777
<i>Look, Ronon says we're close.</i>

404
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,780
If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith.

405
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,115
<i>Rodney and I will find her.</i>

406
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,908
<i>Alright, but be careful.</i>

407
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,993
Understood.

408
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,494
I'll come with you.

409
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:23,996
No, I think it's best if you stay here.

410
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:28,208
<i>Look, is there anywhere that she liked to go?</i>
<i>Any favourite hiding spots or favourite places?</i>

411
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,045
Yes, she often goes off
for hours at a time, up into the hills.

412
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,881
I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me.

413
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,674
It's a start.

414
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:48,312
You know, I thought it was pretty nuts, when
Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest.

415
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,439
Now that it's just us,
do you feel any better?

416
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,734
Oh yeah. Supremely confident.

417
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:02,868
Father.

418
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,621
Ellia.

419
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,126
Where did you go?

420
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,794
I was hiding.

421
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,715
I didn't want the others to know.

422
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,800
To know what?

423
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,055
Ellia! Why did you take the retrovirus?

424
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,350
Because I don't wanna be this way anymore!

425
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,269
I hate what I am.

426
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:34,650
You heard what Dr Beckett said.
You know the retrovirus isn't ready.

427
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,528
I have no choice.

428
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:42,616
When they kill the other Wraith,
I won't be able to pretend anymore.

429
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:44,618
Pretend what?

430
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:50,415
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

431
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:56,088
Your serum doesn't work, father.

432
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,508
It never has.

433
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:02,719
That's impossible.

434
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,014
It's been two years since you...

435
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,978
since the last time.

436
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,231
That wasn't your fault.

437
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,108
It was my idea.

438
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,861
I needed time to perfect the forumla.

439
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:25,117
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.

440
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,246
What did you do?

441
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,711
I'm sorry father.

442
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,132
No. No, that was the other one.

443
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,426
It was both of us.

444
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,387
I sensed him out there.

445
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:50,559
I knew when he was feeding and
I would go out at the same time.

446
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,270
No, it can't be.

447
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,313
Ellia!

448
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,480
Stay away!

449
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,650
What is it? What's happening?

450
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,497
Let me help you.

451
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,849
Sheppard.

452
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,565
This is where he's been making camp.

453
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,943
He was here less than an hour ago.

454
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,414
You hear anything?

455
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,001
No.

456
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,420
Me either.

457
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,532
Easy now. You just went to all that trouble to
save my life, it would be a shame to kill me.

458
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:39,251
Are you alright, Rodney?

459
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:42,713
Yeah, I'm just peachy now.
What the hell was that?

460
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,424
The retrovirus is having the
opposite effect, than we intended.

461
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,176
I guess so.

462
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:48,927
Oh God.

463
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,282
Ellia?

464
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,660
You poor girl.

465
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,455
You never deserved this.

466
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:21,001
I know part of you is still there.

467
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:28,300
Ellia please! This isn't you!

468
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:52,824
Zaddik!

469
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:55,661
Are you alright?

470
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,454
Don't try to move.

471
00:33:57,496 --> 00:34:01,750
It was Ellia.
But it wasn't her fault.

472
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,253
<i>Over here! Come on.</i>

473
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:08,507
No, no, you people need to go back
to the village. It is not safe here!

474
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,801
Who is that?

475
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,310
Don't you remember me?

476
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,899
No. It can't be.

477
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,863
You were taken by the Daemus.

478
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,866
No father.

479
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:40,831
Father? I don't understand.
You're his son?

480
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:44,877
If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old.

481
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,421
Precisely.

482
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,807
There's another one of those things out there.

483
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,393
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!

484
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:04,313
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!

485
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,983
Stay calm. How is he?

486
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,157
I've given him something for the pain,
but his injuries are too severe.

487
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,825
He's not gonna make it.

488
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,577
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

489
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,122
It's not possible.

490
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,082
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:31,131
Don't blame Ellia.

492
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,467
It was my idea.

493
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:38,889
<i>You have to understand.</i>

494
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:48,148
When I found her, I'd just lost
my own wife and son to a fever.

495
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:53,111
She was just lying there helpless.

496
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,081
When I saw her, I knew what I had to do.

497
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:14,424
As I told you, in the beginning she survived
on food and water, like any young girl.

498
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,305
Then the hunger came.

499
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,229
It's alright. Take what you need.

500
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,146
I can't!

501
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,690
Yes you can.

502
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:44,121
She took what she needed from me to survive,
until I perfected the serum.

503
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,381
Father?
Father?

504
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,010
I'm so sorry!

505
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:08,103
She never fed on anyone, after that?

506
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,403
No!

507
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,287
Alright! Teyla, Ronon, you're with me.
The rest of you, stay here!

508
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:29,666
Colonel! The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.

509
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,586
You said she killed the other
Wraith and saved McKay's life.

510
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:36,798
Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing.
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.

511
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,800
Is there nothing you can do for her?

512
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:43,180
I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring
her back alive. But I doubt she'll cooperate.

513
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,434
She's also stronger and faster
than any Wraith I've ever seen.

514
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,061
Great!

515
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:01,615
All this time. We thought you were dead.

516
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:04,785
There was no other way.

517
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:11,375
They never would have accepted us.

518
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:15,629
And I couldn't abandon her.

519
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,382
Why?

520
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,636
She...

521
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,223
needed me.

522
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,314
<i>Colonel, this is Beckett.</i>

523
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,315
Go ahead.

524
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,025
<i>Zaddik's dead.</i>

525
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,654
Understood.

526
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,330
She knows we're here.

527
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,378
She's watching us.

528
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,470
Ellia?

529
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,017
We want to help you!

530
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:14,104
Dr Beckett can make you better,
but you have to come with us.

531
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,400
We will not hurt you!

532
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,882
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.

533
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,178
Stay with her.

534
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,930
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!

535
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,790
Teyla.

536
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,501
What happened?

537
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,253
Where's Colonel Sheppard?

538
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,921
He went after the creature.

539
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,464
You let him go alone?

540
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,842
He wanted me to stay with you.

541
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,511
I am fine. Go.

542
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,388
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?

543
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,182
Sometimes, we're allowed to make exceptions.

544
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,768
And who decides when it's one of those times?

545
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,272
- We do!
- That's good enough.

546
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,620
Ellia!

547
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,251
Don't make me do this.

548
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,912
You OK?

549
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:39,791
Yeah. She tried feeding on me.

550
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,297
She wasn't gonna let us take her back.

551
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,842
Yeah. I know.
