1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,378
You know,

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,757
when they told me
I'd be travelling to another galaxy,

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,593
visiting strange new worlds,

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,971
defending humanity against
unimaginable alien threats,

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,140
this just is not

6
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,725
what I pictured!

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,936
We could be saving Earth...

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,523
- right here, right now, Major.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,816
Through a greater understanding

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,155
of the long-term effects of
severe ozone depletion on plant life.

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,950
You may not
want to admit it, but it's a real danger.

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,202
Oh yeah! Sure!

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,121
Global warming... Wraith attack.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,333
I see the similarity
now, you're right! Yeah, it's great!

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,126
Hey, not too far Doc, OK?

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,837
Ah, not to worry, Major.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,673
I don't think there's
much chance any animal could survive

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,009
the long-term effects
of exposure to the sunlight on this planet.

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,554
So not a place to build a summer home?

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,184
It's the fact this vegetation is thriving!

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,895
Somehow it's managed to persist

22
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,400
despite what should
be extremely destructive ionising radiation.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,611
Oh, would you look at that!

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:15,492
Now what is a
williamsonia suardiana doing here?

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,630
Major!

26
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,101
Doesn't look like the sun killed him.

27
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,686
<i>What do we do?</i>

28
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,608
Kaufman, this is Lorne... any activity?

29
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,859
<i>No, Sir.</i>

30
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,196
We got a dead sucker here...
looks KIA, no more than a day old.

31
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,947
We're on our way.

32
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,949
Come on, Doc,

33
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,660
- let's get you back to the Gate.
- I... I don't understand.

34
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,786
Well, neither do I.

35
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,290
All I know is he didn't do
that to himself. Come on, let's go.

Runner

39
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>- Is the Gate covered?</i>
<i>- Kaufman and Reed, yeah.</i>

40
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,197
We found a dead Wraith. Shot several times.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,867
Looked like bullets,
but it's hard to say. The guy was a mess.

42
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,452
The Genii have such weapons.

43
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,205
Doctor Beckett is performing an autopsy.

44
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,668
- Here he is now.
- I'm not done... not nearly,

45
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,378
but I thought you might like to know this.

46
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,047
The enzyme sac
under the right arm has been removed.

47
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,841
Ford!

48
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,053
What's going on?

49
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,888
Thanks for coming, Rodney.

50
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,515
What? I was right in the middle of a...

51
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,142
<i>P3M-736. We found a dead Wraith,</i>

52
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,938
- maybe killed by Ford.
- He could still be there.

53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,357
Whoa, wait a second. 736?

54
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,985
The UV index there
during the day is something like a thousand.

55
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,737
Bring your sunscreen.
Be ready in ten minutes.

56
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,286
What? I wanna
get Ford back just as much as everyone
else, but do you see my complexion?

57
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,289
- Yes.
- Yes, it's very fair!

58
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,833
Extremely fair.

59
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,880
This isn't fair.

60
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,717
Colonel!

61
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,218
Colonel.

62
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,761
Something urgent?

63
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,681
- We think we have a bead on Ford.
- So I heard.

64
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,932
That was fast.

65
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,688
Base protocol
dictates all senior officers be notified of
situations Code Orange and above. Hey!

66
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,525
How does that go again?
Red, Orange, Blue or the other way around?

67
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,986
- You mind if we go over that when I get back?
- Colonel!

68
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,822
You don't have to remind me of our respective
positions or that you outrank me, Sir.

69
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,618
I was wondering if I needed to remind you
that Lieutenant Ford is a significant
threat to the security of this base.

70
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,827
He's also a friend in need.

71
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,247
His condition forces him to seek out the Wraith.
If he's caught, he would compromise...

72
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,790
Look, I'm gonna find him,

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,043
- and I'm gonna bring him back.
- According to Doctor Beckett's report,

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,921
there may not be anything
that can be done to help him.

75
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,054
With all due respect, Sir, I hope you're
not saying what I think you're saying.

76
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,892
Lieutenant Ford has already proven resourceful
enough to penetrate security and escape the city.

77
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,812
I'm saying if you encounter him and there's
any chance whatsoever that his capture

78
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,651
might prove elusive,
you are duty bound to eliminate the threat.

79
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,238
Lieutenant Ford may have been your friend,

80
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,240
but he's not any more.

81
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,743
I know you understand...
you'll do what's right.

82
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,331
You didn't seem to have a problem with
mercy when it came to Colonel Sumner.

83
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,086
Dismissed.

84
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,122
- Lifesigns detector's useless.
- I told you so.

85
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,958
Just preserving your streak of being right,
officially?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,087
Doctor Parrish believes
that the indigenous plant life retains enough

87
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,090
residual radioactivity
absorbed during the daylight to,

88
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,842
well, to screw up our sensors.

89
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,678
- Making it the perfect place to hide.
- Yes...

90
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:50,017
or... the perfect place to be exposed to
dangerously high levels of solar radiation!

91
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,104
- Any activity while we were gone?
- No, Sir.

92
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,690
Start a sweep... teams of two.

93
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,527
Radio contact every twenty minutes.

94
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,446
It smells like I'm on vacation.

95
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,490
Could it be the
simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter?

96
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035
Strong enough
for anyone within five miles to smell you.

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,829
Like they haven't
been tipped off by the Aqua Velva.

98
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,164
It's dark.

99
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,043
Yeah, and the sun will be
up in two hours, forty three minutes and...

100
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,295
- ten seconds.
- It's raining!

101
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,547
So we'll be cold and miserable.

102
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:26,094
Look, the cloud cover will depreciate
a small percentage of UV rays,
but ninety-five percent of deadly is still deadly.

103
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,889
Doctor Parrish said a
day or two of exposure wasn't gonna kill us.

104
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh yes,
and Doctor Parrish has a PhD in what?

105
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,435
Right... botany!

106
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,561
Teyla, you're with me.

107
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,147
Kaufman take Villick,
Reed and Sherman cover the gate...

108
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,566
and Major you've got McKay.

109
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,362
- Oh, lucky me!
- Here, try some. SPF 100.

110
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,739
- A hundred?
- Yeah, can't buy this kind of protection.
Make it myself.

111
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,491
- Waterproof too.
- Great.

112
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,134
You have any idea what a lone Wraith
would be doing out here on foot?

113
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,053
No, it is unusual.

114
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,057
Perhaps Lieutenant
Ford was able to lure him through the Gate.

115
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,777
It looks as if someone
might have headed off in this direction.

116
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,949
So exactly...

117
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,200
what kind of...

118
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,661
special training do you guys have
to go through to get this sort of mission?

119
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,455
- You guys ?
- Yeah, you know...

120
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,625
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines...
it's a great place to start!

121
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,003
And by `this mission'
you mean hunting down a skilled weapons

122
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,965
expert hopped up on Wraith drugs
in the pitch black of an alien planet?

123
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,467
- Yes!
- Actually,

124
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,720
I skipped that course in Major school.

125
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,096
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

126
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,725
I was hoping Lieutenant
Ford might recognise a friendly face

127
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,394
- and just turn himself in.
- What, you mean me?!

128
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,771
Well, you were friends, weren't you?

129
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,650
Oh, yeah! When we
weren't out on harrowing missions, we
used to hang out together. I'd share my...

130
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,903
dreams of a self-sustaining fusion and he...

131
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,114
he would talk of how
you could sever a man's torso with a P-90!

132
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:13,076
- What... that means quiet, right?
- Yeah... get down, get down!

133
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:14,912
What?

134
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,539
I thought I saw something move.

135
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,880
What is it?

136
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,007
I heard something.

137
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,718
Ford?

138
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,513
Is that you? It's John.

139
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,351
Aiden, listen to me.

140
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,686
We wanna help you, please!

141
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,397
Just come out... we only wanna talk.

142
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,283
What?

143
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,285
Say something!

144
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,870
What?

145
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,664
Talk to him!

146
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,999
What if it's not him?

147
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,752
Ford?

148
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,004
You there?

149
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,965
It's your...

150
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,592
best friend Rodney, Rodney Mc Kay.

151
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,887
Everyone misses you back in Atlantis,

152
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,808
and Doctor Beckett's figured out a way to help you,
so you've just gotta trust me and...

153
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,358
Colonel Sheppard, it's Major Lorne.
In pursuit of suspect.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,276
What?

155
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,319
So are we. Where are you?

156
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,029
We're two klicks south of the Stargate.

157
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,197
Where are you?

158
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,958
What is it?

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,043
Lost him.

160
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,880
Colonel Sheppard.

161
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,299
Stand by. Teyla's been hit.

162
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,517
Colonel Sheppard,
say again. What's your position?

163
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,480
Colonel Sheppard, please respond.

164
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,322
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

165
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,741
<i>Come in please.</i>

166
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,701
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

167
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,874
<i>We haven't heard from them</i>
<i>since 26:30 Atlantis Standard Time.</i>

168
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,795
I know the lifesigns detector
doesn't work there, Major, but
can you use the Jumper to search from the air?

169
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,840
No, ma'am,
the foliage is far too dense for that.

170
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,675
I'll send another team to assist.

171
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,802
Well, anyone you could spare would be great.

172
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,554
<i>Anything else you need?</i>

173
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,390
Elizabeth,
it's Rodney. Yes, hi. There are...

174
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,478
four class one radiation suits
in Medlab storage. We'll need them all.

175
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,355
What?

176
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,983
Look, I know there's not
enough for us all, but we can take turns.

177
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,985
Any sign of Lieutenant Ford yet?

178
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,112
<i>No, ma'am, not that we can confirm.</i>

179
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,407
<i>Fact is, we don't even know if</i>
<i>this is Lieutenant Ford we're dealing with.</i>

180
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,109
Ford?

181
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,619
Colonel?

182
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,288
You OK?

183
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,790
My head is pounding.

184
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,625
Where are we?

185
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,629
I don't know,
but I was just about to ask him.

186
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,181
You might wanna
be careful where you point that thing.

187
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,850
Looks like you've got the safety off.

188
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,814
OK,

189
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,691
be that way.

190
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:19,615
But my guess is if you wanted us dead, we'd
be dead right now, so why don't you tell
us who you are and what you want.

191
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,160
Alright, I'll go first.

192
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,830
I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

193
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,541
I am Teyla Emmagan.

194
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,755
- Colonel ?
- It's my rank... military designation.

195
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,300
Specialist Ronon Dex.

196
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,803
- That's you ?
- Name and rank.

197
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,477
Military?

198
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,982
I used to be.

199
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,291
It was a long time ago.

200
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,253
And now?

201
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,967
Now I'm deciding
whether to kill you and your friends.

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,060
OK, listen up.

203
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,524
I want regular radio contact.
Report anything unusual...
and I'm talking anything unusual at all.

204
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,608
Alright, move out.

205
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,486
Wait, aren't any of them gonna...

206
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,322
Forget it. That's just reckless!

207
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,491
There are four suits.

208
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,452
Not exactly designed for moving
through dense brush and rough terrain,

209
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,122
- not to mention possible combat.
- No,

210
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:55,711
but by my calculations we've been exposed
to 327 millisieverts since the sun came up.

211
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,504
It may not sound like much to you but,

212
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:01,175
I've been keeping a running
tally of my lifetime exposure to radiation:

213
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:06,597
X-rays, cellphones, plane rides,
that whole unfortunate Genii nuclear reactor thing.

214
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,642
My God ... last week we flew
dangerously close to the corona of a sun!

215
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,187
As it is, I may have to forego reproducing.

216
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,938
Yeah, that's funny...

217
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,774
I was just thinkin' that might be wise.

218
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,370
Look,

219
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:35,751
the men guarding the Stargate are
highly-trained soldiers armed with deadly weapons.

220
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,752
Stargate?

221
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,755
Stargate, big circle thing.

222
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,008
I've always known it as the Ring of the Ancestors.

223
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,220
No matter... I have to make it through.

224
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:52,935
Look, we didn't come here looking for trouble,
and the whole killing thing is really unnecessary.

225
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,019
If your friends try to stop me...

226
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,313
They won't, if I tell them not to.

227
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:03,403
Untie us, we'll all go to the Gate together
and you can be on your way.

228
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,656
But why should I trust you?

229
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,451
That's a good question.

230
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,622
Teyla... why should he trust us?

231
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,627
We mean you no harm.
We are only here searching for a friend.

232
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,064
Drop it!

233
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,526
I saw him... your friend.

234
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,446
Where? When?

235
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,740
He killed the Wraith that was hunting me.

236
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,242
Hunting you?

237
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:35,996
Why are you looking for him?

238
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:40,167
His name is Aiden Ford and he is sick.
He needs our help.

239
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:48,509
Thought he'd been in the sun too long.
It can make you sick here.

240
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:55,057
We know that, and that may be true,
but that's not all that's wrong with him.

241
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,059
Then why is he running from you?

242
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,852
Well, he's not, exactly.

243
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,941
Then what is he doing... exactly?

244
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,277
It's complicated.

245
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,571
You can do better than that.

246
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:22,084
Colonel Sheppard? Teyla?
This is Major Lorne, do you read?

247
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,545
It's so hot!

248
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,923
Oh, come on... step it up OK, would you?

249
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,511
I am moving as fast as I can.
I'm very hot. Aren't you hot?

250
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:37,516
Actually, I'm quite comfortable...
but I'm not wearing a fifty pound rubber suit, am I?

251
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,476
I can't breathe! I gotta stop!

252
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,649
Sweet relief!

253
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:56,076
I think the... the fumes from the sunblock are making
me dizzy. I gotta... I gotta... just... rest here.

254
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,498
Unbelievable!

255
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,750
The Wraith was feeding on him.

256
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,129
Apparently they inject some sort
of drug into you when they feed.

257
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,392
He killed the Wraith, got an overdose of the drug.

258
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,686
Kinda messed with him up.

259
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,480
But we think we can help him if we can find him.

260
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,320
What is that?

261
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,613
Radios.

262
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,573
Communication devices.

263
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,576
Our people are trying to contact us.

264
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,662
The cave must be causing
some interference with the signal.

265
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,586
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,088
Getting my hand free.

267
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,174
Didn't feel that way!

268
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,387
OK, you've had your fresh air.
Come on, let's go.

269
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,473
Well, shouldn't we be headed back?
It must have been half an hour.

270
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,183
It's been fifteen minutes.

271
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,269
Oh, really? I thought... It feels longer.

272
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,397
Wow... you must really be some kind of genius!

273
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:13,237
Well, as a matter of fact, I, um... wait a minute.
See, why would you say that now?

274
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,490
Something has to have kept Colonel Sheppard
from shooting you all this time!

275
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah, yeah, OK, I didn't see that one coming!

276
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,623
Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack!

277
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,626
Lorne has been hit! I repeat...
we are under Wraith attack!

278
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,588
Will you relax, McKay?

279
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,091
Ford!

280
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,467
Why don't you drop your gun?

281
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,304
I know what you're like with weapons...I wouldn't want
it accidentally going off while it's pointed at me.

282
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,309
Right!

283
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,897
Good. Now you and me can catch up.

284
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,656
<i>Doctor McKay, what is your position?</i>

285
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,492
<i>Please respond. Major Lorne, come in?</i>

286
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,538
Let's go.

287
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,249
We can't leave Major Lorne.

288
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,917
He'll be fine.

289
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,586
No...

290
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,927
You know that the sunlight
on this planet is kinda dangerous?

291
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,970
Not for me.

292
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:20,804
Actually, if you...

293
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,473
Listen, McKay... you guys
all think I'm crazy or something.

294
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,558
No... no-one thinks that.

295
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,645
Sure. Here's the thing: I'm not just fine,
I'm better than fine.

296
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,107
Really. This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

297
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,776
Well, good! Good for you!

298
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,362
I can prove it.
You just have to give me the chance to prove it.

299
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,782
Well, sure.
Let's... let's head back to the Jumper...

300
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,285
No way. First I'm gonna prove to you that I'm OK,

301
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,706
that things are better this way, then you can go back
and tell the others and then they'll let me come back.

302
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,167
You can come back to Atlantis right now.
Doctor Beckett is...

303
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,920
No. First we have to save Major Sheppard and Teyla.

304
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,214
You know where they are?

305
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,131
Yeah.

306
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,551
Which way did you...?

307
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,806
So obviously
the Wraith didn't destroy Atlantis.

308
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,892
Anything else happen since I've been gone?

309
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,978
Major Sheppard got
promoted to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

310
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:10,812
Really?

311
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,023
- Yeah.
- Good for him!

312
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,775
Yeah.

313
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,868
Keep your hands where I can see them.

314
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,379
- I told you, I have to get to the Ring.
- Why?

315
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,172
- Because the Wraith are coming.
- How do you know?

316
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,049
I know. They're hunting me.

317
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,801
Join the club.

318
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,804
You are a Runner.

319
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,475
I have heard stories, but...

320
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,102
What's a Runner?

321
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,732
I was captured
during a culling on my planet.

322
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,484
I was taken to a ship.

323
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,403
A Wraith started to feed on me.

324
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,576
Something made him stop.

325
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,344
They operated on me...

326
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,888
put some sort of

327
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,599
tracking device in my back and released me.

328
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,939
They hunted me.

329
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,531
I hunted them back.

330
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,618
I've been running ever since.

331
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,453
Don't do it.

332
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,748
Like I said, we're not here to get in your way.

333
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,459
That's good.

334
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,552
You're lucky I had that set to stun.

335
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,933
<i>- You sure this is the right way?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm sure. Keep moving.</i>

336
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,643
<i>- You say this guy has them.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

337
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,769
What guy?

338
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,396
I don't know!
...'what guy?' A guy!

339
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,607
Look, I was on a Wraith planet...

340
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,985
P3X... P3X-447?

341
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,196
447... I know the address.

342
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,739
And there were Wraith there?

343
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,617
Yeah. A whole hive ship.

344
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,118
Anyway,

345
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,996
I was scouting the place out, looking
for the best way in so I could kill a couple.

346
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,790
- What, for the enzyme?
- Exactly.

347
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,251
McKay, I'm telling you,
it's the key to defeating them!

348
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,545
We could create
a whole army of supermen like me!

349
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,712
You were saying?

350
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,464
- What?
- About the guy.

351
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:43,924
Right.

352
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,093
So this one Wraith, armed to the teeth,

353
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,178
comes walking towards the Gate.

354
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:51,390
I figure
one Wraith by himself is easy pickings,

355
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,725
so I followed him here to this planet.

356
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,602
Anyway, I think he was looking for the guy.

357
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,104
How do you know?

358
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:05,279
Well, he was running
from the Wraith when I killed the sucker.

359
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,363
OK,

360
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,157
so what does
the guy want with Sheppard and Teyla?

361
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,450
I don't know.

362
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,828
When I save them, I'll find out!

363
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,291
Look,

364
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,127
you wanna go through the Gate, go.

365
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,463
Give me my radio,
I'll order my men not to stop you.

366
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,341
You can tell them in person.
I'm taking you with me.

367
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,969
You know,
there's a chance we could help you.

368
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:29,928
How?

369
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,265
We know a pretty good doctor... maybe he
could take that tracking device out of you.

370
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,933
You think I haven't tried?

371
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,936
Suit yourself.

372
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,151
And why would you do that?

373
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:47,738
Because I'm a nice guy. Look, I told you.

374
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:54,161
You hate the Wraith, we hate the Wraith.
It's something we all have in common.
We just want our friend back.

375
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,081
You get this tracking device out of me...

376
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,875
I'll get your friend back for you.

377
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,002
OK, good.

378
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,004
It's a deal.

379
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,682
Major.

380
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,147
- Where's Lorne?
- He's inside, Sir.

381
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,273
What happened to you?

382
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,817
I got hit by a Wraith blaster looking for you.

383
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,278
- Now McKay's missing.
- Great!

384
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,613
What about Teyla?

385
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:33,492
Long story.
You can listen to it while I tell Doctor Weir.

386
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,913
This is a joke, right?

387
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,248
I'm afraid not.

388
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:43,585
You want me to go to an alien planet and perform
surgery on an armed man holding Teyla hostage?

389
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,128
Yeah, something like that.

390
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,089
And apparently you don't have much time.

391
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,174
The Wraith could show up at any minute.

392
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,344
Oh! It's getting better all the time!

393
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,513
Have they found Lieutenant Ford yet?

394
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,597
No.

395
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,183
I haven't told you about McKay yet either.

396
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,310
Come on, pack up what you need.

397
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,190
I don't think an operating room
and a bloody army will fit through the Gate.

398
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,615
Why are you stopping?

399
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:17,244
Because I am tired,
and you have no idea where you're going.

400
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,246
How do you know?

401
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,373
We've been walking around in circles for hours!

402
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,875
So that's it...

403
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,209
you just give up, is that it?

404
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,588
That's what you do, isn't it... you just give up
on your friends when they need you most!

405
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,506
No-one's given up on you, Ford! We wanna help you!

406
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,092
I'm talking about Major Sheppard and Teyla.

407
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,135
Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

408
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,221
Alright... Lieutenant Colonel.
So Ford's lost it, Ford's all crazy,

409
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,473
Fool Ford can't even remember a simple little thing.

410
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,600
Hey, I never said that!

411
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:43,145
Although the fact that you keep referring to yourself in
the third person does indicate clinical dissociation.

412
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,439
You don't even know what a friend is, do you McKay?

413
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,065
All you care about is yourself.

414
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,651
- Will you relax?
- You relax! You're pathetic.

415
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,446
You were always making fun of me.
You wanna play a game? Pick on Ford.

416
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,739
I could shoot you and leave you here to die.

417
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,033
Shoot me? When did this
escalate to physical violence?

418
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,451
You're the one who thinks I'm nuts!

419
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,162
I'm capable of anything...
I could go off at any time.

420
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,413
Alright, you wanna shoot me,

421
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:04,791
shoot me! Fine! I don't care.
It'll just save me suffering one
of the many horribly painful deaths

422
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,377
I have in line after from
being exposed to this much radiation!

423
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,755
And, quite frankly,
it'll prove just how far gone you are!

424
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,759
Now, I'm heading back to the Jumper
and you're welcome to join me.

425
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,972
Are you crazy? You could have killed me!

426
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,974
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:28,982
Look, you don't know what it's like,
almost dying like I did, having
your friends turn on you, no-one trusts you.

428
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:31,443
I'm out here all alone.

429
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,779
You don't have to be alone, Ford.

430
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,615
Look, this drug is messing with your head.

431
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,743
Come back to the Jumper with me,
we'll go back to Atlantis,

432
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:44,164
and Dr. Beckett may even be able to figure out a way
for you to keep all your new super-powers...

433
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,500
You think?

434
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,127
Sure, why not?

435
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,839
First we've gotta save Colonel Sheppard and Teyla.

436
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,842
- No, no, wait.
- No! That'll prove that I'm OK.

437
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,176
You go back to the Jumper,

438
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,052
I'll meet you there.

439
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:00,222
Ford! No!

440
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,271
This is not necessary, you know.

441
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,402
How long have you been on the run?

442
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,946
Seven years.

443
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,490
And you have been on your own all that time?

444
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,242
Not much choice.

445
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:25,205
Afraid of bringing the Wraith
down on anyone you were with?

446
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,457
Can't go home.

447
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,627
Can't stay in one place for too long.

448
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,216
Why do you think they do it?

449
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,801
I don't know.

450
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,053
Sport,

451
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,472
training,

452
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,225
learn how we fight,

453
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,520
measure our will to survive.

454
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,480
You said

455
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,567
you heard stories,

456
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:54,568
about others like me?

457
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:57,237
Yes. I have heard of Runners my whole life,

458
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,989
but I've never met one.

459
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,950
I did not even believe it was true.

460
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:08,373
One time I accidentally came across
a planet with a village near the Ring.

461
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,166
What happened?

462
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,294
I stayed... one night...

463
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,838
had a real meal for a change.

464
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,257
<i>I flied away the next day.</i>

465
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,551
Didn't matter.

466
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,179
I later heard...

467
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,225
the whole village...

468
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,647
Teyla, this is Sheppard, come in?

469
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,655
Go ahead, Colonel.

470
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:40,489
You OK?

471
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,241
Yes. We are fine.

472
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,035
I'm here with Doctor Beckett. He's coming in.

473
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,037
Unarmed.

474
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:52,751
Ronon would like me to remind you
that Doctor Beckett remain unarmed.

475
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,466
Alright, for what it's worth,

476
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:03,387
I'd never send you in there
if I thought the guy was gonna hurt you.

477
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,931
Is that opinion based on some sort of evidence,

478
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,642
or is it just a gut feeling
that this gentleman isn't dangerous?

479
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,978
I didn't say he wasn't dangerous.

480
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,522
He could probably kill you in the blink of an eye.

481
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,440
I don't think he will.

482
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,193
Well thank you, I feel much better now!

483
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,737
You ever heard of Androcles and the Lion?

484
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:25,033
Aye... and who are you in this retelling? The Romans?

485
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,744
I'll be right up there.

486
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,258
Hello.

487
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,805
I normally don't make house calls like this,
but then again this isn't really a house, is it?

488
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,348
What's in the case, Doc?

489
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:53,145
Surgical implements, diagnostic tools,
various drugs, analgesics, antibiotics.

490
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,104
What?

491
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:59,443
Ronon, Doctor Carson Beckett.
Doctor Beckett, Ronon.

492
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,694
Pleasure.

493
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,114
I understand you have some sort
of a transmitter in your back.

494
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:08,118
Well, have a seat.
Off with your shirt, and let's have a look.

495
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,706
A little help.

496
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,391
My God!

497
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,644
Tell me you didn't try
to cut this thing out yourself.

498
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:37,022
Yeah, I tried once with a mirror.
Couldn't quite reach.

499
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,149
Most of it's from two different doctors.

500
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,902
No-one I know who calls
himself a doctor would do this.

501
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,836
Is that Ancestor technology?

502
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,130
That it is.

503
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,762
Son, you're gonna have to put
that weapon down and lie down.

504
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:09,930
Not a chance.

505
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,348
Now you listen to me.

506
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,975
I've located the transmitter.

507
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,394
It's in the soft tissue next to
the second thoracic vertebrae.

508
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,436
Good, cut it out.

509
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,438
I can't do that with you sitting up like this,

510
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,482
and I'm gonna have to give you
some anaesthetic to make you sleep.

511
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,525
No you're not.

512
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,568
Excuse me?

513
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:23,902
Ronon, you need to trust us.

514
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:29,157
I do. That's why he's here and you're still alive.

515
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,535
Now get to work, Doc.

516
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,208
Look, if you'd just turn on your radio,
we could hear what's happening.

517
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,295
The others must have called for back-up by now.

518
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:45,090
Maybe Sheppard and Teyla
don't even need rescuing any more.

519
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,306
Someone's coming.

520
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,600
What do I need this for?

521
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,567
OK, I'm ready.

522
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,445
Look, I just wanna say one last time,
I really don't think this is a good idea.

523
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,239
I'm gonna be cutting very close to your
spinal column here. If you were to flinch...

524
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,741
I won't flinch.

525
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:14,703
OK.

526
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,373
Here we go.

527
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,408
I think I've got it.

528
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,982
<i>Don't shoot! It's just me!</i>

529
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,906
What the hell are you doing, McKay?

530
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,783
What the hell am I doing?
What the hell are you doing!

531
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,160
Those are our guys!

532
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,329
You can't trust them!

533
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,874
Oh, that's it... Yeah I've had it.

534
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,209
Just drop your weapons now!

535
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,838
You're gonna shoot me?!

536
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,381
I will if I have to.

537
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,050
Ford, I'm taking you in.

538
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:54,803
Look, you may not believe this,
but it's for your own good.

539
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,360
Oh no!

540
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:20,579
I'm quite certain I've disabled the device.

541
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,124
It may be too late.

542
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:27,461
We know at least one Wraith tracked Ronon here.

543
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,087
I'm gonna look for McKay and Ford.

544
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,672
Yes... we will be fine.

545
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,674
Now that the lion's passed out cold.

546
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,052
I'm gonna pick you up with the Jumper as soon as...

547
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,725
Help me! Help me!

548
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:48,398
<i> Sir! Gate activity over here!</i>

549
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,067
Cloak the Jumper, now!

550
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,783
Colonel Sheppard, we've got Gate activity.

551
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,707
<i>Three Wraith Darts just came through.</i>

552
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:06,750
Great!

553
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,044
We should head back inside.

554
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,348
He went through there.

555
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:33,026
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

556
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,490
<i>Colonel, Ronon is gone.</i>

557
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,284
<i>There was another way out of the cave.</i>

558
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,202
Get back to the Jumper!

559
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,584
Well, look at you!

560
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,921
Yes... look at me! It's funny, huh?

561
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:56,300
- You set this up? It's clever.
- It wasn't me.

562
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,511
No, huh? Well, I'm glad we could both, uh,

563
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:02,639
still laugh about this together.

564
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,393
How about cutting me down now?

565
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,896
No. I think I'm still gonna kill you.

566
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,815
- What?What do you mean, 'still'?
- When did this escalate to killing?

567
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:12,524
When you shot me.

568
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,360
It's a flesh wound! I knew it wasn't gonna hurt

569
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,820
you... you're, you're SuperFord, remember?!

570
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,322
You tried to kill me!

571
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,073
Wait, hey!

572
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:24,953
You... you can't kill an unarmed upside down man!

573
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:23,762
Lieutenant!

574
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,349
Don't.

575
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,109
Ford!

576
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,453
Hi! Doctor Rodney McKay. Could you, um,

577
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,830
get me down please?

578
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,508
Ford!

579
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,762
Keep your hands where I can see them.

580
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,267
We wanna help.

581
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:26,033
You're not getting off this planet!

582
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,206
I'll show you.

583
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,377
You'll see!

584
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,184
After they scooped up Ford,
the Darts made a beeline for the Gate.

585
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,769
We tried to stop them, but...

586
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,688
You had him in your sights,
and you let him get away.

587
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,483
I shot him once. Didn't slow him down.

588
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:00,526
I shot him too.

589
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,486
He ran into the beam.

590
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,571
Are you suggesting he wanted to be taken?

591
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:07,074
I think he saw it was the only way off the planet.

592
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,327
Well, I can tell you from the quality time I spent
with Ford, he was definitely not thinking straight.

593
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:14,790
Now thanks to you, he's in enemy hands
with information that could compromise all of us.

594
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,834
I don't think he'll give us away.

595
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,878
Oh, thank you so much for your assurance, Colonel.

596
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,257
I'll be sure to include
your 'feelings' in my report.

597
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,191
How is it going?

598
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,402
This place is impressive.

599
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,613
And those Ancestors sure could build them.

600
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:48,782
The guards are unnecessary.

601
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:53,245
Well, with your habit of
taking people hostage and all...

602
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:57,791
I meant, should I want to escape,
they will not be able to stop me.

603
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,794
Alright.

604
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,422
Were you able to contact my home world?

605
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,716
Well, that's why I'm here.

606
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,354
I don't understand.

607
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,649
We have machines called MALPs.

608
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:27,821
They're capable of transmitting back
images and information from other planets.

609
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:32,075
We sent this one to the address you gave us.

610
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,662
That is Setita.

611
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,456
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:40,834
It doesn't look like anyone survived the last attack.
