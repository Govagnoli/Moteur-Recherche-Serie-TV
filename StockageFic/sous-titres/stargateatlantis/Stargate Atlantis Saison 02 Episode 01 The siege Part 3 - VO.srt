1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,753
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,838
You have some wraith DNA.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,591
- You can actually see what's happening?
- I'm on a ship.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,259
Receiving an IDC.

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,178
- Who is it?
- Stargate Command.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,931
All we have to do is hold down
until the Daedalus get's here

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,683
then we could use the ZPM to power the city shield.

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,728
Multiple signals Sir. We couldn't see
them until they were right on top of us.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,150
The colonel Marshall Sumner
was a very good friend of mine

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,945
You admit to firing the shot that killed him.

11
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,531
The Wraith... they are in Atlantis.

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,491
They're sending in another wave.

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,910
Fly the puddle jumper in stealth
mode right down their throats.

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,703
You are volunteering for a suicide mission?

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,206
- You can't.
- I have to, and you know it.

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,633
Teyla I'm hearing gun fire,
what's your status,

17
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>Teyla?</i>

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,560
Mecanism armed and ready. I'm going in.

19
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,604
And now the conclusion.

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,440
Defense!

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,913
Major Sheppard, decloak your jumper immediately.

22
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,790
What? Who the hell is this?

23
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,169
Authentication, Alpha Charlie 1. Decloak now!

24
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:16,720
Detonation in 5, 4, 3, 2...

25
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,320
Target has been neutralised.

26
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,366
He did it.

27
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,578
Yeah he did.

28
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,666
Dr Weir I'm picking up another ship.

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,419
- Another hive ship?
- Negative. I'm reading an IFF.

30
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>Atlantis? This is Sheppard.</i>

31
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,716
John?

32
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,093
<i>What other Sheppards do you know?</i>

33
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,803
Oh thank God!

34
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,555
No, that can't be. We saw the hive ship go up.

35
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>I assure you Dr McKay that</i>
<i>Major Sheppard is alive and well.</i>

36
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,226
Who is this?

37
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:09,898
Colonel Steven Caldwell. Commander of the Daedalus.
We are ready to assist you.

38
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,985
Oh thank you!

39
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,445
We are very glad to hear it, Colonel.

40
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,659
And I assume we have you to
thank for saving Major Sheppard.

41
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,620
We were monitoring your transmissions
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

42
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,664
We couldn't beam him in until he decloaked his jumper.

43
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,332
Didn't take much convincing.

44
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,625
Dr McKay?

45
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,377
Present! Yes!

46
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,796
<i>I trust you know what to do with this?</i>

47
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,009
Your ZPM sir.

48
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,514
How did they do that?

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,227
The Daedalus is loaded with Asgard technology.
Beaming technology is the first part of it.

50
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:52,024
- They got things like...
- Rodney? What say we get the shields back up.

51
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,736
What say we.

52
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
We still have Wraith all over the city

53
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,534
After we deal with those other hive ships,
we'll assist you as soon as we can.

54
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,660
Caldwell out.

55
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,955
Sir, we have incoming enemy fighters bearing 320.

56
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,752
All forward rail guns, stand by. Launch all fighters.

Season 2 - Episode 1
The Siege part III

59
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,842
<i>Colonel Caldwell? This is Novak in engineering.</i>

60
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,843
<i>What is it?</i>

61
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,263
Hermiod wanted to remind you that our
shields strength will be severely diminished

62
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,807
without the Zero Point Module
tied into our power systems.

63
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,434
I'm well aware of that Doctor. Caldwell out.

64
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,897
Major, do you recommend any
specific target on the hive ship?

65
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,066
One of the fighter bays, Sir.

66
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,277
That would increase the chance
of secondary explosions.

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,695
That's what I was thinking, Sir.

68
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,448
I agree. Waeps, arm two mark 8 tacticals.
Our target is the hive ships main fighter bay.

69
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,826
Warheads armed. Target is locked Sir.

70
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:26,451
Fire!

71
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,669
We need to get in closer.

72
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,505
Helm, alter heading to intercept. Go to max thrust.

73
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,590
Max thrust.

74
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,674
We'll just have to get closer.

75
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:45,220
The Asgard gave you hyperdrives and shields.
How come, no offensive weapons?

76
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,223
Providing other races with anything that
could be potentially used against them?

77
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,433
I thought they were allies?

78
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,895
Without their beaming technology,
you wouldn't be here, Major.

79
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,063
Arm two more mark 8's.

80
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,523
You're wasting ordinance, Colonel.

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,027
Those missiles are being intercepted
miles from the hive ship.

82
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,577
I've routed the shield's sub routine.
When I give the word, all you have to do is punch it...

83
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,661
I know what to do, go!

84
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,336
Whoa,whoa,whoa, what is this?
This is my security escort?

85
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,421
Well we are spread a little bit thin right now.

86
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,131
OK, but you need to know that if we come under fire,

87
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,050
you're gonna have to put your
lives on the line to protect me.

88
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,800
Rodney!

89
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,512
OK,I mean the ZPM.
Protect the ZPM at all costs.

90
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,305
And me! Am I wrong?

91
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,063
- Dr Weir?
- Yes?

92
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,273
I've lost contact with some of our people.

93
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,483
Who?

94
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,571
We can get a hold of the teams
led by Captain Radnor, Teyla or Lt Ford.

95
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,407
Well keep trying.

96
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,381
Now we're 0 for 2. How many things have you got?

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,882
Only one needs to get through.

98
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,719
Is there any way we can deliver a warhead
the same way you plucked me out of the Jumper?

99
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,179
The Asgard have already considered that Major.

100
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,391
There are failsafes built into the systems to prevent
their use as a weapons delivery system.

101
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:17,145
You've got one of these Asgard onboard?
Can he override the failsafe?

102
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,272
Why would he do that?

103
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,732
Well, his butt's on the line, just as much as ours.

104
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,196
Novak, I need you and Hermiod to figure out
how to get sight to sight transport

105
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,282
locks on a set of coordinates inside the hive ship.

106
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:33,328
No, no. Sir.
Hermiod isn't going to like that.

107
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,872
<i>Get it done Doctor, that's an order.</i>

108
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,009
That's where we have to go.

109
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:00,856
What was that? I didn't get all that.

110
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,151
What do I do? Look, I'm gonna get to
the rolling things. Maybe I can uh...

111
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:48,987
Clear.

112
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,533
No, no. You stay here.

113
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:04,294
So! This is how it's gonna be?
Just me?

114
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,590
OK, that's fine!

115
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,635
You want some of this?

116
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,891
This is McKay! I'm in trouble down here!

117
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,731
Dr McKay? Are you alright?

118
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,400
Teyla, we thought you were...

119
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,237
My radio was broken and I was separated from my group.
I've been trying to make my way back.

120
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,656
Oh thank God! You have no idea.
I thought I was gonna...

121
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,991
I thought you were very brave.

122
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,117
Really?

123
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,954
- I have a ZPM.
- Yes.

124
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,289
We need to get the shields up.

125
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,708
- Lead the way.
- Yeah sure. After you.

126
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,176
I've set the timer for 5 seconds.
Is that enough time for you?

127
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,678
Five seconds should be more than ample.

128
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,226
OK look. I know you don't approve of using
techology this way, but you have to understand...

129
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,853
I am ready.

130
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,234
Colonel, Hermiod is ready and
standing by for warhead transport,

131
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,197
but I can tell you, he is not happy about this.

132
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,159
I take that under advisement.
Are we within transport range?

133
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,993
Yes Sir!

134
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,913
Transport warhead when ready.

135
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:26,460
Ready! 5... The weapon is away.

136
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,058
We have a kill.
The last hive ship has been neutralised.

137
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,397
Novak, I need you to prep
another warhead for transport.

138
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,774
We need to take out those cruisers.

139
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,900
Sir wait!

140
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,988
Colonel, cruisers have broken off
and entered hyperspace.

141
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,574
Seeing what we just did to
their remaining hive ships, I don't blame them.

142
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,244
There are still a lot of Darts out there.

143
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,495
Alright, let's clean this up.

144
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,205
Sir, the Wraith fighters are regrouping.

145
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,041
Everyone get into position.
Stand by for defensive fire.

146
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,252
We're not the target.

147
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:12,297
Major Sheppard is right, Sir.
The formation is headed toward Atlantis.

148
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,591
Elizabeth, you've got a problem.

149
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,386
Yeah, we see that Major.

150
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,264
<i>We're moving to intercept,</i>
<i>but I don't think we can get there in time.</i>

151
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,057
Not a chance. They're coming in too fast.

152
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,893
Oh my God! Their approach is ballistic.

153
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,144
And what exactly does that mean?

154
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,898
Their impact velocities will be in excess
of 10,000 kilometres an hour.

155
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,568
No part of the city can withstand that.

156
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,319
You'd better get the damn shield up!

157
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,029
How much time do we have?

158
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,073
45 seconds.

159
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,619
Rodney we need the shield up
in 40 seconds or we're dead!

160
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,537
Are you kidding me?

161
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,246
No!

162
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,541
<i>I think we're nearing the point</i>
<i>in which I completely snap.</i>

163
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,709
Rodney!

164
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,714
That should do it! Fire it up!

165
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,053
That didn't do it.

166
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,430
- What?
- It is not working.

167
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,557
- I know what she said!
- 20 seconds.

168
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:06,977
Okay, Snap! That's it!
Are you all happy now?

169
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,316
- Rodney!
- OK, OK, OK! Try it now!

170
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,087
Atlantis? This is Sheppard. Come in.

171
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,299
Atlantis?

172
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,019
<i>This is Sheppard. What is your status?</i>

173
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,104
The explosions must have disrupted the radio signal.

174
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,150
We're still here. That's our status.

175
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,862
Don't scare me like that.

176
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,573
<i>Sorry. What about the Wraith fleet?</i>

177
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,784
The remaining cruisers have withdrawn from battle.

178
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,539
Thank you Colonel. Thank all of you.

179
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,708
Glad to be of help. We're gonna stay in
Geosynchronous orbit for the time being.

180
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,335
Can we be of any further assistance?

181
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,462
We could use some help with the Wraith in the city.

182
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,382
We're sending some people to help with that.
Daedalus out.

183
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,679
Major Sheppard. I'm sure you're
anxious to get back to Atlantis.

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,973
Yes Sir! Thank you.

185
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,857
<i>Rodney? You can take the rest of the day off.</i>

186
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:42,114
I'm going to curl up in bed with
the largest sandwich I can find.

187
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:47,870
Shall I just explain to the rest of the Wraith left
on the base, that you're unavailable to fight?

188
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,164
Right.

189
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:13,312
Secure Stargate Operations. Hello, I'm home!

190
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,785
Yes you are.

191
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,915
I truly thought...

192
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,751
Yeah, yeah. I thought the same
thing about you, a minute ago.

193
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,961
We gotta stop that.

194
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,546
I'd like that.

195
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,718
So uh, where are we?

196
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,513
Well most of our sensors are still down,

197
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,849
but we do know that there are at least
a handful of Wraith still in the city.

198
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,100
Still got some work to do.

199
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,646
Before you do anything,
Colonel Everett insists on speaking with you.

200
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,148
He's in the infirmary.

201
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,577
We've neutralised the hive ships,
activated the shields

202
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:15,707
and we've mustered as many people as we can,
making sure there are no Wraith hiding in the shadows.

203
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,460
- Good work Major.
- Thank you, Sir.

204
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,589
They're shipping me out
with the next batch of wounded.

205
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,760
I wanted to finish our conversation.

206
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,347
Yes Sir.

207
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,476
I owe you an apology.

208
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,773
No Sir, you don't.

209
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,151
I think I have a pretty good idea.

210
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,992
I would have done the same thing as you did,
when you found Colonel Sumner.

211
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,663
That's what I wanted to tell you.

212
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,667
None of that matters right now, Sir.

213
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,837
I'm trying to say,

214
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,216
I wish you had been there for me.

215
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,687
- You're gonna be fine Sir, once you get back to Earth.
- I said what I had to say.

216
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,192
Get back to work.

217
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,910
Yes Sir.

218
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,586
Preliminary count is 40 casualties.

219
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,882
Maybe more. I'm still trying to line up
life signs readings with actual people.

220
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,634
There are no Wraith life signs?

221
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,887
The last one was trapped in one
of the deeper parts of the city.

222
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,974
He died trying to damage city
with one of their grenades.

223
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,686
Three of our men were injured.
On the bright side, there was no flooding.

224
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,897
Have we been able to locate Lt Ford?

225
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,775
I'm sorry, no.

226
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,696
We searched everywhere in the city. It's possible
he may have beamed up into one of the Wraith Darts.

227
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,323
Let's not make that assumption.

228
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,867
Major, I'm sorry.
We searched everywhere inside the city.

229
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,619
Well how about outside the city?

230
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,997
- I don't understand.
- Expand the sensors. Maybe he's in the water.

231
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,791
Even if that was the case, there's no chance...

232
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,253
Look, I'm not asking you to swim out there,
I'm asking you to press a few damn buttons!

233
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,464
Even if you're right, I don't see how...

234
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,928
Oh my God.

235
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:47,401
Colonel Caldwell? One of our men is
in the ocean outside our shield.
Most probably injured.

236
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,903
Can you beam him to your ship
and down to our infirmary?

237
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,621
Atlantis? This is Dr Novak on the Daedalus.

238
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,416
<i>You're gonna need some SO's in your infirmary,</i>
<i>before we beam your man down.</i>

239
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,585
We already do Doctor. Beam away.

240
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,341
Good Lord!

241
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,887
Let's get this thing off of him.

242
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>How is he?</i>

243
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,399
<i>I gave him a mild sedative to help rest,</i>
<i>but he should be dead.</i>

244
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,610
<i>He's a tough kid.</i>

245
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,822
Not my point, Major. He was lying face
down in the freezing water for over an hour.

246
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,866
I don't care how tough he is.

247
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,075
So what are you saying?

248
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:38,744
We still have no idea how it works,

249
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,664
but during the Wraith feeding process,
the victim is injected with a special enzyme.

250
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,960
It strengthens the human body temporarily
and ensures that the heart continues to beat.

251
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,379
Why would they wanna make you stronger?

252
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,089
So the victim doesn't die immediately.

253
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,259
The feeding process is so traumatic,
that without the special enzyme,

254
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,428
we shut down far sooner than they like.

255
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,015
They make you stronger
so they can take more time to kill you.

256
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,558
Lovely, isn't it?

257
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:06,605
In most cases the enzyme is released slowly
into the blood stream throughout the feeding process.

258
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,359
I can only ascertain that
the Wraith died quite suddenly

259
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,153
and that Lt Ford's system became flooded with it.

260
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,073
And that's why he was able
to survive in the water for so long.

261
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:16,865
Exactly.

262
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,370
The problem is, now the enzyme is breaking
down in his system, eventually there'll be none left.

263
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,996
That's not good.

264
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,041
No. In fact, I'm quite certain it'll kill him.

265
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,837
<i>It's possible his body's become</i>
<i>dependant on the enzyme to function.</i>

266
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,963
What's the treatment?

267
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,258
We wean him off it. Sneak his body
chemistry back to normal incrementally.

268
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,469
Then we're gonna have to get more of this enzyme.

269
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,638
Aye. With your permission Doctor,

270
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,891
I'd like to harvest it from the Wraith bodies
in the morgue. I know it's a little bit creepy, but...

271
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,768
<i>Elizabeth. Major Sheppard?</i>

272
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,145
Do whatever you have to do.

273
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,731
- What is it?
- You're gonna wanna get up here.

274
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,290
Aren't you supposed to be getting some sleep, Rodney?

275
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,835
I was trying to do just that, but someone thought I should
know the deep space sensors were back up and running.

276
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:10,961
Yes, and?

277
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,340
They picked up 12 more hive ships
travelling in hyperspace.

278
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:19,678
Their course and speed will
bring them here in 36 hours.

279
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,530
12 hive ships?

280
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,992
The Cruisers that got away
probably called for reinforcements.

281
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,288
Our research shows there are
at least 60 hive ships in this galaxy.

282
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,040
But who knows how many more could be on the way?

283
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,251
- At least the shield's up and running.
- That only buys us time!

284
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,211
I like time.

285
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:55,589
Look, the first siege of Atlantis lasted for years.
I mean,

286
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,550
with only one functioning ZPM,
we can't expect to hold on that long.

287
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,636
Can we submerge the city again?

288
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,847
It's a city, not a yo-yo.

289
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,682
Look, I don't even know
how they did it the first time.

290
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,601
How long until they arrive?

291
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,728
A little over a day.

292
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,022
You know what?

293
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,525
I'm sick of this.

294
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,109
I'm sorry?

295
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,072
I mean, sitting around waiting for them to show up.
I say we take the fight to them.

296
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,949
We've got one ship, Major.

297
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,203
We got one ship with an Asgard shield,
an armoury full of nukes and beaming technology.

298
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,164
- That evens the odds out a lot.
- Twelve ships and their escorts.

299
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm telling you.
We've gotta send these guys a message.

300
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,878
We're not like the Ancients.
We're not gonna sit around and wait.

301
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:36,380
If they don't back off,

302
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,092
we have the capacity and the will
to go kick their asses for a change.

303
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,344
How do I fight a ship in hyperspace?

304
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,932
The Wraith's faster than light travel is not
as the Asgard hyperdrive aboard the Daedalus.

305
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,104
Not only slower,
they need to travel in a series of jumps.

306
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,439
So if my calculations are correct,

307
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:59,778
they'll make one last stop here, fifty light years away,
before they make the final jump to Atlantis.

308
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,364
Dr Weir?

309
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,160
It will feel good to have them
on the defensive for a change.

310
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,413
Alright then,

311
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,041
let's do this.

312
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,222
Scanners are clear, Sir. No contacts.

313
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,473
I hope we're in the right spot.

314
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,102
They'll be here.
I'm willing to trust Rodney about these things.

315
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,692
I've set the warheads to go off
one second after reintegration.

316
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:43,238
So I assume you're fine with that?

317
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,120
OK...

318
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,876
They are angry. I can feel it.

319
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,880
Word of our success might spread to other worlds.
They want us silenced.

320
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,007
You can sense that?

321
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,344
The Wraith warrior were in such close proximity...

322
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,347
Excuse me.

323
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,431
Ford!

324
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,266
I'd like to report for duty ma'am.

325
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,645
Dr. Beckett released you?

326
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,356
Why wouldn't he, I'm fine.

327
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:25,822
If we can hit the first one or two as soon as
they exit hyperspace, I think that'll send a message.

328
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,407
Who knows, maybe they'll surrender.

329
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,617
Sir, we have a contact.

330
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,245
Stand by for weapons deployment.
Shields at max power.

331
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:31,954
Shields up.

332
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,587
Novak, this is Caldwell.
Begin deployment at your discretion.

333
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:44,800
I have a weapons lock on the
coordinates of the first enemy vessel.

334
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,719
Got it! First weapon away, Colonel.

335
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,268
That's a kill.

336
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,103
<i>Stand by.</i>

337
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,527
Alright, that's two.

338
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,571
It's working.

339
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,906
Stand by for coordinates.

340
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,158
The other hive ships are altering course to intercept.

341
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,493
- Take us right at them.
- Yes Sir.

342
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,126
They're flanking us.

343
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,211
Forward rail guns, return fire.

344
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,381
Novak we need to speed up deployment of
those nukes or this fight is going to be over soon.

345
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:32,598
The enemy has engaged counter measures
that are preventing our ability to transport.

346
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,601
- Is there a way to counter the counter?
- None.

347
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:40,480
<i>Colonel, we have a problem. They've found a way to jam</i>
<i>us from beaming onto their ship. We don't know how.</i>

348
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:44,026
Rear shield emitters are down to forty percent!

349
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,032
Central rail gun two is out of action!

350
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,201
Take engines to max. Foster!

351
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,453
Try keeping the damaged shield from the main force.

352
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:10,385
Sir! One of the cruisers is approaching
on a parrallel course.

353
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,598
They may intend to board us!
That was their strategy when they attacked Atlantis.

354
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,766
Shield status?

355
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,226
Under 20%.

356
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,269
Set course for Atlantis. Engage hyperdrive.

357
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,437
Hyperdrive. Yes Sir!

358
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:22,147
This fight is over.

359
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,334
<i>Bottom line is, it didn't work.</i>

360
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,628
At least you gave them something to think about.

361
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:49,299
We'll see. I doubt very much that that tactic won't
work again and the Daedalus has sustained damage.

362
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,844
It was still the right thing to do.

363
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,347
We should make it home before they do.

364
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,183
<i>I hope so.</i>
<i>We'll keep the porch light on for you.</i>

365
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,061
OK, what are our options?

366
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,065
Well let me see, we've got slow death,
quick death, painful death, cold lonely death...

367
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,945
OK, you said yourself that the shield
should buy us some time.

368
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:10,988
Where do you want me?

369
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,531
Lieutenant, I...

370
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,742
Lt! What do you think you're doing here?

371
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,036
- I'm fine Doc, really. It's cool.
- The hell you are. You should be back in bed.

372
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,539
I feel great. Just drop it.

373
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,542
I will not just drop it.
Not twenty minutes ago, you were at death's door.

374
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,712
I don't care how spry you feel,
you need to be under medical supervision.

375
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,756
I'm good to go.

376
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,926
I appreciate your enthusiasm Lieutenant, but Doctor...

377
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,597
I'm serious! Just let me prove it.
Just give me something to do.

378
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,557
- I don't think so.
- Don't push me around!

379
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,603
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

380
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,566
Put him down Aiden, he's trying to help you.

381
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,738
Aiden.

382
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,171
I'm sorry Doc.

383
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,674
- I don't know why I...
- You need to be under medical supervision.

384
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,761
He's right, Lieutenant.

385
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,305
We just wanna know why
you're suddenly feeling this way.

386
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,601
OK,

387
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,144
I'll go back.

388
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,230
Good, that's what you should do.

389
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,192
Yes ma'am.

390
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,036
Sedate him if you have to.

391
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:42,079
Aye.

392
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,350
<i>It's starting to affect his brain chemistry.</i>

393
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,855
<i>There's no way you could have known that Carson,</i>

394
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,398
<i>and it's better this than death.</i>

395
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,275
<i>We need to be more aggressive</i>

396
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:12,943
<i>wean him off quicker than I expected to.</i>

397
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,237
<i>It'll be painful and arduous,</i>

398
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:16,905
<i>but I think it may be our only option.</i>

399
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,365
Now I've sedated him,

400
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,868
but he should definitely be under secure supervision.

401
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,536
I've already stationed a guard at the door.

402
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,413
<i>Doctor Weir,</i>

403
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,124
<i>the Daedalus is requesting</i>
<i>permission to land on the east pier.</i>

404
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,377
Permission granted. I'll meet them there.

405
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,940
Welcome back to Atlantis, Colonel.

406
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,192
The Wraith are right behind us.

407
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,443
I wasn't expecting you to land.

408
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,988
Until repairs are complete, the Daedalus is going
to need Atlantis' shields as much as you do.

409
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,239
<i>Doctor Weir,</i>

410
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,158
<i>the hive ships are emmerging from hyperspace.</i>

411
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:02,576
We're on our way.

412
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:17,591
- Ford!
- Don't move or I'll shoot!

413
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,261
Where's the rest of the enzyme!

414
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:22,387
There is no more.

415
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,473
I saw you extract it, don't lie to me!
Where is it?

416
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,098
No, I'm not lying!

417
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:29,603
Where is it?

418
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,563
You're not thinking straight son.

419
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:33,857
You're all afraid of me.

420
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,151
Look at what you're doing,
we have good reason to be.

421
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,570
- I'm gonna die if I don't get it!
- Aiden, you're not gonna die.

422
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,279
Shut up!

423
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:46,995
I'm not gonna ask again.

424
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,559
Is that all of it?

425
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,646
- I promise you.
- Toss it over.

426
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,106
Toss it!

427
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,155
Don't follow me.

428
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,917
They're getting into some sort of formation.

429
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:36,628
Move, move!

430
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,568
The shield's holding under bombardment,
but it's under incredible strain.

431
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:00,819
How long will it hold?

432
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,238
Well if they stop firing at it,
it'll last almost indefinitely,

433
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,907
- but with this kind of...
- Are we talking months, weeks?

434
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:05,490
Days.

435
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,744
At this rate the ZPM will be depleted within days.

436
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,090
It's almost pretty, isn't it?

437
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,010
Almost. But not quite.

438
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,359
We need to get the Daedalus back
into fighting form within 24 hours,

439
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,319
but I think the next engagement
gonna have the same result.

440
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,698
Even if we were able to destroy
these ships this instant,

441
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,244
more would be here in a few days
and even more a few days after that.

442
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,829
From where I'm standing
I just don't see how we can win this.

443
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,623
Well now we know how the Ancients must have felt.

444
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,125
Atlantis is the only way to Earth.

445
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,211
As long as they know we're here,

446
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:00,462
they're just going to keep coming.

447
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,173
As long as they know that we're here.

448
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:04,842
What do you mean?

449
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:08,595
Zelenka just said that as long as they know
that we're here, they'll keep coming.

450
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:09,847
Yes, he said that.

451
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,849
Well what if they thought we were gone?

452
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,643
Then there'd be no reason for them to stay.

453
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:15,561
Exactly.

454
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:16,937
Exactly what?

455
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,522
We disappear.

456
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,651
Destroy the city you mean?

457
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,236
No, we just make it look like we did.

458
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:26,154
How?

459
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:27,865
We cloak it.

460
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,783
Yes, yes!

461
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,578
The Puddle Jumpers are equipped
with cloaking technology,

462
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:35,998
which renders them invisible to the naked eye
and to Wraith scans.

463
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,459
If we just simply remove one of the cloak generators
from the Puddle Jumper...

464
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,794
I wouldn't say simply, but yes,

465
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,005
by interfacing a Jumper's

466
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,550
stealth mode generator with the city's shield,
we should be able to render the city invisible.

467
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:47,593
That's all well and good,

468
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,721
but I think if the city were to suddenly disappear,
they might be able to put one and one together.

469
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,556
Which is why we fake a self destruct.

470
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,059
Have the Daedalus beam a nuke right
above the city shield and then detonate it.

471
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,688
While their sensors are blinded, we cloak the city.

472
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:00,606
When the smoke clears...

473
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,565
Nothing but ocean.

474
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,108
What about high radiation?

475
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,361
I should be able to calculate with reasonable accuracy,
how long to wait before we switch over to the cloak.

476
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:08,030
But what about the displacement issues?

477
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,489
It's called planet emulation.That's the easy part.

478
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,909
OK. What about the hard part?

479
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:13,744
Hard part?

480
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,997
Ah! The cloak, for all intents and purposes,
will replace the shield,

481
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:20,751
which means that we'll be
completely unprotected once the cloak's activated.

482
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,419
We'll be completely exposed?

483
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,713
Well... yes.

484
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,924
So if they're not fooled by the ruse...

485
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:31,178
Then they destroy the city, which I remind
you is exactly what we were going to do anyway.

486
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:33,680
What about the Daedalus?

487
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,723
Well if it doesn't work,

488
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,684
our shields should be sufficiently recharged
to break through their lines and escape.

489
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:38,685
We know we can outrun them.

490
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:44,525
Alright. Let's get as many non essential personnel
onto your ship as we can. Just in case.

491
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,027
I love this idea. I really do.

492
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:51,198
But the Wraith are aware
that we have cloaking technology.

493
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:52,658
They are close.

494
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,203
Close enough for me to connect to them.

495
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:01,542
If I can convince them that we intend
to destroy Atlantis rather than allow it to be taken,

496
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,710
just before the explosion occurs.

497
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,796
How will we know whether or not they believe you?

498
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,298
Once they stop the bombardment, we'll know.

499
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,341
He's right.

500
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,554
If the Wraith believe that
we intend to destroy the city,

501
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,849
the last thing they'll wanna do,
is to help us do it.

502
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:19,977
How much time do you need?

503
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,019
Oh uh...

504
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,062
- Week.
- Couple of hours.

505
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,147
I'll take the second estimate.
Go!

506
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:27,693
You're in union?

507
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:28,610
Couple of hours.

508
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,034
He escaped.

509
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,286
- What?
- Who?

510
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:42,082
Ford. He was able to disarm one of the marines
and got away with all the Wraith enzyme I had left.

511
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:43,750
Ford, this is Sheppard, come in.

512
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:48,964
Ford? I need you to come back
to the control room buddy, we're all going home.

513
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,135
<i>Lt do you copy?</i>

514
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,263
You're just afraid of me Major.

515
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,557
You're afraid of what I can do now.

516
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:01,268
I'm not listening to you.

517
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,022
I'm going after him.

518
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,733
Now's not the right time!

519
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:50,275
Now I'm jolting you out of this the second
I feel there's a problem.

520
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,944
I understand.

521
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,197
We're all set down here.

522
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,574
Good! We're almost ready up here. Rodney?

523
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:58,200
Ready!

524
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,825
Radek!

525
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,162
Ready to go.

526
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,290
<i>Colonel Caldwell.</i>

527
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:06,875
The people are securely aboard.

528
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,461
The warhead has been armed
and is ready for deployment on your mark.

529
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,129
<i>Very good! Stand by!</i>

530
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,109
Dr Beckett?

531
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:35,320
Teyla.

532
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,406
I'm ready.

533
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,117
We're good to go.

534
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,870
Alright, let's send our message.

535
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,222
I am on one of the ships.

536
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,185
They see me.

537
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:15,110
Teyla?

538
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,280
The message has been delivered.

539
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:19,740
Elizabeth, it's done.

540
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,086
Seems that they heard Teyla loud and clear.
Rodney?

541
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,755
- Yeah! I think I'm ready.
- You think?

542
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,049
I am definitely ready.

543
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,177
Daedalus, launch the weapon.

544
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,428
Give me city wide.

545
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,973
Attention all personnel.
Prepare for detonation flash.

546
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,850
Shut 'em down!

547
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:56,860
The weapon is away.

548
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:16,588
Rodney?

549
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:20,217
If we switch to cloak before the blast radius diminishes,
we'll all be incinerated. Five seconds.

550
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,971
Stand by to engage sublight engines on my mark.

551
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,013
Standing by Sir.

552
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,772
I think that was definitely five seconds.

553
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:35,649
We're cloaked.

554
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:37,401
How can you tell?

555
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,528
They're scanning for us.

556
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:47,953
I could have shot you a couple of times by now.

557
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,792
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

558
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,546
Look,

559
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:02,759
why don't you and I just go someplace
where we can talk.

560
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,428
You're trying to change me back.

561
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,347
No, I'm just trying to help you.

562
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,106
No you're not.

563
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:17,566
Crap.

564
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,204
I don't think they've detected us.

565
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:33,624
Why are you whispering?

566
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,794
I don't know, it just
seems like the right thing to do.

567
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,088
Is it working or not?

568
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,227
What the hell...?

569
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:01,568
That's Ford.

570
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,654
I assume that's him in the Jumper?

571
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,076
- Can they detect that?
- I don't know.

572
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:09,910
Shut it down!

573
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,578
I can't the Jumper's in control!

574
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:17,626
Ford! Stand down, this is a direct order!

575
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,352
Where the hell is he going?

576
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,357
It won't matter if the Wraith can detect
the gate activity through the cloak.

577
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:42,025
There's only one way to know.

578
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:52,786
<i>This is Daedalus. Our sensors indicate</i>
<i>the Wraith fleet is breaking orbit.</i>

579
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:56,623
I can confirm that.

580
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,292
They're headed for hyperspace.

581
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,378
Look, I'm gonna keep the cloak up
for a while just to be sure, but

582
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,088
I think they bought it.

583
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:17,895
The gate address will be in the log.
There's still a chance...

584
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:18,729
Doesn't matter where he goes.

585
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:21,815
The second he gets to wherever he's going,

586
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,151
he's gonna ditch the Jumper,

587
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,485
turn around,

588
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,739
and dial another address. One we can't trace.

589
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:30,699
We'll find him.

590
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,075
Maybe.

591
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,957
At least we're still around to try.

592
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:43,545
Yeah.
