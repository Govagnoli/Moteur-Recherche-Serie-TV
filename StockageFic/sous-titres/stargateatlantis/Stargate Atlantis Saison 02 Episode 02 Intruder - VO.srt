1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,920
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,256
We saw the hive ship blow up.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>I assure you Dr McKay that</i>
<i>Major Sheppard is alive and well.</i>

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,093
Who is this?

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,764
<i>Steven Caldwell. Commander of the Daedalus.</i>
<i>We are ready to assist you.</i>

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,434
Rodney we need the shield up
in 40 seconds or we're dead!

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,730
With only one functioning ZPM,
we can't expect to hold on that long.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,315
<i>Are we talking months, weeks?</i>

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,107
Days.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,984
<i>- What if they thought we were gone?</i>
<i>- Destroy the city you mean?</i>

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,528
No, we just make it look like we did.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>We fake a self destruct.</i>

13
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,322
Is it working or not?

14
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,823
I think they bought it.

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,120
He should be dead.

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,207
- I'd like to report for duty ma'am.
- Dr. Beckett released you?

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:42,960
That's Ford.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,169
I assume that's him in the Jumper?

19
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,839
- Shut it down!
- I can't the Jumper's in control!

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,091
We'll find him.

21
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,717
Maybe.

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,578
Hey, what are you doing up so late?

23
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,454
Couldn't sleep.

24
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,501
Must be the burden of command.

25
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,172
You know, ever since I was promoted to Lt Colonel.

26
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,176
Alright John, it's been almost a month.

27
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,846
When are you going to stop trying to find
a way to bring that up in every single conversation.

28
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,181
You gotta understand.

29
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,726
There's a lot of people in the Air Force
who never thought I'd make it past Captain.

30
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,439
Well obviously, the people who's
opinions matter the most thought otherwise.

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,363
What about you? What are you still doing up?

32
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,784
I think I got used to fall asleep
to the sound of the ocean.

33
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,872
Well McKay say's we're already
at the edge of the Pegasus Galaxy.

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,708
You'll be fine once we get back to Atlantis.

35
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,794
You know it's funny.

36
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,508
I spent the past year wondering if I'd ever see
Earth again and as soon as I got there...

37
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,928
I know how you feel.

38
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,515
God, it was extremely convenient
to be able to step through the gate

39
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:24,520
and be at Stargate Command in an instant
and now this feels extremely inconvenient.

40
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,357
Having to spend 18 day's
cooped up in this ship to get back.

41
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,736
Until we find another ZPM to power the Earth gate,
that's just the way it's gonna have to be.

42
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,698
Dr Weir. Colonel Sheppard. There's been an accident.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,710
That's Doctor Monroe. What happened?

44
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,504
I don't know.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,298
But he's dead.

47
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,363
Right, one, two, three.

48
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,908
Carry on.

49
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,287
How did he die?

50
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,790
I'm not 100% certain,
but there are burn marks on his fingertips.

51
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,458
Season 2 - Episode 2
The Intruder

52
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,044
Obviously there was a short.

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,423
Panels open, circuits are charred.

54
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,176
There's not enough juice in those circuits
to kill anyone. Doctor?

55
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,387
I'll know more once I've had a chance
to examine the body more thoroughly.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,891
Do you know what he was working on?

57
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,519
Computer diagnostics. Strictly routine.
I've got security camera footage.

58
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,870
What happened there?

59
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,330
I don't know. It's a camera malfunction.

60
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,708
Right before he was killed? Interesting coincidence.

61
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,253
Actually, I think it makes sense.
Look, Colonel Caldwell is right.

62
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,882
There's not enough juice in those circuits
to kill someone. At least not normally.

63
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,300
What are you thinking?

64
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,303
It's possible there was some sort of
isolated power surge in this section.

65
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,347
That would explain the lost camera,
the malfunctioning door.

66
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:29,436
So, when the door control didn't respond he took off
the panel to bypass the circuits and received a fatal jolt?

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,854
Like I said, it's possible.

68
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,274
Look, I recommend we drop out of hyperspace,
run a full diagnostic on the power distribution system.

69
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,277
No. We drop out now, we risk being detected.

70
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,779
That's true. I just think that if we were...

71
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,366
We're back in Atlantis in less than two days.
You can do your diagnostic then.

72
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,743
Colonel, are you sure that's wise?

73
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,913
With all due respect Doctor,
you got back to Earth through the Stargate.

74
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,957
This is my third trip on
the Daedalus, between galaxies.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,335
I understand that, but this ship is relatively new
and there might be some problems...

76
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:57,172
Doctor! A word please.

77
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,225
I know the chain of command can get a little fuzzy
on Atlantis, but that's not gonna happen here.

78
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
You got a problem with my orders,
you take it to me in private.

79
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,146
Otherwise keep your opinions to yourself.

80
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,607
Are you sure that's what this is all about?

81
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,568
I got a job to do, Doctor.

82
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,278
But not the one you wanted.

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,994
We understand the international community has approved

84
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,582
a significant increase in personnel
and resources for the Atlantis mission.

85
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,919
Now that we have a ZPM,
the city can support a much larger contingent.

86
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,883
Of course, if there's a filling in a corresponding
increase in military presence would also be prudent.

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,053
I agree. That's why I want
the Major Sheppard to come back with me.

88
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,724
In fact I brought all my senior staff back.

89
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,436
I think it's only fair that they participate
in the selection process

90
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,147
of the new personnel in their respective departments.

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,941
That's kind of what we wanted to talk to you about.

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,404
In your report, you single Major Sheppard
out for a lot of credit.

93
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,239
That's right.

94
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,285
You were also candid enough
to document several occasions

95
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,873
in which you and the Major
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

96
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,877
In particular, there was an incident
involving an alien nano-virus,

97
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,923
in which Major Sheppard directly
disobeyed one of your orders.

98
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,010
He also saved a lot of lives that day.

99
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,641
Well, the Major's courage and ingenuity
are not in question here.

100
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,977
His ability to follow the proper chain of command, is!

101
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,604
I'm not military General.

102
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,523
But you are the leader of the expedition.

103
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:42,444
You see Doctor, from our point of view, Major Sheppard's
independant nature causes a bit of a problem.

104
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:51,370
If he can disobey you he may see fit to do the same to
the new Commander of the military contingent on Atlantis.

105
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:55,415
Excuse me? And when did this happen?

106
00:06:55,499 --> 00:07:01,463
Of course the decision hasn't been made yet.
But we do have a candidate in mind.

107
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,723
Atlantis HAS a military Commander.

108
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,893
You had a military Commander. Colonel Sumner.

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:21,108
When he was killed,
Major Sheppard correctly assumed the position,

110
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,278
until a proper replacement could be brought in.

111
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:29,491
Doctor, you can't be suggesting that a mission
of this importance be trusted to a Major.

112
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,952
And one with a questionable record, at that.

113
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,081
Major Sheppard's record before
he joined my team doesn't concern me.

114
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,669
All I can tell you is that if it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

115
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,172
And as for his rank.

116
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,635
Well, if that's not good enough for you?
You're just gonna have to promote him.

117
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:49,845
Doctor.

118
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,930
I shouldn't have to remind you gentlemen,

119
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,727
that I continue to have the support
of the President and our foreign allies.

120
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,063
You don't wanna fight me on this one.

121
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,209
Colonel Caldwell!

122
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,543
What is it doctor?

123
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,546
Look. I realise that you've already made it clearly that
you're not big on the whole dropping out of hyperspace.

124
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,925
Which I understand, given that we're in the middle
of some uncharted section of the Pegasus Galaxy

125
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010
with who knows what waiting for us around the corner.

126
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,136
Doctor?

127
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,390
Look, I think it's possible that Dr Monroe's death
might not have been an accident.

128
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,683
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,937
I checked the power distribution logs against
the time code on the security camera.

130
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,732
There was an unexplained spike, but it happened
thirty seconds after the camera went out.

131
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,691
So?

132
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,445
So that means the malfunction in the door and
the camera were not caused by the same problem.

133
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,322
Major Sheppard was right.
There's too much of a coincidence.

134
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,282
You mean, Lt.-Col. Sheppard.

135
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,661
Right. That's gonna take some getting used to.

136
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,621
Is that the only evidence you have?

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,705
No, something else.

138
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,626
It looks like Dr Monroe was in the process
of enabling certain computer security protocols.

139
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,754
Designed to... isolate and
shut down corrupted programs.

140
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,964
What programs?

141
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,174
I don't know, that's just it.
He was killed before he could finish.

142
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,594
You're telling me there's a problem with the ship
and someone killed Monroe to cover it up?

143
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,974
I know this sounds crazy, but there is definitely
more going on here than random malfunctions.

144
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,604
Bridge this is Caldwell.
Drop us out of hyperspace immediately.

145
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,959
If I may be so bold. What exactly are we looking for?

146
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,587
Any indication that someone's been
tampering with the ships computers.

147
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,840
Perhaps you could be more specific.

148
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,508
Not really, no.

149
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,761
What was that?

150
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,388
Nothing.

151
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,558
Look, just check the major systems.
Propulsion, navigation, life support.

152
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,561
Look for anything out of the ordinary.
Lindstrom and I will check power distribution,

153
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,897
see if we can figure out what caused the power spike.

154
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,317
- How's it going Rodney?
- It's going to take a while.

155
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,614
Don't stare. He hates it when people stare.

156
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,700
Am I the only one who thinks it's strange
we're working with an alien?

157
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,704
Intergalactic hyperdrive technology
is kind of new to us, so we need his help.

158
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,582
Is he supposed to be naked like that?

159
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,459
Lindstrom!

160
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:46,146
OK, let's speed this up. You take the logs
and I'm gonna take a look at... junction box!

161
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,496
I got nothing. You?

162
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,997
Give me a second.

163
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,208
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

164
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,125
What?

165
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,836
I think I got something here.

166
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,420
Well what?

167
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,968
Coolant leak, we gotta get the hell out of here!

168
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,138
Lindstrom!

169
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,852
Lindstrom!

170
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,236
Lindstrom!

171
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,239
Lindstrom! You alright.

172
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,831
Yeah, I'm OK. How am I gonna get out of here?

173
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:49,585
I don't know. Just sit tight. We're gonna need
to shut down the leak and vent the room...

174
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,047
Rodney!

175
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,801
Lindstrom! Lindstrom you reading me?

176
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,346
Lindstrom, are you reading me?

177
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,271
What the hell are you doing?

178
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,861
The airlock is opening! Override the system!

179
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,237
Rodney help me!!

180
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,280
Lindstrom!

181
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,532
Rodney!

182
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,243
Lindstrom!

183
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,045
Oh my God.

184
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,977
I already told you I'm fine.

185
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,523
He's right. It appears he didn't inhale
enough toxins to cause any permanent damage.

186
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,652
Although, a few more seconds of exposure,
it would have been quite a different story.

187
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,861
Thank you Doctor.

188
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,658
I assume this time we can definitely
rule out random malfunctions?

189
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,869
Lindstrom found something new. He was trying
to tell me what it was when the leak happened.

190
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,079
What were you looking for?

191
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,415
We were trying to trace the source
of the power spike that killed Dr Monroe.

192
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,708
Who else knew what you were doing?

193
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,377
A lot of people knew that we were running diagnostics,

194
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,046
but no-one knew that we were
in that particular room at that exact moment.

195
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:23,804
Security camera's. If the person who killed Monroe was
able to get into the system to erase evidence,

196
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,349
there's no reason he couldn't do the same thing
to keep tabs on the investigation.

197
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,768
Assuming it's a he.

198
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,855
How many personnel onboard have
the technical skills to do something like this?

199
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,441
Everybody. That's what you get for
assembling a team of brilliant scientists.

200
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,861
I can't believe it would be one of our own people.

201
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,071
Isn't it possible there's an intruder onboard?

202
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,075
We used the lifesigns detector
to do a head count. We didn't get any extra signals.

203
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,328
Well a hibernating Wraith? They can avoid detection.

204
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:53,333
We've seen that tactic before. Beam in, lay low,
then look for the chance to conduct sabotage.

205
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,129
That was on Atlantis. It's been at least
two months since this ship encountered a Wraith.

206
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,423
There's no way one of them could have
stowed onboard for that long.

207
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,135
He's right. They did a full decontamination sweep
back on Earth. They would have found something.

208
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,349
Alright then. As of this moment I want
all civilian personnel confined to their quarters.

209
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:10,559
What?

210
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,728
Present company excepted of course.

211
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,356
Colonel, with all due respect, some of those people
could be extremely helpful in the investigation.

212
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,775
I'm sorry Doctor, but I can't trust any of them

213
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,278
for the simple reason that
I didn't have any say in their selections.

214
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,572
Somebody else was in charge of that process.

215
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:32,039
Look at this. Four years relief
work in the Sudan and Ethiopia.

216
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,042
Graduate studies at John Hopkins and Harvard.

217
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,960
Half a dozen research grants.

218
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:41,673
And she also enjoys judo, horseback riding,
origami and something called base jumping.

219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,551
Parachuting from cliffs and tall buildings.

220
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,011
Oh! Of course.

221
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,471
You said you wanted the best.

222
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,599
All of these people are more qualified than I am.
How am I supposed to choose between them?

223
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,478
Carson, you're my Chief Surgeon.
No-one is more qualified than you.

224
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:02,486
Well, I've managed to make a short list.

225
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,322
I was hoping you'd make the final selections.

226
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,575
This is your short list?

227
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,123
Did you review the file of a Dr Simon Wallis?

228
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,960
Aye. He was also more qualified than I am.

229
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,670
Why isn't he on the list?

230
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,215
Well, the candidates were required to sign on
for a blank commitment to a one-year term.

231
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,012
Doctor Wallis has been given security clearance.
He knows what this is all about.

232
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,306
Maybe that's the problem.

233
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,600
What do you mean?

234
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,227
He hasn't signed.

235
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,444
When were you gonna tell me?

236
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,116
There's nothing to tell. I mean,
I haven't said yes, but I haven't said no either.

237
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:54,496
You do realise you are not gonna make
the final list of candidates unless you commit!

238
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,084
Elizabeth, you know you can't just come back after a year
and expect me to drop everything on two weeks notice.

239
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,503
I have responsabilities here,
I have patients, I have a surge.

240
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,716
I know, I know, and I would never
diminish the importance of you work.

241
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,719
But you have to understand that every single person

242
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,430
on this entire expedition
is in the exact same situation.

243
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,974
I mean, In fact it's why they were
chosen in the first place.

244
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,142
I understand.

245
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,520
Look, I just need a little more time.

246
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,620
Doctor McKay. You are just in time.

247
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,914
For what? What are you looking at?

248
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,291
The sabotage we've been searching for.

249
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,793
It's a virus.

250
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,462
How perceptive of you.

251
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,214
Where did you find it?

252
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,716
One of the navigational computers.

253
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:52,596
There is evidence of it in communications
and some of the propulsion systems as well.

254
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,639
So it's spreading.

255
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,266
- Yes, and changing.
- What do you mean?

256
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,102
It appears to be rewriting itself as it grows.

257
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,565
It is unlike any human-engineered
programme I have ever encountered.

258
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,403
Air person, don't be there.

259
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,948
What are you doing?

260
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,825
I'm just checking something, I'm sure it is impossible.

261
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,707
Crap.

262
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,209
What did you do?

263
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,587
I just ran it through a translation programme.

264
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,840
It's Wraith.

265
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,554
'Crap' indeed.

266
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,683
A Wraith computer virus.

267
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,935
It was probably downloaded
during our last little encounter.

268
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,063
Well, if it's been there all this time,
why are we just noticing it now?

269
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,607
Well, in all likelihood it was
transmitted in a compressed format.

270
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,945
It took a while to unfold, to spread
to the point where it could affect our systems.

271
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,656
I think it probably happened
during the return flight to Earth.

272
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,075
Since then, it's been dormant,
waiting for some kind of a trigger.

273
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,326
Like what?

274
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,414
Possibly the fact that we're once again
in proximity to Wraith territory?

275
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,667
I think it was ultimately designed to
take control of the navigational system,

276
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,961
fly the ship right to them.

277
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,755
If they get their hands on the Daedalus,

278
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,301
they'll not only have access to
the intergalactic hyperdrive technology

279
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,928
but they'll have all the navigation
data that'll lead them straight to Earth.

280
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,514
That's what they wanted all along.
A new feeding ground.

281
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,059
That still doesn't explain who killed
Dr. Monroe and Dr. Lindstrom.

282
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,187
That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was the virus.

283
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,317
Look, it's an A.I., an artificial intelligence.
It can think for itself,

284
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,777
- adapt itself to new situations...
- Protect itself.

285
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:31,695
Exactly.

286
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,199
It knew that Lindstrom and Monroe
were gonna expose it, so it got rid of them.

287
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,700
Can it take over the whole ship?

288
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:41,079
Not entirely. You have to remember that
there are hundreds of individual computers on board.

289
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,541
A lot of them are interconnected so we tend to think
of them as one big machine but that's not really the case.

290
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:50,589
There are dozens of back-ups and redundancies, and some
systems like life support are deliberately isolated.

291
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,133
So they can't kill us all by venting the atmosphere?

292
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,843
That was the good news.

293
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,970
The bad news is some of the more complex systems

294
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:01,225
like navigation and propulsion require a certain
amount of interconnectivity to function properly.

295
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,478
In all likelihood, the virus has spread
so far through those systems

296
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,231
that to isolate it
will make the ship impossible to fly.

297
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,901
Until we figure out how to get rid of it,
we're stuck here.

298
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,280
Colonel Caldwell. Sir, we just
began broadcasting a distress call.

299
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,323
What are you talking about?

300
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,242
It just came on by itself, sir.

301
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,576
Shut it down!

302
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,916
I'm locked out, sir.

303
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,336
It's the virus. That's what I mean
about adapting itself to new situations.

304
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,007
It doesn't have enough control yet to fly us to
the Wraith so instead it's calling the Wraith to us.

305
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,635
And right now, we are sitting ducks.

306
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,234
What are you doing?

307
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,695
Theoretically we should be able to
cut power to the long-range transmitter.

308
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,489
You won't be able to send messages,
but neither will the virus.

309
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,615
Theoretically.

310
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,035
Well, it's pretty smart. So far,
whatever we've tried, it's been one step ahead of us.

311
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,704
Try it now.

312
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,710
It's no good, sir. We're still broadcasting.

313
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,129
Alright, that leaves us one choice.

314
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,256
We need to do a full system shutdown.

315
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,842
We'll wipe everything, reboot, load clean back-ups.

316
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,343
Will that really work?

317
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,678
Absolutely...

318
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,054
I think.

319
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,347
How long will it take?

320
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,683
Well it's not like the ship's got an on/off button.

321
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,810
We need some time to prepare say, an hour, maybe two?

322
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,897
Every minute we wait,
we increase our chances of being detected.

323
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,107
We need to shut off the transmitter array now.

324
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,275
Do you have an idea?

325
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,402
As a matter of fact, I do.

326
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,571
But you're not gonna like it.

327
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:50,167
<i>Alright, Colonel, we've evacuated all sections</i>
<i>in the vicinity of the array and sealed the bulkheads.</i>

328
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,293
Understood.

329
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,254
All personnel, prepare for impact...

330
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,811
What's our status?

331
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,650
Transmitter is offline.
Distress signal has been disabled.

332
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,610
Well done, Colonel, return to the ship.

333
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,695
With pleasure.

334
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,540
Uh, here's a problem.

335
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,959
<i>My controls aren't responding.</i>

336
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,627
Say again?

337
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,588
<i>The Daedalus is behind me.</i>

338
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,091
I can't seem to turn around and ...

339
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,927
I am however picking up speed.

340
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,267
I should have seen this coming!

341
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,521
The navigational software in the F-302 is compatible
with our sublight system which would be infected.

342
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,565
The virus must have uploaded itself onto the ship.

343
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,608
What about the transport beam?

344
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,610
That'll work. Those systems are still clean.

345
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,822
Do it.

346
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,117
John? This is Elizabeth.

347
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,328
<i>Rodney seems to think</i>
<i>the virus has taken over your ship,</i>

348
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,830
<i>so we're gonna try and beam you out.</i>

349
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,207
Acknowledged.

350
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,709
Standby.

351
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,007
Ah, slight problem.

352
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:20,924
What?

353
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,512
The transport beam is tied to an Asgard sensor.
It's what we use to lock onto targets.

354
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,305
So?

355
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:30,392
So that particular piece of equipment was
located in the array that we just destroyed.

356
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,231
I could key the system to lock onto his radio signal.

357
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,692
It's what they used to do on the Prometheus
before they had Asgard sensors.

358
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:42,112
You'd better do it quick, because in about
three minutes he's gonna be out of range.

359
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,574
<i>John, we've run into a slight snag.</i>

360
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,619
<i>Rodney just has to make a few adjustments</i>
<i>before we can get you out of there.</i>

361
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,330
OK.

362
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,999
Don't worry. I'm not about to give up on you just yet.

363
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,178
Here you go.

364
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:07,721
Thanks.

365
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:11,558
I appreciate you coming here in person, Colonel.

366
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:17,147
Aiden and I were only cousins, but since he didn't
have any brothers or sisters, we became very close.

367
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,109
I want you to understand.
As far as I'm concerned he's still alive.

368
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,822
Till I see evidence to the contrary,
I intend to keep looking for him.

369
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,617
But you can't give me any details.

370
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,954
You can't tell me where he was stationed
or how he went missing

371
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,540
or what the chances are that I'll ever see him again.

372
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,333
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:40,379
This is exactly why I didn't want
you to speak with Aiden's grandparents.

374
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,714
They can't take this kind of thing right now.

375
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,678
I'm starting to think that maybe I should just
tell them that he's not coming home.

376
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,807
- At least then they would have some closure.
- You know, we're not there yet.

377
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,812
You know, Aiden mentioned
you in that taped message he sent.

378
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,772
He said you were a good man.

379
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,775
That he trusted you with his life.

380
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,152
You tell me, Colonel.

381
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,989
Was that trust misplaced?

382
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,825
- Colonel?
- Colonel?

383
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,536
Colonel!

384
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,873
<i>John, are you still there?</i>

385
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,124
Go ahead.

386
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,879
<i>We're gonna use your radio to target the transport beam.</i>
<i>We'll have you out of there in just a minute.</i>

387
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,464
Sounds good. So I'm still in range, right?

388
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,093
The truth is, it's never
been tested from this distance.

389
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,638
Rodney seems to think you'll be okay.

390
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,473
Well that's good.

391
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,143
I don't wanna leave any parts behind.

392
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,188
We're ready. I'm beaming him directly to the bridge.

393
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,212
Are you alright?

394
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,717
Two arms, ten fingers.
I'll check the rest later.

395
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,431
Alright Doctor, I've had enough of this.
I'd like to have my ship back please.

396
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,307
Right.

397
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:28,987
Do you mind?

398
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:33,992
This is what I do when I have problems with my laptop.
I turn it off and then I turn it on again.

399
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,203
I think this is a little bit
more complicated than that.

400
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm just saying, that if we're taking a page
from the John Sheppard book of computer repair,

401
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,583
we're really desperate.

402
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,419
Alright, Colonel! We're ready.

403
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:45,712
<i>Thank you.</i>

404
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:49,174
<i>All personnel, this is Colonel Caldwell.</i>
<i>Prepare for a full system shutdown.</i>

405
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,763
Alright Doctor. Go ahead.

406
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:55,806
And...

407
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,786
What's all this?

408
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:24,793
Well I figured we won't have
many more chances for a really good dinner.

409
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,964
I mean, the food on Atlantis, it's alright,
and some of the Athosian dishes are fantastic, but...

410
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,299
Elizabeth.

411
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,011
I'm not going.

412
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,350
I don't understand.

413
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,730
- You're the adventurer, not me.
- But I'm not.

414
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,608
I mean at least I wasn't, not before.

415
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:51,737
Look, the first time I stepped
through that gate I was terrified.

416
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,573
I knew I wasn't prepared for what I was getting into,

417
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,784
- but I took a chance.
- I know.

418
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,078
And I'm proud of you for that.

419
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,539
- Simon, we...
- There's something else.

420
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,005
I met someone.

421
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,314
You were gone for a long time, Elizabeth.

422
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,429
Engine room, what's our status?

423
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,516
All systems are functioning normally.
No sign of the virus.

424
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,810
Look's like it worked, Colonel.

425
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,313
May I suggest we vacate this system?

426
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,275
Our current position may well have been compromised.

427
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,609
Can you give me hyperdrive?

428
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,028
That will take longer to get back online.

429
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:17,114
I can get you sublight!

430
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,533
- Get us out of here, Major.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,422
What is it?

432
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,756
We're veering offcourse.

433
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,050
Navigational controls are not responding.

434
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:40,721
Damn it!

435
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,431
Engine room, what's happening?

436
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,101
The virus, it's back!
Now it's got full control of sublight navigation.

437
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:47,477
You said all systems were clean.

438
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,356
They were. When we did the reboot there was no sign
of the virus. This shouldn't be happening.

439
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,112
Sir, we've got another problem. It's our new heading.

440
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,282
We're on a collision course with the nearest star.

441
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,585
The virus returned almost immediately
after we restarted the system.

442
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,131
At the risk of repeating myself,
I thought we said we wiped it out.

443
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,633
We did. I must have missed something.

444
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,510
And it's gonna crash us into a sun?

445
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,761
Not exactly.

446
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:30,103
A more precise calculation of our heading show's
that we will not collide with the star, but rather,
make a close approach near it's coronasphere.

447
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:35,317
The ship will survive,
but the radiation will kill everyone onboard.

448
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,071
Why kill everyone if they already
have full navigational control?

449
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,658
The virus has access to our database.
It knows our tactics, our tendencies...

450
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,744
They know we'll destroy the ship
before we'll let it fall into Wraith hands.

451
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,455
Wait a minute!

452
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,918
There was a situation similar to this back at
Stargate Command. I remember reading the report.

453
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:59,967
An alien entity took control of the base computer,
so they did a systems shutdown to destroy it.
It survived by uploading itself onto a MALP.

454
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,718
OK, we don't have any MALP's.

455
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,929
No, we've got a bay full of F-302's.

456
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,432
We already know that the virus can upload itself
onto the ships navigational computers.

457
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:11,061
But it could use any one of those ships as a hiding
place while we wiped the Daedalus systems clean.

458
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,521
It's the only possible explanation.

459
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:13,564
So?

460
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:19,778
So, we physically pull the memory storage modules
from the 302's, we do another shutdown.
That should do the trick.

461
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:24,074
Contact the bridge.
Tell Caldwell we're on the way to the bay now.

462
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,510
It's not working.

463
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,596
Let's try another way.

464
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,982
It's the virus.
It must know what we're trying to do.

465
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,900
How's that possible?

466
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,402
It's thinking ahead, anticipating
our move, like in a chess match.

467
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,778
I hope you're good at chess.

468
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,865
I don't get to play much.
It's tough finding challenging opponents.

469
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:09,786
Bridge, this is Sheppard!

470
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,539
<i>Are there any open paths to the 302 bay?</i>

471
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,545
That's a negative Colonel. Look's like
the entire section's been sealed off. We're trying
to override it but we're not having any luck.

472
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:19,922
<i>You're gonna have to beam us in.</i>

473
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,006
Wait a minute!

474
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:26,178
The transport beam wasn't designed to beam
from one point to another point inside the ship.
We could end up rematerializing half inside a wall.

475
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,891
We're just gonna have to take that chance.

476
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,101
Right. Of course. Why not.

477
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,155
Colonel, we're ready.

478
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:48,659
<i>Standby.</i>
<i>Hermiod says we need to make a few adjustments first.</i>

479
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,123
<i>Activating transport beam now!</i>

480
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,509
It worked!

481
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh boy!

482
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:19,606
Sir, the bay doors are opening!

483
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,316
Bridge to engine room! Beam them out now!

484
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,612
We should really, really be dead right now.

485
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:26,905
I don't feel dead.

486
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,117
Colonel Sheppard. Doctor McKay. Can you hear me?

487
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,535
<i>Yeah we're reading you.</i>

488
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,457
<i>I have raised the fighter bay shield in order</i>
<i>to prevent the atmosphere from escaping. However,</i>

489
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,126
the virus has invaded the system

490
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,880
<i>and it is only a matter of</i>
<i>time before it gains control.</i>

491
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:47,968
<i>Therefore, I suggest you complete</i>
<i>your task as quickly as possible.</i>

492
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,286
<i>Colonel Sheppard, how's it coming?</i>

493
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,454
We're getting there!

494
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:24,922
I can no longer prevent the virus
from gaining complete control of the shield.

495
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,173
Beam them out.

496
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:30,969
Unfortunately, it appears that I have
lost control of that system as well.

497
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,721
<i>Sir, the shield is down.</i>

498
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:33,931
The cargo bay is decompressing.

499
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,390
Colonel Sheppard, come in!

500
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,353
<i>Colonel Sheppard, do you read me?</i>

501
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:46,026
<i>Colonel Sheppard, do you read?</i>

502
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,904
This is Sheppard. We're OK.

503
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:52,449
<i>We managed to get in</i>
<i>the last F-302 before we lost atmosphere.</i>

504
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,953
Any chance you could beam us out?

505
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,205
Sorry John, we lost the transport beam.

506
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,998
<i>You're gonna have to sit still for a while.</i>

507
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:03,085
We pulled all the memory units.
Another shutdown should work.

508
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,419
<i>Understood.</i>

509
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:05,420
Sir!

510
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:09,675
Understood. Engine room, this is bridge.
We don't have a lot of time before
we approach lethal radiation levels.

511
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:16,223
Most of the shutdown protocol's are still in place from
our first attempt. This will only take a few minutes.

512
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,683
Let's hope we have a few minutes.

513
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:25,148
You know, I've never actually been inside one
of these before today. It's a little, cramped, huh?

514
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,152
Just relax Rodney. We're safe for the moment.

515
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:37,160
Right. Quick question though, just out of curiosity.
How much... air, do these things carry?

516
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,078
Lots.

517
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:44,459
I'm just saying, because if this doesn't work and
we have to go off to another planet, who knows how long
we could get stuck in here and so it would...

518
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:50,090
You know what Rodney?
You're exactly right. It's a limited supply,
so why don't we conserve it, by you not talking?

519
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:51,383
At all!

520
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,098
All hands, this is Colonel Caldwell.
We're gonna give this another shot!

521
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,934
<i>We're initiating total systems shutdown now.</i>

522
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,616
Reinitialising.

523
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,540
Did it work?

524
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,959
We will know momentarily.

525
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:27,544
<i>This is Sheppard.</i>

526
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,629
What just happened?

527
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,213
<i>Standby.</i>

528
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,422
We're trying to figure that out.

529
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:34,009
I'm sorry sir.
We had navigation controls for a second,
but we just lost them again.

530
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:45,187
It didn't work.
We're still on course for the coronasphere.

531
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,652
This thing is like a damn cockroach.
You just can't kill it!

532
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,863
This should have worked!
We've disabled every navigational computer in this bay.

533
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,949
There's nowhere else on this ship, the virus can hide.

534
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,870
You're right.
There's nowhere on the ship for it to hide,
but we didn't get every computer.

535
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,081
What are you talking about?

536
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:04,915
We missed one.

537
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,141
What are you doing?

538
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,396
It's the last F-302 Rodney.
The one we left behind? It's tracking us.

539
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,983
That makes sense, but we can't go after it.
We need help from computers or navigation.

540
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,528
I don't need the navigational computer
to fly this thing, besides we're not going far.

541
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:41,368
<i>Engine room, this is Sheppard.</i>
<i>Prepare to initiate another shutdown on my command!</i>

542
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,661
John? What are you doing?

543
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,289
Getting to the last place the virus can hide.

544
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,999
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm nearly done!

545
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,881
<i>You'd better make this quick,</i>
<i>Sheppard. Radiation levels are beginning</i>
<i>to rise in the outer hull.</i>

546
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,007
Understood.

547
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:08,478
What is that beeping?

548
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,858
Something just locked onto us.
Hold on!

549
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,876
What happened to intertial dampers?

550
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,712
At these speeds you're gonna feel
the tight turns even with the dampers.

551
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,047
Now he tells me.

552
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:54,316
I have them on my screens.
The computer controlled ship is preparing to fire.

553
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,944
We're just gonna tap on the brakes here.

554
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:08,622
Nice move.

555
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:09,998
Indeed.

556
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,251
He's making a break for the coronasphere.

557
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,003
Did I mention that we have even less protection
in this ship than we did in the Daedalus?

558
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:15,838
Not really.

559
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,297
I didn't think so.

560
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,222
Radiation levels in the Colonel's ship
are beginning to rise.

561
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,600
Is it just me?
Or is it getting a little hotter in here?

562
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,435
Hold on. I almost got him.

563
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,943
What happened?

564
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,573
They're approaching the coronasphere.
There is too much interference.

565
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,537
You see the thing is, I have very fair skin.
I tend to burn very easy.

566
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,831
Just a few more seconds.

567
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,684
How long can they survive those radiation levels?

568
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,604
I believe it has already been too long.

569
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,774
John can you read me?

570
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,486
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

571
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:28,785
<i>Daedalus this is Sheppard. Target is destroyed.</i>
<i>I repeat. Target is destroyed. If you try</i>
<i>one more shutdown, I think it might just work.</i>

572
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:35,042
<i>Well done both of you.</i>
<i>You had us a little worried there for a minute.</i>

573
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,919
Sorry about that.

574
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:38,879
<i>This is Caldwell.</i>

575
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,257
We'll rendez-vous as soon as we've eradicated
the virus once and for all.

576
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,468
Roger that, Sheppard out.

577
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,851
You did great back there, Rodney.
Wanna take the stick?

578
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,186
Really?

579
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:55,562
No.

580
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:30,472
Dr Weir, Dr McKay, Dr Beckett, welcome back.
And Lt Colonel Sheppard. Congratulations.

581
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,850
Thank you. Anything happened while we were gone?

582
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,726
There has been no sign of the Wraith.

583
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,729
It would appear that they continue to believe
that Atlantis has been destroyed.

584
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:42,651
But I understand that your trip
was not so happily uneventful.

585
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,069
No, not exactly.

586
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,030
My nose is peeling. Do you have moisturiser?

587
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:47,865
Yes Rodney.

588
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:48,699
Well we should get that.

589
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,408
Yes Rodney.

590
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,244
Any word from your offworld contacts?

591
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:57,958
Well we have received several intelligence reports.
However, as of yet, there is no news of Lt Ford.

592
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,960
I'd like to read those reports if you don't mind.

593
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,588
I thought you might. I prepared you this copy.

594
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:06,383
Thank you... Ladies.

595
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,888
I'm sorry your journey was so difficult.

596
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,391
Oh, well we got here. That's what counts.

597
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:21,064
Still, it must have been pleasant to return to Earth.
A chance to reunite with your friends and loved ones.

598
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,483
Dr Weir.

599
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,445
Dr Weir, I'm glad you're back.

600
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,573
We have several reports
with new information on the city.

601
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,408
Ever since we installed ZPM,

602
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,952
we've made many interesting discoveries.

603
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:36,663
Can this not wait? Dr Weir has only just arrived.

604
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:39,583
- I'm sorry...
- No, it's fine. Really.

605
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:42,920
Let's get back to work.
