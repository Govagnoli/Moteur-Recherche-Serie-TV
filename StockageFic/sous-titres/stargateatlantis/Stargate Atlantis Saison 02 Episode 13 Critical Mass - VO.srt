1
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,555
Going off-world?

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,266
M7G-677.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,769
That's the planet with all the kids, right?

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:25,859
They're having trouble with their E.M. Field generator,
and McKay has decided that I am the most
capable person in all of Atlantis to fix it.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, don't worry. They're a great group of kids.
You're going to love them.

6
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,030
My sister has a child.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,490
He breaks things.

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,409
He throws things.
He smears things onto furniture.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,329
<i>Colonel Sheppard!</i>
<i>Need you up at the control room.</i>

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,623
You still here?

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,874
We're just leaving.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,002
Well, do say "hi" to the kids for me.

13
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,799
<i>Idiot.</i>

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,553
"Say 'hi' to the kids for me."
<i>You'll catch it from me. You are such an idiot.</i>

15
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>Two Wraith cruisers.</i>

16
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,473
How far away are they?

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,724
A day, maybe day and a half.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,226
I've been tracking them for some time now,

19
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,728
but good news is, it doesn't
look like they're heading this way.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,814
- Just passing through the neighborhood?
- Yeah, it looks that way,

21
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,899
but I just discovered something rather curious...

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,487
short but intense energy bursts passing between them.

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,364
They're fighting each other?

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,032
In my...

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,659
expert opinion, yes.

26
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,702
That's good news.

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,953
It certainly is.

28
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,914
If there's any change in course at all, let me know.

29
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,380
I just cut short a call with the secretary of state.
I hope this is worth it.

30
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,384
I'm sorry, Sir, but a situation is developing that
you need to be made aware of. It couldn't wait.

31
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,052
Alright, then, make me aware of it.

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,972
We've noticed an increase in chatter
amongst the Trust recently.

33
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,892
The Goa'uld have infiltrated
the highest ranks of the organization.

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,603
We've discovered that
their access to government agencies

35
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,897
has gone a lot deeper than we realized.

36
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,732
How much deeper?

37
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,067
Atlantis.

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,736
They know about it?

39
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,196
Worse.

40
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,447
They've been there.

41
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,201
They planted a bomb somewhere in the City.

00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,050

45
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,185
But I don't understand. Why...

46
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,770
Why would the Goa'uld want to blow up Atlantis?

47
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,773
I mean, I'd think they'd be eager to get
their hands on all that ancient technology.

48
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,483
<i>They want the technology, sure,</i>

49
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,404
but they're more concerned about the Wraith
finding their way to this galaxy.

50
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,157
Last thing they need right now
is another enemy to contend with,

51
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,243
especially one so formidable.

52
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,537
Jeez, those poor people.

53
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,125
I mean, as if they don't have enough to contend with
the Wraith. Now they have a Goa'uld in their midst?

54
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,087
The intel we have suggests a lower-level
operative planted the bomb,

55
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,590
which means we're dealing with a human.

56
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,092
And from what little
we've been able to decipher so far,

57
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,429
the bomb is set to be detonated
the next time Atlantis dials Earth.

58
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,266
So the Trust have probably set up
a transmitter close to cheyenne mountain

59
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,102
to be detonated at the exact moment
that the wormhole is established.

60
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,979
- Which is today.
- What?

61
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,524
- Oh, the weekly status report.
- In 2 hours and 46 minutes.

62
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,027
Well, we have to warn them.
We have to tell them not to dial Earth.

63
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,819
How?

64
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,363
Even if we had the kind
of power needed to dial Atlantis,

65
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,283
we couldn't, because that would detonate the bomb.

66
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,701
What about the Daedalus?

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,705
It's on a return voyage to the milky way.
We could use them to relay the trans...

68
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,999
Oh, no... I mean, wait.

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,170
God, there's no way they're close enough,
even with our long-range transmitters.

70
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,672
You'll find another way to get the message to them.

71
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,298
I will?

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,508
Of course you will.

73
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,635
That's what I pay you for.

74
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:28,143
<i>Elizabeth's including intel about the infighting</i>
<i>amongst the Wraith in today's status report.</i>

75
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,436
<i>Let's hope that trend continues.</i>

76
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,896
<i>The Wraith keep fighting like this,</i>

77
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>we might be able to take the weekend off.</i>

78
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,109
Cadman?

79
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,779
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,114
Well, it's good to see you, too, Rodney.

81
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,200
No, I thought you were leaving on the Daedalus.

82
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,494
Yeah, I was, but something came up.

83
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,580
I asked colonel Sheppard if I could stay
around a little while longer.

84
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,791
Oh, well... that's fine.

85
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,001
You okay with that?

86
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,461
Yeah of course it is,
why wouldn't it be?

87
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:55,921
Colonel.

88
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,006
Lieutenant.

89
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,182
I would think, after all this time,
you'd stop being creeped out by her.

90
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,268
Well, she just has a way of getting under my skin.

91
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,144
Literally.

92
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,402
Dr. Beckett?

93
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,069
Yes?

94
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,197
Do you have time to accompany me to the mainland?

95
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,283
Is something wrong?

96
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,202
A woman who is very close to me, Charin.

97
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,913
Oh, yes, I remember her. Sweet lady.

98
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,999
<i>She is like a grandmother to me.</i>

99
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,043
I've just received word that she is very ill.

100
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,795
I was wondering if you could look at her.

101
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,672
Of course, love. Say no more.

102
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>Okay, this is Atlantis, deep in the Pegasus galaxy,</i>

103
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:52,644
and this is the Daedalus that left there
about a week ago, on its way to...

104
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,521
Earth.

105
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,607
Now,

106
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,735
since we can't dial the Gate to Atlantis,

107
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,820
we have no way to get a warning to them

108
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,157
except by use of a subspace data burst transmission

109
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,784
relayed from our galaxy to Pegasus,

110
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,162
using the Daedalus as one of the relay points.

111
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,957
I thought you said the Daedalus was
too far away for our transmitter to reach.

112
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,627
It is, which is why we have to get closer.

113
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:23,926
P4M-399. It's a tiny little planet right on
the very outskirts of our galaxy,

114
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,012
but if we can send a science
team there through the Gate,

115
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:32,059
they should be close enough to relay the
information to the Daedalus, and then they can...

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,144
it's like the twilight bark.

117
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,481
The twilight bark?

118
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,609
101 dalmatians.
Didn't you guys see that movie? My kids love it.

119
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,277
Well, okay, so there's all these dogs,

120
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,116
and one barks here, one barks here, one...
they send the message across the countryside...

121
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,619
Lord of the rings.

122
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:54,790
<i>Lord of the rings... you know, when they light</i>
<i>all those signal fires on the mountain tops?</i>

123
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,999
You saw that, right? So, okay...

124
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,669
People, people, people, people!

125
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,171
I believe we have work to do.

126
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,006
Right. Sorry.

127
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,508
Gear up.

128
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:21,149
<i>Colonel Caldwell, we just received a subspace</i>
<i>transmission from an SG team on P4M-399.</i>

129
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,112
<i>It's an urgent message from Stargate</i>
<i>Command we are to relay to Atlantis.</i>

130
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,238
What's the message?

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,198
<i>Do not dial Gate to Earth.</i>

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,159
A Trust operative has planted a bomb in Atlantis,

133
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,371
<i>to be detonated upon completion of dialing sequence.</i>

134
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:39,251
We are to maintain our position until the message
has been delivered for further intel as it develops.

135
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,920
Are we still in range to relay the message to Atlantis?

136
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,338
<i>No.</i>

137
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,132
<i>Who's that? Kavanagh?</i>

138
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,383
Yes, Colonel.

139
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,345
We're way too far out to broadcast
a subspace transmission to Atlantis.

140
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,514
We could turn around, get closer.

141
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,016
We don't have enough time.

142
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,436
Their weekly status report dial-up
is in just under two hours.

143
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,481
We can't possibly get close enough to broadcast
the message in time to stop them dialing.

144
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,774
Colonel Caldwell,

145
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,944
<i>I believe I can make modifications to the hyperdrive</i>

146
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,822
in order to achieve the speed necessary

147
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:13,744
to reach a distance capable of relaying
the transmission within the allotted time.

148
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,913
<i>The hyperdrive will be operating</i>

149
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:21,627
at a level that can only be sustained
for a short duration before damage is incurred.

150
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,961
<i>What kind of damage?</i>

151
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,922
It could burn out the drive.

152
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,257
Meaning we'd be stuck between galaxies.

153
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,967
Yeah, I know what it means, doctor.

154
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,765
However, I do believe that we will reach the point
at which we can relay the message to Atlantis

155
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:38,143
before damage to the hyperdrive is incurred.

156
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,270
Are you sure about that?

157
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,316
Shall I make the modifications, Colonel?

158
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,777
Go ahead. Turn us around.

159
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,492
I don't see how you can possibly milk
any more power out of the hyperdrive.

160
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,785
Dr. Kavanagh?

161
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,453
Yes?

162
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,498
Stop talking, please.

163
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,042
Thank you.

164
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,588
<i>Are we set to dial?</i>

165
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,966
Almost. Just finishing data compression.

166
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,092
Stand by.

167
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,052
Standing by.

168
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,896
Dr. Novak, what's your status?

169
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,565
Almost in range, Sir.

170
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,568
We're not gonna make it.

171
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,909
Compression's complete. We're good to go.

172
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,995
Alright, then. Dial the Gate.

173
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,830
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,424
Stop!

175
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,441
We need to disconnect the ZedPM and switch to
backup naquadah generators to prevent any
possible dialing of the Gate to Earth.

176
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,234
I agree. In fact, as of this moment,

177
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,986
all Gate activity shall be suspended.

178
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,529
<i>How many off-world teams do we have out there?</i>

179
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,324
Just Zelenka and his team on M7G-677.

180
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,202
Well, unfortunately, he's going to have
to sit tight until we sort this thing out.

181
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,995
Stuck with all those kids...

182
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,457
is the Daedalus still in range to relay
a data transmission back to SGC?

183
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,710
Yes, they are holding a position that keeps
them in range of both Earth and us.

184
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,839
Okay, good, and send a message saying
we received their warning and aborted the dialing.

185
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,426
Ask them if they can give us a little more
than just, "there's a bomb in Atlantis."

186
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,679
Maybe the Trust thinks this is the only way
to make sure the Wraith don't get there.

187
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,556
Well, it's drastic, but effective.

188
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:45,229
What's worse is the Trust operative who planted the
bomb probably did so under orders from the Goa'uld.

189
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,022
What?

190
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,358
When did the Goa'uld get involved in this?

191
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,609
Several months ago.

192
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,362
<i>They successfully infiltrated</i>
<i>the upper leadership of the Trust,</i>

193
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,533
gaining a stronghold on Earth accessing
government agencies from many countries.

194
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,326
What's a Goa'uld?

195
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:05,249
It's a slimy, snake-like alien creature, burrows into
people's heads and takes control of their bodies.

196
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,583
That doesn't sound pleasant.

197
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,876
<i>It isn't.</i>

198
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,004
I've read enough SG mission reports to know
I don't want anything to do with them.

199
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,131
I want you to organize some teams
and do a search of the City.

200
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,926
Start with obvious sabotage points,
power distribution centers.

201
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:20,472
I'll check primary and secondary systems for
any anomalous energy readings that might
indicate the presence of an explosive device.

202
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,600
And get Cadman to assist you,
she's a bomb expert.

203
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,726
She is?

204
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,311
She's one of the best. She'll be a big help.

205
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,104
Good.

206
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,607
Ask colonel Caldwell to return to
Atlantis to assist with the investigation.

207
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,278
If the Daedalus returns here, then you're
effectively cutting off our communication with Earth.

208
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,490
Yes, I understand that, but if the person
who planted the bomb is on board,
we gonna need to question them here,

209
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,535
<i>have them reveal the location of the bomb</i>
<i>and how to dismantle it.</i>

210
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,787
Alright, let's get moving.

211
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,595
Disconnecting ZedPM power...

212
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,054
now.

213
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:14,067
Charin, if you don't mind,
I'd like to draw a wee bit of your blood.

214
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,820
If you must.

215
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:21,074
When you are done,
I have made some tuttleroot soup.

216
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,660
You, cooking?

217
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,120
Tuttleroot?

218
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,079
Yes...

219
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,290
I have been practicing.

220
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,917
Hopefully,

221
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,293
some day,

222
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,630
I will be able to cook as well as you.

223
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:47,559
I am afraid that day is far into the future, my dear.

224
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,441
You were born for a higher purpose,

225
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,362
to be the leader of our people...

226
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:06,954
and that's why I want you
to prepare them for the ring ceremony.

227
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,915
Charin...

228
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,293
I'm dying, Teyla.

229
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,048
Forgive me, but... what exactly is the ring ceremony?

230
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:28,600
Among our people, it is very rare
for someone to die of natural causes.

231
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,727
Because of the Wraith?

232
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,983
The ring ceremony celebrates such an event.

233
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,111
A ring of stones is laid out,

234
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,405
symbolizing the ring of the ancestors,

235
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,156
the Stargate,

236
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,703
in the center of which the body is placed, and...

237
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:59,256
I am not ready for this ceremony, Charin.

238
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,841
Not yet.

239
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,351
<i>What do you got for me?</i>

240
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,353
<i>One of our teams just raided a Trust compound,</i>

241
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,273
discovered computers containing
further intel on Atlantis.

242
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,358
It's not much,
the Goa'uld are being very cryptic about this.

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,069
Cut to the chase. Do we know what kind of bomb it is?

244
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:21,778
Not yet.

245
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,572
Do we know where in the City it was planted?

246
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,156
No.

247
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,032
I'm sorry?

248
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,325
You said "further intel."

249
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,037
Well, we know for sure that there's no
transmitter here on Earth to detonate the bomb.

250
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,623
I thought you said it was connected
to the dialing of the Gate.

251
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,166
It appears that the actual trigger,

252
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,877
be it the Gate itself or some
other mechanism due to the dialing,

253
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,420
is on their end, not ours.

254
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,339
Colonel Carter just came back from off-world.

255
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,257
She's going to help us figure out
what the trigger might be.

256
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,258
So, what else can we do?

257
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,176
Nothing.

258
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,094
I mean, not until we find out more.

259
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,013
Then by all means, don't let me stop you.

260
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,646
<i>Colonel Caldwell,</i>

261
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>we received another message from SGC to relay.</i>

262
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,484
It looks like the detonator is not on Earth,

263
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,818
but it is in Atlantis.

264
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,990
Alright, go ahead and send it.

265
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:11,203
Also let SGC know of Dr. Weir's request that
we return to help with the investigation.

266
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,412
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

267
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,376
<i>Explosives expert?</i>

268
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:21,088
High temperature and energetic materials technology.

269
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,799
And I can tap dance, too.

270
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,884
Colonel Sheppard, how's it going?

271
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,220
<i>Checking the east pier power distribution centers.</i>

272
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,221
Still nothing.

273
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,139
We're headed to the west pier now.

274
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,642
Ronon...

275
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,018
<i>How about you?</i>

276
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,355
Checking the grounding stations.

277
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,523
Also nothing.

278
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,025
We've got eight other teams out there.

279
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,735
It's a big city. It's going to take a while.

280
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,820
<i>Understood.</i>

281
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,156
Be advised we got a second message relayed to us...

282
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,826
DHD...

283
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,703
It's dialing itself.

284
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,794
That's Earth's address.

285
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,796
I thought it couldn't dial Earth without the ZPM.

286
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,089
Well, it can't.

287
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,139
<i>Did I just hear right?</i>

288
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,432
The Gate dialed by itself?

289
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,434
Yes, it tried to dial Earth.

290
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,853
Whoever planted the bomb must've devised a program

291
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,355
to upload itself
and automatically dial the Gate as backup

292
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,232
in case the first dial-in was halted.

293
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,109
A very good thing you pulled the ZPM.

294
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:24,943
- Rodney...
- What?

295
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,069
The transmitter...

296
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,071
Oh, no.

297
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,365
What is this?

298
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,036
We just started broadcasting a distress beacon.

299
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,247
<i>The Gate dialed itself in order to draw</i>
<i>attention away from the transmitter.</i>

300
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:37,998
Turn it off!

301
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,124
I am.

302
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,546
<i>It's too late.</i>

303
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,423
The damage is already done.

304
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,717
The two Wraith cruisers I was monitoring,

305
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,802
they picked up the beacon.
They've altered their course.

306
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,055
They're headed straight for Atlantis.

307
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,522
<i>How long before they get here?</i>

308
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,190
<i>A day, maybe a day and a half,</i>

309
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,651
depending on if they need to make
a hyperspace pause along the way.

310
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,028
We'll need to cloak the City again.

311
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,656
Even cloaked, the Wraith are going to wonder
where the beacon came from.

312
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,950
Well, then we need a ruse.

313
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:18,038
We'll take a transmitter and dump it along with
some charred rubble on a beach on the mainland,

314
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,542
and they'll think it's jetsam that washed up
when the City exploded during the siege.

315
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,168
Hang on. Back up a second.
Let me get this straight...

316
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,920
you think our bomb guy did this?

317
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,256
Yes. It'd be easy to figure out
the Wraith were in the area.

318
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,340
We've been tracking them for a while now.

319
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,885
So he gets the Gate to dial
by itself in order to distract us

320
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,596
so he can broadcast a distress beacon
that would be picked up by...

321
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,430
By the Wraith, yes,

322
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,265
I believe so.

323
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,224
Okay, why?

324
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,185
Well, maybe he wants to blow up
the Wraith along with the City.

325
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,728
Two cruisers...

326
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,731
that's insignificant compared to all
the hive ships that are still out there.

327
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,818
Well, we don't have much time,
so whatever the connection is,

328
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,320
let's try to figure it out
before the cruisers get here.

329
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,325
Teyla...

330
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,618
you're in an awful hurry.

331
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,203
I'm returning to the mainland.

332
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,372
We are evacuating my people back to the City.

333
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,291
Oh, yes, the Wraith are on their way. I just heard.

334
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,544
They will be protected under the cloak
until the danger is passed.

335
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,089
Unfortunately, if they don't find that bomb,
Atlantis may prove even more dangerous.

336
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,966
They will find it.
I am certain.

337
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:11,925
Before you go,

338
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,510
I need to talk to you about Charin.

339
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,346
I've completed my tests,

340
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,224
and I must say, although she is old,
and her body is indeed failing her,

341
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,686
there are treatments and procedures
I can administer to prolong her life.

342
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,104
Really?

343
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,856
Aye, starting with a pacemaker for her heart.

344
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,943
You see, one of the reasons she's feeling so weak is
that her heart is beating in a...

345
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,862
untimely fashion,

346
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,114
not pumping nearly enough blood through her body.

347
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,991
Now, the condition will continue,

348
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,660
but the pacemaker will slow its progress considerably.

349
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,246
It could possibly add years to her life.

350
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,623
I will let her know,

351
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:46,376
but first I have to get her and my people
to safety before the Wraith arrive.

352
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,753
Of course.

353
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,639
Not sure I like the look on your face, Chief.

354
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,475
Sir, the Daedalus just relayed a message

355
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:05,062
informing us that Atlantis requested
they return to help with the bomb investigation.

356
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,605
Well, tell them no for the time being.

357
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,900
I need them to hold position
in case we gather more intel.

358
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,318
<i>Sir, that's the problem.</i>

359
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,487
They already headed back.

360
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,571
They're out of range.

361
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,241
We have no way of communicating
with them or Atlantis.

362
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,118
Then there's nothing else
we can do for them.

363
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,579
No, Sir.

364
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,265
Passenger manifest?

365
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,266
Yeah.

366
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,142
Any names jump out?

367
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,521
A few, actually.

368
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,190
I hate this,

369
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,859
having to suspect one of our own.

370
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,488
Unfortunately, the list of suspects
may not be limited to the Daedalus.

371
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,368
You think the Trust operative might
still be here in Atlantis?

372
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,036
Yeah, with everything that's happened.

373
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,415
Gate dialing by itself,
the distress beacon.

374
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,125
I don't know.

375
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,629
Getting themselves blown up along with the City,
it doesn't seem part of their M.O.

376
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,215
Well, all it takes is one nut to be talked into it.

377
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,511
Okay.

378
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,097
Who around here do you suspect?

379
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,265
What about lt. Cadman?

380
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:24,391
What?

381
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,226
<i>Hear me out.</i>

382
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,978
She's an explosives expert.

383
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,229
<i>She was all set to leave on the Daedalus,</i>

384
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,523
<i>but asked to stay when "something came up."</i>

385
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,900
She's always around when things happen.

386
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:37,696
- When the distress beacon started...
- She's one of the most trusted officers in my command,

387
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,699
not to mention the fact that she was
stuck in your head for some time.

388
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,242
Do you always have to keep bringing that up?

389
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,537
I bring it up because you of all people should
know she'd never do something like that.

390
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,914
Well, maybe she was brainwashed?

391
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,665
The Goa'uld are very clever when it
comes to things like manipulating...

392
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,499
Excuse me.

393
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,209
Dr. Weir?

394
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,503
Yes?

395
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:56,465
Flight just confirmed that the Daedalus
has landed alongside the east pier.

396
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:57,758
Thank you.

397
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,265
I want to begin the interrogations immediately.

398
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,518
All crew and civilian passengers
have been confined to their quarters

399
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,144
until I have a chance to talk
to each of them sep...

400
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,272
Colonel...
This investigation falls under Atlantis' jurisdiction,

401
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,733
which means it will be conducted under my command.

402
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,111
Now, I welcome your assistance,
but as far as questioning potential suspects...

403
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:22,282
Doctor, one of the people aboard my
ship may be an operative of the Trust.

404
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:26,828
Yes, and the sooner I figure out who that is,
the better for all of us.

405
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,331
Alright, who's first on your list?

406
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,792
You think I did it?

407
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,001
Relax, doctor.

408
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,504
You're just one of many people I'm questioning.

409
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:36,630
No,

410
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,300
I'm pretty sure mine's the first name
on what is probably a very short list.

411
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,971
Shortly after the siege,
you couldn't wait to leave Atlantis.

412
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,224
A few months later,
I received an urgent request from you

413
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,934
to be allowed to return.

414
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,562
Your second tour lasted three weeks,

415
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,313
and suddenly, you ask to leave again.

416
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,316
Because working conditions
became intolerable for me here.

417
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,236
I have no friends here,
my work is not respected...

418
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,323
and this occurs only days before we discover
a bomb has been planted in the City.

419
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,076
Right.

420
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,494
Of course, so

421
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,329
obviously I did it.

422
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,000
Given the circumstances,
can you not see how such behavior might

423
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,502
- arouse suspicion?
- Your suspicion, sure.

424
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,962
Seeing as how you never cared for me

425
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,590
nor valued the talents I brought to this expedition.

426
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,135
My personal feelings towards you,
no matter what they may be,

427
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,512
have nothing to do with this.

428
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,598
Please.

429
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,644
Everything you do is motivated by personal feelings.

430
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,314
You're driven by emotion, not reason.

431
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,859
It's why I've always felt you're
not capable of doing this job.

432
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,944
You don't have the...

433
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,529
strength...

434
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,781
to be leading the fight against the Wraith.

435
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,867
If I remember correctly,
you were the one who wanted to,

436
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,493
what was it, run and hide?

437
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,412
And at the time, I was right.

438
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,665
<i>If the Daedalus hadn't arrived at the 11th hour,</i>

439
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:58,545
this city and everyone in it would have
been wiped out because of your recklessness.

440
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,966
There's no need for the Trust to blow
it up when Dr. Weir's at the helm.

441
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,349
Most of the others have already
been transported to the City.

442
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,228
A medical team will be by shortly
to take you in the next Jumper.

443
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,232
<i>Always running.</i>

444
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:23,028
Always looking to the sky in fear.

445
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:28,158
Soon I shall be free of this burden.

446
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,494
Charin...

447
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,625
Dr. Beckett said he can help you,

448
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,712
give you something to make you feel better,

449
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,297
live longer.

450
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,259
I feel fine, Teyla.

451
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,180
I welcome this.
This is not to be feared.

452
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,392
You are all I have left.

453
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,395
My family, my...

454
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,772
mother, my father...

455
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,066
they are all gone.

456
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,236
If you leave me...

457
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:08,282
I will truly be alone.

458
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:12,661
No, your people are your family, Teyla...

459
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:21,712
and as you look to them,
so they will look to you.

460
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:26,383
They need your strength...

461
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,806
You understand that I am interviewing
everybody onboard the ship.

462
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,391
Oh, sure, I know.

463
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:38,478
I mean, whoever planted the bomb was
probably eager to get away from the City!

464
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,355
Not that I was eager.

465
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:44,318
I was just doing my job.
I couldn't have cared less when we left...

466
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,529
but I care about my job. I just didn't...

467
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,533
You were saying?

468
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,286
Doctor, you have nothing to be nervous about here.

469
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,079
No, I know.

470
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,208
Unless, of course, I was guilty.
Then I would have someth...

471
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:02,836
Sorry.

472
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,549
Have you noticed any crew members...

473
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,802
change in behavior the last few weeks?
I don't know,

474
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,514
anybody acting in a suspicious or odd manner?

475
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,474
No... Wait.

476
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,020
I... I mean, no.

477
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,730
For God's sake.

478
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,440
Can I get you some water?

479
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:24,942
Oh, no. It wouldn't do any good.

480
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,279
I get the hiccups when I'm nervous.
It goes way beyond annoying.

481
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,782
But wait.

482
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,493
The pony-tailed guy.

483
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,744
Dr. Kavanagh?

484
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,705
He was always hanging around,
looking over your shoulder,

485
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,083
poking through computers.
Kind of creepy.

486
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,881
Well, not really creepy as much as...

487
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,925
peculiar, maybe?

488
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,469
I... I don't know the guy.
He could be a great person.

489
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,638
I mean, who am I to judge, you know?

490
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,682
I'll just shut up now.

491
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,975
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

492
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,852
Excuse me. Yes, Rodney?

493
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,146
<i>Can you come to the control room?</i>
<i>We have discovered something important.</i>

494
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,984
I'm on my way.
If you'll excuse me.

495
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,026
Yes, Sir.

496
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,361
Ma'am...

497
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,452
What have you found?

498
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,122
Guess what? Turns out there's no bomb after all.

499
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,124
There's no actual explosive device.

500
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,835
The explosion will come, but from somewhere else.

501
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,463
Now, with the Wraith on the way,
we'll need to cloak the City,

502
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,673
- right?
- Yes.

503
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:33,093
In order to do that, we need to reconnect the ZedPM
in order to supply the necessary power.

504
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:34,219
And what about the Stargate?

505
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,138
I've physically disabled the DHD.

506
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,015
It won't be able to dial, so it won't be a problem.

507
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,100
Now, the ZedPM, however, will be.

508
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:40,767
Now, as you know,

509
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,854
the zero point module controls the
flow of massive amounts of power.

510
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:44,521
Like a dam.

511
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,815
No. It's not like a dam, it's more like a...

512
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:49,526
actually, yes, it's like a dam.
If you overload the dam, it breaks,

513
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,821
which is why the Ancients put in place failsafes
to prevent such a thing from happening.

514
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:53,739
Like a spillway.

515
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,991
Could we just stick with failsafes?

516
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:01,914
The problem is, our Trust operative figured
out a way to rewrite Atlantis' operating
system and disable the failsafes,

517
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,292
but mask it in such a way that
the City's sensors didn't detect it.

518
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,212
So the dialing of Earth would
cause the ZPM to overload.

519
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,213
Oh, yeah,

520
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:13,842
and given that dialing another galaxy
requires tremendous amounts of power,
we're talking catastrophic overload.

521
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,346
The explosion would destroy not just the City,
but most likely the entire planet.

522
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,889
Can the failsafes be re-enabled?

523
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:25,771
Yes, but whoever it was who did this anticipated
the possibility they would be discovered, and they
put in place a code to block access to it.

524
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,607
And I'm gonna guess that cracking
this code isn't going to be easy.

525
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,068
No, not at all.
It is extremely complicated.

526
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,947
But for now, you've already disabled the DHD,
so it's impossible to dial Earth.

527
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,114
Yeah, but unfortunately,

528
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:40,327
any number of systems can be used in
conjunction with each other to overload the ZedPM.

529
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,454
It'd be a much more gradual
build-up than dialing the Gate,

530
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,416
which would cause an instantaneous power spike,
but equally as effective in its results.

531
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:51,129
And we can't disconnect the ZPM because we need
the cloak for when the Wraith cruisers arrive.

532
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:51,755
Bingo!

533
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:55,217
Which is why our bomber activated
the distress beacon, alerting them,

534
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,848
and that is how the Wraith coming to Atlantis
is connected to detonating the bomb.

535
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:11,441
Rewriting Atlantis' operating system and
disabling the failsafes, well, that takes
someone with incredible intelligence.

536
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,902
You mean like Dr. McKay?

537
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:19,700
And also someone who was very eager to leave
Atlantis shortly before the weekly dial-in to Earth.

538
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,660
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

539
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:25,289
but isn't Dr. Zelenka currently
stuck off-world somewhere?

540
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,707
Why isn't he a suspect?

541
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,293
Our list of suspects isn't open for discussion,

542
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,669
but off the record,

543
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:34,381
Zelenka went against his will,
and I couldn't picture him working for the Trust.

544
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:35,674
Oh, but you could picture me?

545
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,301
In a heartbeat.

546
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,555
I see...

547
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:46,018
guilty until proven innocent.

548
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,437
I've been going over
the communication logs from the Daedalus,

549
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:55,194
and it seems that you sent three unauthorized
and coded messages back to Atlantis shortly
after the dial-in was halted.

550
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,780
I have a few friends here I was concerned
about I wanted to see if they were right.

551
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,617
I thought you said you didn't have any friends here.

552
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:07,748
Now, the messages were encrypted, but don't worry
I've got people deciphering them right now.

553
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,208
What do you want from me?

554
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,170
I want the access code
so I can re-enable the ZPM failsafes!

555
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:17,925
Well, if you're waiting for me to tell you,
you'll be waiting a while, seeing
as I have no idea what that code is.

556
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,426
No, I think you do know it,

557
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,637
and since I don't have the time to wait anymore,

558
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,557
I'll just have to decide
the quickest way to get it from you.

559
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,184
Like what?

560
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,686
Are you gonna torture me?

561
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,905
Could the cloaking cause the ZPM to overload?

562
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:45,369
Yes, but I can turn off some of the systems
to keep the power level short of an overload.

563
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,121
Maybe we should start thinking
about evacuating the City.

564
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,790
<i>There's not a lot of options there.</i>

565
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,042
Still, it can't hurt to have a plan ready,

566
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:54,378
if we can think of one.

567
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,340
Dr. Beckett...

568
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,551
why was Charin moved in here?

569
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,427
So I can keep a closer eye on her,

570
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,554
tend to her if needed.

571
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:06,598
I told you, she does not wish for any treatment.

572
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,476
You have to understand, Teyla,

573
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,855
that as a doctor,
I can't just stand by here and let her die.

574
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,774
I took an oath to preserve life.

575
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,193
You may keep her here to make her comfortable,

576
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:19,695
but if the time comes,

577
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:25,284
as much as it pains both of us,
we must not interfere.

578
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,496
Alright.

579
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:35,419
I'm still working on cracking the new failsafe code.
But so far, no luck.

580
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,964
How are things coming with Kavanagh?
Is he still your prime suspect?

581
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,757
Yes, he is.

582
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,509
I'm having some difficulty with him, though.

583
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,678
He's not exactly the most cooperative of people.

584
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,221
Well, there's a shocker.

585
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,639
If he does know the code,

586
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,267
I highly doubt he's going to just give it to us.

587
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,686
Give me 10 minutes with him.

588
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,563
I'll get it out of him.

589
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,443
It might not be a bad idea.

590
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:03,280
Maybe it is time to take this
interrogation to the next level.

591
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,949
Look, I hate Kavanagh as much as the next guy,

592
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,118
probably even more, but

593
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,620
we really need to be sure about this.

594
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:10,704
I agree.

595
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,873
If there's the slightest chance that he's innocent...

596
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,501
We don't have time to debate morality.

597
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,962
Unfortunately, sometimes you have to do
unpleasant things to save lives.

598
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,644
What are you doing?

599
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,981
I was going over the system's
command logs for the past few months.

600
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:38,649
Why?

601
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,778
I noticed a gap in one of the data-stream
sequences from several weeks ago.

602
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,696
It's probably nothing,
but I thought it might indicate a...

603
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,281
A deletion point, yes.

604
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,659
Believe it or not, I have had some
experience with these systems, more,

605
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,577
say, than a tap-dancing explosives expert.

606
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,162
I was just trying to help, Rodney.

607
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,747
Here's a thought...

608
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:54,915
failsafe code.

609
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,000
Why don't you help with that?

610
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,545
Elizabeth...

611
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,713
<i>Yes, Rodney?</i>

612
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,674
The cruisers are getting closer.

613
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,885
I think it's time to reconnect
the ZedPM and cloak the City.

614
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,096
<i>Go ahead.</i>

615
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,437
Switching to ZedPM power...

616
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:18,981
now.

617
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:33,954
How are we doing?

618
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:37,583
I've powered down several of
the secondary systems, but so far,

619
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,669
the ZedPM levels are holding below overload.

620
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,547
I think we'll be okay.

621
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,598
Are you in pain?

622
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:58,020
Dr. Beckett can give you something to ease it.

623
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,737
Teyla...

624
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,948
Yes, Charin.

625
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,370
The journey begins.

626
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,865
They're here.

627
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:54,576
Two Wraith cruisers just outside our atmosphere.

628
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,955
So far, they're not behaving in a way
that would indicate they're aware of us.

629
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:58,705
<i>Rodney...</i>

630
00:33:58,747 --> 00:33:59,289
What?

631
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,959
The City's inertial dampeners just began powering up.

632
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,751
What?

633
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,295
I'm trying to shut it down,
but it's requiring that code.

634
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,214
Get out of there.

635
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,591
It's the star drive.

636
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,636
Look, the City, as you know, is just a giant spaceship

637
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,471
with a star drive capable of faster than-light travel,

638
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,723
which means that it also has inertial dampeners.

639
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:17,724
Yes, I know that.

640
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:22,312
One of the precursors to the star drive's power-up
phase is the activation of the dampeners,

641
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,231
which may very well affect our cloak,

642
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,524
but that's not the worst part of it.

643
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,775
It'll overload the ZPM.

644
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:28,193
Way overload it.

645
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,947
How soon before that happens?

646
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,075
30 minutes at the most,
and this City will be vaporized.

647
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,082
We need to initiate some evacuation plans.

648
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,418
I told you, the Daedalus is our only option.

649
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,670
We can't use the Stargate.
We can't go to the mainland.

650
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,256
I agree... we fit as many people
aboard the ship as we possibly can...

651
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:51,884
There is nowhere near enough room for everyone.

652
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:52,801
We're going to have to make room.

653
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,011
<i>No, no, no, you don't understand.</i>

654
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:56,972
The life support system can't handle that many
people. There's not enough air to go around.

655
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,474
<i>- They'll never make it back to Earth.</i>
<i>- What about another planet?</i>

656
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:03,770
There's one nearby in this solar system, remember,
the one we found the crashed Wraith cruiser.

657
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,856
That took us 15 hours by Puddle Jumper.

658
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,566
It's a blink of the eye for the Daedalus.

659
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,902
And then we could use the Puddle
Jumpers to ferry the rest of the people.

660
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,988
Quickest thing to do is get the code.

661
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,448
Just let me in with Kavanagh.

662
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,658
I'll get it from him.

663
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,328
ZedPM overload in...

664
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,788
24 minutes.

665
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,045
Do it.

666
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,639
Oh, God.

667
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,391
Teyla,

668
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,809
what are you doing?

669
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,813
We are about to begin the ring ceremony,
according to Charin's wishes.

670
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,359
They're evacuating the City in a matter of minutes.
It could all explode.

671
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,610
We are aware of that,

672
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,530
and many of my people are boarding
the Daedalus as we speak.

673
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:58,867
I and the others will leave with the final
groups aboard the Puddle Jumpers.

674
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,995
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

675
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,373
I made a promise to Charin,

676
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:07,668
and I intend to keep it, no matter the cost.

677
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:55,174
Beyond the night, a rising sun.

678
00:36:55,215 --> 00:37:02,055
Beyond the night the battle's won,

679
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:08,312
the battle's won.

680
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:21,325
<i>Fear and shame now in the past...</i>

681
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:28,624
<i>pain and sorrow gone at last...</i>

682
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:34,296
<i>gone at last.</i>

683
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,597
ZedPM overload in 10 minutes.

684
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,475
We should think about getting to the Jumpers.

685
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,774
Dr. Weir, Rodney...

686
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,609
I found something.

687
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:06,036
Circle renewed, peace will be found

688
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:17,005
beyond the night on sacred ground

689
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,800
Stop!

690
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,553
What'd you do to him?

691
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:23,887
Nothing.

692
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,931
He fainted before I could touch him.

693
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,605
Dr. Weir, we're ready to go.
We'll meet you at the rendezvous site.

694
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,905
What the hell's going on here?

695
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:45,534
I asked Hermiod to beam you here
so you could give us the access code.

696
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,368
What?

697
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,329
Lt. Cadman discovered a gap in the system command logs

698
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,415
that indicated two deletion points, which she and...

699
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,917
We don't have time for this.

700
00:38:56,128 --> 00:39:01,258
Your identification code was used
to access this City's operating system.

701
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,259
You copied it,

702
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,385
took it back to the Trust,

703
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:07,097
whose Goa'uld scientists then rewrote
the program to overload the ZPM.

704
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:11,268
You then brought it back here and uploaded
it into the Atlantis computers.

705
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,853
You think that I'm working for the Trust?

706
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,439
We know you're working for the Trust.

707
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,983
So give us the code.

708
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,116
Oh, my God...

709
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,785
I will never give you that code.

710
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,337
I warn you as a Goa'uld, I now possess
the strength of many men.

711
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,714
Won't be a fair fight, then.

712
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:48,972
Hold on.

713
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,326
Colonel...

714
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,370
<i>Colonel!</i>

715
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,956
Sheppard...

716
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:17,251
We don't have much time.
We need that access code.

717
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:29,012
The ZedPM levels are spiking.
We need to go now!

718
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,682
The access code.

719
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:51,869
River flows, led by the wind

720
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:59,960
first new breath her journey begins,

721
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:05,716
her journey begins.

722
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,810
<i>Oh, Carson!</i>

723
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,646
Hermiod's beginning initial
calculations on the extraction.

724
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,064
- Extraction?
- Now?

725
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:26,195
Hermiod is going to attempt to remove the Goa'uld
from colonel Caldwell using Asgard beaming technology.

726
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,654
Quite remarkable, actually.

727
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:28,739
And complicated.

728
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,741
I mean, the calculations are impossibly intricate.

729
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:33,785
You don't want to go beaming out a chunk of his brain.

730
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,746
Lovely, Rodney.

731
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,209
Look who's back.

732
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,211
Mr. Mom.

733
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,587
Have fun with the kids?

734
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,717
Do not even speak to me.

735
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,776
Did you see Zelenka?

736
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,653
No.

737
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,489
Well, you should take a quick look
before he washes his face.

738
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:13,033
The kids did a real number on him.

739
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:19,581
I asked Dr. Beckett to give everyone
in the base a full examination.

740
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,792
If colonel Caldwell could have a Goa'uld in him,

741
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,502
any of us could.

742
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,213
That's not a pleasant thought.

743
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,756
No...

744
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,758
no, it isn't.

745
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,429
I crossed a line, John, with Kavanagh.

746
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:37,015
You did what you had to do.

747
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,936
Good news was, he wasn't hurt.

748
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:47,693
Here we are, gloating about
the infighting among the Wraith.

749
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,362
How are we any different?
