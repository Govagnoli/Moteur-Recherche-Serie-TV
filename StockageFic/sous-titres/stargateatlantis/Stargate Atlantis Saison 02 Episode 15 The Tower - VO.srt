1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,101
If we're hoping that these people have
something to trade, we are wasting our time.

2
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,480
From the looks of it, they barely have enough food
to feed themselves, and their technology?

3
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,816
Well, let's just say that this about sums it up?

4
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,987
Establishing good relations
with our neighbors is not just about trade.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,992
Right, but do we need to make friends with
every primitive agrarian society in the Pegasus galaxy?

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
Alright, that's enough.

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:39,206
They can't all be planets with cool technology
and open-minded women.

8
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,666
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,708
Greetings.

10
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,585
I am Eldred.

11
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,838
I'm Sheppard.

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,799
This is Ronon, Teyla, McKay.

13
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,301
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,

14
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,889
but it's harvest time,
and we must prepare our tribute for the Tower.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,183
The tower?

16
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,145
You must come from a distant land indeed
if you have not heard of the Tower.

17
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,440
I don't know of anyone who is not under its protection.

18
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,317
Protection from what?

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,402
The Wraith.

20
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,867
Is this tower close by?

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,326
I will show you.

22
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,369
Come.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,924
There.

24
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,475
- Is it my imagination, or does that look a lot like...
- The central spire of Atlantis?

25
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,560
Yes.

29
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,549
How exactly do the people
in the tower protect you from the Wraith?

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,303
They have a great weapon capable of annihilating
the Wraith ships which descend from the sky.

31
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,721
What kind of a weapon?

32
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,308
Thousands of bright lights rise up
from the ground beneath the Tower,

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,936
swarm the ships, and destroy them.

34
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:06,812
Really?

35
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,897
Thousands of bright lights.

36
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,607
And you have seen this?

37
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,442
I have never seen a Wraith ship.

38
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,570
They have not come for many generations,

39
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,115
but there are times
that the Lord Protector sees fit to...

40
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,034
demonstrate this power to his people.

41
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,788
We'd really like to meet this Lord Protector.

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,248
That may prove difficult.

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,750
Only members of the royal court
are allowed in the Tower.

44
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,296
Perhaps they would consider
making an exception just this once.

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,798
I'll do what I can.

46
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,216
Thank you.

47
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,179
You know this weapon he's talking about?

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,471
We call them drones.

49
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,391
We've used them to defend Earth and Atlantis,
but we could really use some more.

50
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,434
<i>And not only that.</i>

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,520
If these people have working drones,
they must also have a ZedPM.

52
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,814
Eldred said the Wraith have not come in a long time.

53
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,108
Perhaps this technology is no longer operational.

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,861
Well, I'll know more if I could get
a little closer, take some readings.

55
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,407
Do you think this Eldred is telling the truth?

56
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,117
<i>There's no reason for him to lie.</i>

57
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,245
And you say the tower looks
a lot like Lantian architecture?

58
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,831
Well, it was overgrown by vegetation, but otherwise,

59
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,459
there was definitely something familiar about it.

60
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,754
So the people in the tower could be Ancients?

61
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,005
<i>I don't know.</i>

62
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,882
The feudal society doesn't fit the profile.

63
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,260
Why would Ancients want
to lord over a bunch of simple farmers?

64
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,261
I don't know.

65
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,388
Either way, we should talk with them.

66
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,265
Agreed.

67
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,811
We're approaching the base of the Tower.

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,939
This is as close as I dare bring you.

69
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,569
I take it people like you don't get
invited up for barbecues too often?

70
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,489
The Tower is for nobles only.

71
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,451
And what makes them noble?

72
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,702
Blood.

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,622
Right.

74
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,215
Who are these guys?

75
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,092
Soldiers from the tower.

76
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,471
Take it easy.

77
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,348
Who are you?

78
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,642
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.
Who are you?

79
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,353
I am a constable of the Lord Protector's guard,

80
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,898
and this village scum dared to defy me.

81
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,486
It's clear we're going to have to make an example.

82
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,946
I don't think so.

83
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,240
Please, Colonel...

84
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,534
it's my fault.

85
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,662
If you think I'm going to sit here
and let you whip an innocent man,

86
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,539
you're sorely mistaken.

87
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,416
<i>Constable...</i>

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,501
you may stand down.

89
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,009
You are the strangers who requested an audience,

90
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,677
are you not?

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,762
That's us.

92
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,350
My name is Otho.

93
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,853
<i>I have the honor to be Chamberlain</i>

94
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,938
to the Lord Protector,

95
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,526
and you would never be allowed in his presence

96
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,195
so armed.

97
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,279
Well,

98
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,157
I guess we'll have to be on our way, then.

99
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,247
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

100
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,333
Take this one.

101
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,086
Please, Colonel, don't resist.

102
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,172
The Lord Protector sees all.

103
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,257
He does, you know.

104
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,514
But I suppose you're going to need a demonstration.

105
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,893
And here it comes.

106
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,956
Now, please, turn over your weapons.

107
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,918
Some of the people here may not survive the next strike.

108
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,885
Colonel...

109
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,028
We are not supposed to be here.

110
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,781
- If the soldiers come...
- Relax. I'm almost done.

111
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,199
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

112
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,702
Go ahead.

113
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,204
We have a problem.
They took Colonel Sheppard.

114
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,038
What?

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,664
Who did?

116
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,292
<i>Soldiers from the tower. They confiscated our weapons.</i>

117
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,793
What? And you let them?

118
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,964
We didn't exactly have much of a choice.

119
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,674
Alright, I'm on my way back.

120
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,803
It was definitely a drone.

121
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,096
It was pretty good shooting.

122
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,224
I mean, if it was their intention to scare people
and not actually kill anybody.

123
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,685
<i>This is Sheppard. Anyone reading me?</i>

124
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,353
Colonel, are you alright?

125
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>I'm fine. Is McKay with you?</i>

126
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm here.

127
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,192
<i>Did you find anything with your scans?</i>

128
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,735
As a matter of fact, I did.

129
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,904
There's definitely an active ZedPM,

130
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,656
but it's barely registering,
so it's hard to say whether it's

131
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,159
depleted or just not drawing much power right now.

132
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,202
<i>What else?</i>

133
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,748
The really interesting part is that it seems
to be coming from underground.

134
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>Now, when I realized that,</i>
<i>I started scanning for subterranean structures.</i>

135
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,586
<i>The tower is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

136
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,088
<i>There is a massive structure buried beneath it.</i>

137
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,966
It's hard to say without more detailed analysis, but...

138
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,970
it could very well be comparable
in size to Atlantis itself.

139
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,473
Doesn't really surprise me.

140
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,852
I'm in the tower right now,

141
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:39,686
and,

142
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,772
I've got to say...

143
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,691
it does kinda look familiar.

144
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,357
You there.

145
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,025
Approach.

146
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,411
- Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard...
- I know who you are.

147
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,079
I saw you in the village.

148
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,955
You did?

149
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,457
I see all that I need to see

150
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,960
within my domain.

151
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,729
Your friends, they are concerned about you.

152
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,568
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I'm a little concerned about me, too.

153
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,236
<i>I mean...</i>

154
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm a prisoner, right?

155
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,578
A show of force was necessary
for the benefit of the villagers.

156
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,497
It keeps them from getting ideas,

157
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,626
but for the moment I would prefer
if you thought of yourself as...

158
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,294
a guest.

159
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,005
Father, I must object.

160
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,797
This...

161
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,798
man...

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,258
should be punished.

163
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,968
He challenged one of our constables.

164
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,304
One of our constables?

165
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,972
Forgive me.

166
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,641
One of your constables.

167
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,892
<i>Lieutenant Colonel...</i>

168
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,480
it would be my pleasure
that you dine with us this evening.

169
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,570
From what I can tell by these readings,

170
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,866
the underground structure's not just roughly
the same shape and size as Atlantis. It's identical.

171
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,869
Yeah, it's pretty much
the same on the inside, too, although

172
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,329
it's been redecorated.

173
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,457
<i>If it is a city like Atlantis,</i>
<i>then where are the other spires?</i>

174
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,168
Probably fell a long time ago.
Maybe they were destroyed during a Wraith attack.

175
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,130
Look in the intervening 10,000 years, the whole
thing must have been overgrown by the forest.

176
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,050
One thing's for certain. These people are no Ancients.

177
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:19,221
But from what you're saying,
the Lord Protector must have the gene required
to activate the advanced technology.

178
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,430
<i>So it would seem.</i>

179
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,932
Were they using any other technology?

180
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,392
No, not that I can see.

181
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,728
They've turned the control room
into a gallery for royal audiences.

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,108
There are some systems that seem to be operational,
but I think they're just running on automatic.

183
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,569
Are you certain you are in no immediate danger?

184
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,070
I don't think so.

185
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,033
They don't have me under guard,
and they've even given me my own room.

186
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,535
I don't like it.

187
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,412
I say we call the troops and get you out.

188
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,872
I don't think it would work, even if we tried.

189
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,042
Look, the combination of the hologram
technology and a healthy supply of drones,

190
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,502
they'd pick us off pretty easily.

191
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,047
For the moment, I don't want anybody to do anything.
Just keep a low profile.

192
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,384
Right...

193
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,479
We are happy you could share our evening meal.

194
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,939
The pleasure is ours.

195
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,623
We thank the ancestors
for the great bounty bestowed upon us,

196
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,751
and we ask that they bless the Lord Protector,

197
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,087
that he may ever watch over us and keep us safe.

198
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,633
Please, enjoy.

199
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,932
It is generous of you to remember
the Lord Protector in your prayers,

200
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,434
especially after what happened this afternoon.

201
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,520
It is unfortunate,

202
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,022
but the soldiers serve the Tower,

203
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,690
and without the Tower,

204
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,567
we are vulnerable to the Wraith.

205
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,530
In exchange, you give them a portion of your crops?

206
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,615
Half of every harvest.

207
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,492
Half?

208
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,886
I've never known anyone
called "Lieutenant Colonel" before.

209
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:23,929
What does it mean?

210
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,223
It's not his name, you simpleton.

211
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,683
It's his rank.

212
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,351
My apologies.

213
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,811
That's alright.

214
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,730
I don't usually stand on ceremony anyway.

215
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,607
How about you just call me John?

216
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,485
<i>Alright, John.</i>

217
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,323
It's obvious to anyone with eyes
to see that you're a military man,

218
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,992
which makes me wonder,

219
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,537
why is it you question
the actions of my father's soldiers?

220
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,456
<i>Do you not agree that discipline is necessary?</i>

221
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,044
I guess I just don't think
whipping people is a good motivator.

222
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,755
The villagers are mindless brutes.

223
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,424
They understand nothing else.

224
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,552
Maybe because they've never known anything else.

225
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:07,723
I don't think that any of us would deny
that the life of peasants can be difficult,

226
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,476
but how much worse would it be
if they fell victim to the Wraith?

227
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,562
You protect them with these...

228
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,814
lights, like the one that hit the village today?

229
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,899
Of course.

230
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,984
Where do they come from?

231
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:22,112
The Lord Protector calls them forth with his mind.

232
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,989
But from where?

233
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:28,994
I mean, they rise up from the ground, but has
anybody bothered to go down there and check it out?

234
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,662
You mean the catacombs?

235
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,331
Yeah, whatever you call them.

236
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,084
They're dark and filthy.
Why would anyone want to go down there?

237
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:39,838
My lord!

238
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,714
It's nothing.

239
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:41,924
Leave me be.

240
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,175
Take him to his chambers.

241
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,474
What's wrong with him?

242
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,184
He'll be alright.

243
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,603
It isn't the first
time this has happened.

244
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,625
Well, that was a particularly
unsatisfying meal.

245
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,461
We should be honored that those with
so little would wish to share with us.

246
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,922
Oh, I'm honored.
I'm honored and hungry.

247
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,925
Seriously, we should be feeding them.
We've got better food in our emergency rations.

248
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,803
I'm not sure that they would accept it.
They are a proud people.

249
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,514
Not so proud that they'll
stand up for themselves.

250
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,016
That could change.

251
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,893
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

252
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,856
We need to be careful, right?
We have no idea who's watching, remember?

253
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,984
And we are supposed to be keeping a low profile,
not starting a revolution.

254
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,570
You cannot seriously believe
that this is a just society.

255
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,739
It is a society that has not been
culled by the Wraith in a long time.

256
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,575
That much we know for sure.

257
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,080
Now...

258
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,332
where are the emergency rations?

259
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,095
Am I disturbing you?

260
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,014
Mara. No...

261
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,600
How's your father?

262
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,976
He is resting.

263
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,728
Thank you for your concern.

264
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,479
Look...

265
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,191
maybe it would be best if I...

266
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,068
- just came back another day...
- No, you can't leave!

267
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,028
Please,

268
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:30,282
there's a matter of great importance
my father wishes to discuss with you.

269
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,992
Perhaps in the morning?

270
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:37,331
If these chambers are not to your liking...
- No, no, they're fine.

271
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,250
Well, then maybe there's something
I can do to make you more comfortable.

272
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,211
I don't think so.

273
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,338
Are you certain?

274
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,471
I never see this coming.

275
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,805
You don't find me pleasing?

276
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,850
No, no, it's not that.
It's just...

277
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,026
What you said at dinner,
did you mean it?

278
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,361
Absolutely.

279
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,657
- What did I say again?
- About the villagers.

280
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,909
My brother thinks it's a sign of weakness,

281
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,411
but I know that it means
you'll be a great ruler some day.

282
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,371
Right.

283
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,417
Ruler?

284
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,127
What are you talking about?

285
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:29,341
My father has promised that if we are married,
succession will fall to me.

286
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,106
We need to talk.

287
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,609
Colonel Sheppard. Yes.

288
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,236
Come in, please.

289
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,323
Seems that

290
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,701
certain people around here have somehow

291
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,703
gotten the wrong idea about me.

292
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,416
Mara came to visit me last night.

293
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,837
You must forgive her
forward behavior, Colonel.

294
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,839
She doesn't have much time.

295
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,300
What's that supposed to mean?

296
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:19,057
I have many duties here in the Tower, the most
important of which is as royal genealogist.

297
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:25,147
These scrolls record the bloodlines of the Lord
Protector's family going back 20 generations.

298
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:30,694
It's my duty to study them in order to determine the
best possible match for every member of the royal house

299
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,698
so that we may maintain the
integrity of those bloodlines.

300
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,742
This is necessary because only

301
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,410
one of the royal blood

302
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,748
can control the throne chair,
which in turn controls the weapon

303
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,417
that protects us from the Wraith,

304
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,462
<i>but I suspect you know some of this already.</i>

305
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:52,007
Most people, when they see the throne
chair activated for the first time,

306
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,801
react as though they've seen
some kind of magic,

307
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,094
but you...

308
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,263
you didn't bat an eye.

309
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,557
What's more,

310
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,143
you have in your blood

311
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:09,525
the very gene for which our royal family
has been so selectively bred all these generations.

312
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,485
I...

313
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,903
scanned you

314
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,197
shortly after we met,
remember?

315
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:16,782
Right.

316
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,576
Colonel, you must understand
how important this is to us.

317
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:24,998
Over the centuries, despite our best
efforts, the bloodlines have deteriorated.

318
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,128
The ability of each new Lord Protector to control
the throne chair, it is no longer a certainty.

319
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,174
Well, then, maybe it's time to start
thinking about a new system of government.

320
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:39,388
You have observed the inequalities
of our society, and you disapprove.

321
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,348
I can hardly blame you.

322
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,476
You didn't seem to have much of a
problem with that in the village.

323
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,898
I must maintain the image of my authority
in front of the villagers. It is my duty,

324
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,028
but believe me, between the two of us,
you are in a better position to change things.

325
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,739
The gene in you

326
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:04,413
is stronger than it has been in any
recorded member of the royal family for 300 years.

327
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,000
You sent Mara to my room.

328
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,793
I didn't have to.

329
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,589
She understands the
situation perfectly well.

330
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,925
Right now, Tavius is next in line,

331
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,387
but the possibility that his sister
might one day bear children

332
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,058
with superior genetic make-up to him or
his progeny, that will always be a threat.

333
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,811
So if the old man dies...

334
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,104
Precisely,

335
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,399
and his condition grows worse every day.

336
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,904
I know someone who may
be able to help with that.

337
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,621
Dr. Beckett...

338
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,663
Good morning.

339
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,832
I understand there's a patient
waiting for me in the tower.

340
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:52,002
- So Colonel Sheppard informed us over the radio.
- Oh, thank you, Ronon.

341
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,254
Do you have any idea
what I'm walking into?

342
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,923
Not really, no.

343
00:20:56,173 --> 00:21:00,427
According to the Colonel, your safety has been
guaranteed by the Chamberlain of the tower.

344
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,845
And we can trust him?

345
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,224
Not really, no, but
I have a backup plan.

346
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,685
Look, Baldric, my trusty local guide says
he knows a way into the underground city.

347
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,856
He's not exactly thrilled about going under
there, but I think I can talk him into it.

348
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,316
And what good does that do us?

349
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,402
Well, if I can find the ZedPM, then we can
shut these people down whenever we want.

350
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:21,615
Without the drone chair, they're just a
bunch of primitive thugs with axes and knives.

351
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:23,992
Axes and knives can
cause damage, Rodney.

352
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,619
You know what I mean.

353
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:26,995
Great.

354
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,455
Alright.

355
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,506
Busy as usual, I see.

356
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:41,844
Always making plans, plotting little strategies,

357
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,346
all for the benefit of the royal house of course.

358
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,431
- Of course.
- Of course.

359
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:50,561
I understand you've recruited
someone new into your little schemes

360
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,772
this Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

361
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,650
Something about medical
assistance for the Lord Protector?

362
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,027
He offered.
What was I supposed to say?

363
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,989
Just be careful, Chamberlain.
Remember your place...

364
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,200
and remember our arrangement.

365
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,119
What about the Colonel?

366
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,455
I'll deal with him when the time comes.

367
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:23,677
This is it.

368
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,345
Alright,

369
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:26,680
let's do it.

370
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,682
I'm not so sure this is wise.

371
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,810
Okay, I'm not interested in
your primitive taboos, okay?

372
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:36,565
It's a dark and scary place, but it's not
cursed or haunted or anything like that.

373
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,233
It's perfectly safe.

374
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,529
Actually, the catacombs
are prone to earthquakes.

375
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:44,531
They are?

376
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,785
Three village children died
in a cave in just last year.

377
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,414
I thought it was a superstition thing.

378
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,459
Oh, no, the danger is quite real.

379
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,253
Oh, now he tells me.

380
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,051
He's anemic,

381
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,261
and both his liver and
kidneys seem to be malfunctioning,

382
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:09,264
but he's not running a temperature,
so I don't think it's an infection.

383
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,558
- I'll need to run some more tests.
- I want to talk to him.

384
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,435
Right now, he needs to rest.

385
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,311
Carson...

386
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:15,562
He's not lucid at all.

387
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,939
Thank you, doctor.

388
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,023
Alright.

389
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:24,821
Colonel... I am authorized by the Lord
Protector to speak with you on his behalf.

390
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,573
Please come this way.

391
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,674
Do you know what this is?

392
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,967
You tell me.

393
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,010
It's a flying machine,

394
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,179
or at least it used to be.

395
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,807
It ran out of power a long time ago.

396
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:58,272
I know you have some understanding of these
things, even though you try not to show it.

397
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,066
I also know that this place

398
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,862
was once home to a much more advanced civilization.

399
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:09,366
Unfortunately,
aside from a few trinkets and useless relics,

400
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,911
all we have left is the throne chair,

401
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:18,625
and if the bloodline continues to deteriorate,
soon that will be taken from us as well.

402
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,837
What if I told you there
was a way around that,

403
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:27,176
<i>a way to protect the planet without worrying about</i>
<i>all these royal bloodlines or any of that crap?</i>

404
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,427
That's impossible.

405
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,595
What if it wasn't?

406
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,097
Such talk is dangerous.

407
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,892
He can't watch everyone all the time.

408
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,103
<i>Look, I know you serve these people,</i>

409
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,982
but if you're right, and eventually
they lose their ability to control the chair,

410
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,984
well, at that point, what good are they?

411
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,819
What are you suggesting?

412
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:51,825
A drug.

413
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,411
Gene therapy.

414
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:59,041
You give it to the people in the village, half of them
will be able to control the throne chair, no problem.

415
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:03,045
- You're talking about revolution.
- I'm talking about survival.

416
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:07,299
What's going to happen when the royal
family can't protect this planet anymore?

417
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:13,305
And in exchange for this drug,

418
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,682
what do you want in return?

419
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,484
<i>Rodney, come in...</i>

420
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,027
Go ahead.

421
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:27,569
<i>Rodney...</i>

422
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,114
Say again!

423
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,367
I'm not getting very
good reception down here.

424
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,577
<i>I said, have you found anything yet?</i>

425
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,663
We've only just made
our way into the city.

426
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:42,417
Look, we may be able to swing a little deal
here... drones in exchange for gene therapy.

427
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,419
I just need to know
how many they have left.

428
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,922
Alright, I'm on it. Let's go!

429
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:51,969
What was that?

430
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,762
I told you. The catacombs are unstable.

431
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,597
Alright, let's just keep moving.

432
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,278
Colonel Sheppard,

433
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,614
I've completed my
examination of the Lord Protector,

434
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,742
and I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for him.
He's dying.

435
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,744
How much time does he have?

436
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,413
It could happen any day now,

437
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,081
but there's something else.

438
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:24,376
The reason he's dying is
because he's been poisoned.

439
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,212
- What?
- Aye.

440
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,008
My guess is, it's been done slowly,
over the last couple months,

441
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,260
probably in his food.

442
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,722
Any idea who'd like to see him dead?

443
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,725
Yeah, I have a theory.

444
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:49,568
<i>This is it.</i>

445
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:50,652
<i>What?</i>

446
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,155
<i>Drone storage.</i>

447
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,450
<i>I don't understand.</i>

448
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:01,163
<i>Okay, those brilliant lights that magically rise</i>
<i>up into the sky and destroy the Wraith ships?</i>

449
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:02,289
They're not magic.

450
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,666
They're real, physical objects.

451
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:08,712
They're projectile weapons,
incredibly powerful projectile weapons.

452
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,173
The only question is,

453
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,925
have you used them all up?

454
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,346
- I can't see anything.
- Okay, hold on.

455
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:21,517
There's a working ZedPM in here, so
it should just be a matter of...

456
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:23,894
this.

457
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:41,954
Okay, there are still a few left.

458
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,750
Maybe turning on the power
wasn't such a good idea.

459
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,293
I think you might be right about that.

460
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,378
Let's get out of here.

461
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,317
Is there another way out?

462
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,111
Technically, no.

463
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,071
That's the only way out of this section.

464
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:19,032
There's no need to panic.
I'll radio for help.

465
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,703
Colonel Sheppard, it's
McKay. Come in, please.

466
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,624
Ronon, Teyla, please respond.

467
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,919
Anybody?

468
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,385
Okay,

469
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,637
we may need to panic a little.

470
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,982
You call this a harvest?

471
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,570
I bring this pathetic tribute to the Lord Protector,
and I'll be whipped for my insolence.

472
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:57,946
This is all we could spare.

473
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,991
Well, then, maybe there's something
besides food that you can offer.

474
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,203
No...
No...

475
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:06,788
<i>Hey!</i>

476
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:08,916
You again.

477
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,002
Let's see how you do against
someone who can defend himself.

478
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,046
You have an impudent tongue.

479
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:18,050
<i>I think I'll remove it.</i>

480
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,244
Colonel Sheppard...

481
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:45,953
<i>Go ahead.</i>

482
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,996
We have a problem in the village.

483
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,331
There has been an...

484
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,208
altercation.

485
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,460
<i>Where are we?</i>

486
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,921
<i>This should be auxiliary control.</i>

487
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,840
<i>Yes.</i>

488
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,681
God, it's amazing.

489
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,100
The layout of this place is almost identical.

490
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,726
Identical to what?

491
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,353
Never mind.

492
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:16,066
Okay, we need to access the city's
internal communication system, so...

493
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,485
remember what happened last time
you started turning things on?

494
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:22,072
At this point, I don't think we have much choice.

495
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,575
This is terrible.

496
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:28,996
I knew Tavius was cruel and vindictive,
but to want to murder his own father?

497
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,206
Raising children can be very dangerous.

498
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:34,042
The key is,
we don't let him succeed to the throne.

499
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,919
We need to talk to the Lord Protector.

500
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,881
I'm afraid it's already too late.

501
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,258
<i>I received word a few moments ago.</i>

502
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,594
He's dead.

503
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,307
You must leave now.

504
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,601
<i>Tavius will arrest Mara</i>

505
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:54,354
and anyone he considers was conspiring with her,
and that includes you.

506
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,440
What about the villagers?

507
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,359
He'll kill them all,
burn the place to the ground

508
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,944
to make an example of them.

509
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,946
They had nothing to do with what happened.

510
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,283
It doesn't matter.
Any defiance must be crushed without mercy

511
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,452
to keep it from spreading to the other villages.

512
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,663
Look, this is the gene therapy we're talking about.

513
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,374
You can take it to the people
and tell them what it means.

514
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,419
They don't have to be slaves to
this royal bloodline anymore.

515
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,087
Well, this may be too late.

516
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,465
Tavius will consider this to be treason.

517
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,758
He'll fight it,

518
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,801
and if the soldiers support him...

519
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:28,555
What's that mean?

520
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:32,601
It means news of the Lord Protector's
death is already spreading.

521
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,312
The court is being called
to assemble in the throne room.

522
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:38,482
Go now, before it's too late.

523
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,192
Colonel...

524
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,076
This is interesting.

525
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,495
It looks like the ZedPM's almost depleted.

526
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,414
- What?
- The ZedPM, it's...

527
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,333
Okay, you know what?

528
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,043
I know, never mind.

529
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,755
More importantly, I can't bring
internal communications online.

530
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,048
So we can't send a message?

531
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,468
No, and my radio won't work because
we're too far underground.

532
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,804
That leaves us only one option.

533
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,186
Head back to the village.

534
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:17,354
There's one more thing I need to do.

535
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,480
Right.

536
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,151
You should not have killed the constable.

537
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,778
Somebody had to do something.

538
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,113
Now more soldiers will come.

539
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:29,116
Then stand up to them.
Gather your people together and fight.

540
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,660
And if the Lord Protector uses the throne chair?

541
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:32,744
We'll deal with that.

542
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,580
It's too late to argue, Eldred.

543
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,623
What's done is done.

544
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:39,877
The Lord Protector will take his revenge,
on all of us

545
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:44,047
and if we're going to die,
I would rather die fighting.

546
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,890
Mara!

547
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,058
John, what are you still doing here?

548
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,268
I've been looking all over for you.

549
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,603
You have to leave now.

550
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,731
I know,
but I want you to come with me.

551
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,860
We both know what's going to happen if you stay here.
I can find a safe place for you to go.

552
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:05,986
John...

553
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,322
None of this is your fault.

554
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,491
You really would take me with you,

555
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,452
- wouldn't you?
- Of course.

556
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,913
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

557
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,416
Mara is perfectly safe now.

558
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:24,338
Tavius has been arrested
for the murder of the Lord Protector.

559
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,175
That's good news.

560
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,051
You...

561
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,136
really...

562
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:35,057
should have got out
while you had the chance.

563
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,227
What the hell is this?

564
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,937
I'm sorry, John.

565
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,855
<i>I was prepared to let you walk away,</i>

566
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:45,150
but your colleagues in the village forced my hand.

567
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,236
They're inciting an uprising,

568
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,738
and as the new Lord Protector,

569
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,698
that is something that I...

570
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,866
just

571
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:53,742
can't

572
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:54,952
have.

573
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,014
Wait outside.

574
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,559
I'll have your head for this, Chamberlain.

575
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,436
You are in no position to make threats.

576
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:26,066
Is it really necessary to insult me further
by imprisoning me with these people?

577
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,026
We're not the ones who committed murder.

578
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:32,114
True, there is only one murderer in this room.

579
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,157
Isn't that right, Otho?

580
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:36,827
Oh, let me guess.

581
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,412
He told you I did it.

582
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:43,000
Do I look like the sort of person who knows
anything about poisons and chemicals?

583
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,252
Otho, on the other hand

584
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:47,504
is always making elaborate studies of things

585
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:49,423
topics you and I might find boring

586
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:53,051
but which sometimes can turn out
to be quite useful.

587
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,097
You're saying that he's the one
that poisoned the Lord Protector.

588
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,348
I had no choice.

589
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,310
I offered to guarantee him the succession.
In return...

590
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,728
he would spare Mara's life.

591
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,813
<i>Oh, but you're leaving out the best part.</i>

592
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:09,693
Once I assumed the throne,
Mara was to be given to Otho as his wife.

593
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:15,449
All she had to do was bat her eyes at him
a couple of times, and the fool was hooked.

594
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,326
Guards!

595
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:22,206
It's true we were to be married, and so we will...

596
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,459
Only now she won't be marrying a lowly servant,

597
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,295
but the Lord Protector himself.

598
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:34,009
I really need to stop making house calls.

599
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,473
You said these weapons had great destructive power?

600
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:41,016
Yes.

601
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,268
What do you intend to do with it?

602
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:48,232
Blow a hole straight up to the surface,
assuming I can get it to fly in a straight line.

603
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,901
I've never actually done anything like this before.

604
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,154
- What'll happen if you succeed?
<i>- Well, two possibilities.</i>

605
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,240
Either we create a nice, sturdy shaft

606
00:35:56,281 --> 00:36:00,911
that will give us some much needed air and provide
a big enough gap for the radio signal to get through,

607
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:04,873
or it will bring the already
unsteady ceiling down on us,

608
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,000
burying us both alive.

609
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,629
I prefer to imagine the first possibility.

610
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,465
Yes, the power of positive thinking.
Very good. While you do that...

611
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:17,469
I will rely on my experience and expertise.

612
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,596
You said you'd never done this before...

613
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:24,393
General expertise.
Will you be quiet while I do this?

614
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,436
<i>Alright...</i>

615
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,367
I can't believe that worked.

616
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,202
What happened to positive thinking?

617
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,662
I lied.

618
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,330
This is McKay.
Is anyone reading?

619
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,332
Rodney, where have you been?

620
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,041
<i>Where have I been?</i>

621
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:53,797
<i>I have been trapped underground by an</i>
<i>earthquake that blocked of our one exit from this</i>
<i>section of the city.That's where I've been.</i>

622
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,924
Do you have access to the ZPM?

623
00:36:56,341 --> 00:37:00,596
No, I don't have access to the ZedPM,
but thank you for your concern, by the way!

624
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:01,471
Rodney...

625
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:02,806
<i>No, no, no, no. No, it's fine.</i>

626
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,644
<i>Upon learning that your beloved friend has nearly died</i>
<i>and continues to face the imminent threat of death,</i>

627
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,898
your first concern is for the ZedPM?
It's only natural!

628
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,734
<i>I am sorry, Rodney,</i>
<i>but we have a few problems of our own.</i>

629
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:17,237
<i>Colonel Sheppard and Dr. Beckett are</i>
<i>no longer responding to our radio calls.</i>

630
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,113
As well,

631
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:23,035
there is a good possibility that the Lord Protector
is about to launch a drone attack on this village.

632
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:26,413
If that happens, everyone here will die.

633
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,262
Leave us.

634
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,393
I'm really sorry, John.

635
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:52,773
Oh, please.
Don't play the sweet little innocent here.

636
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,859
I never meant for you to get hurt.

637
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:57,694
Well, then, help us get out of here.

638
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:58,779
I can't,

639
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,740
but I may be able to convince
Otho to spare your lives.

640
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,492
That would be a good start.

641
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,995
In the meantime, I did bring you this.

642
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,624
You must tell your friends
to leave before it's too late.

643
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:16,088
For his first act as Lord Protector, Otho intends
to destroy the entire village using the throne chair,

644
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,675
so that no other villages will ever
rise up against him again.

645
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,593
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

646
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,387
Sheppard, are you alright?

647
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:27,516
I'm fine. Listen, I need you to pull the ZPM and
cut the power right away, or Ronon and Teyla are dead.

648
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:31,562
I already know all that.
Look, unfortunately I am cut off from the ZedPM.

649
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,938
<i>There's got to be something you can do.</i>

650
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,189
Yeah, I'm working on it!

651
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:35,566
Well, work faster.

652
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,257
These fools...

653
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:06,180
they actually think they can stand against me.

654
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,348
Alright, I think I've got something.

655
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,017
According to my readings,
the ZedPM is nearly depleted.

656
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,519
If we can activate enough systems simultaneously,

657
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,647
it might drain power completely,
thus rendering the drones inert.

658
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:16,773
So do it.

659
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,693
But I can't! I don't have access to enough
systems to draw that kind of power.

660
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,445
I need something really big.

661
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,285
How about the star drive?

662
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,121
The city's just like Atlantis, right...
a city that was designed to fly?

663
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:33,540
You want me to fly the city
right up out of the ground?

664
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:36,043
<i>No, you don't have to go anywhere.</i>
<i>Just charge the engines.</i>

665
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,629
<i>That should be the single greatest</i>
<i>drain on power you can create.</i>

666
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,964
You're right, that could work.
There's only one problem.

667
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,049
What?

668
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,134
<i>This place is pretty unstable.</i>
<i>If I fire up the engines,</i>

669
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,970
the vibrations alone could cause
the whole thing to come down on us.

670
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,392
It's a risk we're going to have to take.

671
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,739
Firing up main engines.

672
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,089
What's going on?

673
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:28,971
Let's go.

674
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,430
What about him?

675
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:32,057
Forget about him.

676
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,144
Sorry, wee man.

677
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,971
<i>Well, this is better...</i>

678
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,639
<i>I guess.</i>

679
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:25,319
You...

680
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,322
this is your doing.

681
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,073
Seize them!

682
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,618
You're only Lord Protector
if you can control the chair.

683
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,994
You said it yourself.

684
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,624
It's over.

685
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,293
You don't have to bow down to this man

686
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,378
<i>or Tavius or anyone else!</i>

687
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,171
John!

688
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:01,730
Tavius was right about one thing.

689
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,817
I do have a fair knowledge

690
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,903
of poisons.

691
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,545
Got the drones,

692
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,880
got a few jumpers, I even got the girl.

693
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,131
<i>You got the girl?</i>

694
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,218
Well, I mean, I could have got the girl.
I turned her down.

695
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:34,304
What did you offer them in return
for the drones and the jumpers?

696
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:37,391
A supply of medicines and an IDC
