1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,427
Why do you have to park so far away?

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,721
This ridge was a little further away than it looked.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,015
You can't just land a Jumper anywhere, Rodney.

4
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,351
It doesn't matter now, I think we're almost there.

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,395
Rodney, do you even know what it is we are looking for?

6
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,689
Yeah, well, whatever it is, it's around here somewhere.

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,732
What's around here?

8
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:27,277
Whatever it was that was causing the energy spike
we detected from the Puddle Jumper.

9
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,570
D'you have any idea what that looks like?

10
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,656
I'll know it when I see it...

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,784
And I see it.

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,291
Looks like a door.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,794
Yes, it is remarkably door-like

14
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,804
Well, looks like the only way through the ridge anyway.
It runs for miles.

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,056
Alright, let's check it out.

16
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,975
- There's something there.
- What?

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,477
Some kind of an energy barrier
around the threshold.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,199
It disappeared.

19
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,909
Or it went right through a cloak.

20
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,995
It has many of the same properties
as a cloaking field.

21
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,497
Yeah, and the Ancients did tend
to hide all the really cool stuff.

22
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,625
Yeah, I would just like to be able to explain
these readings better before we step through.

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,588
Get me a branch.

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,047
You got tape?

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,801
Because...

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,138
I got a camera!

27
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,640
I didn't ask for a log!

28
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,351
<i>Thank you!</i>

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,811
OK, so...

30
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,731
Tape it to the stick...

31
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,527
We extend the camera through,

32
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,281
record for a few minutes,
pull it back, play the recorder.

33
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,618
Yeah! MALP on a stick!

34
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,954
Yes, MALP on a stick, very clever.

35
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,415
<i>Are we done?</i>

36
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,541
Yep!

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,980
<i>I am not fluent in Ancient</i>
<i>but I do recognise a few words.</i>

38
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,942
'Welcome' and 'ascension'.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,151
Ascension?

40
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,487
<i>To a higher plane of existence.</i>

41
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,781
<i>The race of people who built the Stargate,</i>

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:41,411
they eventually evolved to a point
where they ascended to a state of pure energy.

43
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,288
That'd be great!

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,416
Yeah, well, sadly it's a matter of... evolution.

45
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,753
Anyway...

46
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,630
I'm sure we've got more than enough now.

47
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,715
There we go.

48
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,175
And...

49
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,678
have a look, shall we?

50
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,730
OK, then! Any volunteers?

51
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,190
I'll go.

52
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,988
Just... back out if you encounter
anything problematic.

53
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,864
Problematic?

54
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah, like poisonous atmosphere,
acid atmosphere, no atmosphere.

55
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,286
Hey, it's a MALP on a stick, only shows you so much.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,414
OK.

57
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,168
Here goes.

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,718
Weird!

59
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,097
Yeah, it's kinda hurting my hands a little.

60
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,557
OK, so get outta there.

61
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,476
I'm trying to, but it's pulling me in.

62
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,728
I got you.

63
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,230
OK, come on, guys, get me outta here.

64
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,273
I'm tryin'.

65
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,524
Well, try harder.

66
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,984
No, we proved this it shouldn't be happening.

67
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,112
Well, it is!
It's pulling me in!

68
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,780
It's too strong!

69
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,743
Don't touch the barrier!

70
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,393

73
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,785
I don't know if you can hear me over the radio, but...

74
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,539
I'm finally on the other side.

75
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,876
Looks just like the pictures.

76
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,175
Hurts pretty bad to move.

77
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,468
I don't know if I can...

78
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,393
Alright, you guys... stay put.

79
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,901
Why did you tell us to let him go?

80
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,820
Because you weren't gonna stop and the last thing
we need is both of you to get pulled in with him.

81
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,906
Why would the Ancestors create
something that would do this?

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:04,948
I don't know.

83
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,659
- Figure it out or you're going in after him!
- OK, that is not helping!

84
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,996
Obviously the portal reacts differently to living
matter than it does to inanimate objects.

85
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,372
It might even be specific to humans.

86
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,541
This is Sheppard, can you hear me now?

87
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,006
I've taken a good look around the area.

88
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,134
Cave opens up to the other side of the ridge.

89
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,845
There's not much there, so...

90
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:29,973
I'm just gonna...

91
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,059
wait here...

92
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,604
and give you guys a chance to figure this one out.

93
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,775
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Please respond.

94
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,069
You're wasting your time and it's not gonna work.

95
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,780
Colonel, if you can hear me, please respond.

96
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,079
There's absolutely nothing on this tape
that could possibly indicate any kind...

97
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,372
Oh, no!

98
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:54,998
What?

99
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,084
The memory's full.

100
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,795
It's recorded almost two hours and...

101
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,839
and the battery just died! Dammit!

102
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,881
Why are you wasting time?

103
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,800
That is the one thing I am not doing.
OK, look,

104
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,971
I need something living, like a,
like a flower, or a blossom. OK.

105
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:14,184
Now would not be a good time to throw that rock
I asked you to throw a few hours ago.

106
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,355
I'd never see it coming,
this side is as black as oil.

107
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:34,621
There's one thing I haven't tried,
so if you can hear me... stand back.

108
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,498
And if you can't...

109
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,043
Well, then I guess you can't hear me.

110
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,053
Good one, John!

111
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,722
Shoot yourself!

112
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,101
This is downright problematic, Rodney!

113
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,149
To test a theory. Work with me here, people.
Look, if I'm right, we need to hurry.

114
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,651
What are you doin', McKay?

115
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,031
I am trying to determine how much
faster time is passing on the other
side of the portal than it is here.

116
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,616
Why would time progress faster?

117
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,533
That doesn't make any sense.

118
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,619
That is what I am trying to prove.
Now, just wait!

119
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:26,715
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...

120
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,634
- McKay...
- ten, bear with me,

121
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:36,558
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty.

122
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,938
A whole lot faster!

123
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,322
Can you hear me now?

124
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:00,541
The cave opens up to the other side of the ridge but
there's nothing in the immediate area I can survive on.

125
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,143
OK, that's day two and I'm out of water.

126
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,020
We don't leave our people behind,

127
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,106
right?

128
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,571
How about sending me a signal
to show me that you're still there?

129
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,699
Doesn't have to be a rock,
you can write a damn note.

130
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm gonna turn off my radio for another
six hours to conserve the battery,

131
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,965
and try to get some sleep.

132
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,719
Sheppard out.

133
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,307
The blossoms have aged several hours at least.

134
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,435
We might be able to pick him up in the Jumper
but I need to get back to Atlantis.

135
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,269
You're not goin' anywhere.

136
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,900
It is a time dilation field, which means
that time is passing much faster on the other
side of the portal than it is here for us.

137
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,402
I'm not sure of the exact ratio, but I need to go now.

138
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,028
Why?

139
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:11,862
<i>I don't have time</i>

140
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,739
to explain temporal compression theory to you

141
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,782
when every moment we stand here debating this,

142
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,744
literally hours could be going by
for Colonel Sheppard relative to us.

143
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:23,123
Look, hours equate to days, and days for us could
mean years for him. Do you get it now?

144
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,709
Teyla!

145
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,962
I need you to follow me back as far as
the Puddle Jumper and I'll explain
what I need you to do on the way.

146
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,550
And you, stay here.

147
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,469
And do what?

148
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,513
Don't go through, if that's what you're thinking.

149
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:39,723
Give me the knapsack.

150
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,518
Rodney, Teyla... Ronon?

151
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,229
Come in?

152
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,609
You guys are starting to
worry me a little bit here.

153
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,362
Empty your pockets, everything
you think he might need to survive.

154
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,620
We might just buy him a little more time there.

155
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,372
Come on.

156
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,831
- Go.
- Good.

157
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,412
What the hell took you guys so long?

158
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,392
Alright. Emergency rations,
medical kit. Anything else?

159
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,768
Extra batteries for the camcorder.

160
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,187
Right. You know what to do?

161
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,522
Press Record, extend and hold for three seconds.

162
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,565
No more, no less.

163
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,816
- And then pull it out again.
- Right.

164
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,944
If he's still there, that should give him plenty
of time to record a detailed message.

165
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,571
Dammit! Why didn't I send through a note?

166
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,072
What do you mean if he is still there?

167
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,325
Look,
depending on the compression ratio inside the field,

168
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,120
there's a very good chance he may have used up the
supplies we've sent through by the time you get back.

169
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,040
- I know it's hard to get your head around
but what it means is we have to...
- we must hurry.

170
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,917
Right. Go-go-go-go-go-go-go.

171
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,793
Good!

172
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,670
Alright!

173
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,301
Right!

174
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,141
<i>What, you have no idea whether he's injured?</i>

175
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,103
The excruciating pain he was experiencing
was a result of the temporal differential.

176
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,396
And what is that, exactly?

177
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:57,528
The... portal must somehow dampen
the extreme tidal forces that would normally occur
in the event horizon of a time dilation field,

178
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,947
and we were keeping him from passing through it.

179
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,535
So part of his body is experiencing time
at a different pace than the other?

180
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,203
Who knows what that could do to him?

181
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,122
I have no idea, but I suspect he could use a doctor.

182
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,791
So you don't even know if he's alive?

183
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,127
The most time-efficient approach was
to assume that he was alive but stranded.

184
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,047
And why not assume that he'll make
his own way back through the portal?

185
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,009
Because Cl Sheppard would have already had hours
to try to make it back through the portal in the time

186
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,763
I wasted explaining the situation to Conan and Xena!

187
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,807
- Now, Rodney, that's not very...
- No.

188
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,058
No, I suppose it isn't.

189
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,977
This is McKay. Supplies been loaded aboard yet?

190
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,312
<i>Almost there, Sir. Just a few more cases.</i>

191
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,276
Alright. When you're done with that,
make sure you assist Zelenka in securing
the descent probe into the launch compartment.

192
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,318
Let's move.

193
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,034
This is Sheppard.

194
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,665
I'm pretty sure you can't hear me, but I don't
have a volleyball to talk to, so what the hell...

195
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,253
I've rationed what little
I have for as long as I could but

196
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,590
I have enough left for maybe one more day.

197
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,680
I've gotta get myself something to live on while
I find my own source of food and water.

198
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:14,605
Not that I didn't appreciate the three canteens
of water and the whole handful of power bars.

199
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,861
There's nothing in the immediate area.
I'm gonna have to go further out.

200
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,989
I'm giving you an indication of where I go,

201
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,074
as I go.

202
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,785
Sheppard out.

203
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,650
That was quick.

204
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,318
Not fast enough, I fear.

205
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,280
Get the camera.

206
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,537
Doctor McKay would like us to try this again.

207
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,413
To see if Sheppard's still alive?

208
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,376
And to determine the true
passage of time on the other side.

209
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,964
Alright.

210
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,134
Alright.

211
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,599
One, two, three.

212
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,144
That wasn't long enough to see anything.

213
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,732
<i>And yet it seems to have recorded several minutes.</i>

214
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,074
He is not there.

215
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,981
Well, you're either gonna eat me, or...

216
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:22,649
I'm gonna eat you.

217
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,076
We've loaded weeks of supplies
and everything I could think of.

218
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,536
What're we not thinking of?

219
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,330
Now take a minute, and be certain.

220
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,707
If your theory is correct,
you won't be able to make many of these trips.

221
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,584
I am painfully aware of that.

222
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:45,464
I remind you only because from what
you've told me, rushing is what got
Sheppard into trouble in the first place.

223
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,216
This was not his fault, it was mine.

224
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,344
I should have looked more closely at the video.
The clues were there before he even stepped through.

225
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,514
Look, all I can hope
to do now is fix this within his lifetime.

226
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,390
His lifetime?

227
00:16:55,432 --> 00:17:00,187
If it takes us a week to ten days to fix this,
then it won't matter,
because he will probably have died of old age.

228
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,021
Oh my God.

229
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,481
Yeah, hence the rushing.

230
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,149
Now, you ready? You don't look ready.

231
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:04,983
I'm ready.

232
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,277
I need to pick up a few of my books
to help with the translation.

233
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,613
Well, we'll pick `em up on the way,
and I hope you've got us a real Jumper pilot

234
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,491
because I don't trust him and I can't
fly the damned thing in a straight line.

235
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,292
<i>Help!</i>

236
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,086
Help me, please!

237
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,256
Where is it?

238
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,757
It's there. In the trees.

239
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,592
<i>What is it?</i>

240
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,927
The Beast!

241
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,222
- Alright, is there a safe place for us to go?
- No, no, the Cloister is too far.

242
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,223
It's upon us!

243
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,810
Stay down, and stay behind me.

244
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,727
You can't fight it!

245
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,312
Maybe we can scare it away.

246
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,613
Get outta here!

247
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,220
<i>There it is.</i>

248
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,015
Well, according to these readings,
it's not there.

249
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,227
Rodney, I can see it with my own eyes
it's right inside that crater.

250
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,483
It's hard to say whether the Ancients actually
built it inside the crater or whether the rim
formed as a result of the time dilation field.

251
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,693
The Jumper sensors aren't picking up anything?

252
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,612
Nothing, ma'am.

253
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,824
Alright. Position us directly above it and stand by.

254
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,118
Prepare to launch the probe on my mark.

255
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,079
What is this probe of yours supposed to do?

256
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,958
Well, it's supposed to descend slowly
into the atmosphere of a gas giant.

257
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,629
The `chute opens, the probe separates into two
components joined by a tether hundreds of metres long.

258
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,383
So we should be able to receive telemetry
from inside the time dilation field

259
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,593
while the other half of the probe is still outside.

260
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:40,597
Right. And depending on the variance, we might be
able to fly right into the field and rescue Sheppard.

261
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,266
Very clever, Rodney!

262
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,143
Yes, it is.

263
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,020
Actually, it was Zelenka's idea.

264
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,870
Hi.

265
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,791
He's awake again!

266
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,585
I am now!

267
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,259
I am Teer.

268
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,221
Have we met?

269
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,223
When Avrid first brought you here.

270
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,475
You were terribly injured from fighting the Beast.

271
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,895
Avrid carried you almost
halfway across the Sanctuary.

272
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,313
And I healed you.

273
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,648
You did?

274
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,984
You're a little young to be a doctor.

275
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,029
Hedda is one of the few among us
who possesses the healing power.

276
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,866
Well, good. Thank you.

277
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:44,203
It's we who should thank you for
saving our brother from the Beast.

278
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,539
It's funny,
I don't remember winning.

279
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,209
It's good to see you awake and well again.

280
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,295
Didn't it come after you?

281
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,256
No.
Only the Ascended know why.

282
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,927
None of them are around, are they?

283
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:00,802
Are you hungry?

284
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,930
Starving.

285
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,272
Which one of you got me out
of my clothes and into these?

286
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,358
I did.

287
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,986
Is that alright?

288
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,531
Yeah. I just usually like to...

289
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,617
meet a woman before she sees me naked.

290
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,414
What do we have here?

291
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm glad you're feeling better.
Welcome to your new home.

292
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:47,599
Avrid, I'm happy to visit and I'm grateful
for the food and the whole healing thing, but...

293
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,017
do you know the way out of here?

294
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,855
There is no way to leave, John, other than to ascend.

295
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,567
What exactly do you mean by "there's no way"?

296
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,571
That is the sole purpose of this place...

297
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,950
To meditate upon ascension and one day
join those who created the Sanctuary.

298
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,578
The thing is, I've got other plans.

299
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,831
Then why did you enter the portal?

300
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:15,335
Well, call it a mistake. I tried to stop it
but the damned thing sucked me in.

301
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,382
Those that came before us made certain
that there could be no indecision.

302
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,510
Once you set foot within the Sanctuary,
your path was chosen.

303
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,970
Not by me!

304
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:30,601
Once you cross the threshold, you are committed
to be here for the remainder of your days.

305
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:54,917
Alright. Launch the probe on my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.

306
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,799
The probe's about to pass through the field.
Stand by.

307
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,802
Dammit!

308
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,222
- What happened?
- Exactly what I was afraid would happen.

309
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:11,934
The probe was ripped apart by tidal forces
at the event horizon almost instantly.

310
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,269
So we can't fly through it
and rescue Colonel Sheppard?

311
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,605
Not unless we wanna be ripped apart too!

312
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:19,525
Did you receive any telemetry
before the probe failed?

313
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,778
Actually quite a lot.
Looks like mostly gibberish, though.

314
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,239
This is gonna take me the better
part of an hour to go through.

315
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,328
I'm glad I finally got you outside.

316
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,455
You've been alone in your room for so long.

317
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,123
I'm being depressed.

318
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,835
Is it so terrible here?

319
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,753
No, you folks have been great. It's just...

320
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,672
I have responsibilities back home.

321
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,132
People I care about, and who care about me.

322
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,134
At least I thought they did.

323
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,514
Why'd you come here?

324
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,599
Well, I was born here.

325
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,184
No, I mean your people.

326
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,187
Well, they came generations ago.

327
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:02,943
I'm from a race of people who revered those who
came before us, those who created this place.

328
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,153
We call them Ancients.

329
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,865
To follow in their footsteps, to ascend,

330
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,450
was the greatest goal among our forefathers.

331
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,581
Many centuries ago, some of our people
sensed it was within them to do so.

332
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:20,502
It took them many years to discover the
location of this world and once they found it,

333
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,380
they came to this world as a pilgrimage.

334
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,716
We are their descendants.

335
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,467
Not many of you left.

336
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,888
No. We are the last.

337
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,600
So what's holdin' you back?

338
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,270
Journeys such as ours can take a lifetime.

339
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,191
You afraid it might not happen?

340
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:45,110
We're not afraid of anything.

341
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,615
Well, I'd be pretty afraid of that Beast thing.

342
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,368
As long as we stay in the Cloister, we're safe.

343
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,661
And what kind of life is that?

344
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:59,708
Well, life here is not entirely without its pleasures.

345
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,428
The telemetry was not entirely
gibberish. Bring up the HUD.

346
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:16,517
I've been able to determine the location
of the power source inside the field, here.

347
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,810
What good is that?

348
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:23,023
Once we know where the generator is,
one way or another,
I should be able to turn it off.

349
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,309
You know, you don't have to do
this for me every morning.

350
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,935
You saved my brother's life.

351
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:44,605
Then shouldn't he be the one
bringing me breakfast?

352
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,315
He is meditating with the others.

353
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,903
He's always meditating.
Everyone's always meditating.

354
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,657
At least share it with me.

355
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,549
It's OK.

356
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,302
It is very close.

357
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,140
It's here.

358
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,061
It's never come inside the Cloister.

359
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,437
- I am scared.
- It's OK.

360
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,064
- Take her inside.
- John...

361
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,732
- Do it.
- Go.

362
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:44,373
OK, people, I'm starting to develop
some serious abandonment issues here!

363
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,628
OK, but I'm warning you I've got a knife!

364
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,840
<i>No! Come back!</i>
<i>Come back! Come back!</i>

365
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,427
Now there's two of us!

366
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,479
Ronon!

367
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,191
He left a sign for us to see.

368
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,865
He must have gone to look for another way out.

369
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,867
At least we know he may still be alive.

370
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:23,537
<i>Teyla, Ronon. We're inbound in the Jumper</i>
<i>and should touch down in a few minutes.</i>

371
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,621
<i>Meet us at the landing site.</i>

372
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,789
Understood.

373
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,769
We thought we'd lost you again.

374
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,731
What happened?

375
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,691
I've never seen such bravery.

376
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,235
Were it not for you, all may have been lost.

377
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,488
I don't remember winning this time either.

378
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:03,243
He's not fully healed.

379
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,581
- I'm fine.
- You've done enough, Hedda. Come on.

380
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,291
Let's get you some rest.

381
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,223
What the hell's the matter with you people?

382
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,099
I don't understand.

383
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,062
I'm talking about letting her stand
out there alone against that thing.

384
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,856
Violence is not the path to ascension.

385
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:35,025
There's a difference between violence and self-defence.

386
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,028
We are very close to ascension, John.

387
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,321
All of us.

388
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:41,907
If we leave the path,
it may be lost to us forever.

389
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,786
Everything may be lost to you forever
unless you stand up to that damned thing.

390
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,583
I must join the others in meditation.

391
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,177
You sure it was three seconds?

392
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,053
Yes.

393
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,346
And there's twelve minutes of video.

394
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,013
Yes.

395
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,557
Alright, so it's a ratio of about...

396
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,016
Two hundred and fifty to one.

397
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,061
I sent my watch through,

398
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,399
along with a letter to Colonel Sheppard
telling him we're doing our best to rescue him.

399
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,984
If you would like to check again...

400
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,069
No, that's good, that's good,
that's good, good..good thinking.

401
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,781
Just out of curiosity, what does that mean
for Colonel Sheppard in terms of... days?

402
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,408
We're already talking months.

403
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,875
You don't have to wait up for me.

404
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,919
You've been gone over a day.

405
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:39,173
Yeah, well, after I found my weapons,

406
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,301
I decided to take a run all the way back
to the portal, and look what I found.

407
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:46,680
I don't know what took `em so long,
but my friends finally sent some supplies through.

408
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,018
There are people here who care for you.

409
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,853
Sorry, I should've...

410
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,105
told somebody.

411
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,065
<i>I knew.</i>

412
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,569
I was following your journey in my mind.

413
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:02,821
I was with you since you left the Cloister.

414
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,116
Is that some special power
of yours you haven't told me about?

415
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,326
Yes.

416
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:14,374
I've been with you each time
you've searched for a means to leave us.

417
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:18,378
As Hedda has the power to heal,
I am able to see images in my mind.

418
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,508
It's not uncommon for those on the
path to ascension to gain such abilities.

419
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:27,304
I wish you woulda told me, I could've used you
out there. It took me forever to find this stuff!

420
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:31,225
Before my mother ascended,
she could move things with her mind.

421
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,603
You can imagine how wondrous
that would be for a child.

422
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:36,355
Sit with me.

423
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,247
I was the one who sent Avrid to find you.

424
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:54,873
You did?

425
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,000
Because I knew you were coming that night,

426
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,087
and I knew where you would be in the field

427
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,130
and I have known since I was a child

428
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,467
that you would sit here with me as you do now.

429
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:10,264
I've been able to close my eyes and
see your face my entire life, John.

430
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,766
You are the one.

431
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,145
The one what?

432
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,148
The one who will lead us to ascension.

433
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:25,779
What is it?

434
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,449
Nothin'. I just was hoping you were
going in a different direction with that.

435
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,619
I've seen that as well.

436
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:37,457
That's why I waited for you.

437
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,751
Really?

438
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,838
Tonight.

439
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,756
Tonight?

440
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:49,636
I... I wish you woulda told me,
I wouldn't have gone on a ten-hour run.

441
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,764
And in the coming days,
once you have defeated the Beast,

442
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,058
we will ascend together,

443
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,185
all of us.

444
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,313
You mean all of you.

445
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,356
I haven't given up on you just yet.

446
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,360
I don't know how that's gonna happen, Teer.
I really don't.

447
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,531
Look, I've been up against that thing twice.

448
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,659
I don't see how a third time's
gonna turn out any different.

449
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,413
You don't have to know how.

450
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,000
You just have to trust that it will.

451
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,020
<i>OK, I think I've got it.</i>

452
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:46,527
I am interpreting a bit, but it seems the field
was designed as a sanctuary from the Wraith,

453
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:51,657
but a place the last of the Ancients could travel
to and hopefully ascend without fear of attack.

454
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,953
Of course.
They could potentially spend entire lifetimes inside
the field before the Wraith even discovered the place.

455
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:59,248
And if they ever attacked, their ships
would get torn apart just as the probe did.

456
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,000
And so it has remained for ten thousand years.

457
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,293
<i>This writing here...</i>

458
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,296
this serves as a sort of welcome,

459
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:11,176
as well as a warning for any of the humans
under their protection looking for sanctuary,

460
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:16,390
but I think it was left there for anyone who wanted
to seek the path to ascension on their own.

461
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,016
And what's the warning?

462
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,770
That once you cross the threshold,
there's no return.

463
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:27,693
That is, unless you have the exact location of the
power source and the expertise to turn it off.

464
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,486
Hey, we may even get a ZedPM out of this.

465
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:30,654
Now you're talkin'.

466
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:33,657
Lieutenant, this is Weir.
If you haven't heard from us in...

467
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,741
Rodney?

468
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,035
Well, an hour would give us months in there, but,

469
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,371
Elizabeth, of all the people
who should stay, it would be you.

470
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:42,040
<i>There may be writing by the</i>
<i>power source that needs translating.</i>

471
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,750
- There is a slight chance that when we go through...
<i>- Rodney,</i>

472
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,169
I'm going.

473
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,673
Lieutenant, one hour, then head back to Atlantis
and see if Zelenka can think of anything.

474
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:50,757
<i>Understood.</i>

475
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,303
Well, he may need medical treatment and I'm the
only doctor here, so I should probably just...

476
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:57,806
Carson, it probably won't hurt so
much if you just go through quickly.

477
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:01,018
Alright, let's do this.

478
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,613
That wasn't so bad!

479
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,241
You were just...

480
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,035
That's weird...?

481
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:21,580
<i>Well, we may as well relax.</i>
<i>The others are gonna be at least five minutes.</i>

482
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,790
Judging by the location of the power source,

483
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,126
we've got a long walk ahead of us, so...

484
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,225
Haven't any of you seen thunderstorms?

485
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,894
The Sanctuary provides rain for the orchards.

486
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,438
I'm talkin' about thunder and lightning.

487
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,733
Giant bolts of electricity shooting down from the sky.

488
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:51,318
Sounds scary.

489
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,947
Well, it is scary, but it's also very cool.

490
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,825
It's OK to be scared, it's part of life.

491
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:04,081
You know, when I was a kid, we used to have storms
that shook the house. Scared me half to death.

492
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,000
When we are ascended,
we will experience such things.

493
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:10,128
Hell, if you're ascended,
you can make thunderstorms!

494
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,382
I'm talking about actually experiencing life.

495
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,969
We contemplate on the experience that is life each day.

496
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,763
I'm talking about living it.

497
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,936
Haven't any of you got things you wanna
do as flesh and blood human beings first?

498
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,064
I mean, you, you talk about

499
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:34,194
moving on to a plane of existence beyond your
own mortality, but you haven't even really lived.

500
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,113
Our lives are full.

501
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:40,534
Well, I've spent a long time with you folks, and
I don't think "full" means what you think it means.

502
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,703
<i>To ascend, one must meditate.</i>

503
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:45,122
You're not meditating, you're hiding.

504
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,582
From what?

505
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,501
You know the answer to that.

506
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,755
He means the Beast.

507
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,757
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

508
00:36:55,799 --> 00:37:00,387
Now I don't know how any of you expect me to feel like
I belong here, but every time that thing comes around,

509
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,639
I'm out there alone.

510
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,606
You're not alone.

511
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,691
I know, you were out there too.

512
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,819
No, I mean your friends have come.

513
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,571
<i>They number five.</i>

514
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,365
They've come for you.

515
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,285
They have? Are, are you sure?
That's the best news I've...

516
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,079
No, John,
I sense something more.

517
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,041
The Beast is nearly upon them.

518
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,797
You know, I was just thinking,
this entire field, I mean not the field

519
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,424
I mean the field, field

520
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,594
must generate its own day and night cycle,
not to mention its own artificial climate.

521
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:41,637
I mean, it's incredible! When you think...

522
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,305
You wanna pick up the pace, McKay?

523
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,016
Hey, he's waited for months.
Another half hour isn't gonna kill him.

524
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,060
We don't know how long
it's gonna take to find him.

525
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:51,855
Aye, and besides that, I have a date planned
with Lieutenant Cadman for tomorrow night.

526
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:55,067
Oh, no, so we've only got twelve years in here!

527
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,362
What? What is it?

528
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,449
I'm not detecting anything.

529
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,159
Doesn't mean it isn't there.

530
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:05,827
Can you see anything?

531
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:09,748
No. But I sense something is close.

532
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,625
Maybe we should try another way?

533
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,922
Won't make any difference.
It's stalking us.

534
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,590
Sounds like it's more than one.

535
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:20,509
Yeah, more than one what?

536
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,844
I do not know.

537
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,173
What the hell took you so long?

538
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,675
Believe it or not, you were
only gone a couple of hours.

539
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:02,676
Try six months!

540
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,053
You don't understand, you've been
trapped in a time dilation field.

541
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:05,762
What?

542
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,347
- What was that bloody thing?
- I don't know.

543
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,308
What's a time dilation field?

544
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,185
<i>Can we talk about this somewhere else?</i>

545
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,812
No, it is still close.

546
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,293
You've fought this thing before?

547
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,294
Twice.

548
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,130
How did you beat it?

549
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,798
Still haven't figured that out.

550
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,092
Now'd be a good time.

551
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:48,347
Yeah, well, what'd you say we just
fight it and see what happens?

552
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,806
<i>John?</i>

553
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,601
Friends of yours?

554
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,316
We've come to stand with you,
whatever happens.

555
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,110
No, we've come to fight.

556
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,239
And we are not afraid of you.

557
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,409
The Beast is of our own creation,

558
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:13,413
and it is long past time we sent it away.

559
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,112
That's it?
That's all it took?

560
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,782
You were right, John.
We were afraid.

561
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:54,037
The Beast was the final burden we had
to shed, manifest from our own fears.

562
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,790
You gave us the courage to face it.

563
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,254
Come with us.

564
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,178
I'm not ready for that yet.

565
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,472
I'm not sure I'll ever be.

566
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,141
One day, perhaps?

567
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,060
Yeah, one day.

568
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,981
I'll look forward to it.

569
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:25,068
There'll be no need to destroy
the Sanctuary, Doctor McKay.

570
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,195
What?

571
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,363
No..., I wasn't thinking that, I was...

572
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,699
We will keep the portal open
for you until you are gone.

573
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:33,827
At which point the ZedPM which undoubtedly
powers this beautiful place will be...

574
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:37,206
Sanctuary was left by those who came before us,

575
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,209
for those who may seek it out and follow the path.

576
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,794
And it will continue to remain

577
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,713
after you are gone.

578
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:46,673
Yeah, but...

579
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,263
Absolutely.

580
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:22,084
What is it with you and ascended women?

581
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,050
Well, the beard is interesting!

582
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,804
First thing to go when we get home.

583
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,889
<i>Never thought I'd see any of you again.</i>

584
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,641
Kind of even...

585
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,810
missed you a little.

586
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,521
Yeah, well, it was only
a couple of hours for us, so...

587
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,772
Ronon.

588
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,941
We were all quite worried about you.

589
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:46,900
Of course we were.

590
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,361
We're just sorry
we didn't get here sooner.

591
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,825
Let's get outta here!
