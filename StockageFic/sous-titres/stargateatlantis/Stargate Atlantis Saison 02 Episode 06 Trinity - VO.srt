1
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:12,513
I'm just saying, as a team veteran, to the new guy,
heavy lunch before mission departure, bad idea.

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>And even with the inertial dampners, this whole</i>
<i>flying thing is best done on an empty stomach.</i>

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,351
Yeah well, I've got a pretty strong stomach.

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,895
Hey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing
and sometimes it doesn't even affects me.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,188
McKay!

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,273
Are you reading anything?

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,819
Nuthin'! Lifesigns from the planet are negative.

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,238
Then it is a shame.

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,116
From what we read in the Atlantis database,
the Durandens were a wonderful race of people.

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:38,038
Well the database is over 10,000 years old.
You can bet things have changed around here.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,915
Sheppard...

12
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,132
OK.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,969
That's not something you see everyday.

14
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,888
There was a great battle here.

15
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,102
<i>That is a hive ship.</i>

16
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,564
Well, it was a hive ship.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,316
Something put a lot of holes in it, alright.

18
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,402
We should check it out.

19
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,863
What if whatever put holes in it
wants to put holes in us?

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,241
You just said a lot's changed in 10,000 years.

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,177
That would explain the lack of lifesigns.

22
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,430
This is what usually happens when you fight back.

23
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:41,894
These folks took out a fleet of Wraith ships.
I'd say they did a pretty good job of fighting back.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,061
Hold on!

25
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,481
We're picking up faint energy readings....from...

26
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,235
there.

27
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,201
That would explain how they were
able to put up such a good fight.

28
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,577
How?

29
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,870
Because,

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,039
they were Ancients.

Season 2 - Episode 06
Trinity

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,157
Definitely Ancient design.

35
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,909
Their latest stuff, too.

36
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,912
Their latest being 10,000 years old.

37
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,540
It's a lot like the labs we found on Atlantis.

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,750
So this is one of their outposts?

39
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:51,004
Yet the Ancestors made no mention
of their presence here, in the database.

40
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,047
Why?

41
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,634
- Well, let's find out. Can you power it up?
- Working on it.

42
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,947
I got two bodies here.

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,287
I got three more over here.

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,291
Whatever happened here,
no-one came back to claim the dead.

45
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,965
I can't tell if they were fed on by the Wraith.

46
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,842
Yeah, something killed them.

47
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,969
Something killed everyone on this world.

48
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,848
Why is this outpost,
if that's what it is, still intact?

49
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,309
It doesn't make sense. What do you think Rodney?

50
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,314
Sorry, I... wasn't listening,
but it just struck me that

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,065
if this is an Ancient outpost,

52
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,109
why would the Wraith leave it intact?

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,238
That's a good question.

54
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,118
Alright, let's see...

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,369
So...

56
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,626
<i>So it's a military research facility?</i>

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,755
From what we can tell, it's a ground based version of
the satellite weapon we used to destroy that hive ship.

58
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,466
With one major exception. Fire power.

59
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,636
I mean, if that single outpost was responsible
for destroying an entire Wraith fleet...

60
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,514
And you're sure it was this weapon
that destroyed all those Wraith ships?

61
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:29,144
It had to be. There's nothing on
the planet that suggests the Durandens had anything
capable of inflicting anywhere near that much damage.

62
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,523
If we could learn of such technology,
we could defend other worlds from being culled.

63
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,941
It didn't save the Durandens.

64
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,818
Yeah, but at the end of the day,
the outpost was still standing and that means...

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,905
well I'm not sure what that means.
But it means something definitely worth finding out.

66
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,823
- Colonel?
- He's right.

67
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,784
It's definitely worth sending a research team back.

68
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,663
Good! Well give me Optican, Collins and Zelenka,
if he's over the stomach flu.

69
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,374
We'll try to access the computers log books.
See if we can decipher them and if that's...

70
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,875
OK, OK.

71
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,126
Easy sell.

72
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,045
- Go!
- Oh good.

73
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,593
Teyla...

74
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,096
I heard you were heading offworld
on a personal mission.

75
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,974
- To Balkan, yes.
- Sounds interesting.

76
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:16,066
The Balkans possess a particular
disease resistant strain of flax seed, which
would double the yield of our crops on the mainland.

77
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:21,697
In exchange, I intend to offer
Athosian manpower to aid in their harvest.

78
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,199
Still interested?

79
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,328
This place has everything I want,
don't get me wrong, but...

80
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,123
Sometimes you feel the need to go somewhere else.

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,876
- Anywhere else.
- I know the feeling.

82
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,085
So?

83
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,380
Bring only weapons you can conceal.

84
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,134
I'll keep it to a bare minimum.

85
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,819
<i>I'm telling you, at least .09%.</i>

86
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,198
Oh please, please, move the decimal place.
I mean, it's, it's, it's impossible for God's sake.

87
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,824
Have you figured out what this is?

88
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,827
- No.
- No, I wouldn't say no. No, we have a theory.
- Well, we don't know yet.

89
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,580
No, but based on the shielding around
the chamber, what else could it be?

90
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,498
Have you tried turning it on?

91
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,585
That's what we're working on.
The problem is that there's no direct link between it

92
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:22,674
and the main power control systems,
which among other things has led us to theorize that
it's an instrument to power up the weapons systems.

93
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,760
- Cool!
- See that? You see?

94
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,555
See the way he lights up at the mention of that?
It's like Doctor Vogel at the mention of pastries.

95
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,601
- They found out a way to soup up their space gun.
- Yes, but it's much more than that.

96
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,895
Well, the sticking point is that there's...

97
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,648
no tie between
the power generator and the primary capacitor.

98
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,776
Yes. Meaning they would have to channel
the power directly into the weapon.

99
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,570
Which I'm sure means nothing to you.

100
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:48,825
Means they could fire multiple bursts without having
to store up more power for the next firing sequence.

101
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,453
Yes.

102
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,830
- Very good!
- Which leads me back

103
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,165
to, cool.

104
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,251
Yes, but it only makes sense if we're right.

105
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,544
About what?

106
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,088
Tell him.

107
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,256
Not yet.

108
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,717
Come on McKay, you read the equations.
What else could it be? An Ancient typo?

109
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,971
Well we know they're not perfect,
because they're all dead!

110
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,723
Look, I just, I just,
I don't want you to get all excited over nothing.

111
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,017
- Well, maybe you're right.
- I'll give you a hint.

112
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,647
It seems the Ancients were experimenting with high
energy physics on a level that we've never seen before.

113
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,904
- Wow.
- Yes, wow. I just, I want to be sure.

114
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,577
I'll do my best to wait.

115
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,626
The manpower that you are demanding is outrageous.

116
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:45,674
You would turn my people into nothing more
than indentured slaves, to serve your farms.

117
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,345
It would seem that you have nothing else
of value to trade, but your people.

118
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,600
Mattus.

119
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,395
<i>You know full well my offer is fair.</i>

120
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,105
I'm sorry Teyla.

121
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,274
If you had something of more value to offer,

122
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,359
<i>Technology,</i>
<i>weapons.</i>

123
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,486
You've heard my terms.

124
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,698
Then,

125
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,825
our business is done here.

126
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,038
She said her offer is fair.

127
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,251
I say it isn't.

128
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,421
Well,

129
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,006
I say it is.

130
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,649
What?

131
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,529
I had the situation under control!

132
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,907
- It didn't look like it.
- So you came to my rescue.

133
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:57,204
You have no idea what is at stake
during these negotiations! My people depend on me!

134
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,997
They were taking advantage of you.

135
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,457
No they were not!

136
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,417
That is what I wanted them to think.

137
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,172
A negotiation is a delicate process.
The words spoken are often meaningless.

138
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,842
Teyla!

139
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,930
- Do you want me to...
- No!

140
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,851
Go! Gather our things, I will meet you at the Gate.

141
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,609
It was a mistake to force Hendon's hand.
You will only pay for it next time.

142
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,819
I know.

143
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,197
- Your friend is not Athosian?
- No.

144
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,909
Ronon is the only survivor
of a world known as Sateda.

145
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,913
He saved the life of a friend of mine
and in return we offered him sanctuary.

146
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,500
If Sateda is his homeworld,
then he is not the only survivor.

147
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,005
<i>There is a man in this village</i>
<i>who also claims to be from there.</i>

148
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,847
What have we got Sergeant?

149
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,640
It's Colonel Sheppard, Ma'am.

150
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,726
This is Weir. Go ahead Colonel.

151
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,479
<i>We're on our way back. Rodney wants to fill you in.</i>

152
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,399
I take it you found something interesting.

153
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,567
Interesting?

154
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,905
- How about the greatest discovery of all time!
- He's pretty excited.

155
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,325
So I hear. He couldn't even wait till he got back.

156
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:21,955
I wanted to send an encoded databurst directly
from the outpost to the secure network in my lab,
while the Gate was active.

157
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,458
Now!

158
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>Receiving transmission.</i>

159
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,379
Transferring data.

160
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,054
Care to fill me in, so I can be excited too?

161
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,098
- It's a weapon.
- It is much, much more than a weapon!

162
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,310
We think we've stumbled across
the Ancients' last great discovery.

163
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>It was too late to win the war for them, but</i>
<i>I think if I can finish the work they started, then...</i>

164
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,481
What is it?

165
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,691
It's the ultimate power source.

166
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:54,446
Something that would make Zero Point Modules
seem like alkaline batteries in comparison.

167
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,498
<i>It was called Project Arcturus</i>

168
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,545
and from what we could tell,
it's ultimate goal was to render ZPM's obsolete.

169
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:10,879
How?

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:19,054
The Zero Point Module
is an artificially created region of subspace time.
It's kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle.

171
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:24,142
It extracts vacuum energy through it's artificial region
of subspace time until it reaches maximum entropy.

172
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,853
So what's different about this thing?

173
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,772
Project Arcturus was attempting to extract vacuum energy

174
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,400
from our own space time. Making it

175
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,611
potentially as powerful
as the scope of the universe itself.

176
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,490
It strikes me as something
the Ancients would have tried first, even before ZPM's.

177
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,954
And they may have. But extracting zero point energy
from our own universe is, well it's definitely trickier.

178
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,163
Explain trickier.

179
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,960
Well, because we actually have to live in our
own universe, it presents a whole range of problems.

180
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,672
Well obviously it's not all
that easy or Atlantis wouldn't still be relying on ZPM's.

181
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,925
Well, you're right. The Ancients couldn't make it work.

182
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,343
I said I wanted to do all the talking.

183
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,514
- Come on Rodney, Arcturus was a total failure.
- Failure, yes. Total, no.

184
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,268
<i>Look, the Ancients were losing</i>
<i>the war against the Wraith, when work on Arcturus began.</i>

185
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,811
<i>If they could have made it work,</i>

186
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,106
it could have turned the tide of war. I mean,
we're talking about their own Manhatten Project here.

187
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:17,196
The outpost was ordered by the Ancients in Atlantis,
to defend the Duranden people using their
weapons powered by this new power source.

188
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:22,534
Yeah, yes,
but despite their strong reservations that it
was not ready to be tested under battle conditions.

189
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,036
The point is, the Wraith won.

190
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,873
Yes but the Durandens still inflicted
massive damage on the attacking Wraith fleet.

191
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,878
- I'm not saying they didn't put up a hell of a fight.
- The logs indicate there was a major malfunction.

192
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,256
Well yes, the Ancients in the bunker were forced
to shut everything down, including the weapon.

193
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,884
The Wraith sent more ships, the Durandens got wiped out.

194
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,679
So if the malfunction hadn't occurred,
the Ancients would have saved the planet?

195
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,639
Definitely!

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,183
Possibly. Don't sugar coat this, Rodney.

197
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:52,773
The Ancient scientists running Arcturus
were rushed into testing before they had perfected
a means of effectively controlling the power output.

198
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,483
<i>I believe, if they'd had more time,</i>

199
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,485
history would have played out
differently on that planet.

200
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,278
Possibly in this galaxy.

201
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,074
I won't deny that this is something
that we'd dearly love to get our hands on,

202
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,493
but the Ancients were a pretty bright bunch.

203
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,080
And desperate and losing a war they'd
already been fighting for a hundred years.

204
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,041
More importantly, they were, they were like this close.

205
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,587
And you believe you can finish their work?

206
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,797
I do.

207
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,841
We do.

208
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,926
They do.

209
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:31,854
Alright, I need everyone's attention, please!
What we've got here is...

210
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,774
I need this code divided up into sections
and each one double checked.

211
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:40,362
- No! No! You're not listening to me. I'm telling you,
this one right here is wrong!
- It's not going to! It's not going to...

212
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,031
The whole point is that these numbers
here should be corrected.

213
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,201
Unless they're corrected...
there you go, simulation failed.

214
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,005
Oh, that's heavy!

215
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,049
So, I need that over there. Thank you.

216
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,765
<i>What I want you to do is pull the crystal.</i>
<i>Pull it when I say go, alright?</i>

217
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,363
I think we have it.

218
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,123
That's it!

219
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,555
We were looking for a man named Solen.
Do you know him?

220
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:49,973
Upstairs.

221
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,227
Thank you

222
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,981
<i>Was I free?</i>

223
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,608
<i>Course I was.</i>

224
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,985
<i>But my people were counting on me.</i>

225
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,239
Now I was alone. I was low on ammo,

226
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,493
but I managed to take out the three
Wraith guards and gain access to that ship.

227
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,577
<i>Liar!</i>

228
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,039
What did you say?

229
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,087
Ronon?

230
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,091
There were two
Wraith guarding that cruiser and he wasn't alone.

231
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:33,225
Teyla Emmagan, Solen Senshure.
We served in the same regiment on Sateda.

232
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,643
I am honoured.

233
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,770
You two make a nice match.

234
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>Congratulations.</i>

235
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,232
We are friends.

236
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,525
Nothing more.

237
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,444
For years I believed I was the only survivor.

238
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,406
So you don't know about the others?

239
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,782
What others?

240
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:54,288
Before the city fell, a few of us managed
to make it to the shelters west of the capital.

241
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,041
<i>Over 300 civilians found their way there too.</i>

242
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,045
When we emerged
we realised there was nothing to salvage, so

243
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,547
<i>we left.</i>

244
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,882
<i>All of us.</i>

245
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,509
To where?

246
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,345
Some came here. Some went to Manaria.

247
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,182
300.

248
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,644
Drink Ronon and rejoice. You're not alone!

249
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,403
Everything's been triple checked.

250
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,781
Power levels
are holding steady in all computer simulations.

251
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,658
- Power it up.
- Alright!

252
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,368
Attention all personnel!

253
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,830
Stand by for power up, on my mark!

254
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,915
<i>3...</i>

255
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,458
<i>2...</i>

256
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,001
<i>1...</i>

257
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,503
mark.

258
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,941
Oh man. To see Kel's face when he sees you.

259
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,486
Yeah, it's true.

260
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,113
Kel's alive.

261
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,241
And his family.

262
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,034
They settled on Belsa.

263
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,496
Run this big trading operation over there.

264
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,915
When were you going to tell me this?

265
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,085
Honestly,
I was going to wait until you drank a little more.

266
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,672
Then you've seen him.

267
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,051
Yeah, he comes around now and then
to trade weapons with the Balkans.

268
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,762
He's got his own private army now.

269
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,307
Is this Kel, a friend?

270
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,936
Oh, he's more like kin.

271
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,313
He was Ronon's taskmaster

272
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,691
during his military training.

273
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,569
There is no closer bond.

274
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,488
None.

275
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,366
To reunions.

276
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,245
To reunions.

277
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,587
Radek, talk to me.

278
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,631
<i>I'm picking up some minor power fluctuations.</i>

279
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,259
Chamber's temperature's holding steady.

280
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,762
<i>There it goes again.</i>

281
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:17,806
Is everything OK?

282
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,599
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

283
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,812
The containment bubble is designed to automatically
compensate for any sudden changes in energy output.

284
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,898
This never happened in the simulations.

285
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,357
Maybe we should abort.

286
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,154
I said it's fine. Collins. See if you can
boost more power to the field, manually.

287
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,363
You got it.

288
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,550
Prepare for test firing.

289
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,843
On my mark.

290
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,185
Levels just spiked into the red!

291
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:05,729
What?

292
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,105
Shut it down. Shut it all down!

293
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,023
I'm trying.

294
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,275
The interface is not responding.

295
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,904
I'm gonna switch to back-ups!

296
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,407
- Levels are going off the scale!
- McKay?

297
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,536
I have given the command to shut down.
Something's creating an overload.

298
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,328
We should evacuate.

299
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,371
Just give me a few seconds!

300
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,872
We may not have that time!

301
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,124
Wait, wait, wait.

302
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,043
It's stabilizing.

303
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,674
Generator is offline.

304
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,471
What the hell just happened?

305
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:44,101
Obviously there was a surge of some kind.
Look. Collins....Collins.

306
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,689
<i>Collins!</i>

307
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,001
Officially my report will indicate
Dr Collins died due to radiation exposure,

308
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,753
causing severe burns to well over 90% of his body.

309
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,131
But it was more than that?

310
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,299
Aye, much more.

311
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,844
To be honest, I have no idea
what sort of radiation it was.

312
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,847
I've never seen or heard of
cellular decay this massive.

313
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,183
Not when exposure only lasted mere seconds.

314
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,477
Collins' next of kin have been notified.

315
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,563
Good.

316
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:32,900
What went wrong?

317
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,236
We're still analyzing data from the test.

318
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:42,034
All we know for certain was, there was a massive power
surge which in turn, caused the containment field

319
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:46,246
to expand asymmetrically in the direction
of the command access tube.

320
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,915
As to why...

321
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,374
How about human error?

322
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,211
Excuse me?

323
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,673
Well, according to your report, during the test,
Dr Collins made an adjustment to the containment field.

324
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,135
Isn't it possible that he triggered the surge himself?

325
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,181
Are you looking for a scapegoat, Colonel?

326
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,390
Not at all Doctor.

327
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:10,020
I'm admittedly looking for a rationale that would
allow Dr McKay to continue his very important work.

328
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,730
Is there something wrong with that?

329
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,984
No! Collins knew the systems just as well as any of us.

330
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,611
He wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.

331
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,447
Everything was going well.
Everyone did their job.

332
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,950
Then what?

333
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,201
I don't know!

334
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,995
In terms of physics, it shouldn't have happened.

335
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,749
We're still analyzing the data from the accident.
It's going to take time...

336
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,419
What I do know, is the device did
what it was supposed to do.

337
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,588
No Rodney, it didn't.

338
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,216
Well, apart from the obvious containment issues.

339
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,718
It overloaded and you couldn't stop it.

340
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,305
But we won't know for sure until
we go back down there and try again.

341
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,641
Try again? Are you serious?

342
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:48,433
Yes.

343
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,732
A member of your team is in the morgue.

344
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,778
And I am responsible for his death, yes.
I am painfully aware of that.

345
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,990
I sent him in there and I will have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

346
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:07,369
But we have a responsibility
to understand what happened and learn from it.

347
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,497
Rodney, we don't even know what went wrong.

348
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,416
Which is why we have to go back there!

349
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,464
I know how important this is to you, Rodney.

350
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:25,179
But we knew when we came to Atlantis that we might
encounter certain technologies, which for the moment,

351
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,555
are out of our reach.

352
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,973
It's not in this case.

353
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,267
You have the data from your first attempt.

354
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,020
You can run all the simulations you want.

355
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,064
Come on Elizabeth. You really think
the military's gonna let this go?

356
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,650
I mean, at the very least, we should be
the first ones in there to spearhead the research.

357
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:39,902
That's what this is about?

358
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,945
You wanna beat them to it?

359
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,115
I'm sorry. The answer's no.

360
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,472
I'm not tired.

361
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,599
Why did we leave?

362
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,984
I believe you've had enough.

363
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,862
I don't believe I have.

364
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,739
Goodnight.

365
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:28,909
Teyla?

366
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,957
There are 300 of my people.

367
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,150
Harry K. Daghlian.

368
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,944
Who?

369
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,488
He was a scientist.
Worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.

370
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,323
He was only twenty-six years old.

371
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:13,745
Accidentally irradiated himself while performing
a critical mass experiment on half spheres of plutonium.

372
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,456
It took him a month to die.

373
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:22,087
While his body was slowly shutting down
from radiation poisoning, you know what
he did with his last thirty days?

374
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,006
He worked.

375
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,220
He tried until his last breath to understand
what had happened to him, so that others
could learn from the tragedy.

376
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:35,642
So that his work, his death,
wouldn't be rendered meaningless.

377
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:42,316
Now, have you considered what would have happened
if they'd just shut that project down after that?

378
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,358
This is different.

379
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,234
Is it?

380
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:49,531
Collins' death is a pointless waste of life unless
something comes of this and I am not sure that I can...

381
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,745
I think I know what happened.

382
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:57,956
Let's hear it.

383
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,082
Can I come in?

384
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,250
No.

385
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,795
The Ancients had it wrong.

386
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,006
Our mistake was using their equations.

387
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,549
Look, I just did the calculations again myself.

388
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:12,554
I did them three times just to be sure
and I am positive the problem is
in the automatic containment protocols.

389
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,223
OK, what's your fix?

390
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,559
I'm proposing that we adjust
the field strength manually.

391
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,062
You saw how fast it spiked on you.

392
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,648
So we don't operate the generator
at anywhere near it's potential.

393
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,024
Look, there's no need to be greedy.

394
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,152
Even operating at 50% it'll still
generate the power of a dozen ZPM's.

395
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,613
How come the Ancient's didn't figure this out?

396
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,448
Maybe they were caught up in the heat of battle.

397
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,243
Maybe they thought that they needed
as much power as they could get.

398
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,119
Maybe they weren't smart enough.

399
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,371
And you are.

400
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,622
No, I didn't say that.

401
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,124
But I have the benefit of hindsight. They didn't.

402
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:47,798
Look, this is big.
This is the wheel, the light bulb, the hotdog, big.

403
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,134
Best case scenario.

404
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,761
I win a Nobel Prize.

405
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,222
Worse case scenario.

406
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,974
We tear a hole in the fabric of the universe.

407
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,851
Which is much less likely
to happen than the Nobel Prize.

408
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:03,355
I mean, look, the risks are nothing
compared to the potential benefits.

409
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,732
Elizabeth will listen to you.

410
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:09,945
I've never asked this of you before,
but I think I've earned it.

411
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,655
Trust me.

412
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,325
I've already made this decision, John!

413
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,912
If Dr McKay says he's solved the problem,
I don't see why we don't give it another shot.

414
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,790
Isn't the Daedalus about ready to head back to Earth?

415
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,042
Yes we are.

416
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:28,297
But I think you should know the Pentagon
is taking a very keen interest in this vacuum energy.

417
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,884
I'm sure they have, but the Pentagon
doesn't make the decisions here.

418
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,678
Yeah, I may not have the power to overrule you on this.

419
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,767
But when I get back to Earth, I'm going to be
making the recommendation that Dr McKay be allowed
to continue his work, to the highest authorities.

420
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,853
Ultimately Dr Weir,

421
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,731
this won't be up to you.

422
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,696
Can Rodney guarantee that the same thing won't happen?

423
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,323
Nobody can do that.

424
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,991
Then what's changed?

425
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:59,453
According to him it's the Ancients
calculations that were wrong, not his.

426
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,705
If McKay is that confident,
then I don't see why we don't...

427
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:05,000
Confidence is not something
Doctor McKay is in any short supply of.

428
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,419
For good reason! If anyone can do this...

429
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,547
The Ancients could not do this.

430
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,841
And that's what it keeps coming back to for me.

431
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:20,349
Isn't it possible that you have placed the Ancients
on such a high pedestal that you can't even
consider the possibility that they may be wrong?

432
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,352
Why are we mincing words, Colonel?

433
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,229
You want the weapon.

434
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,732
Yes! I do!

435
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:36,406
A weapon that could effectively eliminate the
Wraith threat is very attractive to me, and to the
people that I work for. I'm not hiding that fact.

436
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,325
But there's more to it, isn't there?

437
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,619
No more hunting for ZPMs.

438
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:45,082
The shield at full strength.
Faster, more powerful ships.

439
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:48,752
How about a power source that could provide the
energy needs for an entire planet.

440
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,003
<i>No more fossil fuels.</i>

441
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,880
I get it!

442
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:56,343
And if it worked as advertised,
it would be wonderful.

443
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:04,893
I'm trying to tell you, I know Rodney McKay and
there are times when I have to protect him from himself.

444
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,771
I can do that.

445
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,440
<i>Let me go back with him. Just him and me.</i>

446
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:15,279
You can activate the Stargate any time
you want to contact us by radio.

447
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,949
He really sold you.

448
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,414
He asked me to trust him.

449
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:35,465
I appreciate your support, Colonel,
but... don't worry.

450
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,803
I try and make it a habit
not to make the same mistake twice.

451
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,722
That was a joke, right?

452
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:47,811
No. I offer you my personal assurance that a surge
like the one that happened before is inconceivable.

453
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,938
I'm gonna run some power-up simulations first.

454
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,568
How about I carry out my plan and
you keep the hot coffee coming?

455
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,031
Joking again, right?

456
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:02,618
Well, where were we?

457
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,955
Doctor Weir, I need to speak to you right away.

458
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:07,915
What is it?

459
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:11,251
I finished going over the accident data.

460
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:15,464
I think I know why the Ancients
abandoned this technology.

461
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,011
Colonel Sheppard, this is Atlantis.

462
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,221
Go ahead.

463
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,556
Is Doctor McKay with you?

464
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:28,268
Of course I am, but we're a little busy
getting ready to run a test here.

465
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:32,397
Actually, I would like you to delay the test firing.

466
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:33,649
Why?

467
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,363
We have reason to believe that the weapon's power
source, may not be controllable at any power level.

468
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,656
Radek?

469
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,448
<i>Rodney?</i>

470
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:47,204
OK, we have been over this. I am doing
this manually, at half power. It's a cakewalk.

471
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:50,791
I don't think it matters how much cake you walk on.

472
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:58,674
I've been doing calculations of my own and
I believe that the very act of trying to contain
vacuum energy from our own space-time creates

473
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:02,261
an environment where
the laws of physics cease to apply.

474
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,804
What are you on about?

475
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,264
<i>As power output increases,</i>

476
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:12,187
new and exotic particles are continuously created
and destroyed inside the containment chamber,

477
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,649
interacting with each other and with the field itself.

478
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:21,405
<i>Eventually particles are created</i>
<i>that cannot be prevented in this space-time,</i>

479
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,783
and they breach
the containment field as hard radiation.

480
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:29,830
As long as I'm monitoring the energy output manually,
I can stop that before it happens.

481
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:34,877
You cannot predict something
that is inherently unpredictable.

482
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,504
- Rodney?
- I know what I'm doing.

483
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:43,594
Rodney, I am trying to tell you as a friend,
I have serious doubts.

484
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,596
Well, you're wrong. I'm sorry, but there it is.

485
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:50,434
And to bring this up now when I am just about to do
this smacks of nothing but professional jealousy.

486
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,854
Fine! Kill yourself,
just like the Ancients did!

487
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,939
What do you mean by that?

488
00:30:55,981 --> 00:31:00,944
I believe if the overload is allowed to continue,
the weapon acts as a sort of release valve

489
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,822
to prevent catastrophic containment failure.

490
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:08,035
The Ancients barely managed to shut it down,
and they lost their lives in the process.

491
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:14,291
What we're suggesting is that the Wraith didn't
kill everyone on that planet. It was the weapon itself.

492
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,793
That would explain why this place
is the only thing left standing.

493
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:20,756
Congratulations, you've solved the mystery
of how the Ancients screwed up ten thousand years ago.

494
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,424
<i>It doesn't mean that I will do the same.</i>

495
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,259
Look, I don't know how else to say this,

496
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:27,513
but none of you are capable of understanding
this on the same level that I do.

497
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,389
And Zelenka, that includes you.

498
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:39,358
Rodney, I cannot afford to lose either one of you.

499
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:43,987
Now tell me. Can you do this?

500
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:44,780
Yes.

501
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,157
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

502
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,243
- Are you sure you're sure?
- I said yes!

503
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,245
- Because if you're wrong...
- I'm not!

504
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,216
I'll call you back after the test.
How does that sound?

505
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,051
You'd better.

506
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,887
I won't let you down.

507
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,983
How are you feeling?

508
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,526
Fine.

509
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:29,825
We should really be getting back.
Doctor Weir will be expecting us.

510
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,493
Kel's here.

511
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,287
What?

512
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:36,707
He's meeting with Hendon right now.
Solen just told me.

513
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,293
I have to see him.

514
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,463
And you would like me to arrange a meeting.

515
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:48,177
After yesterday, I don't think
I'd get very far if I asked myself.

516
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:54,433
OK, this is good.

517
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,311
My equations are working like a charm.

518
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:00,731
Power level's at forty percent,
just to be on the safe side.

519
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,608
I think we're ready for our test.

520
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,901
Where do you want the weapon targeted?

521
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,861
The debris orbiting the planet.

522
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:06,862
Sounds good.

523
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:10,365
Bringing the weapon online... now.

524
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:26,882
What's that?

525
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:30,677
Energy surge. It's fine.
I can regulate it.

526
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:32,763
You said you could contain...

527
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:37,935
The temperature inside the containment field
is well within acceptable parameters.

528
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:43,482
Staying ahead of it.
Levels are rising in the chamber.

529
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,818
Reroute power from the secondary systems
to the containment field.

530
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,070
I'm thinking we need to abort.

531
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,864
I can compensate. Just give me a minute.

532
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,075
It's overloading, just like last time.

533
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,369
There is no logical reason this shouldn't be working.

534
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,036
McKay?

535
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:57,746
None of this should be happening!

536
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,749
Look, the energy levels are spiking at a rate
far greater than anything I predicted.

537
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,376
Shut it down!

538
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:07,923
Fine.

539
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,313
Doesn't make any sense?

540
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,275
What's wrong?

541
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,904
I can't shut it down.

542
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,521
I am Kel, from Sateda.

543
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:08,901
Teyla Emmagan of Athos.
Thank you for granting us your time.

544
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,406
If we are to trade,
I would know all the members of your party.

545
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:18,160
Of course. In fact, that is why we are here.

546
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:23,999
Ronon!

547
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,834
Hello, Kel.

548
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,259
Ronon, what have you done?

549
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:40,474
We all know who this man was, what he was.

550
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,645
If anyone here believes he should be avenged,

551
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,857
here I am.

552
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,719
You just used me to murder an innocent man!

553
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,722
He deserved worse.

554
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:24,059
You said he was like a father to you.

555
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:27,187
Kel commanded several infantry divisions on Sateda.

556
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:33,360
When the Wraith came, he ordered thousands
to their death just to save himself.

557
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:39,074
He was, he was... a traitor and a coward.

558
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:45,205
My only regret is that his death was quick.

559
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,798
I understand.

560
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,594
In your place I might have done the same.

561
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:06,185
But believe me when
I tell you that the others would not.

562
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:10,147
We must not speak of this when we return to Atlantis.

563
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:18,405
And if you ever use my friendship in such a way again,

564
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:23,410
I will not be so understanding.

565
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,256
What was that?

566
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,259
The weapon's discharging
to prevent a catastrophic overload.

567
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,178
Alright, that's it. We're outta here.

568
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,558
It's not safe! The weapon's firing
at random targets above the planet.
This is the safest place to be right now.

569
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:50,020
The place isn't gonna be safe for very much longer!

570
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,731
I can bring it back under control!
Just give me a second!

571
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,191
No you can't!

572
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,651
Just one second!

573
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,488
I've seen this before, Rodney.
Pilots who wouldn't eject when something went wrong.

574
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,909
Trying to fix their planes
right until it hit the ground.

575
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,246
OK, we need to leave.

576
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:13,627
I've waited too long, the weapon can't discharge
enough power to avoid a catastrophic overload.
This whole planet's gonna go up.

577
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,798
Not that your speech wasn't working.

578
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,930
OK, strap in.

579
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:28,058
You need to avoid flying predictably
to prevent the weapon from locking onto us.

580
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,059
I know what I'm doing.

581
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:31,645
I'm just saying,be sure not to fly in a straight line.

582
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,647
Rodney, shut up!

583
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:42,072
Can I just say there's no way
the Jumper can take even one direct hit?

584
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,241
I'll keep that in mind.

585
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,045
The weapon's locking onto us.

586
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:00,090
How about I fly us away from the planet,
return after the overload?

587
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,258
We can't.

588
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:01,967
Why not?

589
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:08,015
Don't you understand? This explosion is gonna
take out three quarters of the solar system.
There's no way we can fly far enough or fast enough.

590
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,058
We have to head for the Gate.

591
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,477
Dial the Gate.

592
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,569
How do you intend to avoid
getting hit on the final approach?

593
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,447
I haven't figured that part out yet.

594
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,170
It's a good thing we stopped by
to check on your progress, Colonel.

595
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:41,048
Make a break for the Stargate.
We'll run interference.

596
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,674
<i>Copy that, Daedalus.</i>

597
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,052
Stand by to engage sublight engines on my mark.

598
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:48,639
Recommend you go into hyperspace
as soon as we go through.

599
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,807
There's gonna be a big bang.

600
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,142
<i>Understood.</i>

601
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:11,036
Take this grain to the storage room.

602
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:15,666
<i>You are the smartest guy we have.</i>

603
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:16,500
<i>I know!</i>

604
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:24,883
<i>putting your life and other people's lives at risk.</i>
<i>You destroyed three quarters of a solar system!</i>

605
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,426
<i>Well, five sixths. It's not an exact science.</i>

606
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:30,138
<i>Rodney, can you give</i>
<i>your ego a rest for one second?</i>

607
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,892
Oh, Colonel!

608
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,519
Colonel!

609
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,522
I've been looking all over for you.

610
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,023
I heard.

611
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:44,862
I suppose I deserve that.

612
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,697
Look, I just...

613
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:50,993
I wanted to apologise about what happened.
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

614
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,997
And I wanted to assure you that,
I intend not being right again,

615
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:58,083
about everything, effective immediately.

616
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,130
That was a joke.

617
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:04,548
Good one.

618
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,177
I've already apologised to Elizabeth

619
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,679
and Radek and

620
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:15,225
I thanked Colonel Caldwell for...
caring enough to spy on the experiment from orbit.

621
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,436
I sent him a nice little email, actually.

622
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,397
But I saved you till last because,

623
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,988
honestly, I would... I would hate
to think that recent events might have
permanently dimmed your faith in my abilities,

624
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,406
or your trust.

625
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:34,453
At the very least, I hope I can earn that back.

626
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,414
That may take a while.

627
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,250
I see.

628
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:47,007
But, I'm sure you can do it,
if you really wanna try.
