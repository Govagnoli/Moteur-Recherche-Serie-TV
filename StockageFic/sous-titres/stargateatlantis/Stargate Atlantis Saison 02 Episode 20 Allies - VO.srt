<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,588
Hello, Michael.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,422
Do you remember me?

4
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,882
I don't even know who I am.

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,219
I get the feeling like they
know something, something they're not telling me.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,261
He's not...

7
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,513
human!

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,849
I'm a Wraith!

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm returning to what I was.

10
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,229
There are Wraith nearby.

11
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,608
Not only has our dear lieutenant's rejoined the Wraith,
but he's taken with him the knowledge
that Atlantis still exists.

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,693
They will send another wave of hive ships.

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,779
<i>We found a sister ship to the Aurora</i>

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,613
<i>called the...</i>

15
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,447
Orion.

16
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,409
All chairs and seatbacks into
your upright and locked positions.

17
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:38,789
Be advised,
we have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,254
All of my people have been
safely relocated to the City.

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,505
Did everything go smoothly?

20
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,676
Yeah, they're pretty used to it, back and forth,
by now. Have you picked up any of their contacts?

21
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,718
Sergeant?

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,678
Negative, Ma'am.

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,472
Scans are still clear.
It looks like it's just the one hive ship.

24
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,473
And our cloak?

25
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,809
Up and running. All readings are in the green.

26
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,852
Good.

27
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,354
Colonel Caldwell, are you in position?

28
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,108
<i>Affirmative. We're out of scanning range and</i>
<i>ready to jump into position on your go-ahead.</i>

29
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,359
<i>Excellent.</i>

30
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:13,198
Just for the record, I still think that we should be
in orbit around Atlantis, ready to open up on
that hive ship the second it comes out of hyperspace.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,997
It's one hive, Colonel, which suggests they
might just be checking up on us. There's no
need to confirm our presence if we don't have to.

32
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,331
<i>Just stand by.</i>

33
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,791
Standing by.

34
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,711
Colonel Sheppard, how goes it on your end?

35
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:30,507
<i>Well, we're out of sensor range</i>
<i>and all that, but whether or not we're</i>
<i>ready to fight is a whole another story.</i>

36
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,427
<i>Getting this ship up and running</i>
<i>in under a month is a miracle.</i>

37
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>Do we start the beatification now or later?</i>

38
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,892
Rodney, if the hive opens up on us,
I want Orion's drones.

39
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,603
Which means we're gonna need
the hyperdrive to get in position.

40
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,522
Which means we'll need shields,
which means you want everything!

41
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,650
- I like everything! Can we do it or not?
- Well, don't get up!

42
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>Shields!</i>

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,613
Yes.

44
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,489
Jump into position.

45
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,783
Maybe.

46
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,452
Release the drones.

47
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,997
Probably not.

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,499
Well, it's pointless to get
in position if we can't fire.

49
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,542
<i>You know,</i>

50
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,087
let's talk about it for a really long time,
that'll help for sure.

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,633
<i>Rodney's doing everything inhumanly</i>
<i>possible to be ready.</i>

52
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,884
I have a contact.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>Atlantis, report?</i>

54
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,231
<i>It's going into geosynchronous orbit.</i>

55
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,733
Hasn't armed any of its weapons.

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,738
If they do, I want you to switch from cloak to shield
as quickly as possible. Don't wait for my order.

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,614
Yes, Ma'am.

58
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,909
You could be a little more chatty, Elizabeth.

59
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,411
I'm sorry, I was just waiting
for them to make the next move.

60
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,705
Transmitting a signal, audio only.

61
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,999
Put it on speaker.

62
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>We know you are there.</i>

63
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,962
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

64
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,213
<i>Please respond.</i>

65
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,758
John, are you hearing this?

66
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,261
It's repeating again.

67
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,137
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,100
<i>There is no point in hiding, Doctor Weir.</i>

69
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,560
<i>We know you are there.</i>

70
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,019
<i>We mean you no harm.</i>

71
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,688
<i>Please respond.</i>

72
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,190
Is that who I think it is?

73
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,859
<i>He's addressing me by name.</i>

74
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,987
I think we can assume it's Michael.

78
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,848
- You don't actually intend to respond?
<i>- Why not?</i>

79
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,308
Where do you want me to start?

80
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,019
I think we can safely say our cover is blown.

81
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,896
I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.

82
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,190
The message is from Michael, Colonel.

83
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,691
They know we're here.

84
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,069
<i>- But they don't know exactly where we are.</i>
<i>{Y:i}- He's right.</i>

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,280
Answer them, and we guarantee
the first shot won't miss.

86
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,991
Teyla?

87
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,707
Any attempt on my part to connect
with Michael will confirm our location
as surely as if you answer by radio.

88
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,504
I recommend you open a secure channel
to the hive via the Daedalus.

89
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,589
That way they won't be able
to pinpoint Atlantis' position.

90
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,675
We can always turn the shield on.

91
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:04,471
And I believe we have enough combined
firepower to take out a single hive if we need to.

92
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,808
Have you ever heard of a Wraith behaving this way?

93
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,268
No.

94
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,936
Nor have I.

95
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,771
Right.

96
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,107
Let's hear what they have to say.

97
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,908
Rodney and I have set up the subspace relay to

98
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,706
go through the Daedalus, and I've been able
to configure our systems to handle both
their audio and video frequencies. So,

99
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,458
we should be able to see and hear them live.

100
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,170
They want to know what's taking so long.

101
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,340
Open the channel.

102
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,185
Hello, Michael.

103
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,061
Why the long delay?

104
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,232
We needed to take a few precautions
before contacting you.

105
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,109
<i>I'm sure you understand why.</i>

106
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,612
I said we would not harm you.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,531
Well, excuse me for not taking you at your word.

108
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,825
You wanted to talk, we're listening.

109
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,868
Go ahead.

110
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,162
Over two years ago,

111
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,498
every hive ship in this galaxy

112
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,627
emerged from hibernation prematurely.

113
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:21,215
We thought a new,
<i>rich feeding ground had been discovered.</i>

114
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,257
Earth.

115
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,134
Unfortunately,

116
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,802
locating your planet

117
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:30,182
and uncovering an effective means
of transportation to get there

118
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,310
has proven... quite difficult.

119
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,647
Well, I can't say I'm sad to hear that.

120
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,691
<i>For the first time since the dawn of our race,</i>

121
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,320
there are too few of your kind
to feed the waking Wraith.

122
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,657
This has resulted in civil war.

123
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,202
<i>Hives are forming alliances</i>

124
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,496
and the strong are attacking the weak.

125
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,790
Which are you?

126
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,335
Our goals are not dissimilar, Dr. Weir.

127
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,129
<i>You would like to eliminate the Wraith as a threat?</i>

128
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,131
I find that hard to believe.

129
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:07,511
We would like you to give us Dr. Beckett's retrovirus.

130
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,596
If we were able to distribute it

131
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,141
among the rival Wraith hives in sufficient quantity,

132
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,644
this would both render them helpless

133
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,312
and provide us

134
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,606
with an alternative food source.

135
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,109
Those Wraith would become humans.

136
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,820
On the surface, perhaps.

137
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,365
As a sign of good faith,
I am sending you our jamming codes.

138
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,536
This program was established and
distribute before the civil war broke out,

139
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,873
so we assume all the hive ships are still using it.

140
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,375
By figuring out how to bypass

141
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,669
or disable this program,

142
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:45,257
you would be able to beam your nuclear
weapons aboard any of our ships

143
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,134
<i>whenever you so please.</i>

144
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,470
<i>We are willing to help you achieve this</i>

145
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,930
if you help us.

146
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,433
They're sending a data burst.

147
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,769
Download it to a non-networked, firewalled computer.

148
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,604
Yes, Ma'am.

149
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:04,443
<i>I'm sure you'll want to recall all the ships you had</i>
<i>lying in wait for us and discuss this with your people.</i>

150
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,320
We will await your reply.

151
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,405
But

152
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,533
should you make an attempt to destroy us,

153
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,832
we will alert every Wraith in this galaxy
<i>to the fact that Atlantis is still very much intact.</i>

154
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,752
I'm sure you wouldn't want that.

155
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:33,222
Well, I think it's safe to say that if they were going
to attack us, they would have done it by now.
They let the Daedalus land without incident.

156
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,098
And you're sure they don't know about the Orion?

157
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,809
I ordered Lorne to park her
just outside of sensor range.

158
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,644
<i>This...</i>

159
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,729
this is incredible!

160
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,232
<i>I can't believe they actually sent this over so freely.</i>

161
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,568
If I can figure out how to break through this program,
which is, well, as you know, pretty likely,

162
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,696
we could nuke any hive ship that we came across.

163
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,616
- Including Michael's?
- Well, it might take a couple of tries the first time.

164
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,536
Long enough to tell the rest
of the Wraith we're still around.

165
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,455
<i>If they really are willing to let</i>
<i>me run tests on their ship...</i>

166
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,581
I mean, this is...

167
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,000
an amazing opportunity, Elizabeth.

168
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,877
An amazing opportunity?

169
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,754
<i>Well, think about it.</i>

170
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,048
This is essentially our idea.

171
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,469
We created the retrovirus in order to do
exactly what they're proposing we do.

172
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,887
What's the downside?

173
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,015
<i>I mean, other than that fact that</i>
<i>we'd be working with the Wraith.</i>

174
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,267
Isn't that enough?

175
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,812
It would mean at least something good
came of our experiment with Michael.

176
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,689
<i>I am not sure we have a choice.</i>

177
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,025
It appears they have kept our existence a secret,

178
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,111
but if we do not help...

179
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,988
There is that.

180
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,784
Carson, I know you've been working
on the weaponization of the retrovirus.

181
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,244
<i>How close are you?</i>

182
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,495
We're close.

183
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,372
<i>It still needs work,</i>

184
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,040
but we're close.

185
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,548
What?

186
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,842
What do you think?

187
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,136
Let's do it.

188
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,596
<i>Really?</i>

189
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,055
<i>Sheppard said it himself...</i>

190
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,515
it's our idea.

191
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,975
I just thought you of all people...

192
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,146
Hey, if they want our help killing other Wraith,
that's one kind of help I'm happy to provide.

193
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,397
Okay.

194
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,942
So, we're going to do this.

195
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,781
I'll accept the offer.

196
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:19,995
Teyla.

197
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,872
Colonel?

198
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,626
Something tells me you don't
think this is such a good idea.

199
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,754
As I said, I do not believe we have a choice.

200
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,006
But a good idea is still a good idea.

201
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:36,261
I voiced my concern about this plan to change the
Wraith into humans prior to the experiment on Michael.

202
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,513
And we convinced you.

203
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,806
No, Colonel.

204
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,518
I chose to place my trust in you.

205
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:43,977
There's a difference.

206
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,314
Look, it's not like we're setting out
to create a bunch of Michaels here.

207
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,025
No, we are creating a food source for other Wraith.

208
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,987
Instead of us, which is the part
I am fine with, by the way.

209
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,784
I guess I just want you to be fine with it, too.

210
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,120
If this is the full extent of their plan...

211
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,666
What do you mean?

212
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,628
They are Wraith.

213
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:27,145
<i>This is Escort 2. We have a visual on the Wraith</i>
<i>scout ship and are entering formation with Escort 5.</i>

214
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:37,573
I got to tell you, when I woke up this morning,
I honestly didn't think this would be happening.

215
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,743
God, I hope we're doing the right thing.

216
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,854
Touchdown.

217
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.

218
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,937
Welcome to Atlantis.

219
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,042
My people are willing to work
with some of your scientists,

220
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:16,630
but no more than three Wraith will be
allowed on this base at any given time.

221
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:21,468
You will be subjected to extensive searches
that we we'll perform at random intervals.

222
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,555
If any harmful materials or
weapons are found on your,

223
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,849
your fellow Wraith,

224
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,811
we'll consider it an act of aggression
and immediately destroy your ship.

225
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:36,441
- We are also monitoring all of your transmissions.
- All we want is the retrovirus.

226
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,404
It is the key to ending a civil war
that could go on for centuries.

227
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,740
Impose whatever conditions you wish.

228
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,120
Let us begin.

229
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:56,461
Aside from a slight
refinement since we last used it on,

230
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,130
well, on

231
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,841
the one we called Michael.

232
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,343
Do you have names?

233
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,803
What shall I call you?

234
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,680
What shall I call him?

235
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,685
Well, I suppose in the end it
really doesn't matter, does it?

236
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,439
<i>Okay...</i>

237
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:16,982
Where was I?

238
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,027
- We were just getting to dissemination.
- Yes, yes. Thank you.

239
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:20,944
Now,

240
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:25,532
when disseminating an aerosolized medicine
such as the retrovirus, one needs to take in

241
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,618
<i>a number of different considerations...</i>

242
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,369
proximity to patient,

243
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,746
particle size,

244
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,289
<i>ventilation pattern,</i>

245
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,542
<i>- airway architecture, dosage...</i>
- You have turned it into a gas?

246
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:36,710
Yes.

247
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,587
An aerosol gas.

248
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:45,260
On Earth, we would normally use a technique
called aerodynamic dissemination,

249
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:49,431
but because of the problems of doing
that inside, say, like, a Wraith hive ship,

250
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,559
<i>we have attempted various styles</i>
<i>of thermal dissemination.</i>

251
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,728
- Explosives?
- Explosives. Yes, yes.

252
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,356
The problem with an explosive delivery system is that,

253
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,233
because the drug is now an aerosol,

254
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,735
a third of the tests ignited the medication,

255
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,195
rendering it useless.

256
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,655
They call it flashing.

257
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,909
<i>Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons.</i>

258
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:13,830
We found them most difficult
to use in outer-atmosphere combat.

259
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:21,129
When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused
explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.

260
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,841
We had thought of that, yes,

261
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,552
but if you want to affect a

262
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,680
large population simultaneously,

263
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,016
<i>an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.</i>

264
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,353
Now we have to figure out a way to get
it into your enemies' hive ship.

265
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,396
Yes.

266
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,856
We will.

267
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,903
It's pretty interesting stuff.

268
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:50,117
I think I've learned more about Wraith technology
in the last hour than I have in the past two years.

269
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:53,662
Oh, come on.

270
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:58,458
I understand you're an Asgard and everything, but
even you've got to feel a bit of an adrenaline buzz.

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,046
My body does not possess the adrenal gland
that produces epinephrine in your system,

272
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,631
and even if I did,

273
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,009
I would not be as easily impressed.

274
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,762
I get it, I get it... you think you're smarter
than I am. Are you ready to go or not?

275
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,265
I have been for some time.

276
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,644
This is McKay.

277
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,730
Get me an open channel to the hive.

278
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,148
<i>You're live.</i>

279
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,232
<i>Go ahead.</i>

280
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,446
This is Dr. Rodney McKay
aboard the Earth ship Daedalus.

281
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,157
We would like... with your permission,

282
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,413
to begin attempting to beam an innocuous canister
onto your ship while you are actively jamming.

283
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,541
We're hoping, through trial and error, that we can

284
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,709
slowly

285
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,669
disarm or

286
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,546
break the code.

287
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,215
May we proceed?

288
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,262
<i>You may begin, Dr. McKay.</i>

289
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,348
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

290
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,059
That was weird.

291
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,936
Shall we?

292
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,111
Hello, Michael.

293
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,865
It seemed right to come back here.

294
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,785
And to see you.

295
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,287
Thank you for coming.

296
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,998
You didn't have to bring him.

297
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,875
I insisted.

298
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,212
The last time I saw you,

299
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,714
I really was going to feed on you...

300
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,759
but it was not a matter of choice.

301
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,885
It was...

302
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,554
instinct.

303
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,473
That is what you have come here to say?

304
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,564
You have given me a very rare
perspective among the Wraith.

305
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:48,151
Few of us have ever come to know
the humans we are going to feed on as...

306
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,280
anything more than a means to survive.

307
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,948
<i>And still,</i>

308
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,659
I would do what I had to do.

309
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,371
But what you

310
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,707
- did to me...
- We did the same.

311
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,626
- To survive.
- I thought you were trying to help me.

312
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,878
What's your point?

313
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,880
We're not as different as you think.

314
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,840
We are nothing like you.

315
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,513
You are a lot more like us than
you allow yourselves to believe.

316
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,057
I will not argue with you, Michael. It is pointless.

317
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,476
If we are to make this alliance work,

318
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,273
we must both overcome the instincts that define us.

319
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,321
We will not meet again.

320
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,324
Goodbye.

321
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Goodbye.

322
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,377
You're proving my point right now.

323
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,131
Oh, every fiber in your body wants to kill me.

324
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,345
Instinct is so hard to overcome.

325
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,223
But what would happen to our alliance?

326
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:04,144
Every Wraith ship in this galaxy would
descend upon this City and destroy it.

327
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,689
Is it worth it, Ronon?

328
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,983
- If it was up to me...
- But it isn't!

329
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,757
What will happen once you disseminate the weapon?

330
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,343
We shall continue on to the next hive.

331
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,386
Then what?

332
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,557
<i>Well, we will continue until we</i>
<i>have conquered all of our enemies.</i>

333
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,476
And you think our retrovirus can do all that?

334
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,686
Yes.

335
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,397
The one we're freely handing over to you.

336
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,023
I see.

337
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,612
Your people will not be harmed.

338
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,074
Such will be the nature of our agreement.

339
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,285
<i>And what about all the other humans</i>

340
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,786
on the other worlds?

341
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,581
Any chance you'll stop feeding on them?

342
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,251
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.

343
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,587
There will come a time,

344
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,046
however,

345
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,592
when our enemy will be vanquished.

346
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,470
At which point you'll return to killing
ordinary folks the old fashioned way.

347
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,140
That will take far longer than your short lifetime.

348
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:26,018
Let's just say I'm worried about my grandkids.

349
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,562
<i>The technology of this City...</i>

350
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,565
this City that you now control...

351
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,860
is far more powerful than that of the Wraith.

352
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,697
Yet we brought the Lantians to their knees...

353
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,034
- Why?
- Far greater numbers.

354
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,579
Numbers that will be diminished by your retrovirus.

355
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,498
Balance will be restored.

356
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,586
I believe that is as much as either of us can ask for.

357
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,671
Don't you?

358
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,259
No!

359
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,513
I'm sorry, an aerosol gas is the only way to go.

360
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:04,973
<i>Not</i>

361
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,226
that I want to anger you, or

362
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,477
not

363
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,146
take any of your ideas into consideration.

364
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,689
It's just that, well,

365
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,567
we've been working on this for some time now.

366
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:17,819
Very well.

367
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:21,990
<i>Can't you smuggle a gas bomb</i>
<i>onto one of your rival hives?</i>

368
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:28,622
Such a device would not allow for the gas
to affect the whole ship in sufficient time.

369
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:33,418
They would open fire on our own
ship the moment the gas was detected.

370
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,503
Aye.

371
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:37,589
You need to reach all the occupied compartments

372
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,091
at once.

373
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,846
If we could get the aerosol gas
into the life support system...

374
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,265
How long for the gas to take effect?

375
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,269
- Well, theoretically...
- We don't know.

376
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,645
Well, we don't.

377
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,939
He's right, we don't.

378
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,527
Then I will have to make arrangements.

379
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,684
I want to go in there.

380
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,562
Now.

381
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,611
Vent the gas from the room.

382
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,545
Don't worry. He'll begin to turn
back in only a number of days

383
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,297
if we don't start administering the...

384
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,466
<i>Colonel.</i>

385
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,844
We knew this would be a part of the bargain.

386
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,233
I've seen enough.

387
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,541
It works.

388
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,176
There is another hive ship a
single jump away from this system.

389
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:49,763
They recently attempted to attack our ship.

390
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,226
I would like to test the virus on them first.

391
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,688
With all due respect, Madam,

392
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,773
<i>I don't think we're there yet.</i>

393
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,650
<i>We've been working with your scientist here on</i>

394
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:06,697
- an effective means of disseminating
the virus as an aerosol...
- And you have succeeded.

395
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,575
Transforming a single Wraith
in a controlled environment

396
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:13,078
and trying to infect an entire hive at
once are completely two different things.

397
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,041
We plan on entering their hive under the
pretense of negotiating our surrender.

398
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:23,255
Part of the delegation will break away, planting
small canisters of gas throughout the ship.

399
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:27,134
We need only to create a system
that will synchronize the release.

400
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,468
Well, we can do that.

401
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,387
But do we have the kind of volume we need?

402
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,639
Aye. Our lab has been

403
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,559
churning it out since
we struck our deal with our friends here.

404
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,895
Then we can do this?

405
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:39,897
Well...

406
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,316
It's up to them.

407
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,904
I would like our people to go along and observe.

408
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,572
For what purpose?

409
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,782
Make sure you stick to the plan,

410
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,910
do what you say you're gonna do.

411
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,537
Very well.

412
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,457
Good luck.

413
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,876
To us all.

414
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,934
Jumper 8 has cleared the bay, cloaked,
and is heading for the two hives ships.

415
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,312
- We are running quiet and out of sensor range.
- Thank you, Captain.

416
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,773
I guess now we just wait.

417
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,400
This trial's a little premature, don't you think?

418
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,529
Guess that's what happens when
the Wraith get too excited.

419
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,947
What if they fail?

420
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,784
Maybe they'll blow each other to
kingdom come. We can all go home.

421
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,744
I thought we wanted this to work.

422
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,539
I'm just saying if this thing goes south,

423
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,667
we can't let
the word get out we were involved in this.

424
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,381
Carson.

425
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,049
Elizabeth.

426
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,261
When I developed this retrovirus for the Wraith,

427
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:56,014
it was to free them from what I
perceived to be an unnatural state.

428
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:00,435
Now, the very moment they take human form,
they'll face a horribly painful death.

429
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,938
No matter how we rationalize this,

430
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,940
we're still letting the Wraith kill humans.

431
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,652
I guess it depends on how you define "human".

432
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,738
We can't judge an entire race based on the fact that

433
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,448
Michael's experiment didn't work.

434
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,618
If you're asking me whether or
not I'm losing sleep over this...

435
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:21,582
Well...

436
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,169
I am taking those sedatives you prescribed.

437
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,798
We're getting
telemetry back from the cloaked Jumper, Sir.

438
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,924
It's in theater.

439
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,176
Let's see it.

440
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,762
That's our hive there on the left.

441
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,556
"Our hive".

442
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,141
That's weird.

443
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,606
The delegation is aboard. Now we wait.

444
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,361
They didn't need you on the Daedalus?

445
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:56,283
Colonel Caldwell believed my time was
better spent disabling their jamming code.

446
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,619
So, they can fly that ship without you?

447
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,457
Yes, but apparently you cannot
run these tests without me.

448
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:06,168
I'm sure I would have been fine.

449
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,128
I am not as sure.

450
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,088
Really?

451
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:11,507
Well...

452
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:16,386
Okay.

453
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,514
Try it now.

454
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,148
Well, well.

455
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,609
Turns out the human knows
what he's doing after all.

456
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:31,777
<i>Indeed.</i>

457
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,030
Your assistance on this project will be noted.

458
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,865
My assistance?

459
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:46,250
The delegation transport is returning
to the friendly hive ahead of schedule.

460
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,298
What was that?

461
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,968
The transport has been destroyed.

462
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,386
That's not good.

463
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,013
Sir, Jumper 8 is reporting
the enemy hive has opened fire.

464
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,224
Friendly hive is sustaining serious damage.

465
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,853
If they get boarded, it's all over for Atlantis.
They'll give us up for sure.

466
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:09,481
Jump to their position, shields to full,
ready main rail guns, ready all missile batteries!

467
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,441
Jumping into theater now.

468
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,000
Get that Jumper back into bay! We're not
going to be able to keep this up for long.

469
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,086
- Hopefully we'll give them enough time to jump into...
- Our hive is entering hyperspace.

470
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,513
Jumper 8 has been recovered.

471
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:44,349
Set course for Atlantis. Get us out of here.

472
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,322
<i>Our delegation was searched.</i>

473
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:01,867
They were killed immediately
when your canisters were discovered.

474
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,369
<i>Our transport ship tried to escape,</i>

475
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,205
<i>but it was destroyed.</i>

476
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:09,917
You must devise a better delivery method.

477
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,168
Or what?

478
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:15,422
Or we will disclose your location to the other Wraith.

479
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,508
We kept our part of the bargain.

480
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,218
We gave you the retrovirus.

481
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,137
And it is useless without an effective delivery system!

482
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,264
So we have to do everything?

483
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,565
Okay, okay. I will figure something out,

484
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,527
But no more holding back. I want to know
everything there is to know about hive ships.

485
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,322
Schematics, power distribution,
life support configurations, everything you've got.

486
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,157
Then you shall have it.

487
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,243
For real?

488
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,665
Receiving transmission.

489
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,083
Make sure it's secure.

490
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,169
Yeah, we're completely firewalled.
Let me see that.

491
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,469
She actually did it.
I mean, this is the motherlode!

492
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,054
What is, exactly?

493
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,976
Only everything you've ever wanted to know
about Wraith technology, but were afraid to ask.

494
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,563
Why are you doing this?

495
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,816
We have suffered extensive damage.

496
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,366
We could render assistance

497
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,410
<i>You would do this?</i>

498
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,288
We're supposed to have an alliance, aren't we?

499
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:35,794
Sending information on Wraith technology was
a remarkable act of good faith on your part.

500
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:40,007
<i>Your assistance would be acceptable.</i>

501
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,092
Alright, then.

502
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,052
We have a deal.

503
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:00,152
I know you guys have been
burning it at both ends, so...

504
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,279
Dr. Vogel just went to get us some.

505
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,364
- Thank you
- Yeah, caught him on the way in.

506
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,908
How's it coming?

507
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,452
It's phenomenal.

508
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,622
It's like being handed a Wraith encyclopedia.
It's hard to know where to start.

509
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:15,918
When I was a kid and I got my first
encyclopedia, I started with the letter "S".

510
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,880
Yes, well, while I'm sure
that Wraith sexuality is interesting,

511
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,840
we've decided to split into two teams.

512
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:26,345
Team A, over here is trying to find the best
place or places to plant the gas canister

513
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:31,225
and team B, over there is trying to come up
with some fixes for the damage that the Wraith hive

514
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,061
- sustained during its last battle.
- And you?

515
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,980
- Mostly, I'm just skimming the index.
- Anything exciting?

516
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,649
- Oh, yes.
- Such as?

517
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,192
Well, the ships are massive,

518
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,277
but because of their mainly organic design,

519
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,404
they have a number of external weaknesses.

520
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,074
I've got a weakness for external weaknesses.

521
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,327
- Any word from Rodney yet?
- I'm sure he's fine.

522
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:00,170
The organic base of a lot of your technology, it's...

523
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,380
it's quite amazing.

524
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,339
Very...

525
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,674
resilient.

526
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,636
Many of the problems
we encounter eventually heal themselves, yes,

527
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,472
but there are smaller, more complex issues.

528
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:14,685
Such as the programming code
to make your old ships do new things?

529
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,063
Or bypassing inoperable systems, yes.

530
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:21,984
It has been so long since we have fought a real battle.

531
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:23,944
Yes, well...

532
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,780
I imagine I'd forget a lot in 10,000 years, too.

533
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:32,786
Before the civil war, there were
keepers who maintained the entire fleet,

534
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,663
but they have made their own alliances.

535
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,039
Sorry about that.

536
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,624
Without your help,

537
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:41,503
- this damage may have been irreparable.
- Finally, an alien race that appreciates me.

538
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,550
Do you think we will be able to come up with an
adequate delivery system for the retrovirus?

539
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:47,467
Well...

540
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,469
I know that you don't know me,
so you couldn't possibly know this but...

541
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,763
The short answer is yes.

542
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:53,432
This way.

543
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,143
Ronon, are you crazy?

544
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,644
Do you want us to get killed?

545
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,146
You don't touch him.

546
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:02,858
He was guiding me down the hall,
not sucking the life out of my shoulder.

547
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,693
We are sorry.

548
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:05,861
Say you're sorry.

549
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,779
That will not be necessary.

550
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,990
He was protecting his superior.

551
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,491
I would have done the same.

552
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,951
He's not my superior.

553
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,580
Certainly not in every sense.

554
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,582
My apologies.

555
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,626
You wanted to take us somewhere?

556
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,502
Please...

557
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,170
this way.

558
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,595
That's your sweet spot.

559
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:34,556
This central chamber scrubs the
CO2 from your artificial atmosphere

560
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,934
and redistributes it as breathable
air to the rest of the ship.

561
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,978
If you get a sufficiently large canister of
retrovirus into that central chamber,

562
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,606
the whole ship will be affected simultaneously.

563
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:46,944
Getting to this location without
arousing suspicion will be very difficult.

564
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,739
I'm sure it will be,
but we can't really help you with that.

565
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:54,743
Although, the Colonel and I have come up
with a way to test that theory.

566
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,245
Step one,

567
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,916
we find another enemy hive and jump
to a location just out of its sensor range.

568
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,836
Step two, the Daedalus takes position
in close proximity to your hive,

569
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:08,215
essentially merging with your scan patterns, rendering
it practically invisible to the enemies' sensors.

570
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,258
Step three,

571
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,759
using sublight systems,

572
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,095
our ships approach the target hive for

573
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,805
whatever reason...
I'm sure you can come up with something.

574
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:15,556
Step four,

575
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,766
now that the Daedalus can use
its beaming technology again...

576
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,226
which would be thanks to...

577
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,478
Anyway,

578
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,021
once we get in range,

579
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:26,859
we can beam a canister
into the CO2 chamber, and boom...

580
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:29,945
one hive ship de-Wraithified.

581
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,407
Unacceptable.

582
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:35,492
Excuse me?

583
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:40,706
This plan keeps us completely reliant
on you to disseminate the retrovirus.

584
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,999
<i>It's meant to be a test</i>

585
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,085
to see if the gas works in the first place. If it does,

586
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,880
you can come up with some other way to deliver it.

587
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,803
Very well.

588
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:59,892
I'll transmit the coordinates to our new
target as soon as I return to the hive.

589
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,186
We'll leave as soon as you are ready.

590
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,154
What's a girl like her do for fun?

591
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,117
I should be on that hive when we do this.

592
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,118
Excuse me?

593
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,869
Really?

594
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,537
I know it's uncharacteristically brave,

595
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,957
but I've hacked a lot of their systems
under the guise of repairing them.

596
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,044
I've convinced them that I should be there to
supervise their systems if anything goes wrong.

597
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:28,378
And they agreed to this?

598
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,338
Yes.

599
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,798
Plus, now we can freely beam
stuff on and off their ships,

600
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,883
I've written a program

601
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:36,970
that will immediately beam me out of there the
second I activate this emergency transponder.

602
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:40,474
You're sure you want to do this?

603
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,100
Of course I don't want to do it.

604
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:42,809
I just...

605
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,228
I think it should be done.

606
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,979
Ronon goes along.

607
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:47,898
I wouldn't have it any other way.

608
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,441
And I'd like you on the Daedalus.

609
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,901
No place I'd rather be.

610
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,403
<i>Okay. Good let's get this done.</i>

611
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:56,532
I'm about ready for our house guest to leave.

612
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,171
Hey, is your terminal...

613
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,175
You need to see this.

614
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,098
Oh, no.

615
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,600
Tell me the Daedalus has not left yet.

616
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:32,860
Are we there yet?

617
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,237
Do you have any idea how difficult
these maneuvers are going to be?

618
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,155
I'm guessing really difficult?

619
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:40,784
Yeah, we're going to be flying so close to that
hive ship you'd be able to reach out and touch it.

620
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:43,704
I'm gonna insist on a few practice
runs before we approach the enemy.

621
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,455
I'm sure they're fine with that.

622
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,708
Coming out of hyperspace.

623
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,669
Now, get McKay on the radio. I want to...

624
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,382
Shields to maximum!

625
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,635
Decks 1 to 7 in the forward section have
decompressed and are venting atmosphere.

626
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,889
Seal off those sections, get a
damage control team down there.

627
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,433
Who's firing on us?

628
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:07,102
I have two hive ships
bearing down on our position, Sir.

629
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,562
One of them is the friendly.

630
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:10,772
Not so friendly.

631
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,941
All main weapons, fire at will on both ships.

632
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:16,278
<i>Hermiod, stand by to beam</i>
<i>warheads to the nearest hive ship.</i>

633
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:17,946
This doesn't make any sense.

634
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,531
Why break the alliance now?

635
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,742
They don't even have the gas
aboard their ship, we do.

636
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,243
That's not my concern right now.

637
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,833
Colonel Caldwell, this is Hermiod.

638
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,627
The warheads are ready to deploy.

639
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,712
Stand by till we reach optimal range.

640
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,173
We've got to give McKay and Ronon
time to beam back aboard first.

641
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,509
They've got until we reach
weapons deployment range.

642
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,804
If they can't activate their
emergency transceivers by then,
there's nothing we can do about it.

643
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:55,734
What was that?

644
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,444
Activate your transceiver.

645
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,322
Oh, no...

646
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,787
What are you doing?

647
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,039
I am sorry, Dr. McKay.

648
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,249
There has been a

649
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,751
change in plans.

650
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:19,424
That's time.

651
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,260
You got to give them a few more seconds.

652
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,719
Sorry, Colonel. I can't do that.

653
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,722
Hermiod, deploy warheads when ready.

654
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:26,765
Colonel Caldwell,

655
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,102
Dr. McKay's code has failed to
breach the Wraith countermeasures.

656
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,729
I am attempting another series of codes.

657
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,816
Work as fast as you can.
This shield ain't gonna hold up forever.

658
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,028
With some 302s, I might be able to take
out their hyperdrive, save us some time.

659
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,946
Do it.

660
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,241
Shields are at 60%!

661
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>Dagger 2, on my lead,</i>

662
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,377
<i>we're going to hit their stardrives,</i>
<i>where the hull is thinnest.</i>

663
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,378
<i>I've got incoming.</i>

664
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,089
Daggers 3 and 4, try to keep
these darts off our six.

665
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,109
Hold on! We were supposed to be allies!

666
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,573
I'm afraid the alliance has been dissolved.

667
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,409
Do you have any idea how much
work I have put into all of this?

668
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,955
I haven't slept in 36 hours!

669
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,375
Perhaps it is better if you rest.

670
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,885
Shields are under 20%.

671
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,512
Hermiod, what have you got for me?

672
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:51,350
I cannot guarantee that I will be able to defeat
the Wraith countermeasures in sufficient time.

673
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:55,187
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.

674
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,815
<i>Two minutes, and I can shut down their hyperdrive.</i>

675
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:02,444
Unless you can shut down their weapons,
it's not going to do us much good.

676
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:06,490
<i>Damn it.</i>

677
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,331
Sheppard?

678
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,376
Sheppard?

679
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,211
I'm not getting anything, Sir.

680
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,922
Prepare to jump on my mark.

681
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,716
Sir, the hives are opening hyperspace windows.

682
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,944
Why the hell'd they do that?

683
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,780
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, Sir.

684
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:47,656
Sheppard?

685
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,199
His fighter isn't one of them.

686
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:52,744
The only contacts I have on screen are wreckage.

687
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,454
What about his locator beacon?

688
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,123
No. Nothing, Sir.

689
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,584
He's just gone.

690
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,462
Understood.

691
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,467
Set course for Atlantis.

692
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,054
We got hacked.

693
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,057
Within the hive ship schematics
was a worm-like computer virus.

694
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,392
Your people went over the data.

695
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,186
I know. We thought it was clean,

696
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,396
but this virus was entirely different.

697
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,606
What did it do?

698
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:24,985
It very selectively probed our systems
without damaging them or exposing itself.

699
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:28,113
I don't understand. If you didn't
find it, and it didn't reveal itself...

700
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,115
Once the hive left Atlantis,

701
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:33,410
the worm began to destroy
all of the data they had sent down.

702
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,954
Then this was their plan all along.

703
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:38,957
What did they get?

704
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,834
This is one of the reasons we didn't detect it.

705
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,420
They only uploaded two pieces of information...

706
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:46,006
One, the Aurora mission reports...

707
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:47,716
Okay.

708
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,176
And two?

709
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,598
The location of every world in our database.

710
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,154
Are you okay?

711
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:13,492
No.

712
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:17,371
No, I think this is the most "not okay"
I have ever been.

713
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,625
I see you have awakened.

714
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,918
Really?

715
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,420
I was sort of hoping this was just a nightmare.

716
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,840
Why aren't we dead?

717
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,470
The queen wants you to live long enough
to witness the fruits of your labor.

718
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,056
If it wasn't for you, Dr. McKay,

719
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:38,934
we would never have been able to get there.

720
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:41,228
What are you talking about get where?

721
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,190
Earth.

722
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:56,034
.

723
00:42:56,535 --> 00:43:01,331
... See you next season ...
... Hugs and kisses to everyone ...
