00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:06,645
- The princess is going to play.
- Where’s the princess ?

1
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:08,998
- Where’s the princess-- ?
- Right there.

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,680
Which one ?

3
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:12,962
Put this one...

4
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:15,243
This is how they
need to get around, right ?

5
00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:19,200
Go inside the train.

6
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,239
Hello ?

7
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:02,845
Madison ?

8
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:06,400
Honey ?

9
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:16,520
Hi.

10
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,560
Oh, hey.

11
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:19,876
So...

12
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:22,281
... how was your day ?

13
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,121
Send it to Graeme Peel.

14
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:31,558
Graeme has better things to do
than look over my nonsensical scribbles.

15
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:34,287
Well, they didn’t look nonsensical
to me.

16
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,926
Okay, fine, they did.

17
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:39,079
l’m an English major.
What the hell do l know ? Send it.

18
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:41,363
Look, what’ve you got to lose ?

19
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,843
- Good night.
- Good night.

20
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:09,999
l’Il get it.

21
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,956
- Jean Miller ?
- Yes.

22
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:25,279
Hi, l’m Lieutenant Colonel Samantha
Carter of the United States Air Force.

23
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:26,436
Okay.

24
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,046
Did you send a math proof...

25
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:32,041
... to Professor Graeme Peel
of the California Institute of Technology ?

26
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,842
Was l not supposed to ?

27
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:37,596
Sorry to interrupt.

28
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,201
You need to pack your toothbrush,
head back to Earth.

29
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,403
- l do ? Why ?
- Carter needs help.

30
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,562
- With what ?
- Your sister.

31
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:02,079
- Welcome back to Earth.
- Yes, yes. What has my sister done ?

32
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,600
Good to see you too, McKay.

33
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,839
Greetings, salutations, pleasantries.
What’s she done ?

34
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:24,085
l thought that--

35
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,920
Well, it’s certainly
some very interesting stuff...

36
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:33,966
... but, no, can’t be her work. l mean,
she’s been out of the game for years.

37
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,242
The game ?

38
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:39,195
Yeah. She hasn’t published a single
theoretical-physics paper in four years.

39
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,119
Oh, that game.

40
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,881
She was on a fast track
to some pretty exciting grants...

41
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,480
... doing some interesting work.

42
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:49,879
l mean, she was no me, of course,
but she was at least a you.

43
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:55,122
Anyway, she got herself knocked up
by some English major...

44
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,164
... and priorities shifted overnight.

45
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:00,916
Tried to talk some sense into her,
but she’s a tad on the stubborn side.

46
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:02,884
When was the last time
you spoke to her ?

47
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,526
- Four years, maybe.
- Four years ?

48
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:07,605
Not that l didn’t check to see
if she’s published.

49
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,923
You realize what this proof means,
right ?

50
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:14,238
- Yes, if the math checks out.
- l’ve been over it. It checks out.

51
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:18,446
Well, no offense, blue eyes, but l’d like
a little more time with it myself.

52
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:19,960
It checks out.

53
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,086
She said it just came to her ?

54
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,238
She was playing with her kid
and she got a notion.

55
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,604
A notion. That is just beautiful.
She’s gonna love this.

56
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,565
You didn’t tell her l’ve been trying
to prove something like this ?

57
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,605
- Not exactly.
- Oh, good, because she would just--

58
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,645
Wait a minute. Why not ?

59
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:38,358
That’s part of the reason
l asked you here.

60
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,119
She’s been cleared by the Pentagon...

61
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:42,562
... but she refuses
to sign the confidentiality agreement.

62
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,116
She says she wants nothing
to do with us.

63
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,676
To be honest,
she’s been a bit of a pain in the ass.

64
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,404
Forget her, then.
She’s made her choice.

65
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,400
We’Il just have to figure out
how to implement it on our own.

66
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,364
Let’s see.

67
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:59,077
Now, upon first glance,
there are certainly some missing pieces...

68
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:02,444
... that aren’t exactly spelled out
in the proof, but...

69
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,036
What ?

70
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,721
This would go a lot faster
if your sister were onboard.

71
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,447
- She’s not gonna listen to me.
- You’re her brother.

72
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,484
Exactly.

73
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,556
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,398
- Long time no see.
- To say the least.

75
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,519
- Aren’t you going to invite me in ?
- Why are you here ?

76
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:34,639
l can’t just stop by
and say hi to my little sister ?

77
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,004
We haven’t spoken in four years.
You’ve never done anything like this.

78
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,646
So, no, you can’t.

79
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:43,004
l’ve been kind of busy with work,
doing a lot of traveling and such.

80
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,079
And l was called back on business.
So l was in town...

81
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,602
... and l thought l’d, you know...

82
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,598
- Wait a second.
- What ?

83
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,201
You’re not here
because of the physics proof, are you ?

84
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:57,121
- No. That’s part of the reason l’m here--
- You work for the U.S. government ?

85
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,517
No, l work for a multinational
oversight advisory that--

86
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,440
You know what ? l don’t care.
l already told that colonel person...

87
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:04,199
... l don’t want anything
to do with them.

88
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,837
- Do you know what you’ve written ?
- A math proof. Some theoretical physics.

89
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,726
l am willing to wager
it has no practical application at all.

90
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,843
- l’Il take that action.
- What does that mean ?

91
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,362
- Just sign the damn agreement.
- No.

92
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,882
Getting all proprietary
about our research and ideas...

93
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,958
... is everything that’s wrong
with science today.

94
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,402
Did you know
that one-fifth of our genes...

95
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,161
... the very building blocks of our being,
have been patented...

96
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,722
... by major pharmaceutical corporations ?
One-fifth.

97
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,957
If there’s any benefit at all
to what l’ve written...

98
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:31,845
... it’s that it’Il spark an idea
in someone.

99
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:35,682
l am not gonna sign away my rights,
least of all to the U.S. military.

100
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,639
It has sparked an idea in someone,
a big one.

101
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,121
- Like what ?
- No. Can’t tell you.

102
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,960
- Not till you sign the agreement.
- l’m not signing till you tell me.

103
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,516
- Is everything okay ?
- Look who showed up.

104
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:45,881
Hey.

105
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:49,125
It’s my brother.

106
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:52,881
Right. Hey.

107
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,959
Hi.

108
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,562
- Hello, little one.
- Did you bring me a present ?

109
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,804
- Madison.
- What ? No.

110
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,763
- l didn’t know it was a rule.
- It is.

111
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,958
Well, l guess l broke that rule.

112
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,919
l made some dinner.
Would you care to join us ?

113
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,122
Well, that’d be great.

114
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,557
l’m starving. You have no idea
what time zone l came from.

115
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,638
Well, l sure hope you like tofu chicken.

116
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,883
l sure hope he’s kidding. Here you go.

117
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:27,002
Not a fan of vegetarian cuisine, eh ?

118
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes, well, l suppose l was just
in the mood for, well, food.

119
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,558
l’Il give Maddie her bath.
You two catch up.

120
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,116
- Okay, hon.
- Hey, pop your head in before you leave.

121
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,285
- What ? Why ?
- Children like to say goodbye.

122
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,280
Oh, the-- Yeah. Sure. Sure.

123
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,957
Boy, Madison’s sure grown, huh ?

124
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,486
Since she was born ?
Yeah, yeah, she has.

125
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:55,516
Okay, look, l don’t wanna waste
any more of your time.

126
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:56,676
You need to come with me.

127
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,998
Your proof could lead
to something groundbreaking.

128
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,966
- How long would l be gone ?
- Well, like, a couple months, tops.

129
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,362
A couple of months ?
Are you joking ? l--

130
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,722
Madison has her first ballet recital
next Tuesday.

131
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:11,082
She’s 4.
How good could she possibly be ?

132
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,681
- That’s not the point.
- Hey, she’s not gonna remember.

133
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,800
- l’Il remember me not being there.
- This is bigger than your responsibilities.

134
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,117
Okay, we’ve had this conversation
before.

135
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:22,596
You belittle my choices,
l get furious at you...

136
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:26,157
... and we don’t talk for four years.
l’m not all that anxious to do that again.

137
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,119
This is not what Dad
would have wanted.

138
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,876
No, he would have wanted us
working together side by side...

139
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,083
... toppling problems and sharing credit.

140
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:34,999
Oh, you share credit now, do you ?

141
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:38,884
This is important, Jeanie. It’s much more
important than you could ever imagine.

142
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,685
For you, l am sure it is.

143
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,317
But this, me being here,
this is important for me.

144
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,000
Why can’t you accept that ?

145
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,436
- You know, you leave me no choice.
- What ?

146
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,000
- Give me your hand.
- Why ?

147
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:55,080
Please just give me your hand.
Will you just. . ?

148
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:07,601
- Okay, what the hell just happened ?
- It’s okay. You’re perfectly safe.

149
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,326
l don’t feel perfectly safe.

150
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,445
You’ve been teleported to an interstellar
vessel in orbit around the planet.

151
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,077
Please. Teleportation is about as likely
as time travel.

152
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:19,799
Yes, well...

153
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:32,722
- Oh, my.
- Oh, yes.

154
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,044
Is that. . ?

155
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,886
Why aren’t we weightless ?

156
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,363
Artificial gravity.
And, yes, that is North America...

157
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,398
... and you are in geosynchronous orbit.

158
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,478
We work for something
called the Stargate program.

159
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:46,636
Stargate ?

160
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:49,082
It’s a device that creates
stable artificial wormholes...

161
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:53,320
... that allows us to travel between
other planets, even other galaxies.

162
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,036
What have you gotten yourself
involved in here, Meredith ?

163
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:00,283
- Meredith ?
- It’s a long story.

164
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:03,883
- It’s his name.
- Your name is Meredith McKay ?

165
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,641
It’s Meredith Rodney McKay, yes,
but l prefer to go by Rodney.

166
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,877
Could we stick to the point here ?
Look out the window.

167
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,164
- Much more interesting than my name.
- Your name is Meredith ?

168
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:16,684
So this is, like, a spaceship ?

169
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,959
This is a U.S. Air Force vessel
called the <i>Daedalus.</i>

170
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,004
Your equation
has real-world applications...

171
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,964
... l’m certain you’ve never
even considered.

172
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:27,085
You see, there are some
very bad creatures out there...

173
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,403
... that want nothing more
but to destroy this planet...

174
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,205
... and everything that you hold dear.

175
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,206
Did you say creatures ?

176
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,359
- Like alien creatures ?
- Yes.

177
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,406
Look, the work we could do is important,
Jeanie. It’s not just to you or me...

178
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:44,082
... but to every living being down there.
And that includes Madison and...

179
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,317
- Kaleb.
- Kaleb, yes.

180
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,160
- We can’t do this without you.
- Let’s not go overboard.

181
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,124
- l mean, she’d be an asset, but--
- McKay.

182
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,962
So, what do you say, Mrs. Miller ?

183
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,202
- Jeanie ?
- It’s just a lot to take in right now, okay ?

184
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:02,686
Just give me a second, Mer.

185
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:14,522
So somewhere down there, my husband
is giving my daughter a bath.

186
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,084
You have to go.

187
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,606
l know.

188
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,884
- What did you tell Kaleb ?
- The truth.

189
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,561
What ? Do you have any idea
what nondisclosure means ?

190
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,446
Just because we don’t keep secrets
doesn’t mean we’re incapable of it.

191
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,881
Well, what did he say ?

192
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,084
He’s concerned that me telling him
will get him assassinated.

193
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,001
- That-- That won’t happen, right ?
- Oh, probably not.

194
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,920
<i>I’m sorry I couldn’t come with you,</i>
<i>but there’s too much going on here.</i>

195
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,076
It’s fine.

196
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,078
<i>I thought I could</i>
<i>help get Jeanie up to speed...</i>

197
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,124
<i>... before you guys</i>
<i>are out of comm range.</i>

198
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:24,279
<i>About a year ago, your brother came</i>
<i>across an abandoned alien experiment...</i>

199
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:25,880
<i>... called Project Arcturus.</i>

200
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:28,003
<i>It was an attempt</i>
<i>to generate zero-point energy.</i>

201
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,402
That would be virtually limitless power.
What happened ?

202
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:33,923
A slight problem. It was the creation of
exotic particles in the containment field.

203
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>He destroyed a solar system.</i>

204
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,917
- Meredith.
- It was uninhabited.

205
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,647
<i>Your brother, with others,</i>
<i>has been trying to figure out a way...</i>

206
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,486
<i>... to draw zero-point energy</i>
<i>from a parallel space-time.</i>

207
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,400
Which would get us around the creation
of dangerous exotic particles...

208
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:47,556
... in our own space-time.

209
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,683
And my theory
is about bridging universes.

210
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,044
<i>Exactly. And we’re hoping</i>
<i>to use your proof as a theoretical basis...</i>

211
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,005
<i>... for building a bridge</i>
<i>from a parallel space-time to ours.</i>

212
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,641
The energy you’d need would
be enormous to the point of absurd.

213
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,957
« Absurd » we can do.
We have a zero-point module...

214
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,283
... which does what we’re attempting
on a smaller scale :

215
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,244
Extract energy from subspace-time.

216
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:08,126
- So subspace is real ?
<i>-You’re flying in it.</i>

217
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,639
Aren’t you worried about the exotic
particles crossing back over my bridge ?

218
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,121
<i>That’s the beauty of your theory.</i>

219
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,118
<i>It should not only allow us</i>
<i>to build a bridge...</i>

220
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,676
<i>... it should also allow us</i>
<i>to manage the flow rate of energy.</i>

221
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:20,956
Like a faucet.

222
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,956
- Well, it’s something like that.
<i>-It’s exactly like that.</i>

223
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,560
What about the parallel universe ?

224
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,799
Aren’t you just shifting
the exotic-particle problem to their side ?

225
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,440
<i>Potentially. But when you consider...</i>

226
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:33,485
<i>... that the number of possible</i>
<i>parallel universes that we could access...</i>

227
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:35,126
<i>... borders on the infinite...</i>

228
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,596
<i>... the odds of us choosing at random</i>
<i>one that’s inhabited...</i>

229
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,280
<i>... are astronomically slim.</i>

230
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,519
<i>I know, it’s an awful lot</i>
<i>to take in at once.</i>

231
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,837
l solved your problem
in my spare time.

232
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,759
- With finger-paints.
- Here we go.

233
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,395
l just can’t imagine
how you’re surviving the humiliation.

234
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,683
If it wasn’t for my work,
your theory would be useless.

235
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:55,923
<i>Whoa, whoa, siblings, please.</i>

236
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,725
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

237
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,086
What ?

238
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:07,205
<i>Well, it’s just that you both said « sorry »</i>
<i>in that cute little Canadian way, and I--</i>

239
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,838
<i>Sorry. Touch base when you get back</i>
<i>to Atlantis. Good luck.</i>

240
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,319
These creatures must be quite the threat
for you to even try what you’re doing.

241
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:19,921
Now, l don’t wanna scare you,
but you need to know the stakes.

242
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,679
We’re at war.

243
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,883
- Did you start it ?
- What ? No.

244
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,321
- Come on.
- Well...

245
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,365
You’ve got a nota bene by
the cosmological constant. Why is that ?

246
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:34,926
Jeanie ?

247
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,046
Hey.

248
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:41,727
Yeah. Why you’re here, remember ?
Thank you.

249
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:45,163
- So there’s your problem, right there.
- What are you talking about ? It’s here.

250
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,806
- And you made a mistake.
- No, l didn’t.

251
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:50,403
Okay, so we need a yea or nay
on the equations.

252
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,684
Yea.

253
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,403
<i>Atlantis already has</i>
<i>a containment chamber we can use.</i>

254
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,922
<i>I’Il forward the necessary modifications</i>
<i>to zelenka.</i>

255
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,396
<i>If he doesn’t mess it up,</i>
<i>he can make the changes we need...</i>

256
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,920
<i>... before we even get there.</i>

257
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:22,679
Ready ?

258
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,679
Now, we’ve been through
these calculations...

259
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,838
... and we’ve settled
on a containment-field setup...

260
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:31,602
... that should work for us.
l just wanna show you these...

261
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:39,040
Yes, we have it, people. Good work.
Good work, everybody.

262
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,285
Just in time.

263
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,240
- Has he talked about his sister with you ?
- Once or twice in passing.

264
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,398
Usually like,
« Come on, even my sister can do it. »

265
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,683
- You know, that type of thing.
- How’s it coming, Radek ?

266
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,236
The simulations are in the green.
We’re ready to try power-up.

267
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:54,365
- Just in time.
- That’s actually what l just said.

268
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,684
Holy cow.
Now, that can’t be good for you.

269
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,963
Nothing to worry about.
l’ve done it dozens of times.

270
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:05,721
John Sheppard.

271
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,525
Yeah. She’s married
and she’s my sister.

272
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,116
- l’m just saying hi.
- Yeah, l know exactly what you’re doing.

273
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,084
l’ve seen that look before, Kirk.

274
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,925
Hello, Mrs. Miller. l’m Dr. Élizabeth Weir.
Welcome to Atlantis.

275
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,805
Thank you.
Mer’s told me so much about you.

276
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,878
All good, l s--

277
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,561
- Did you just call him Mer ?
- It’s her pet name. Where are we ?

278
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,042
Simulations are in the green.
We’re ready to try power-up.

279
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:28,119
Really ? So soon ? That’s amazing.
Excellent work, Radek.

280
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,517
- Thank you.
- Yes, we try not to encourage him.

281
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,484
He’s got a bit of an ego.

282
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,717
In-chamber conditions are green.

283
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,647
Containment field is in the green.

284
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:50,243
- Monitors are green.
- Everything’s green.

285
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:55,317
- He likes to do the checklist.
- ZPM levels are well into the green.

286
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:59,321
And backup terminals are green.

287
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:01,682
We’re ready to initiate power-up.

288
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,566
- Good luck.
- All right. Here we go.

289
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,439
Want to turn it on together ?

290
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:11,399
- Why would we do that ?
- Because it’s both of our work.

291
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,444
There’s only room on the button
for one finger.

292
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,837
- Well, then can l do it ?
- Yeah, but l’m right here, so--

293
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,760
He likes to push the button.

294
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:22,124
- Fine, go.
- Powering up to 5 percent.

295
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,442
Containment field is holding.
Power generation is steady.

296
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,400
- What about exotic particles ?
- Jeanie, please, l’m on it.

297
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:39,038
We are holding at 5 percent.

298
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,686
Good. Now what ?

299
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,839
The safe thing to do is hold at 5 percent
for the next while.

300
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,038
Yeah, she wasn’t talking to you.

301
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:49,199
- It was an open question to the floor.
- Shared credit, huh ?

302
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:51,119
We’Il do this together.
Dad will be so proud.

303
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:54,677
- This is not the time or the place.
- Fine.

304
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,600
- l’m going to my quarters.
- Yes. Well, good night. Thank you.

305
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,402
So ?

306
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,797
Well, obviously we hold at 5 percent
for the next while...

307
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,845
... and see if any problems turn up.

308
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:06,996
Right.

309
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,841
l should probably
try to get some rest myself.

310
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,599
Could you. . ?

311
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,164
What the-- ? Shut it down.

312
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:41,965
Foreign object. Go get Dr. Zelenka.

313
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,798
It worked.

314
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,803
- What are you doing ?
- Radek.

315
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:03,396
Yes.

316
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,485
l need to speak to whoever’s in charge
of this project.

317
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:08,959
But that’s you.

318
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:14,361
Well, then,
l guess l need to speak to me.

319
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,446
- What is this ?
- Hey, Meredith.

320
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:34,275
Oh, wonderful.

321
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:36,599
John here was kind enough
to show me around...

322
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,327
... offer me a warm meal, and introduce
me to some of your friends.

323
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,206
- What have you told them ?
- We weren’t talking about you.

324
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,240
- Oh, you weren’t ?
- No. We were discussing many things.

325
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:48,963
Now, when the issue of bed-wetting
happened to come up...

326
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:51,482
... she may have mentioned something
about your childhood.

327
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:52,716
That is not true.

328
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,395
- Relax. We all have embarrassing stories.
- Of course we do.

329
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,957
One time, the school bullies made me eat
lunch with my underwear on my head.

330
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,845
Oh, wait, that was you.

331
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:08,201
- And this is revenge for what, exactly ?
- You don’t even know, do you ?

332
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:11,717
<i>Colonel Sheppard and Dr. mcKay</i>
<i>to the Isolation Room immediately.</i>

333
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,679
Isolation Room ?

334
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,320
Come on.

335
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,961
- What in the world ?
- That’s you.

336
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:32,324
No, that is a live closed-circuit feed...

337
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:36,765
... of a man we have
in the Isolation Room.

338
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:44,995
What ?

339
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,921
He appeared in the containment chamber
in some sort of force field.

340
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:52,921
- What do you mean, he appeared ?
- Out of thin air.

341
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:55,760
l have Zelenka working on it.
Obviously we shut down the project.

342
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:57,724
Well, how did he get in there ?

343
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,606
He claims to be from
a parallel universe.

344
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,678
You said the odds against this
were astronomical.

345
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,519
- You saw the math.
- Well, we got it wrong.

346
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,797
He’s here now, so the question is,
what does he want ?

347
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,838
To talk to you.

348
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,319
All right, you want shared credit ?
You’re coming in with me.

349
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,439
Now, l figured you’d be here,
but Jeanie ?

350
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:30,962
l always hoped we’d work together
in Atlantis.

351
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,166
Well, this is a first.

352
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:34,555
- For me too.
- For me too.

353
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:38,402
Have a seat.
Now, l presume you go by--

354
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,159
Rodney.

355
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:41,802
Rod.

356
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:44,242
l could never get anyone
to call me that.

357
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,477
Okay, l’m gonna make
some assumptions...

358
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,046
... based on what l’ve seen here...

359
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:51,085
... and from readings we’ve taken
in my own space-time.

360
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,919
Please stop me if l’m wrong. One :

361
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,043
l presume you’re running
some sort of experiment...

362
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,562
... that’s designed to bridge
between parallel universes ?

363
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:01,602
And, two, it has something to do
with power generation.

364
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,076
- Warm ? Cold ?
- Hot.

365
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,966
Well, l’m sure the experiment’s
been a success on this side...

366
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,960
... but it’s having some rather serious
repercussions in my universe.

367
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,595
- l told you.
- Not now.

368
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,361
Dangerous particles that don’t belong
in either of our universes...

369
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,677
... are being created
on your side of the bridge.

370
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:20,762
So you knew this could happen ?

371
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,201
It was a slight risk, yes.

372
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:26,523
- This is weird.
<i>-Well, you’re quite correct, Jeanie.</i>

373
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:29,485
<i>Because these particles don’t behave</i>
<i>according to any laws of physics...</i>

374
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,126
<i>... in our space-time...</i>

375
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,721
... they’re creating a tear
in the fabric of our universe.

376
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:38,764
- First a solar system, now a universe.
- Yes. How exactly did you get here ?

377
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, we detected the anomaly about
20 hours ago in space above the planet.

378
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,482
We maneuvered one of our Jumpers
in close...

379
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,684
... and tried to broadcast a signal
to whoever was on the other side.

380
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,964
We would be unable to detect that signal
from within the containment chamber.

381
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:56,244
So Sheppard and l came up with a plan
to beam a person into the anomaly.

382
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,759
They would be protected by an Ancient
personal force field that we discovered.

383
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,682
l depleted ours.

384
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,164
Still, it was an incredible risk.

385
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:06,804
Well, it was Sheppard’s idea.

386
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,520
<i>We decided it might allow one of us...</i>

387
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:11,201
<i>... to cross the bridge</i>
<i>and bring the problem to your attention.</i>

388
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,723
There was very little time
and, well, there seemed no other way.

389
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,117
- We drew straws.
- You lost.

390
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:20,842
No. l won. What, the prospect
of saving an entire universe ?

391
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,719
No, it was-- No-brainer.

392
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,482
Oh, sure.

393
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,286
l can’t begin to say how sorry we are.

394
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:31,445
Yes, well, you could start
by shutting down the experiment ?

395
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:33,763
Already done. And after hearing
what you’ve told me...

396
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:35,440
... l see no reason
why we’d start it up.

397
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:40,601
Great. Then my work here is done.
Mission accomplished.

398
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:51,597
Well, yes, but how did you plan
on getting, you know, back ?

399
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:52,882
l mean, to your own universe.

400
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,561
The matter bridge you created
is unidirectional.

401
00:24:57,527 --> 00:25:01,361
- But that means--
- Yes. Yes, it does.

402
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:08,882
So, Jeanie, you have three kids
in this universe ?

403
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:10,560
No, just the one.

404
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:14,037
Well, l’m sure you’re as great a mother
in this space-time as you are in mine.

405
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:15,922
This’Il blow your mind.

406
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:20,285
l have photographs of your alternate life.
Wanna see the kids you haven’t had yet ?

407
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,796
Absolutely. Oh, look at Maddie.

408
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,083
- Who’s that ?
- That’s Bradley and Robbie.

409
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,566
All right, what’s the game plan ?

410
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:29,480
Put him up in the guest quarters
till we can find something permanent.

411
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:31,478
Something more permanent ?
We’re not keeping him.

412
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,877
- He can’t go back.
- That doesn’t mean he has to stay here.

413
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:37,403
- He’d rather be on Atlantis than Earth.
- l see. So he gets his way and l don’t.

414
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,398
How can you not wanna be with him ?
He’s you.

415
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,683
He’s not me. l’m me, the real me.

416
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:45,237
l suppose it’s all relative. To Rod,
his reality is every bit as valid as ours.

417
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,557
To him, we’re the impostors.

418
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,365
What does Élizabeth have to say
about this ?

419
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:50,801
Two McKays are better than one.

420
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:54,960
There aren’t two McKays.
There’s one McKay and him.

421
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:56,685
Whatever you say...

422
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,565
... Meredith.

423
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:16,196
Nice shot. Easily 275.

424
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,564
You know, l’ve been meaning
to put up buoy markers...

425
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,604
... but who has the time, huh ?

426
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,241
This is great. We don’t have
one of these where l’m from.

427
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:27,001
Besides, you’d need to take a cattle prod
to the Sheppard l know...

428
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,964
... to get him up this early.

429
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:30,480
Late nights partying, huh ?

430
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,840
If you could call it that.

431
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:36,601
He’s very active with the Mensa club
we have there.

432
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,163
They have a lot of functions.

433
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,876
Well, can’t blame a man
for his intelligence.

434
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,204
No, but l can blame him
for reminding me all the time.

435
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:48,878
- He doesn’t.
- Trust me.

436
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:52,477
My Sheppard makes your Rodney
seem modest in comparison.

437
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:58,525
Well, l got to admit,
between you and me...

438
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,837
... you’re a lot different
than our Rodney too.

439
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:02,316
How so ?

440
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,078
It’s the little things.

441
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:09,638
You like golf.
You say please and thank you. You’re...

442
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:11,439
What’s the opposite
of condescending ?

443
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,920
Now, l can help you with that hook.

444
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,239
- What the hell is this ?
- Hey, sleepyhead.

445
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,238
- Yeah, hi.
- l had a breakfast date with Jeanie.

446
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,797
l guess it ballooned into a group affair.
Sit down. We’re tracing back our lives...

447
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:42,844
... trying to find differences
between our pasts.

448
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,157
Rod is an honorary member
of the Athosian Council.

449
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:46,999
And is godfather to his niece
and nephews.

450
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,596
- Yes, well, how wonderful for him.
- Well, it’s easier for me.

451
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,804
Our Earth has a ZPM too, so it makes
the back-and-forth a lot simpler.

452
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,282
<i>Doctors mcKay, please report</i>
<i>to the containment chamber.</i>

453
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:56,800
<i>Doctors mcKay.</i>

454
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,400
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

455
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:03,004
- Hey, Rod, are we still on to spar later ?
- Absolutely.

456
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,366
What do you mean you started it up ?

457
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:12,758
Shutting the experiment down only
made things worse for us, not better.

458
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:16,403
The matter bridge is still active,
but we are not drawing any power...

459
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,916
... creating pressure like a dam.

460
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:22,642
If we didn’t turn it on, it could have
resulted in a catastrophic overload.

461
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,719
- We should have thought of that.
- Don’t look at me.

462
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,082
You’re willing to take the credit
but none of the blame ?

463
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:29,600
l never wanted all the credit.

464
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:31,837
- Oh, no one is blaming you.
- Oh, really ?

465
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,402
Look, this is just a temporary solution.

466
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:37,883
The Zelenka in my space-time estimates
that there is at least a week and a half...

467
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,163
... before the tear expands
as far as the city.

468
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:43,637
- My city.
- What’Il happen when it does ?

469
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,765
Imagine what would happen if you threw
the laws of physics out the window.

470
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,839
Entropy. Chaos.

471
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,283
Worst-case scenario, the entropy
expands as far as the subspace layers...

472
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:53,562
... underneath our space-time.

473
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:57,606
It could travel instantaneously. Your
universe could flash out of existence.

474
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:00,196
We need to mend that tear
before it becomes irreparable.

475
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,642
l have some thoughts.
Is there a place we could go to work ?

476
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,644
Oh, yes, of course. Follow me.

477
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:08,963
- Jeanie, we could use your help.
- Thank you.

478
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,798
Do you mind running up
these power requirements ?

479
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,366
Done.

480
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:19,519
What were you doing
having breakfast with him ?

481
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:21,518
l don’t often meet people
from another universe.

482
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:23,325
l found myself curiously interested.

483
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,603
Well, l don’t want you hanging around
with him anymore.

484
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,156
- What ?
- Look, l am your real brother.

485
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,676
- In what sense ?
- Oh, what is that supposed to mean ?

486
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,117
You haven’t been a brother to me
since l quit school.

487
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,437
You were making an incredible mistake.
l was trying--

488
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:39,435
You were trying to control my life, Mer.
l disagreed with you. l still do.

489
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:41,598
What, because of that,
you stopped being my brother ?

490
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:45,077
- l never stopped being your brother.
- We haven’t talked in four years.

491
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:47,843
- Don’t put that all on me.
- It is all on you.

492
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,366
l had no way of getting in touch.

493
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:53,355
l was doing top-secret research
in another galaxy.

494
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:54,880
You could have sent me a message.

495
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:57,720
You know, call me on my birthday,
at Christmas.

496
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:59,764
Once a year,
that’s all l would have needed.

497
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:04,079
Just a,« ou » ?Hi. How are you ?
Are you happy ? Are you okay ? »

498
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,317
That would have been enough,
but you didn’t do that.

499
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:10,805
l was wrong and you were right.
So, what, l was not worth talking to ?

500
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,965
It wasn’t like that at all.

501
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,480
You don’t like me talking to Rod...

502
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,957
... because it makes you realize
how bad a brother you’ve really been.

503
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,516
Hey, you guys got something
over there ?

504
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:25,237
No. We don’t.

505
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,919
- He’s slowing me down.
- Really ?

506
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:32,964
l thought two of you
would have sped things up.

507
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,316
Yeah, he’s not me.

508
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:36,079
l know he’s not the same person,
trust me.

509
00:30:36,247 --> 00:30:38,078
Just saying he’s a genius too,
isn’t he ?

510
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:40,124
- Unless he’s lying.
- About what ?

511
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,484
What if the people on his Atlantis were
sick of him messing up all the time, huh ?

512
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:46,764
So when it came time to send
some stooge to another universe...

513
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,758
... there was only one guy
they could do without.

514
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,679
Say what you want.
l know what this is about.

515
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:51,836
Oh, really ?

516
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:54,760
Mr. Mensa-ln-a-Parallel-Universe,
what is this all about ?

517
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,565
You think Jeanie likes him
more than you.

518
00:30:56,767 --> 00:31:00,521
What ? That’s crazy. That’s-- That’s--

519
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,003
That’s possibly true.

520
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,406
Jeanie and l drifted apart.

521
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,523
l mean, that happens.
It wasn’t done maliciously.

522
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:11,281
Do l have regrets ? Yes, of course l do.
But who doesn’t ? l mean--

523
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:14,519
You know, l’m not very good at saying
l’m sorry or that l’m wrong...

524
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:17,884
... you know, possibly because
it happens so rarely.

525
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:19,801
So l didn’t call or write.

526
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:23,403
And when l realized that four years
has gone by, it was just a...

527
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:27,759
You’re right. Of course, you’re right.

528
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:30,006
She has every reason to hate me.

529
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,682
- l didn’t say she hates you.
- Yeah, well, she should.

530
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:35,518
- Well, if you insist.
- Yeah, l do.

531
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,365
Fine. Fair enough.

532
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:41,361
<i>Dr. mcKay to the containment chamber.</i>
<i>Dr. mcKay.</i>

533
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:43,843
Good talk. Thanks.

534
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,439
- Great, he’s here.
- What’s going on ?

535
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,679
l set up a way to pick up transmissions
inside the containment chamber...

536
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,485
... should Rod’s universe
try to contact us.

537
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:59,719
We, of course, still have no way
of communicating with them, but--

538
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,161
- They sent us a message.
- Yeah.

539
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:02,726
Their exotic-particle problem...

540
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,447
... is spinning out of control much faster
than they’d anticipated.

541
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,757
- Oh, boy.
- But they have a solution.

542
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,043
- They do ? That’s great.
- Well, not really.

543
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:12,084
Their solution
will not only destroy Atlantis...

544
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:16,001
... but tear a hole
in the fabric of this universe.

545
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,558
Oh, boy.

546
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:27,556
Now, l’m not saying that their attempt
would be successful, but if it was...

547
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:30,161
... it would flood the exotic particles
created on their side...

548
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,318
... into this space-time all at once.

549
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:34,523
- And that would--
- Be bad.

550
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,962
- Right. l got that, but--
- How bad ?

551
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,556
Well, to be honest, the science
gets extremely complicated...

552
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:41,399
... but simply put...

553
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:45,196
... the tear will eventually swallow up
the entire galaxy, possibly the universe.

554
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,686
So...

555
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:47,836
... very bad.

556
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,838
l think we can all agree that
that would be bad.

557
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,963
Their plan will take six hours
to implement.

558
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,919
l suggest we do something
before that.

559
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:56,687
- Well, we have an idea.
- Actually, Jeanie has an idea.

560
00:32:57,687 --> 00:33:01,600
We think we can collapse the bridge with
a massive burst of energy from this side.

561
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:06,246
And stop the creation of exotic particles
on the other side by doing so.

562
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:09,996
- How massive a burst are we talking ?
- Everything we’ve got.

563
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,601
l mean, enough to severely deplete
our ZPM.

564
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:15,759
So instead of creating
a new powerful energy source...

565
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,157
... we’Il be sacrificing the one
we already have.

566
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:21,723
Yes. We’d still be able to dial Earth,
but much less frequently, of course.

567
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,959
And let’s just say, l wouldn’t wanna
be around here if the Wraith show up.

568
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,762
l don’t see that we have a choice.

569
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:35,797
All right. Do it.

570
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:38,766
Dr. Weir gave the okay for this ?

571
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:41,487
You’d rather the universe
was destroyed ?

572
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,684
- Not really.
- Rodney, can l talk to you for a second ?

573
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,957
Look, the <i>Daedalus</i> is still in orbit.
l thought--

574
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,560
l know what you’re gonna say.

575
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:56,197
If l can beam into the energy stream,
protected by my personal force field--

576
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,562
You’d be transported
back to your own universe. l know.

577
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:00,877
l didn’t bring it up because,
if it doesn’t work--

578
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,197
Well, l’m willing to take that risk.

579
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,041
l’ve already requested the <i>Daedalus</i>
to execute the transport...

580
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:08,960
... to the coordinates inside the chamber
on your mark.

581
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,004
That is, if you’re willing to do this.

582
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,081
Everyone loves you here.

583
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,720
Yeah, but it’s not home.

584
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,276
Look, what,
my Sheppard is a know-it-all...

585
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:22,042
... my Teyla is hard to talk to,
and my Ronon is--

586
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,243
Well, actually,
those two are pretty similar.

587
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:29,481
l guess what l’m trying to say is that,
for all their faults...

588
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,923
... they’re my team.
My place is with them.

589
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,402
Besides, they’re not looking
for another McKay around here.

590
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,842
- They already have one.
- It’s just a lesser model.

591
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:39,881
l envy you.

592
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,806
You say exactly what’s on your mind
no matter how it makes you look.

593
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:46,363
l can only imagine the freedom you must
have not caring if people like you or not.

594
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:51,437
- What, people don’t like me ?
- Trust me, you’ve got it great here.

595
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,638
Now, l’ve made some calculations.

596
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,798
When the readings reach the levels
l’ve indicated...

597
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,878
... you’Il know whether or not
l made it home.

598
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:02,881
Well, l guess you just need
to click your heels together, huh ?

599
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,959
Good luck, Rodney.

600
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,364
Yeah, you too.

601
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,399
Radek.

602
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,044
Jeanie.

603
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:27,556
- You’re letting him do this ?
- l tried to talk him out of it.

604
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,718
But you know Rod.

605
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:31,559
Hermiod, ready when you are.

606
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:36,805
l guess there’s nothing left to say
but there’s no place like home.

607
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:43,836
All right, all in the green.
Ready for forced power output.

608
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:46,362
Right. Then...

609
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,163
You wanna press the button ?

610
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:54,285
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

611
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,438
Power is at full.

612
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,404
It’s working.

613
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,957
Hermiod, this is McKay.
Commence transport.

614
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:08,915
Transport is complete.

615
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,880
- The bridge is beginning to destabilize.
- It’s not yet enough.

616
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,521
- ZPM’s at 50 percent.
- It’s still not enough, Rodney.

617
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:16,922
- We have to max it out.
- Thirty percent.

618
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:20,319
The bridge is collapsing.
We’ve done it.

619
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:22,199
- Okay, we can shut it down now.
- Not yet.

620
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:25,240
According to these readings, if we
shut it down now, he won’t make it.

621
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:26,721
Give it a few more seconds.

622
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,560
- ZPM’s at 5 percent.
- Almost there.

623
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,001
Cut power now.

624
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:36,443
How much power did you drain
from the ZPM ?

625
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:42,679
All of it.

626
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:45,595
l drained all of it.

627
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,236
You did the right thing.

628
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,441
Well, l suppose l would’ve done
the same thing for...

629
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,199
... me.

630
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,802
l am so fired.

631
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:03,080
<i>Jeanie, it’s your brother, Rodney.</i>

632
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:05,238
<i>I wanna say...</i>

633
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,115
<i>... family is important.</i>

634
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:11,278
<i>I’ve come to realize that</i>
<i>because the people here...</i>

635
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:15,122
<i>... have become a sort of</i>
<i>a kind of surrogate family to me.</i>

636
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:16,402
<i>I know what you’re thinking.</i>

637
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,876
<i>I’ve never been the poster child</i>
<i>for that kind of sentiment.</i>

638
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:22,323
<i>But when one’s contemplating</i>
<i>one’s own demise...</i>

639
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,002
<i>... one tends to see things</i>
<i>more clearly.</i>

640
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:32,197
<i>I really do wish you the best, you know ?</i>
<i>And I’m sorry we weren’t closer.</i>

641
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:33,880
<i>Perhaps...</i>

642
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,244
<i>... if, by chance, I make it out of this,</i>
<i>perhaps one day we can be.</i>

643
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,284
<i>And I would like that.</i>

644
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,846
<i>Now, if there’s time, I’d like to--</i>

645
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,886
When did he record this ?

646
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:51,404
Couple years back when we thought
the bad guys were gonna get us.

647
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,440
Now l’ve seen three sides
of my brother.

648
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,245
Yeah.

649
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,282
What are you two up to ?

650
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:03,120
Nothing. Just telling stories about you.

651
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:05,721
You know,
trying to help her fall asleep.

652
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,363
l’Il leave you guys alone.

653
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

654
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,164
Hey, you should be packing.
<i>Daedalus</i> leaves in the morning.

655
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,360
l’m done. How’d it go with Weir ?

656
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,446
Well, she wasn’t too happy
about the whole killing the ZPM...

657
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,757
... but, you know,
in the grand scheme of things...

658
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,838
... we did prevent the destruction
of the universe.

659
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,520
So, you know, not fired.

660
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:40,400
- That’s good.
- Yeah.

661
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:44,925
Oh, right. Got this for Madison.

662
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:49,836
Yeah. Swiped it from Weir’s desk.

663
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,481
Well, it’s not like there’s a Toys R Us
nearby, so...

664
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,445
Well, it’s the thought that counts,
l guess.

665
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:03,126
- Well, l’d say,« ou » ?See you around, » but...
- Yes.

666
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:04,959
About that.

667
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,923
Which is to say...

668
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:14,805
Look, what l wanted to...

669
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,203
Thank you for trying.

670
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:34,556
How are you ? You happy ? You okay ?

671
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,605
Yeah, Mer. l am.

672
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,405
l really am.

673
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,038
Intergalactic Gate Network
should be completed soon.

674
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:48,720
So...

675
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,479
... maybe it won’t be four years
next time ?

676
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,239
Does this mean
l’Il see you at Christmas ?

677
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:56,281
If you can convince Kaleb
not to make Tofurkey.

678
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,484
No promises.

679
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,276
Am l just not getting
the team e-mails anymore ?

680
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,085
Take it easy.
We’re just talking about Rod.

681
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,881
- Oh, yes, well, of course you are.
- Do you think he made it back ?

682
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,641
Well, it’s hard to say, really,
but l doubt he’Il be back, though.

683
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:30,720
- Good. We found him a little creepy.
- What ?

684
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,718
l can’t stand people
who are nice all the time.

685
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:34,923
Makes me feel like
they’re trying to hide something.

686
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:36,759
- Really ?
- He kept trying to correct me...

687
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:40,715
... on my Athosian history.
It grew tiresome very quickly.

688
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,886
Why, well, he wasn’t that bad.

689
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:45,197
Yeah, well, let’s be honest.
Rod was annoying.

690
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:49,679
Well, l’Il be honest with you.
That’s kind of nice to hear.

691
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,646
Now...

692
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,280
... what else has been happening ?

693
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:57,644
Well, Teyla’s got the hots
for one of the new Marines.

694
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,798
- That is not true.
- You know it is.

695
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:02,117
Hardly new either.
