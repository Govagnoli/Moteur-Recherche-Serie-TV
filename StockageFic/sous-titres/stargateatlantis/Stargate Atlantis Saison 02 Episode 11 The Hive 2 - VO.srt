<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,422
Ford?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,090
Thought I was dead, didn't you Sheppard?

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,384
Jace here has really fine tuned the enzyme.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,470
We've gotten so good we can even lace food with it.

6
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,347
Congratulations.

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,015
You've just had your first dose.

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,352
You're gonna help us, destroy a Wraith hive ship.

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,646
There's been a slight change of plans.

10
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,357
McKay's going to stay here,
while we run the op.

11
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,025
<i>Sheppard, you there?</i>

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,902
<i>I think I might have set the alarm off.</i>

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,158
What do you want?

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,286
The one who flew the ship.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,344
<i>And now the conclusion...</i>

16
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,183
The ship.

17
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,482
Where did you get it?

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,487
You mean the Dart?

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,615
We call them Darts because they're so pointy.

20
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,867
Tell me.

21
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,160
Where?

22
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,664
I really don't wanna say.

23
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,598
I don't even know your name.

24
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,939
In time, you will tell me every...

25
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,778
Tell you what? What's wrong?

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,115
She didn't even tell me her name!

27
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,135
Colonel?

28
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,525
Are you unharmed?

29
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,567
Yeah.

30
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,444
Where'd they take you?

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,241
A little Q and A with the Queen of the hive.

32
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,700
What'd you tell her?

33
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,578
It was a short conversation. She walked out.

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,454
Why?

35
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,540
I don't know. Maybe she was late for a meeting.

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,753
No. There's something else.
I sense she was agitated, even angry.

37
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,630
Why?

38
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,849
Another hive ship has arrived.

42
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,255
Are you sure there's another ship?

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,800
I sense it... close by.

44
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,929
Well, maybe they're planning
on culling the planet together.

45
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>- Or they're gonna fight for it.</i>
<i>- Either way,</i>

46
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,768
the planet's only a few days away, so we don't
have much time if we still intend to stop them.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,522
Alright. First things first.
How to get out. Any luck?

48
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,981
Not yet.

49
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,901
Don't worry... I'll figure a way out.

50
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,445
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

51
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,532
OK, they definitely should have been back by now.

52
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,702
Seriously, am I the only one who thinks that
maybe things haven't gone according the plan?

53
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,745
Yes.

54
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,873
OK, look, we can't just sit here.
We need, we need to, we need to do something.

55
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,959
- Like what?
- Like go get help!

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,670
Look, we can dial the Stargate back
to Atlantis where we have a ship...

57
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,007
a fast ship with, with, with shields. We can fly to
the hive and then, then rescue them if we need to.

58
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,803
Can't dial the Gate, remember? Ford removed
the control crystals from the dialing device.

59
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:07,599
Yes, I know that. But here's the good news.
You're the ones guarding them.

60
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,227
Look, all you have to do is get me
the crystals, I can fix the DHD.

61
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,647
And then then look, you just have to walk
into Ford's little room back there and get them.

62
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,149
We're not giving you anything.

63
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,443
Then I can't dial the Gate.

64
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,695
What I said.

65
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,448
What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
Look, just give me the damned crystals!

66
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,496
You want the crystals,
you're gonna have to go through us.

67
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,417
Unbelievable!

68
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:47,222
Last time we were on one of these ships, McKay was
able to open the door by cutting right into the wall.

69
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,142
You mean like with a knife?

70
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,143
You have a knife?

71
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,896
One for them to find, one to keep.
Everybody knows that.

72
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,232
Right! Forgot all about that rule.

73
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,109
Well, it's a good thing I'm here.

74
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,697
Right! Now, just, take your time...

75
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,451
I said take your time!

76
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,286
I hit the exact spot you were pointing at!

77
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,205
Alright, alright. Anybody else have a knife?

78
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,300
Getting warmer.

79
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,262
How many of those things have you got?

80
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,139
How many d'you need?

81
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:03,549
OK, you can take them out, easy. Just a few well-placed
karate chops and, and, and, and down they go.

82
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,260
Piece of cake. Let's...

83
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,554
Are you an idiot?

84
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,232
Desperate times, desperate measures.

85
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,536
That's one hell of a karate chop!

86
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,589
You must have a hell of a time going through airports!

87
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,305
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

88
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,224
- That's the last of it.
- What about the rest of us?

89
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,101
- You don't need it.
- You don't know that.

90
00:07:56,226 --> 00:08:03,192
We're heading to the Dart Bay.
Stay together, and stay quiet.

91
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,501
Lock and load!

92
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,938
And that's what happens when you back
a brilliant scientist into a corner!

93
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,739
Now focus, focus.

94
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,038
Ah, control crystals! Yes!

95
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,010
Wait.

96
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,096
They are coming.

97
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,139
I got it.

98
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,266
Ford!

99
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:23,897
Move!

100
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,025
More coming!

101
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,068
This way!

102
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,078
Big dose! Big, big dose!

103
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,163
But you needed it.
You needed it.

104
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,666
To lay out the guards... idiots!

105
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,169
"You want the crystals?
You're going to have to go through us."

106
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,045
Well I went through you allright, didn't I?

107
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,131
Like a hot knife trough jelly.
No...

108
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,050
Butter.
Knife trough butter.

109
00:09:52,092 --> 00:10:01,852
Okay... Focus. Must finish dialing. Please, please...

110
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,771
OK, go home.

111
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:29,588
Help us. Please, help us.

112
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,673
She's alive!

113
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,342
<i>So is this one.</i>

114
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,219
Let's get them out of here.

115
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,598
We don't have time to stop.
This isn't the mission!

116
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,935
There is no mission, Ford.
There's just your stupid plan.

117
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,186
- If you hadn't screwed up...
- Look,

118
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:49,399
the sooner you stop arguing with me and help me
save these people, the quicker we get out of here.

119
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,073
<i>Unscheduled activation!</i>

120
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,201
It's Doctor McKay's IDC.

121
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,661
Lower the shield!

122
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,040
I know what I need to do!

123
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,002
Rodney, what's happened?
Where are the rest...?

124
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,713
There's no time, no time.
The planet... not Ford's, the one the...

125
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,590
ship's headed towards, we need to get
there and we don't have much time.

126
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,093
I was barely able to escape myself,
but I managed to take out the guards.

127
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,638
Oh, you should have seen me! I was amazing! I wish
we'd got it on camera because... That's not the point.

128
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,558
Rodney, slow down. Are you alright?

129
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,894
Yes, yes. I mean... I don't know.

130
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,772
I mean, I did take out the guards and
they were huge and dumb and stupid...

131
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:29,648
What guards?

132
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,108
Ford's guards! Didn't I mentioned Ford?

133
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,027
No, you didn't, and you haven't even
mentioned Sheppard, Teyla or Ronon either.

134
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,904
Yes! They were there too, and there were the two guards.

135
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,032
They were huge and massive and I had to take them out,
so I had to inject some of the enzyme.

136
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,117
You took some of the enzyme?

137
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,952
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.
I didn't take some of the enzyme.

138
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,872
I took a lot of the enzyme, because I had to,
because I had to take out the guards, which I did,

139
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,331
and you should have seen me, I was amazing!

140
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,583
Are you insane?

141
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,459
Yes, yes, now that I've taken the enzyme, yes.

142
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,796
Rodney, focus. Where is Colonel Sheppard?

143
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,133
No, no, no, I had to take the enzyme because,
because I had to take out the guards!

144
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,801
But that's not the point...
the point is we don't have enough time.

145
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,721
We need to stop the ship from getting
to where the ship is going.

146
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,764
Come on, come on, let's take a
walk to the Infirmary, alright?

147
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,432
What are you doing?

148
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:08,228
No-no-no-no, I don't wanna go to the Infirmary.
I wanna go to the... the...

149
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,191
Doctor Beckett, we have an emergency.
We're headed to you.

150
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,831
Move!

151
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,768
Are you alright?

152
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,105
I think so.

153
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,110
You were shot by Wraith stunners.
You both went down pretty quick.

154
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,821
The effects of the enzyme must be wearing off.

155
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,740
Where are the others?

156
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,959
Feeling better?

157
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:04,178
Her name's Neera.
Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

158
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,097
Hi.

159
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,851
Where are the others?

160
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,353
They split us up into separate cells.

161
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,690
I guess the Wraith figured keeping us
in smaller groups would make it tougher to escape.

162
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,610
We shouldn't have stopped.

163
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,904
- What's done is done, Lieutenant.
<i>- No!</i>

164
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:27,951
First you set off the alarms, and then
you stop to rescue people when you know
damned well the Wraith are on our tail?

165
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,496
It's like you're purposefully sabotaging this mission.

166
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,999
You hate to see me succeed at anything.

167
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,710
You've got a lot of issues to work out, Ford.

168
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,549
Teyla and Ronon went down too quick when they were shot.

169
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,260
<i>The enzyme's wearing off.</i>

170
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,180
You feeling anything yet?

171
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,934
Not yet.

172
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,104
But I will.

173
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,692
It's happened before when I've run out of the enzyme.

174
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,072
It gets pretty bad.

175
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,868
So we gotta figure a way out of here.

176
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,830
And no more unnecessary stops.

177
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:33,016
Colonel Caldwell!
I didn't think you were due back here for days.

178
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:37,187
Doctor Weir requested that we join the search ASAP,
so we pushed the engines a little.

179
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,856
How is he?

180
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,315
I've sedated him;

181
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:44,278
administered a beta blocker to bring his blood
pressure down to a more manageable level.

182
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,363
It's a wonder he didn't suffer a stroke.

183
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,491
Did he mention anything further about
the location of Colonel Sheppard and his team?

184
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,577
Nothing coherent, I'm afraid.

185
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,330
By the time he arrived here,
he was hyperventilating, pulse extremely rapid.

186
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,416
He could barely get out a word...

187
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,961
although, being Rodney, he certainly tried.

188
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,298
How much of the enzyme did he take?

189
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,175
A very big dose, I'm afraid.

190
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,468
I found a significant amount of it in his system...

191
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,345
nearly as much as Lieutenant Ford.

192
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,891
Alright... can you wean him off it?

193
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,559
I wish I could.

194
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,730
Unfortunately, Lieutenant Ford took the last supply
of our enzyme when he left Atlantis,

195
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,232
so an incremental withdrawal is out of the question.

196
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,901
Unless we harvest more enzyme.

197
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:28,906
Not an option. By the time you go out and collect it,
the enzyme will have broken down in his system already.

198
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,825
No, I'm afraid for Rodney the only choice is...

199
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:32,868
Cold turkey.

200
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,411
Aye, to put it bluntly.

201
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,164
I can administer some drugs to help ease the process,

202
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,416
anti-nausea medication, pain reliever,

203
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:44,004
benzodiazepine for anxiety, as well a sa multivitamin
injection to bolster the immune system.

204
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:44,671
Good.

205
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,842
But there's no dodging the fact it's
gonna be difficult... possibly even deadly.

206
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,695
Are you alright?

207
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,948
I'm just tired.

208
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,245
No.

209
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,998
The enzyme's leaving your bodies.

210
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,459
Mine too.

211
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,636
How bad will it get?

212
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,890
Bad. Maybe not for you.

213
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,810
You guys haven't been on the enzyme for long.

214
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,146
But me, on the other hand...

215
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,909
Thank you.

216
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,456
How're you holding up, Lieutenant?

217
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:07,337
OK. I just need to get my hands on some more enzyme.

218
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,756
Then I'll be able to get us out of here.

219
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,803
We'll do it together. With or without
the enzyme, we're a team, remember?

220
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,640
I remember.

221
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,228
Don't just stand there... get me more enzyme.

222
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,479
We don't have any.

223
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:28,400
It's the cave... Ford's cave... he's got a,
a whole cabinet of it. There's, there's dozens of vials.

224
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,112
Do you know the address?

225
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,822
What?

226
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,533
No!

227
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,494
I'm sorry, Rodney.

228
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,038
You don't have to scream at me!

229
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,080
I'm not screaming.

230
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,790
This is fun for you, isn't
it, watching me like this?

231
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,250
I assure you, it's not.

232
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,960
What is this, payback? You're jealous?

233
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,714
Jealous of how vital I am to
this mission... vital, vital...

234
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:55,719
jealous of how I get to go offworld
and, and you get stuck in this stupid,
pathetic excuse for a hospital.

235
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,137
You know that's not true.

236
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,764
Jealous I get all the women and you don't!

237
00:18:58,805 --> 00:18:59,681
Excuse me?!

238
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,477
Please, just give me a little enzyme... just
enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.

239
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,478
I told you, we don't have any.

240
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,938
You think I don't know you're lying?

241
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,440
- I'm not lying.
- You are. You think I don't think you are but you are.

242
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,108
And don't think I won't forget it...

243
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,361
What?

244
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,197
I don't know! Just kill me.

245
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,907
I wish... It'll pass.

246
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,867
Don't shout! I am right here.

247
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,245
Perhaps we should move him
to a more secluded area.

248
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,206
What... so you can kill me in private?
Stab another knife in my back?

249
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,376
Rodney... no-one's trying to kill you.

250
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,839
You have no idea of the
agony I'm going through.

251
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,050
Oh, I have an inkling.

252
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,595
<i>Kanayo, you must be strong.</i>

253
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,930
Fight it!

254
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,102
I do not know what else to do for him.

255
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,353
There's nothing we can do.

256
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,330
Kanayo?

257
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,380
He is dead.

258
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,093
Is that what's gonna happen to us?

259
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,408
One less for you to feed on?

260
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,304
Take him.

261
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,667
How is he?

262
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:38,340
Asleep... finally. Mercifully.

263
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,178
Has he mentioned anything
about Sheppard and the others?

264
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,471
<i>No, not yet.</i>

265
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:48,392
Our conversation was of a different sort.

266
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:54,106
I feel not unlike the priest in The Exorcist.

267
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,444
Well, he's through the worst of it.

268
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,572
The nausea has passed,

269
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,824
<i>his pulse has returned to normal,</i>

270
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:09,037
blood pressure in a more reasonable range, considering
his borderline hypertensia before taking the enzyme.

271
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,330
Good.

272
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,748
I hate to say it

273
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,710
but his stubbornness is probably what
sustained him throughout the ordeal.

274
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,839
We won't tell him that, though.

275
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,841
Aye... mustn't feed the beast!

276
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,843
No!

277
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,014
You should get some rest.
You look exhausted.

278
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,892
I'll stay with him just a wee bit longer...

279
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,019
just to make sure he's out of the woods.

280
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,273
Carson.

281
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,650
Nice work.

282
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,986
Thanks, Elizabeth.

283
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,910
Come on, buddy, hang in there. Don't leave us.

284
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,369
Yes, Sir.

285
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,705
I'm sorry, Sir.

286
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,998
No, none of that.

287
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,001
Mission's not over, remember?
We've still gotta figure a way to get out of here.

288
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,002
<i>You hear me?</i>

289
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,086
Yes, Sir.

290
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,923
Aiden. You can make it through this.

291
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,387
Move away from him.

292
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,059
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Move away.

293
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,935
He's sick!

294
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,312
That is why we're taking him.

295
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,825
Where? Where are you taking him?

296
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,037
<i>To a cocoon.</i>

297
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,333
It will preserve him...
keep him from dying.

298
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,964
Until they're ready to feed.

299
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,856
I'm sorry.

300
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,444
It's my fault you got caught,
I should never have asked you to stop.

301
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,406
It's OK.

302
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,994
You were trapped in one of those cocoons,
no-one can blame you for wanting out.

303
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,246
Now your friend has taken my place.

304
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,082
Well not for long, not if I can help it.

305
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,920
How will you get us out of here?

306
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:27,843
OK, I haven't figured that part out yet...
but when I do, it's gonna be real impressive.

307
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,804
The Wraith will not allow us to escape.

308
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,141
Yeah, well, I try not to let them
tell me what I can and can't do.

309
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,894
You do not fear them?

310
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,438
The Wraith? Naah.

311
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,484
Now clowns... that's another story.
Scare the crap out of me.

312
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,117
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

313
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,829
Ah yes, bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed, as the idiom goes.

314
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,331
You gave us quite a scare.

315
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,415
It was very strange.

316
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:01,084
The whole time I was under the influence
of the enzyme, it felt like I was...

317
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,004
I was perfectly lucid... eloqent, even.

318
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,758
I mean it was you who wasn't making any sense
or listening to reason. It was very peculiar.

319
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,844
I think I kind of understand how Ford
must have been feeling this whole time.

320
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,137
Rodney?

321
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,891
What happened out there?
And where are the others?

322
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:20,521
I don't know exactly, but I think I can
figure it out. I told you Ford's alive.

323
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,064
Well, you told me, but I didn't believe you.

324
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,441
The man is nothing if not
resilient. He's been busy, too.

325
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:28,028
He gathered himself together a little
gang, doped them all up on the enzyme.

326
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,909
They're the ones that caught us, drugged us,
and coerced Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon to join
them on a mission to destroy a hive ship.

327
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,077
A hive ship?!

328
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,498
Yeah, they managed to steal themselves
a Dart. Like I said, he's been busy.

329
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,459
Look, when they didn't return from the mission,
I realised something had obviously gone wrong.

330
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:46,088
Now, I have the coordinates to the planet
that the hive ship was headed towards to cull.

331
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,798
So if the team is still alive...

332
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,343
maybe captured on the ship...
there's a chance we can rescue them.

333
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,720
Yeah. At the very least we can warn
the planet of the impending culling.

334
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,097
I'll alert Colonel Caldwell.

335
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,473
Very good.

336
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,982
How're you feeling?

337
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,988
Better.

338
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,031
<i>You?</i>

339
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,993
Ready to get out of here.

340
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,914
Have you had any luck finding a way to escape?

341
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:25,460
I think our only chance is to
try to create a diversion...

342
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,463
try to overpower them the
next time they come in here.

343
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,179
Have you thought of Lieutenant Ford?

344
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,600
If his withdrawal was as severe as Kanayo's...

345
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:46,106
If it distracts you,
clear your mind of it.

346
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,318
<i>If it fuels your anger</i>

347
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,612
use it.

348
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,619
D'you have anything sharp...

349
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,830
knife, hairpin, anything that'd puncture
the skin on these walls?

350
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:02,998
No.

351
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,126
It's just that everyone in
my last cell had one, so...

352
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,004
Your people were taken by the Wraith too?

353
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,715
A few.

354
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,718
<i>My whole world was destroyed,</i>

355
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,888
and my people taken and brought here.

356
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:22,684
I watched as my own mother and
younger brother were fed upon.

357
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,646
Sorry to hear that.

358
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:30,275
We had no means to fight the Wraith.
We are a simple, peaceful people.

359
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,572
We're peaceful too, but the good news is,
we have the means to put up a hell of a fight.

360
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:39,493
- You have fought the Wraith before?
- Lots of times.

361
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,495
Won some battles, lost some.

362
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,624
War's not over by a long shot, but
we're managing to hold our own.

363
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,585
And the clowns?

364
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,129
The clowns?
Oh, yeah, the clowns.

365
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,674
Yeah, we fight them too...

366
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,094
entire armies,
spilling out of Volkswagens.

367
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,013
We do our best to fight them off, but...

368
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,183
they keep sending them in!

369
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,773
According to Ford's intel,
Edowin has a space Gate.

370
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:14,194
If we can get there quickly in a Puddle jumper,
we wouldn't be able to do much more than just
warn people of the impending culling.

371
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:14,945
Do we have enough time?

372
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:15,696
- Yes.
- We think.

373
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,780
- We should.
- We hope.

374
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,992
It'll be close, yes, but using the Daedalus
we might be able to get a radio lock on

375
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,662
Sheppard and the team inside the hive ship.
If they're still alive, we can beam them out.

376
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,456
Alright. Let's get this bird off the ground.

377
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,792
- Coming with us?
- No, no...

378
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,214
Right!

379
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,934
For warmth.

380
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,191
OK.

381
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,528
How's that? Better?

382
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,239
Yes. Thanks.

383
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,786
How long will they keep us in here?

384
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:08,040
That's a very good question.

385
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:13,378
If we're able to escape, where will I go?

386
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:16,006
Wherever you want.

387
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,638
Can I go with you to your world?

388
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,225
Sure. Why not?

389
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,561
I'm sure we can find a spare room.

390
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,356
I'd like that.

391
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,529
What is it like, your world?

392
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:47,162
It's nice... comfortable, good climate.

393
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,706
Tell me what it looks like.

394
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,252
Like every other world, I suppose

395
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,588
Trees, water, mountains.

396
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,092
Starbucks on every corner.

397
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:02,511
What is it called?

398
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:11,687
D'you mind if we pick this up after we get some sleep?

399
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,649
Yes, of course.

400
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,131
What is it?

401
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,008
I don't know.

402
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,469
Must have just dropped out of hyperspace.

403
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:48,182
Maybe they're getting ready for the culling.

404
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,311
Take him.

405
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,462
Shall we talk now?

406
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,464
About what?

407
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,217
You are stubborn.

408
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:29,723
Yes, I am... and, she's very pretty, by the way.

409
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:38,941
Neera... the girl you planted in the cocoon
for us to rescue after you let us escape.

410
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,818
The one that was supposed to get information from me.

411
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,613
It's never gonna happen.

412
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,580
We drop out of hyperspace directly behind the planet...

413
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,875
use it to shield us from the hive ship and
we can attempt radio contact with Colonel Sheppard.

414
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,877
But we won't be able to make
radio contact from behind the planet.

415
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,091
This is why you and Major Lorne will take a cloaked
Puddle Jumper to get close enough to determine if
Colonel Sheppard and his team are still aboard the ship.

416
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,428
If they are, we'll move into position
around the planet and beam them out.

417
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,013
And if they're not there?

418
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,891
We'll beam a nuke aboard the ship and destroy it.

419
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,601
What if they jam us like they did before?

420
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,855
Doctor, you worry about getting Colonel
Sheppard and his team out of that ship.

421
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:20,816
Let me worry about destroying it, OK?

422
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,119
Ah, there you are.

423
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,748
I guess an empty room is off the table,
but nice try back there in the cell.

424
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,670
I knew there must have been a good reason for you to
let us break out, but that was quite the performance.

425
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,589
Where'd you find her?

426
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:48,218
She is one of many thousands
that have come to serve us...

427
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,973
even worship us.

428
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,102
They do my bidding,

429
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,483
and I let them live.

430
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:07,362
A Wraith-worshipper?

431
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:11,867
The prophecy of The Great Awakening
has come to pass. The end of days have come to the...

432
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,413
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know about that because, I'm one too.

433
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,918
Although in my case, it's not so much worship
as it is a meaningful business relationship.

434
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,252
You lie.

435
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,005
OK, tell me this.

436
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,508
How else could I get my hands on a Dart?

437
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:33,347
And who else could provide me
with specific instructions on how
to infiltrate your hive and destroy it?

438
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,390
Of which queen do you speak?

439
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,893
You gotta have a window on this boat, don't you?

440
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,186
Take a look.

441
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:43,357
The other hive that joined you for the culling...

442
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,944
a lot more people to feed on
when you don't have to share.

443
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,695
I will speak to her of this.

444
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:51,990
You don't really think she'd admit
to trying to have you killed, do you?

445
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,576
Enough!

446
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,750
I shall savour your defiance!

447
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,685
How'd you get our weapons back?

448
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,270
That was the easy part.

449
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:24,314
Getting some more enzyme... that was harder.

450
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,862
You're one tough son of a bitch!

451
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,780
What are you doing?

452
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:34,658
Down that hall, fifty metres, turn left.

453
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,660
It'll take you to Teyla and Ronon's cell.

454
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,120
I'll hold the Wraith back for you.

455
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,997
You're coming with me.

456
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,749
I'll hold the Wraith back, boss. Now go. I'll be OK.

457
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,835
I'm not going without you, Lieutenant.

458
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:48,338
John. I'll catch up. Now GO!

459
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,675
Ford! Oh, crap.

460
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,389
Get ready.

461
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,939
How about I bust you guys out of here?

462
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,108
If you don't mind.

463
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,114
I've gotta get myself one of these.

464
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,324
Where's Kanayo?

465
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,659
He is dead. Ford?

466
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:21,455
Well, last I saw he was alive... I'm stickin' with that.

467
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,175
Jumper One, you have a go.

468
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:37,387
On our way. Engaging cloak.

469
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,860
Oh, no.

470
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,195
There's two of them!

471
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,404
You said there was only one.

472
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,781
- Well, there was only one!
- Now there's two!

473
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,658
I can see that!

474
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,202
Let's try and hail Colonel Sheppard.

475
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,670
The culling is beginning.

476
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,129
We've gotta stop them.

477
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:11,922
How?

478
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:16,051
Stay here.
When I give you my signal, get out in the open.

479
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,475
Jumper One, what's your status?

480
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:27,729
We're unable to establish a radio link with Colonel
Sheppard or the others on either of the hive ships.

481
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:32,568
Which doesn't necessary mean they're not on
either of the ships. Look, they could have had
their radios taken from 'em.

482
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:36,029
We can't make that assumption.
Return to the Daedalus immediately.

483
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,698
Almost there now.

484
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,702
Good. We need to take those
ships out before they start culling.

485
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,131
Is that his signal?

486
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,799
It'd better be.

487
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,312
Oh, I sure hope that worked.

488
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,009
Max power to the shields.

489
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,802
Are we within transport range?

490
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,264
Yes, Sir. We have a weapons lock on
coordinates inside the first enemy vessel.

491
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:46,099
Deploy warhead.

492
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,937
The enemy has engaged counter measures
to block our transport.

493
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,022
They're jamming us again!

494
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,148
We're under fire.

495
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,692
Forward rail positions, return fire!

496
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,162
This is not good.

497
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,623
Not good, not good.

498
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,010
<i>How much of this can the shields take?</i>

499
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,596
Not much. They're already down twenty percent.

500
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:27,766
Our people have been in Wraith hands too long.

501
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,936
We have to assume they've been compromised and
that the Wraith know that Atlantis wasn't destroyed.

502
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,312
We need to win this.

503
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,831
Look... see that?

504
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:51,623
What?

505
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,625
It's a Dart firing on one of the hive ships.

506
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,043
Why?

507
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,462
Sheppard!

508
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,153
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

509
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,948
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other!

510
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:04,655
The blast has destroyed everything
in a fifteen thousand metre radius.

511
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,573
Did any Darts survive?

512
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,534
Negative, Sir.

513
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,718
Copy that. Atlantis out.

514
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,470
Doctor Weir?

515
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,518
We received word from Daedalus.

516
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,521
They said they should be back to
Atlantis by nineteen hundred hours.

517
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,231
They called the search off?

518
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:42,025
They said there was nothing to search for.

519
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,779
Thank you.

520
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,876
Offworld activation!

521
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,003
Who is it?

522
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,379
We have an IDC.

523
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,714
It's Colonel Sheppard's code!

524
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,008
Let them in!

525
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,896
Sorry we're late.

526
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,752
Alright. Up you go.

527
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,295
Why aren't you dead?

528
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,088
Ah, it's good to see you too, Rodney.

529
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,759
No, no, I mean... well, you know what I mean.
Why aren't you... dead?

530
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,803
Well, I knew when the hives started
to shoot at each other,

531
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:58,143
it was just a matter of time before they blew
each other up, so I went to the space Gate and
dialed an address where I could land safely.

532
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,687
I didn't think the Dart could fit in our Gateroom.

533
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:05,025
The Colonel was kind enough to make us
whole again, and we returned home.

534
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,945
I'm curious, Sheppard... how did you
know the Wraith would fight each other?

535
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,447
A little intel from Ford in the game, plus...

536
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:13,450
well, I kinda goosed things along with the Queen.

537
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:17,037
It would appear the Wraith are becoming
more territorial than we had thought.

538
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,290
There is definite tension building among them.

539
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,542
Which is good for us.

540
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,793
Certainly is.

541
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:27,047
It also opens a brand new strategy in fighting them.

542
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:32,052
And, and, where is Ford?

543
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,181
He was aboard the hive ship when it was destroyed.

544
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:39,726
He was last seen aboard the hive ship.

545
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,937
What does that mean?

546
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:48,652
Well, you know Ford. I wouldn't be
surprised if we run into him again.
