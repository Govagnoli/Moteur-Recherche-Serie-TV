1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,384
Impressive.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,764
This is our central control room

3
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,849
and this

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,977
is our shield generator control.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,524
<i>The austerity of the facility suggests</i>
<i>that it was built during the height of war.</i>

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,651
It is well beyond our science.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,736
My skills are rudimentary at best.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,821
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:34,201
It took Dr. McKay years to figure
out all things Ancient, and he still
doesn't completely understand 'em.

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,912
I have a very firm grasp on Ancient technology.

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,457
- You've blown up entire planets, Rodney.
<i>- That wasn't my fault.</i>

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,585
- Well, it didn't do it by itself.
<i>- Are these our guests?</i>

13
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,420
Yes, Chancellor.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,090
Lieutenant colonel John Sheppard,

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:52,135
<i>Dr. Rodney McKay, Teyla Emmagan and Ronon Dex.</i>

16
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,012
Chancellor Lycus.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,681
Welcome to Taranis.

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,473
Thank you.

19
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,017
And thank you for finally
answering our calls for assistance.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,691
We tried several addresses from the database, but
we were beginning to wonder if anyone could hear us.

21
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,861
Sorry about that.
We like to keep a low profile.

22
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,655
So as not to attract the attention of the Wraith.

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:12,948
I see.

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,075
Well, hopefully you can help us.

25
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,829
Our shield generator has been
giving us trouble for some time now. Our...

26
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,706
knowledge of the technology is limited

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,085
and the Ancestors regrettably neglected
to leave behind the instruction manuals.

28
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,336
Actually, they did.

29
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,299
- You probably just couldn't underst...
- The good news is, you found our address.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,051
I'm sure we can fix whatever needs fixing.

31
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,888
And by "we", he means me, so...

32
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,015
shall we get started?

33
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,603
I'm sure I could learn a lot from you, Doctor.

34
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,442
I'm sure I can learn...

35
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,613
let's start here, shall we?

36
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,367
In the meantime, perhaps
you'd like a tour of the facility?

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,410
Lead the way.

38
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,211
My ears just popped.

39
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,087
We are deep underground.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,510
The Ancestors constructed an extensive
system of corridors and tunnels
throughout the facility and beyond.

41
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:20,140
In fact, it was by following such a tunnel beneath our
nearest settlement that we discovered this facility.

42
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,565
- What was that?
- Oh, just a tremor.

43
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,193
Nothing to be concerned with.
Please, this way.

44
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,449
Those are harmonic tremors.

45
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,744
We've experienced several
such tremors in recent days.

46
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,622
I'm concerned they may have something
to do with our generator problems.

47
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,791
Well, you say your generator
is powered by geothermal energy.

48
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,625
Yes.

49
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,502
Well, then I'd say there's probably a connection.

50
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,379
What were you doing?

51
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,215
Oh, that, that was
the standard military procedure

52
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,175
in the case of an earthquake, one hides...

53
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,302
well, stands, in a doorway, and

54
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:01,390
just checks the structural integrity of...
of the building for...

55
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,100
sake of the civilians.

56
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,811
This is the main hangar.

57
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,479
Hangar, for what?

58
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,607
Mere description would be inadequate.

59
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,162
I see what you mean.

00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,861

63
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,124
It's an Aurora class warship.
Obviously, the Ancients built more than one of them.

64
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,253
Why didn't we become aware of it at the same
time our sensors picked up the Aurora?

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,713
It's damaged.
Probably from the war with the Wraith.

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,507
- Beyond repair?
- I don't know.

67
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:04,054
Their scientists, or at least the folks
who call themselves scientists, have been working
on it for years, but it's way out of their league.

68
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,182
They know how to turn things on and off,
but as far as fixing problems...

69
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,435
Rodney should still have the technical specs
you brought back from the Aurora mission.

70
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:15,691
I told him to take a look at 'em, but first,
I want him to fix the shield generator,
build some goodwill with these people.

71
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,775
Good idea.

72
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,486
Hopefully we can establish an alliance with them.

73
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,154
A ship like that...

74
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:25,117
Would come very much in handy now that
Wraith are probably on the way. I know.

75
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,539
I'm gonna get back there now,
make sure he's not distracted, so...

76
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,790
Distracted?

77
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,544
Well, the lead scientist, she's very...

78
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,004
Hot?

79
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,881
I was gonna say attractive,

80
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,592
but McKay is acting very...

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,051
Smitten?

82
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,262
I was gonna say pathetic.

83
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>Wait.</i>

84
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,142
I should head back with you and begin
negotiations with the taranian leader.

85
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,393
What's he like?

86
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,854
You know, he's a guy.

87
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,147
I didn't pay much attention.

88
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,981
Sorry.

89
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:06,074
A shield like this would normally require
a Zero Point Module to power it, but

90
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:10,370
this one seems to operate
on geothermal energy alone.

91
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,498
Yes. There's an enormous amount
of heat beneath the surface.

92
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,210
You're telling me.

93
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:23,175
When I noticed the fluctuations in
shield strength, I managed to override
the alarms and make some adjustments,

94
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:27,054
but then other lights began blinking,
I was unable to understand what they meant.

95
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,765
Shortly after that is when the tremors started.

96
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
<i>How goes it, Rodney?</i>

97
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,268
I was just still running diagnostics.

98
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,061
Still?

99
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,604
I thought you would have had that fixed.

100
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,356
If you want,

101
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,235
- I can call Dr. Zelenka. I'm sure he could...
- I can handle it, thank you.

102
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,074
What are you doing back so soon?
I mean, I told you this might take some time.

103
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,868
Elizabeth wanted to talk to the Chancellor,

104
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,330
see if we can establish
relations with these good people.

105
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,998
That would be wonderful.

106
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,169
In fact, you've been working awfully hard, maybe I...

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,714
No, no, no.
I was just about to show Norina the generator log,

108
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,591
which shows that...

109
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,762
you've been running the shield
continuously for over a year now.

110
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,224
Yes. When the device was activated,
you told me what it was called...

111
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,184
Those are long-range scanners.
That's just what we call them.

112
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,687
- It's from an old TV show.
- Yes, yes, what about them?

113
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,898
When they indicated
a sudden rise in Wraith activity last year,

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,901
Chancellor Lycus ordered me
to increase the strength of the shield.

115
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,237
Well, that's unfortunate.

116
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,114
Why?

117
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,910
Because the Ancients didn't design these things
to run continuously at maximum capacity.

118
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,290
Look, shields are for emergencies only, Norina.

119
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,878
When you shut down the alarms, you overrode
the failsafes, and that means that we're...

120
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,214
Oh no.

121
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,674
What is it?

122
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,010
The reason

123
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,513
the Ancients chose to power
this facility on geothermal energy

124
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,723
is because we're sitting

125
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:57,603
right smack in the caldera of a dormant
super volcano, or should I say formerly dormant,

126
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:02,357
because drawing all this energy from the
magma chamber has made it extremely active.

127
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,609
So...

128
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,444
things are going to get worse.

129
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,779
I think we could safely say that
things are going to get...

130
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,239
worse.

131
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:11,742
Yes.

132
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:18,916
We are seeking to establish relations
with civilizations throughout the galaxy.

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,000
As are we.

134
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:25,714
In fact, people from several worlds have chosen
to immigrate here, seeking refuge from the Wraith.

135
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,634
Our interest extends beyond just security, though.

136
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,013
We're also interested in cultural exchange
and of course, trading opportunities.

137
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,975
As you discovered, we have an extensive
knowledge of Ancient technology.

138
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,269
And we have an Ancient warship.

139
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,232
Yes...

140
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,734
a ship that currently is unable to fly.

141
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,236
If we were able to repair it,

142
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,573
- perhaps we could negotiate...
- We do not know all of its wonders,

143
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:56,370
but I can only assume it possesses
the capability for great destruction.

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,000
Why would I hand over that capability to you?

145
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:07,422
Now, Chancellor, don't take this as a threat
in any way, but we already possess that capability.

146
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,968
Now, having that ability and using it
are two entirely different things.

147
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,010
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

148
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,887
Excuse me, please.

149
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,347
Yes, John?

150
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,518
<i>You and the Chancellor may want</i>
<i>to come to the control room.</i>

151
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,603
<i>We have a problem.</i>

152
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,646
What kind of problem?

153
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,988
<i>That kind of problem!</i>

154
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,743
I don't see any volcano.

155
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,496
Because you're standing inside it right now.

156
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:44,168
Look, when you think of regular volcanoes,
you think mount St. Helens, or Kilauea.

157
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,296
- And a super volcano?
- Yellowstone national park,

158
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:53,093
with a caldera over 50 miles wide and
a massive sea of molten rock just beneath the surface.

159
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:57,681
So the Ancients built the facility here in order
to tap into all that geothermal energy.

160
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,933
Right. These things don't erupt very often.

161
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,103
Thousands, oftentimes hundreds of
thousands of years go by between blasts.

162
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,315
So the Ancients thought, what the hell,
plenty of energy down there to run a shield.

163
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,108
But not continuously.

164
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,028
By doing so, we've increased
the pressure of the magma chamber.

165
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,364
It's expanded to over 40 miles now, and increasing.

166
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,782
- Can it be stopped?
<i>- No.</i>

167
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,284
The damage is already done.

168
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,745
Look, a significant hotspot rift has opened.

169
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,749
The pressure will keep building as magma
continues pouring in directly beneath us.

170
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,294
Is there anything we can do to relieve
the pressure somewhere else?

171
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:31,465
Maybe we can fire a drone down into
the crust on the other side of the caldera.

172
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:35,219
Every problem has a military
solution in your world, doesn't it?

173
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,138
Look, when this baby goes, the whole thing goes.

174
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,224
Then we need to evacuate your people.

175
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,143
Is there anywhere on this planet
we can help relocate you to?

176
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:47,105
Look, you're still not getting it.
Listen to me, all of you.

177
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:53,987
When this thing erupts, the force of the explosion
will be over 10,000 times greater than
the blast that destroyed mount St. Helens.

178
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,158
- It will obliterate half of this continent.
- There must be other continents.

179
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,869
<i>The dust cloud will envelop the planet within weeks,</i>

180
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,206
blocking out enough
sunlight to kill every living thing.

181
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,960
We are talking about an extinction level event.

182
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:15,467
Look, the only option you've got is to evacuate
your people to another planet, and I would
advise doing it sooner rather than later.

183
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,638
Excuse me.

184
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,017
Watch them carefully.

185
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:26,728
Oh, I'm sorry.

186
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,814
Was my volume turned right down?

187
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,482
Did he not hear me?

188
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,254
Chancellor Lycus,

189
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,133
Dr. McKay is the finest scientist we have.

190
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,304
- I trust his advice without reservation.
- And I don't know you.

191
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,973
You asked for our help, and we came.

192
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,518
To fix our shield generator,
not incite evacuation of our planet.

193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,897
Your shield generator is what's causing this problem.

194
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:15,110
Now, we would not advise such drastic
measures unless there were no other alternatives.

195
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:20,949
I'm just finding it curious that you advise us
to leave this planet shortly after you discover
that we possess an ancient warship.

196
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,077
You think we're trying to get you
to leave so we can take your ship?

197
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,329
As I said,

198
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,997
I don't know you.

199
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,665
No, you don't.

200
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,515
Is everyone alright?

201
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,725
Nasty cut on his forehead.

202
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,102
Reports of the wounded are
coming in from the settlement.

203
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,979
I'll call Beckett, get him up here.

204
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,147
<i>You'd better make it quick.</i>

205
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,193
The last tremor opened a hydrothermal vent in the base.
The ground is eroding beneath us.

206
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,738
You need to get your people off this planet now.

207
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,658
They can come to Atlantis.

208
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,117
They'll be safe there.

209
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,957
If we didn't answer your call for help,
this would still be happening.

210
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,876
Chancellor, please listen to them.

211
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,298
Alert the settlers.

212
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,095
<i>Tell our people to gather only their most precious</i>
<i>possessions and come here as quickly as possible.</i>

213
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,806
We'll begin evacuating immediately.

214
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,891
Good.

215
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,811
Teyla, Ronon, come in.

216
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,651
Oh, good, you're here.

217
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,070
We're just about ready to escort
the first wave back to Atlantis.

218
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,029
Where are the wounded?

219
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,908
There's a technician up in the control room
that needs tending to. They're also bringing
in more wounded from the settlement.

220
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,034
What can we do?

221
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,453
You can help colonel Sheppard
facilitate the flow of evacuees.

222
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,456
Chancellor Lycus and I are going
to handle their arrival on the other end.

223
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,499
This way, Carson.

224
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,130
<i>Rodney?</i>

225
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,173
Right here.

226
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,846
Gate's dialed. You're good to go.

227
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:16,064
<i>Alright, we'll see you on the other side.</i>
<i>Please make it quick.</i>

228
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,914
Sheppard, the first wave's on its way.

229
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,582
How you doing with the next group?

230
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,667
<i>Keep the line moving.</i>

231
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,640
Sheppard, get those people back inside the facility!

232
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,185
Atlantis, this is McKay. Raise the shield!
I repeat, raise the shield!

233
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,323
The Stargate...

234
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,451
It's gone.

235
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,177
Why did you raise the shields?

236
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,680
McKay gave the order just before we lost contact.

237
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,809
What is happening?

238
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,893
I don't know.

239
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,941
Run a Gate diagnostic.

240
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,570
Power levels were intermittent
the last few seconds before it shut off.

241
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,780
Something must have terminated
the connection from their end.

242
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,031
Dial them back.

243
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,790
Can't establish a wormhole.
Something's happened to their Stargate.

244
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,918
There's nothing wrong with our Gate.
Dial it again.

245
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,923
I'm getting nothing.

246
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,177
- You orchestrated this, didn't you?
- What?

247
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,597
You lured me here to hold me hostage
in exchange for our warship.

248
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,725
I assure you, Chancellor, that is
not what's happening here.

249
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:19,521
Zelenka, the Daedalus is on its way back
from Earth. I want you to contact colonel
Caldwell and divert them to Taranis.

250
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,564
Right away.

251
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:25,235
- We're going to find out what's going on, I promise.
- I will not be cut off from my people.

252
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,905
My people are on your planet too, Chancellor.

253
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,323
We're both cut off.

254
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,201
What the hell happened?

255
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,453
<i>The Stargate.</i>
It was swallowed up by the magma.

256
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,622
- We are so screwed.
<i>- You mean we're stuck here?</i>

257
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,042
- If we have no way of contacting Atlantis...
- We are totally screwed.

258
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,418
Hang on, let's not panic.

259
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,256
- This facility has no means of
direct subspace communication.
- Will you just take it easy?

260
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,342
We're inside a
soon-to-be-erupting volcano!

261
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,345
Elizabeth will try to dial us
back. When she can't get through,

262
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,180
she'll send the Daedalus.

263
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,598
Daedalus. Right.

264
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,350
That's good.

265
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,561
What if the volcano erupts before then?

266
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,939
The ship in the hangar.

267
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,899
Maybe McKay can fix it.

268
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,153
Oh, maybe I can fix it. Place the pressure
squarely on my shoulders for a change!

269
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:12,282
Well, I've discovered you're pretty
good under the threat of impending death.

270
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,913
I am, actually.

271
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,383
<i>Okay.</i>

272
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,300
And

273
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,885
primary power

274
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:32,928
is

275
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,222
online.

276
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,900
I wonder how many more ships like these exist.

277
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,028
<i>A few more of these, and we can</i>
<i>give the Wraith a serious fight.</i>

278
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,615
Life support should be back up
and running in a few minutes.

279
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,242
Good. That's good.

280
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,912
And I have discovered the ship's name.

281
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,833
It's the Hippaforalkus.

282
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,334
The what?

283
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:08,046
Yeah, well, it appears to have
been named after an Ancient general.

284
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,174
Hippaforalkus.

285
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,675
Well, we're not calling it that.

286
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:16,346
- Oh, good, then what about...
- And we're not calling it the Enterprise, either.

287
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,723
I wasn't going to say that.

288
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,893
- For my second choice, though...
- How about we name it later?

289
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,477
Fine.

290
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,690
Whatever its name, this ship is
large enough to fit many people.

291
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,068
- It could fit all the settlement if we had to.
- Let's hope we don't have to.

292
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is the Daedalus.</i>

293
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,405
Go ahead.

294
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,493
<i>The signal's having trouble breaking through.</i>
<i>We're gonna have to boost it.</i>

295
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,454
Can you get communications online?

296
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,039
Right. I'm on it.

297
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,714
Alright, try it now.

298
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,925
Yes, Sir, we're here.
Where are you?

299
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,719
We just arrived in orbit above Taranis.
Where are you?

300
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,804
We've scanned the base and found no life signs.

301
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,057
Well, this part of the base must be shielded.

302
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,892
<i>I hear you could use some assistance?</i>

303
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,649
The Stargate on this planet's been swallowed by lava,
and we're in a volcano that could erupt any second,
so, yeah, yeah, we could use a little help.

304
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,235
Get yourselves out in the open
where we can get a lock on you.

305
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,946
<i>No, Sir, we promised to help these people.</i>

306
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,782
We're gonna need Daedalus
to evac them back to Atlantis.

307
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,536
From the number of people that we're
detecting, that's at least four trips.

308
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,122
But the Daedalus is quite large.
<i>Surely you could fit more.</i>

309
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,168
This is a spaceship, which means that our
life support resources are finite.

310
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,338
<i>Four trips would already stretch</i>
<i>those resources to the limit.</i>

311
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,756
Do we have enough time for that?

312
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,217
There's no way to know for sure.
I mean, it'll be close.

313
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,135
Well, the tremors have stopped.

314
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,178
For the moment.

315
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,889
Beckett's on his way back to the
settlement to treat the wounded.

316
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,892
Teyla and Ronon can join him, organize
people into groups that can be beamed aboard.

317
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:47,187
In the mean time McKay and I are going to
stay here and continue our work on plan B.

318
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,981
No, no, no, we need to get out of here.

319
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,776
We can start the process, but if things get worse
and the Daedalus can't get everyone offworld,

320
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,570
we're going to need another lifeboat.

321
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,697
And plan B is what?

322
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,949
<i>We found a sister ship to the Aurora</i>

323
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,242
called the...

324
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,119
Orion.

325
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,290
McKay's trying to get the sublight drive online.

326
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,416
<i>Really?</i>

327
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,336
Well, a ship that large, you should be
able to get everyone else out in one trip.

328
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,756
Yeah, well, whether or not we
live or die is all up to Rodney.

329
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,758
This is so unfair.

330
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,219
Sounds like a plan, Colonel.

331
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,512
Let's get to it.

332
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,396
Right, over there you go.

333
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,690
Have you selected which patients will go first?

334
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,859
Aye, this group here.
They're the most severely wounded.

335
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,570
I've alerted the Daedalus' infirmary.
They're waiting for them.

336
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,865
Ronon is outside gathering
the remainder of the first group.

337
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,160
Everyone has seen and felt the first
signs of the impending eruption,

338
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,788
and despite our best efforts to keep
them calm, some are beginning to panic.

339
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,832
How long before
the Daedalus is able to return?

340
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,293
12 hours to travel to Atlantis and back.

341
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,421
12 hours and hope there's
enough time to make four trips.

342
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,673
Ronon, this way.

343
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,300
To the far left.

344
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,593
The next group to go.

345
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,844
Alright.

346
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,887
Come here, everyone.

347
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,264
<i>I need you to stay in here.</i>

348
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,266
<i>Come on. Stay in here.</i>

349
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,977
Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.

350
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,981
Daedalus, this is Teyla Emmagan.

351
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,652
We have several hundred Taranians
standing by at the various beaming sites.

352
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,654
We are ready.

353
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,530
<i>Understood.</i>

354
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:30,207
<i>The first wave of refugees are onboard.</i>
<i>We're headed back to Atlantis.</i>

355
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,836
Thank you, Colonel.
We'll be ready to receive them. Weir out.

356
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,630
Then what?

357
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,717
Once my people have been evacuated
to this city, what happens to us then?

358
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,011
You're welcome to stay here with us,

359
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,765
or we can help you find a safe,
suitable planet you could relocate to.

360
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,519
And if what is happening on
my planet is a false alarm?

361
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,604
I doubt that's the case.

362
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,191
Dr. Weir...
Dr. Weir, I'm sorry, it's important.

363
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,943
Excuse me, Chancellor.

364
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,655
The long range scanner.

365
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,949
A hive ship.

366
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,077
<i>Yes. Headed toward Atlantis.</i>

367
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:08,745
How far out?

368
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,747
Three weeks, perhaps.

369
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,125
Just the one?

370
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,668
So far.

371
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,589
So far.

372
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:33,061
I have already learned so much
from you just in the last few hours.

373
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,814
Perhaps one day I could study under you.

374
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,900
Yes, well, I really...

375
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,903
really look forward to that,
but first we need to get off...

376
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:46,116
First we need to get off the planet.First we need to
get off the planet, and then you can be under me...

377
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,545
Okay, that was a big one.

378
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,423
- That was a lot stronger than the...
- You alright?

379
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,674
I'm fine.

380
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,722
All good under there.

381
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,183
Okay.

382
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,856
What is it?

383
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,400
It's just ash beginning to fall.

384
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,195
Is that a sign that the volcano will soon erupt?

385
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,822
Diastrophism is a wee bit outside my bailiwick.

386
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,242
I mean, no, I doubt it.

387
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,369
Remember what Rodney said.

388
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,287
When she goes, we'll know.

389
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,832
<i>- And who decided that?</i>
<i>- We all did. Everyone's voice was heard.</i>

390
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,710
- What is wrong?
- This is Vonos. He's from another settlement.

391
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,129
- Hello there.
<i>- How long before the Daedalus returns?</i>

392
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,756
<i>Still several hours,</i>

393
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,093
and I'm afraid the second evacuation
group has already been selected,

394
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,012
but you and your people will
be able to leave in the third.

395
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,057
- That won't be necessary.
- He thinks he can outrun this thing.

396
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,643
- What?
- A day's walk from here, there is a river,

397
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,311
wide, calm,

398
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,397
should offer
protection from any lava flow.

399
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,899
- Another two days after that, we're at the sea...
- Listen to me.

400
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,528
There's a cloud of ash spreading across
the sky. If that doesn't choke you to death,

401
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,154
you'll surely die in the explosion.

402
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,116
The only chance of survival
is to evacuate this planet.

403
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,618
And the only way out of here is on our ship.

404
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,499
Time to go.

405
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,843
It's getting a hell of a lot worse out there.

406
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:31,305
The last tremor opened many more fissures.
We have a problem.

407
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,517
<i>Rodney, come in.</i>

408
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,311
Go ahead.

409
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:42,524
<i>Looks like there's a lot of new vents, a lot of</i>
<i>ash going into the air headed toward the settlement.</i>

410
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,819
We don't have time to wait for the
Daedalus. How are those engines coming?

411
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,029
I'm not even close.

412
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,616
- Well, then, I guess we're all going to die.
<i>- Oh, you're doing that on purpose!</i>

413
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:52,701
What?

414
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,871
You're creating an impossible task
that my ego will force me to overcome!

415
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,248
Oh, yes, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing.

416
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,211
It has nothing at all to do with saving the
lives of these people. It's all about you.

417
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,964
<i>Now, get your ass back to</i>
<i>work and fix those damn engines!</i>

418
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,763
He'll fix them, trust me.

419
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,520
Alright, folks, can I have your attention, please?

420
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,189
I'm afraid there's been a change of plans.

421
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,442
We need to bring everyone from
the settlement back to the base.

422
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:26,568
Once at the base,

423
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,863
we'll board another ship called the Orion.
It's a lovely ship with lots of room for...

424
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:30,864
Why?

425
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,451
As you can see, the conditions
outside are rapidly deteriorating.

426
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:37,371
We may not have time to wait
for our ship to return, so

427
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:41,625
we would like everyone to proceed down
the tunnel that leads back to the base. The Orion

428
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:46,588
- will safely evacuate everyone before the volcano...
- Why did we not board that ship in the first place?

429
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,135
The engines are not currently in working condition,
but our people are confident they'll have
them fixed before the volcano erupts.

430
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,388
This is why we should not have waited.

431
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:58,058
We cannot trust what they say.
We must leave this place now.

432
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,726
And go where?

433
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,563
- To the river.
- Have you looked outside, big man?

434
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:07,067
- The air will be clear beyond the river.
- No, it won't! That cloud stretches for bloody miles!

435
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,903
- You will die out there.
- Maybe.

436
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,575
But it is better to do battle with
death than idly wait for it to take you.

437
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,580
You're all welcome to join us.

438
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:24,626
No. At least in here, we stand a chance
of survival. Out there, it is suicide.

439
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:44,813
Alright,

440
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,356
everybody else,

441
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,066
please come this way,

442
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,568
down the tunnel.

443
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,340
Do you know which of these stars is Taranis?

444
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,218
I'm sorry, I don't.

445
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,764
Your city is incredible.

446
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,309
Yes, it is.

447
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,104
Dr. Weir...

448
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:31,360
<i>your people have been putting their</i>
<i>lives in jeopardy to save my people, and</i>

449
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,987
I have rewarded that kindness with

450
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,281
doubt and suspicion.

451
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,242
I apologize.

452
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,327
That's not necessary.

453
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,830
I understand how you must feel.

454
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,585
I truly believed that the Ancestors'
shield would protect my people.

455
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,046
I could not have been more wrong.

456
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,674
We'll save as many as we can.

457
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,927
I believe you will.

458
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,225
<i>Okay, this way, folks. Hurry, hurry.</i>

459
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,477
Good, good. Keep 'em coming.
Where are Teyla and Ronon?

460
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,063
Still back at the village to gather the rest
of the people. Then they'll be on their way.

461
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,107
Good.
Get these people to the ship.

462
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,068
- Come on, move it. Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, straight down to the hangar, folks.

463
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,945
Ship's waiting, plenty of room.

464
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:17,865
Don't panic!

465
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,449
There's plenty of room!

466
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,536
- Sheppard.
<i>- What?</i>

467
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,539
<i>I just got the atmospheric sensors</i>
<i>online. I'm reading dangerously high levels</i>

468
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,417
of sulfur dioxide spewing into
the air from dozens of fumaroles.

469
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,421
Look, it is rapidly becoming toxic out there.
Make sure you get people to stick to the tunnels.

470
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,464
We'll pass the word. How about those engines?

471
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,300
I'm still working on that.

472
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,593
Keep me apprised.

473
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,052
<i>Teyla, Ronon.</i>

474
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:41,680
Yes, Colonel.

475
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,892
<i>We've got toxic gas venting into the atmosphere.</i>

476
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:46,685
Yes.

477
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,395
It has already made its way here.

478
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,690
Get everyone into the tunnel
underneath the settlement asap.

479
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,317
<i>They are heading your way.</i>

480
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,320
Ronon has found one remaining
family at the edge of the village.

481
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,530
He is returning, and then we will go.

482
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,704
Beckett and Norina
are helping people get on board.

483
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:08,415
It's getting pretty tense,
but nobody's trampled each other...

484
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,875
yet.

485
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,587
What?

486
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,089
Two large fissures
just opened up near the base.

487
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,592
One of the lava flows just covered
the hangar directly above us.

488
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,761
We're talking over 30 feet thick.

489
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:21,845
Is the door gonna hold?

490
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,516
I don't know. I, I think so,
but it's, that's not the bigger problem.

491
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,978
Even if I can get the engines fixed,
there is no way to fly this ship out of here.

492
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,855
We're stuck.

493
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:41,615
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla. Please respond.

494
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,326
Colonel...

495
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,871
if you hear me, please respond.

496
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,749
Ronon.

497
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,337
Everyone else get through?

498
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,464
Yes. We are the last to remain.

499
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,842
We'd better get going, then.

500
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,469
Ronon, the tunnel is blocked.

501
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:05,222
I was just there.
It collapsed during the last tremor.

502
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,723
It'll be alright.

503
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,895
We can't go back out there.

504
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:14,731
I have been trying to hail colonel Sheppard.

505
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,650
So we're stuck?

506
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,862
It would appear so.

507
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,787
Time for a military solution.

508
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,663
For which problem?

509
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:33,166
We've got an armory full of drones on board.
Maybe we can blast through the hangar door.

510
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:37,254
The hangar door is directly above us.
The molten lava would destroy the ship.

511
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,047
Not if I can get the shields operational.

512
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,841
- Tell me you can do that.
- I can do that.

513
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,052
And once they're operational,
they'll be able to provide enough protection to...

514
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,512
<i>- To what?</i>
- Talk amongst yourselves.

515
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,471
<i>- What're you doing?</i>
- I have an idea.

516
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,973
- What kind of idea?
- Can't talk. Busy.

517
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,391
- Just give me a basic..
- Not now, please.

518
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,476
I hate it when he does this.

519
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,534
What are we gonna do?

520
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,038
There is no place to go.

521
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,501
I'm not good at sitting around waiting to die.

522
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,922
Maybe we can make it back to the base on foot.

523
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,590
Outside?

524
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,134
We will never make it.

525
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,221
As long as we can breathe,

526
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,306
there is still hope

527
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:36,104
and we may be able to last a few
minutes longer in here than out there.

528
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,239
Okay, hurry, ladies and gentlemen.
Right down the hallway there. Thank you.

529
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,448
Carson, how're we doing?

530
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,535
We're just about ready. There should be another
group of refugees coming on board now.

531
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,994
Teyla? Ronon?

532
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,747
They helped the last family.
God, I haven't seen them.

533
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,375
Teyla? Ronon?

534
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,169
Teyla, Ronon, please respond.

535
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:03,382
- Don't leave without us.
- No, of course not.

536
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,676
Right down there.

537
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,308
They're still alive...

538
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:14,977
but barely.

539
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,940
Perhaps you were right.

540
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,946
We should have tried
to make it back to the base on foot.

541
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:27,906
No.

542
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,200
You were right.

543
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,786
We'd be dead.

544
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:39,334
As long as we can breathe...

545
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,920
there's still hope.

546
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,390
We owe you a debt of gratitude, Colonel.

547
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:57,477
Frankly, yours were the only
life signs that we could detect on the planet.
What happened to the others?

548
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,313
Sheppard, Beckett, and McKay,

549
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,481
they took the rest of the people back to the base.

550
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,151
- We got cut off from them.
- Well, that's brilliant. The base is shielded.

551
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,861
I can't beam them out of there.

552
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,739
They were attempting to load the rest
of the people on board the Orion,

553
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,160
hoping Dr. McKay would be able to get
the engines working before the eruption.

554
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,088
What are you saying? They're all dead?

555
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,048
<i>We don't know.</i>

556
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:30,260
One way or the other,
we can't hail them on radio because of
extreme electrical activity in the ash cloud.

557
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,596
We can't even detect their life signs.

558
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,015
So if you make contact, what are your options?

559
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,727
Well, colonel Sheppard could have
saved some of the remaining population,

560
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,356
but instead he tried to save every
single one of them by taking refuge aboard the

561
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:47,027
damaged ancient warship, which has pretty much
taken any options I might have had out of the equation.

562
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,322
Stay as long as you can.

563
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,910
<i>Hermiod says the volcano's about to erupt.</i>
<i>We should know for sure by then.</i>

564
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:59,456
Be advised,
we have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.

565
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,544
Just the one?

566
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:07,339
I'm afraid that's all the good news we have.

567
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,016
Teyla, Ronon, come in.

568
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,067
<i>Stop!</i>

569
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,570
Door's probably hot.
You don't want to touch it.

570
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,572
Let's try this way.

571
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,034
Okay, not that way either.

572
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,619
Rodney, come in.

573
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,996
Go ahead.

574
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,332
<i>I've run into the last group of villagers</i>
<i>and I'm trying to get them back to the ship.</i>

575
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:46,670
Looks like the base is going to emergency lockdown.
We got doors sealing off everywhere.

576
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,131
We could really use some help
trying to find another way back.

577
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,257
Alright.

578
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,760
I'll have Norina call up
the base schematics, see if she can...

579
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,896
Rodney?

580
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,231
Rodney...

581
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,817
do you copy?

582
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,487
Damn it.

583
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:26,460
Colonel, I'm attempting to calculate the precise
time remaining before the main eruption.

584
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,545
We should try to land.

585
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:32,299
<i>The planet's surface is far too unstable</i>
<i>to attempt any landing.</i>

586
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,760
So our only option is to sit here and wait?

587
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,304
<i>There is one other option.</i>

588
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,680
What?

589
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,600
We could leave.

590
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,561
That's not an option we're considering.

591
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,902
I'm starting to smell sulfur dioxide here.

592
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:56,156
Stay close. Stay calm.
Try not to take too many deep breaths.

593
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,827
Colonel Sheppard, are you there?

594
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,580
Colonel Sheppard, please come in.

595
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,290
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

596
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:07,042
There's too much interference.

597
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:10,212
Look, the atmosphere is heavily
charged with electromagnetic energy.

598
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:12,089
This baby's ready to blow.

599
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,176
The Taranian people are all on board, except for
the last group that colonel Sheppard was escorting.

600
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:17,261
Teyla and Ronon?

601
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,263
We've lost contact with them as well.

602
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,599
Alright.

603
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,780
Please be the hangar door.

604
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,202
Help me pry this thing open.

605
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,764
This way.

606
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,146
Alright.

607
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,441
Tell the people to get on the floor and secure
themselves. I think the eruption is imminent.

608
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,234
We're just about ready.

609
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,569
<i>Ready for what?</i>

610
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,906
Oh, thank God.

611
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,157
What took you so long?

612
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,202
- Just about ready for what?
- To activate the shields.

613
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,829
I thought you said the blast from the
eruption will wipe out half the continent.

614
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:29,208
It will, and after 4.1 seconds of those
extreme temperatures and pressures,

615
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,584
our shields will be depleted.

616
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,878
As much as I'm all for
living for another four seconds...

617
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,924
- That's not very much time for anything, Rodney.
- It's plenty of time to open a hyperspace window.

618
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:40,385
But that's my plan.
Didn't I tell you about that?

619
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,845
- No.
- No, you didn't.

620
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,599
- You were too busy running around looking for people.
- Well, tell us the damn plan.

621
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,560
Fixing the sublight engines was
impossible in the amount of time we had left...

622
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:49,645
they were just too badly damaged,

623
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:53,690
but I've devised a sort of a patch that in effect
diverts auxiliary power to the hyperdrive.

624
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,610
- Only enough for a fraction of a second, mind you.
- That won't get us very far.

625
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,029
We don't need to go far.
Any old orbit will do.

626
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,113
And then what?

627
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,990
Well, then Norina and I were planning a

628
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:03,659
small dinner for us all, nothing fancy, just...

629
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,536
- Rodney...
- Well, what does he mean, "then what?"

630
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,204
Then we won't die horribly?

631
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:12,918
So your plan is to not blow a hole in
the hangar but to sit here and wait for this
cataclysmic eruption to take place.

632
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,505
With the shields
and inertial dampeners at full strength, yes.

633
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,757
I think I may be missing something.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

634
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,301
but when the volcano erupts, don't we as well?

635
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,261
That's the plan.

636
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,595
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

637
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,264
- That plan sucks.
- Aye.

638
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:30,018
The ship will be ejected along with the magma
and steam several thousand feet into the air.

639
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,520
The ship can survive that?

640
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,564
For exactly 4.1 seconds, yes.

641
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:36,817
Look, the hangar should disintegrate. The moment
we're clear, we open a brief hyperspace window,

642
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,779
jump to space before the explosion
depletes our shields and incinerates us.

643
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,574
Okay.

644
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:44,992
What.

645
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:46,827
That's very clever, Rodney.

646
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,624
Well, don't thank me 'till it works...

647
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,711
which it probably won't.

648
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:56,420
Excuse me.

649
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:06,430
Colonel, I believe
the eruption will occur in 52 seconds.

650
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,348
Are you sure?

651
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,226
I would not state it if I wasn't.

652
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,359
What?

653
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,404
Bent my fingernail back.
I hate that.

654
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:23,906
Yes, that can be painful.

655
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,574
- Yeah, will you look at that?
- Are you done?

656
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,075
Almost. Look,

657
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,368
does anyone have nail clippers?

658
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,369
Rodney...

659
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,371
Not helping.

660
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:32,289
Alright,

661
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:34,249
so...

662
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,961
hyperdrive's ready,
inertial dampeners are engaged, shields are up.

663
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,505
We're good to go.

664
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:44,051
- What?
- Got up too fast.

665
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,220
40 seconds.

666
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,269
Where's the P.A.?

667
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,771
Arm of the chair.

668
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:02,653
Alright, folks, all chairs and seatbacks into
your upright and locked positions.

669
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,822
Don't hold your breath.
It could happen any time in the next half an hour.

670
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,553
Five...

671
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:28,637
<i>Four...</i>

672
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,721
<i>Three...</i>

673
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,056
<i>Two...</i>

674
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,266
One.

675
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,297
<i>It worked!</i>

676
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,842
You really are a genius.

677
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,304
<i>Rodney?</i>

678
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,556
I'm good.

679
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,729
This is the Daedalus. Are there any survivors aboard?

680
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,314
Yes, Sir.

681
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:21,565
In fact,

682
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:25,110
we have a pretty big passenger list.

683
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:39,875
The explosion was every
bit as destructive as I feared. The...

684
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,169
ash cloud has encircled the entire planet.

685
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,671
Will the Taranian people ever be able to go home?

686
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,507
Not for many years, I'm afraid.

687
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,927
We found a planet
that Chancellor Lycus feels is suitable for them.

688
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:52,346
We've already started relocating the people there.

689
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:56,892
I'd like you and your team to assist them, just
to make sure the relocation goes smoothly.

690
00:41:56,934 --> 00:42:00,437
I'll take a repair team
back to the Orion, get the engines fixed.

691
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,856
I thought you told Norina you couldn't fix it.

692
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,901
It was never a question
of whether or not I could fix it, it...

693
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,362
<i>Well, as quickly as you can, Rodney.</i>

694
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:13,450
The Chancellor has graciously allowed us
to use the ship in exchange for our help.

695
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,702
I assume there's still a hive ship on the way?

696
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:16,912
Yes.

697
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,330
Why only one ship?

698
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:20,249
We don't know.

699
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:24,878
Maybe they're just coming to prove
we're still here, but if they manage to do that.

700
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,632
Well, at least we've got the Orion now,
and the city's supply of drones has been replenished.

701
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:31,051
That's enough to put up a hell of a fight.

702
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,803
Let's not fool ourselves.

703
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:36,974
If they come in full force, and there is no reason
to believe that they won't this time,

704
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,686
- then I'm sorry, but...
- It's not going to be enough.

705
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,445
It's all we've got.
