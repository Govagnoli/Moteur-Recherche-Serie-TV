<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,632
This is Weir.
What's the nature of Major Sheppard's injury?

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,551
Some sort of funky alien bug
attached itself to his neck.

4
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:15,265
Part of Ellia is Human and part of her comes
from a creature we call the Eratus bug.

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:19,728
Now it's possible, by means of this retrovirus,
that we could strip away those parts

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>and leave only the Human parts behind.</i>

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,565
<i>Good Lord!</i>

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,359
She took the retrovirus!

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,820
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not! Not by a long shot!

10
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,918
Are you OK?

11
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,337
Yeah.

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,931
This really isn't necessary, Doc!

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,767
Yes it is. You've got a serious laceration
in your arm and you've lost a good deal of blood.

14
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,228
Yeah, well, enjoy the ride Colonel,
they're making me walk.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,440
- You have a splinter, Rodney.
- Yes, a very nasty, painful splinter.

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>Alright, let's have a look at this.</i>

17
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,533
Thank you.

18
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,661
- This might hurt a bit.

19
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,289
I'm sure it will.

20
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>This doesn't sting?</i>

21
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,334
No.

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,796
I know you have a high threshold for pain, but this...

23
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,631
This is what?

24
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,051
Gone.

25
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,344
What?

26
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,096
The feeding mark.

27
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,640
It's completely healed.

Season 2 - Episode 8
Conversion

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>- Maybe it wasn't that bad.</i>
<i>- Then where did all the blood come from?</i>

32
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,335
I don't know.
Maybe it just looked a lot worse than it was.

33
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,672
- Well I don't see evidence of any cut at all.
- It's weird, cos it hurt like hell.

34
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,508
You sure the skin was broken?

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,844
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. There was a lot of blood.
Maybe it was hers.

36
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,096
It was definitely Human.

37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,099
I don't know.
Maybe it was a nose bleed.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,729
- Is that supposed to be a joke, Colonel?
- Believe me, this isn't funny.

39
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,691
Give me half a day to run your bloodwork
and analyse it with the data we already have.

40
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,943
We'll figure it out.

41
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,321
- And until then?
- Well, you're welcome to look over my shoulder.

42
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,158
- Yeah, that's tempting but...
- Just go about your day.

43
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,466
I thought you said you were a runner?

44
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,926
Funny!

45
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,012
I can usually barely keep up.
What's with you?

46
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,765
What's with you?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,392
Water?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>Alright, sore loser!</i>

49
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,274
I don't act like a jerk when you beat me.

50
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,192
Yes you do.

51
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,445
OK, then we'll go around again.

52
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,865
Go ahead.

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,950
OK grumpy,

54
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,451
I will.

55
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,541
<i>Dr Beckett?</i>

56
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,545
Thought you'd wanna see this.

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,842
- Is this from Colonel Sheppard's blood sample?
- That's right.

58
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,052
- And you've run it twice?
- Of course.

59
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,763
OK, let's run it one more time.
I wanna be certain before I tell him.

60
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,098
Right.

61
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,456
Not bad?

62
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,957
Yes, yes.

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,043
You're doing very well.

64
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,975
You have been practising.

65
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,810
Not really.

66
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:00,759
You are showing a considerable leap
in ability, Colonel Sheppard.

67
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,929
You can call me John
when we're off the clock.

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,056
Very well...

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,724
- John.
<i>- There you go.</i>

70
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,690
Should we continue, or do you...

71
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,833
I'm not really sure just what happened.

72
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,877
Colonel.

73
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,256
That was interesting.

74
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,009
<i>Colonel Sheppard, please report to the infirmary.</i>

75
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,929
You OK?

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,224
Dr Beckett will be expecting you.

77
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,269
Yeah.

78
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:08,035
<i>The good news is, we can now say with some certainty</i>
<i>that Ellia didn't drain away any of your life.</i>

79
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,494
<i>We already knew that.</i>

80
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,996
<i>I suppose.</i>

81
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,707
<i>That's the best good news you could come up with?</i>

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,253
It looks like you've been infected
with the Eratus Bug retrovirus.

83
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,797
The one we were working on
to turn Ellia into a Human.

84
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,342
You mean, the one that didn't
turn her into a Human.

85
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,720
Ellia administered the treatment prematurely.
It wasn't ready. It wasn't even supposed to be...

86
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,848
- I'm not blaming you, Doc.
- But you're right,

87
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,478
the transformation was into a creature closer to
the Eratus Bug than to a Human and I know how much you...

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,188
- Hate those bugs?
- Yes.

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,235
But for one, Ellia was a Wraith and
she took a massive dose of the retrovirus.

90
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,695
Do we know how
the Colonel's system might respond to the drug?

91
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,988
I have no idea.

92
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,534
It was never engineered to be given to a Human.
It was never intended to be given to anyone!

93
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,493
Let go.

94
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,371
But the problem is,
I have no idea how your body will react.

95
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,289
I can't even begin to guess.

96
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,626
If how I feel is any indication, I'm fine.

97
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,505
It's certainly possible
that it's already breaking down in your system.

98
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,924
Ellia's transformation was extreme and immediate.

99
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:04,758
See?

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,428
- But the wound on your arm healed unnaturally fast.
- If there was a wound.

101
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,473
There had to be! Otherwise,
I don't see how you got infected in the first place.

102
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,684
She was spitting an awful lot.

103
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,811
So what? We just monitor it for now?

104
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:16,728
Aye.

105
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,939
You'll need to check in every six hours.

106
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,065
I can do that.

107
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,233
And you should probably...

108
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,528
Suspend my offworld activities, until we know more.

109
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,154
Thank you.

110
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,699
See you in six hours.

111
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,173
You're working late.

112
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,926
No, not really.

113
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,220
Yeah.

114
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,556
I keep trying to remove it
from the terminal's on the Daedalus.

115
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,392
Somehow the crew keeps
finding a way of putting it back.

116
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,436
Never get between a genius

117
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,146
and a computer game.

118
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,357
Ain't you scheduled to fly out?

119
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,736
I was supposed to, yes. Until I heard about Sheppard.

120
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,822
He's under Beckett's supervision.

121
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,411
If the Lt Colonel finds himself
unable to perform his duties, that's...

122
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,540
You have a ship to command, Colonel!
I wouldn't wanna spread you too thin.

123
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,543
Novak and Hermiod are running
a full diagnostic on our FTL drive.

124
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,755
They're worried about
the constant huge jumping between galaxies.

125
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,967
Which is to say if I need to, I have some time.

126
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,056
OK, let me think about it.

127
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,476
Thank you.

128
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,855
You get chess on there?

129
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,900
As a matter of fact, I do.

130
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,279
Well I have to warn you that
I'm a career military strategist.

131
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,616
Well I'll have to take my chances.

132
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,887
Hey Doc!

133
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,848
This is Sheppard.

134
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,058
<i>Yes Colonel.</i>

135
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,063
We may have to bump up
my first checking.

136
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,584
The retrovirus isn't breaking down in his system,
like we hoped it would.

137
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,295
- You're positive?
- Yes. In fact,

138
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,840
it's beginning to alter his DNA.
If it's allowed to continue,

139
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:53,218
he'll devolve into a creature
similar to what Ellia became.

140
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,058
- How long do we have?
- I'm not sure exactly.

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,687
- Ballpark. Months? Weeks?
- Days. We have days.

142
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,192
OK, what's the plan?

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,819
I've injected him with a viral inhibitor.

144
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:15,199
It should slow down the retrovirus
as far as his cognitive abilities are concerned.

145
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,284
But I'm afraid that's it so far.

146
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,287
We're exploring various
treatments that may or may not be effective, so...

147
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,872
No Carson, we don't have any time to explore.

148
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:25,125
Come on, there's gotta be something in the Ancient
database that can help you find a treatment.

149
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,628
I know that Elizabeth. We're doing our best.

150
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,088
I'm sorry, I know. Of course you are.

151
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,134
You should talk to him.

152
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,053
He's hiding it very well,

153
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,972
but if I was him, I'd be scared to death.

154
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,770
How am I doing?

155
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,823
Anything that has you speechless, has me concerned.

156
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,410
- You're gonna be fine.
- That's dead man talk.

157
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,580
- No it isn't.
- Have you seen this?

158
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,501
- Beckett is gonna figure this one out.
- I think I already have.

159
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,296
You know who I'm starting to feel like?

160
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,673
Ford.

161
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,675
Now, what happened to you is completely different.

162
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,970
I know, I know, but still, I can feel it.

163
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,182
I mean, I can feel it
changing me inside, like he did.

164
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,810
I don't think that's even possible.

165
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,356
- Look, you're very worried...
- No, no, it's...

166
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,819
One of the best weeks
of my life was when I got my wisdom teeth out.

167
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,905
I was on codeine for a full seven days.
This is kinda the same.

168
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,366
I know I should be in pain.

169
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,078
or at the very least, freaked out by this and I'm not.

170
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,664
And that freaks me out more than anything.

171
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,876
- We're gonna beat this.
- We're gonna beat this?

172
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,045
Beckett will figure this out?
You're gonna be fine?

173
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,632
You really suck at the whole bedside manner thing.

174
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,634
I know, I'm sorry.

175
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,721
But I appreciate the effort.

176
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,976
No! No! No! That would only work if the retrovirus
is doing what we had originally intended it to do.

177
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:10,189
I disagree. You are not taking into account,
what's happening to his somatic cells.

178
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,691
The only thing I have to take into account,
is how off you are

179
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,611
and I don't think I'm the only one
who sees that, so let's move on.

180
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,030
Wait! Wait! Wait! Oh God.

181
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,657
We're looking at this all wrong.

182
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,117
The best idea we've had so far

183
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,578
is to try to repair his system on the genetic level,

184
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,581
by administering a massive clone,
embryonic stem cells treatment.

185
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,208
I still think it's our best bet.

186
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,585
Introducing more human genetic material into his body,

187
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,629
is only going to give the retrovirus more fuel

188
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,297
I don't know how much simpler I can say that!

189
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,424
Yes, yes, I agree!

190
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:42,095
That's why we have to use the Eratus Bug stem cells.

191
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,847
Sorry?

192
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,976
The Eratus Bug stem cell, programmed with Human RNA,
wouldn't get rejected by his system

193
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,979
and would be practically ignored
by the current strain of retrovirus.

194
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,273
- We attack it from the inside.
- Exactly,

195
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:57,903
It would be like our own magic bullet,
that can navigate the retrovirus
and start to repair his mutated cells.

196
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,281
The only bug cultures we have are
from a sample that died a year ago.

197
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,909
<i>I have no doubt we could program</i>
<i>the cells if we had them.</i>

198
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:09,331
But we do not have the time to artificially produce
a gene therapy of that kind of volume.

199
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:19,341
Which means, ladies and gentlemen,
we need to go on an egghunt.

200
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,641
It's OK.
Sit. Please.

201
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,811
How's the Colonel?

202
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,604
Not very well.

203
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,147
I'm sorry to hear that.

204
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,357
Yes, so am I.

205
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,610
I think it would be best if you do assume
some of Colonel Sheppard's duties, until...

206
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,945
Consider it done.

207
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,489
Just until he's back on his feet.

208
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,826
You two are pretty close, aren't you?

209
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,082
Well, we've been through a lot together.
Yes.

210
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,921
You got the best team in two galaxies,
working on a way to get him back to normal.

211
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:04,178
My money's on success,
and if you need someone to talk to...

212
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,471
If you could assume those duties,
effective immediately?

213
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,514
I can do that.

214
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:08,557
Thank you.

215
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,524
The Ancient database has quite
a lot of information about the Eratus Bug.

216
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:22,029
We know what planet it's on. We know that it likes
cool, damp, dark places to lay it's eggs.

217
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,156
- It shouldn't be that hard to locate.
- Oh, wait a minute!

218
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,618
The last time we ran into
one of these things, we almost lost Sheppard.

219
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,162
How do you expect to just walk right
into one of their nests?

220
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,331
<i>I don't see that we have any other choice.</i>

221
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,626
We need the Eratus stem cells.
The best stem cells come from embryos.

222
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,795
With them, we actually have a chance of saving
Colonel Sheppard. Without them he'll die.

223
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,464
And this is the only option we have?

224
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,132
And time's an issue as well.

225
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,719
You have no idea what will happen.

226
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,180
There's only one certainty.
What will happen if we do nothing.

227
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,390
<i>We all understand the risk, Dr Weir</i>

228
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,228
and I believe that Colonel Sheppard
would do the same for any one of us.

229
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,274
Permission granted.

230
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,109
I need an hour to get my things together.

231
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,819
OK, gear up!
One hour.

232
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,461
Look! I made a new friend!

233
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,381
It's only protocol.

234
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,675
That's your answer for everything.

235
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,552
You look well.

236
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,139
<i>Should you be out of bed?</i>

237
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,102
I was going a little crazy down there,
so they said I could walk around for a bit.

238
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,103
That's good.

239
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,112
Look, I'm trying to say,
I want to go on this mission.

240
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,866
You said yourself,
you're not fit for any offworld activity.

241
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:56,206
The inhibitor that Beckett's got me on, the one that's
keeping me lucid, they keep having to up the dose.

242
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,041
I know, they told me.

243
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,544
Well, I don't know how much more time I have,

244
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:06,508
but the last thing I wanna do,
is sit on my mutating hands,

245
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,596
while my team puts their lives on the line,
trying to find me a cure!

246
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,473
I should be with them.

247
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,810
No!
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,732
What's the worst that could happen.
I'd die?

249
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,275
You could compromise the mission.

250
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:27,029
- They have enough things to worry about...
- Oh, no, no. So what? Suddenly I'm a liability?

251
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,114
Your condition can change rapidly.

252
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:33,076
- I know and I know I can do this!
- I am glad you feel that way,

253
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:37,247
- but it would be irresponsible of me...
- This is my life we're talking about!

254
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:38,916
I know that.

255
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,835
I'm going on that mission.

256
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,754
No, John, you're not!

257
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,215
Dammit!

258
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,802
It's OK! Put it down!

259
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,267
I'm betting that didn't sell you.

260
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,812
No.
No not really.

261
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,982
I should go back to the infirmary.

262
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:06,860
Yes.

263
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,468
So, what are we looking for?

264
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,762
Well, according to the Ancient database,
probably a cave.

265
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,724
Cool, damp and dark.
Which I translate, scary, awful, bad.

266
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,476
They wouldn't want their nests out in the open.

267
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,687
The cave keeps the eggs away from predators.

268
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,230
I always figured they were the predator.

269
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,023
I guarantee there's something out there worse.

270
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:45,899
Really?

271
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,609
They gotta feed on something.

272
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,403
Thank you.
Thank you for that!

273
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,487
You're welcome.

274
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,282
The foot of that mountain range starts
about a mile up this way.

275
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,783
It's probably our best bet for caves.

276
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,617
<i>Agreed!</i>

277
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,077
<i>OK, let's pick up the pace!</i>

278
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,465
What do you think you're doing?

279
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,968
Sergeant? You wanna give us a minute, please?

280
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,471
What's the problem?

281
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,139
<i>This!</i>

282
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:22,060
This is the problem. Memo to all Atlantis
personnel regarding new security protocols.

283
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,730
Is there a part there that you
disagree with in particular?

284
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:29,026
You are just keeping Sheppard's chair warm, Colonel.
Don't lose sight of that.

285
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:33,280
Look, he's done a good job here. There's just
some rookie mistakes that I thought needed fixing.

286
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,908
So you went ahead and changed
them without talking to me.

287
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,038
I don't need to check with you about how I run
the military operations on this base, ma'am.

288
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,543
They tell me you're also thinking
of rearranging the offworld teams.

289
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:50,589
Again! Sheppard had things a little backwards.
I figured that while I'm here...

290
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,174
Well you figured wrong!

291
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,553
There's no telling when Sheppard's gonna be better.

292
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,847
<i>None of the estimates that I've heard are certain.</i>

293
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,098
On the contrary,

294
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:04,478
I think I may be doing a little more than
keeping the Colonel's chair warm, ma'am.

295
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,564
<i>I mean, just look at this scheduling,</i>
<i>labour distribution.</i>

296
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,232
I don't need to!

297
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,233
Well somebody needed to.

298
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,193
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

299
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,903
I'm trying to improve things.

300
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,448
Look, I'm not saying that you're wrong,
or even that I object to all of these changes.

301
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,492
Excuse me?
Because I thought that's exactly...

302
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,868
You could have waited a week

303
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,787
<i>or even a day!</i>

304
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,457
You making sweeping changes to
the way John Sheppard runs things,

305
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,503
just hours after being assigned to this position,
sends only one message!

306
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,797
That he's not coming back.

307
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,100
You think this is it?

308
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,853
It certainly smells like
there's something living in there.

309
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,020
Yeah, or dying.

310
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,731
I cannot see that far into the cave.

311
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,485
Oh, well that is disgusting!

312
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,613
They're in there.

313
00:19:56,655 --> 00:20:00,033
And you had to pick it up
and smell it, to figure that out.

314
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,870
To know it's recent.

315
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,746
Well, how recent?

316
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,165
So what's the plan?

317
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,625
<i>Well, we go in there.</i>

318
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,795
We get some eggs
and then we come out.

319
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,046
OK.

320
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:17,301
Ronon, Teyla, you're on point with me.
Walker, Stevens, you take our six.

321
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,468
Docs, just...

322
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,054
stay in the middle and try not to get bit, OK?

323
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,056
Well maybe someone should, stay out here.

324
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,226
So that you're all alone when a dozen
of them come stampeding outta here?

325
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,228
I'll be in the middle.

326
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,231
Let's do it!

327
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,122
Hear that?

328
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,541
Yes.

329
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,668
Looks like we got the right address.

330
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,256
You don't seriously think that's gonna help,
do ya?

331
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,134
Yeah well, if they see your neck before mine.
You won't think it's stupid.

332
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,261
Where are these eggs supposed to be?

333
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,347
The database says they have a central nest.

334
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,432
I'm hoping we'll know it when we see it.

335
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:16,902
John?

336
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,656
<i>Leave them off.</i>

337
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,324
What?

338
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,869
The lights.
Leave the lights off.

339
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,789
OK.

340
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,419
I thought I should come by
and practise my bedside manner.

341
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,339
How are you?

342
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:41,510
My body's mutating into a bug.
How are you?

343
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,306
Would you like an update
on your team's progress?

344
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,852
They found an Eratus cave
and they've headed in.

345
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,103
Good.

346
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,772
They should locate some eggs
and be back here in no time.

347
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,523
No time.

348
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,399
Yes.

349
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,483
Then what?

350
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,364
Honestly, I don't know.

351
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,748
Are you alright?

352
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,336
- Would you like me to call someone?
- Who would you call?

353
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,880
If you need to see a Doctor.

354
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,299
I need a bigger security detail.

355
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,342
Excuse me?

356
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:26,763
At least two men stationed at my door,
sooner rather than later.

357
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,057
What are you talking about?

358
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,768
Just trust me Elizabeth,
you're gonna need it.

359
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,020
Listen John...

360
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,773
Oh my God!

361
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,859
They need to hurry.

362
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,157
You should be in the infirmary.

363
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,618
The infirmary isn't secure.

364
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:53,248
The inhibitor's only keeping me lucid.
It's not slowing the retrovirus.

365
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,959
- Still.
- Don't argue with me!

366
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,547
I'm not safe to be around anymore.

367
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,344
Get some more men on my door
and get the hell out of here.

368
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:08,889
OK.

369
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,974
<i>OK.</i>

370
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,233
Double the detail.

371
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,567
Code 1-6.

372
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,256
Doc!

373
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,136
Good God!

374
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,431
<i>I think this is it!</i>

375
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,982
So how do we wanna play this?

376
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,650
They'll defend their young.

377
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,944
Maybe we should make a diversion.

378
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,281
Are you volunteering?

379
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:08,740
I'll shut up.

380
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,788
I do not believe we can get close enough to retrieve
the eggs without these creatures attacking.

381
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:17,499
I have this.

382
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,002
I need to get under that.

383
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,173
Hand me that water canister.

384
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:35,642
If there's one thing we knew about these little
buggers, it's that they hate salt water.

385
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,353
How's that gonna help us?

386
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,273
Just watch.

387
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,625
See?
Not so stupid!

388
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,168
Shut up!

389
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,602
Doc...

390
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,647
We've come this far.

391
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,609
Head's up!

392
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,905
Carson, run!

393
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,208
<i>Let's go! Come on!</i>
<i>Get out of here! Don't look back!</i>

394
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,210
<i>Don't look back, come on!</i>

395
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,755
Walker, Stevens!
Get the hell out of there!

396
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,883
Walker, Stevens, do you copy?

397
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,762
Fire in the hole!

398
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:55,055
<i>Let's go!</i>

399
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,358
I think that stopped them.

400
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,863
We're not sticking around to find out.
I'm pulling the plug on this mission.

401
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,155
Let's get back to the gate.

402
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,156
We can't give up!

403
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,325
We just lost two men in there, Doc!

404
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,287
So unless you can find another way to get
those eggs out of there, we're done!

405
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,913
Understand?

406
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,373
Let's go!

407
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,224
The nest is incredibly well protected.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of 'em.

408
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,809
I just don't think it's possible.

409
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,060
So, where is that leave us?

410
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:47,232
Without the stem cells,
our plan is not promising.

411
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:50,986
OK,

412
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,114
I'll tell him.

413
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,836
How is he?

414
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,338
I wouldn't go in there, ma'am.

415
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,132
I'll be fine.

416
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,100
John?

417
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,532
So this is when I usually
ask you a stupid question.

418
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,576
Like, how are you feeling?

419
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,164
John?

420
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,501
John?

421
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,883
Our team got back from the mission.

422
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,933
The nest was too well protected.

423
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,436
We were unable to retrieve the eggs.

424
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,022
- They tried their best.
- Best?

425
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,442
- The bugs attacked.
- Try again.

426
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,364
- I can't do that.
- Why?

427
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,616
- John.
- No.

428
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,120
- I understand...
- If you won't, then kill me now.

429
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,792
- John!
- It's better for the both of us.

430
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,881
I can't do that.

431
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,344
Then try again.

432
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,195
We lost Walker and Stevens!
I won't send another team!

433
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,906
I won't risk more lives!

434
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:16,757
This is Weir! We have a security breach!
Colonel Sheppard's quarters.

435
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,724
OK, we got a lock on him.

436
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,438
That can't be him,
it's moving too fast.

437
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,856
It's him.

438
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:37,611
<i>Alright. Four teams. Surround him</i>
<i>and close in. I want him stopped.</i>

439
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,739
And gentlemen, use whatever level of
force you deem necessary.

440
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:41,990
Move out.

441
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,161
You will only use such force as a last resort.

442
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:47,746
That's not Sheppard anymore, ma'am.

443
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,748
You heard me.

444
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,005
You coming?

445
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,509
Yes.

446
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:05,889
Lock down the Stargate.

447
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,407
I thought you said that
he couldn't use the transporters?

448
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,034
I said, I doubted he was lucid enough.

449
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,744
Well shut 'em down.
He's not going to do it again.

450
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,954
Thus stranding your search teams.

451
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:35,169
<i>Bravo team you're on deck.</i>
<i>While Tango is on the floor right below you.</i>

452
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,337
You heard the man!
Down the stairs.

453
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,508
Ronon, where are you going?

454
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,467
Let him go.

455
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,696
Bravo team and Sheppard are in the same room.

456
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,865
Stay sharp, he should be right in there with you.

457
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:28,931
Anyone have a visual?

458
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,728
Above us!

459
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,871
Colonel!

460
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,753
Please, do not make me do this.

461
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,354
Get the Doctor down here.

462
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:18,772
<i>I have him.</i>

463
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:35,205
I've put him in a medically induced coma, for now.
I was afraid he might break through the restraints.

464
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,164
That's a good call, Doctor.

465
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,457
So what now?

466
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,919
The retrovirus has wreaked havoc
on his system and it's taking over.

467
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,004
What does that mean?

468
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:45,507
It means, if we don't find a way to
stop the retrovirus in the next 24 hours,

469
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,011
what's left of the John Sheppard
we know will be gone.

470
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,903
You guys are up late.

471
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,696
Can't sleep either?

472
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,657
Any progress?

473
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:14,286
No. He's still in a coma.

474
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,247
At least he isn't in any pain.

475
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,375
Maybe if I went alone. Maybe...

476
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,044
It's not open for discussion.

477
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,671
I'm not good at sitting still.

478
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,007
I understand.

479
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,010
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>I appreciate how you feel.</i>

480
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:35,724
Look, we have closed down that section
of the infirmary, but if you feel the need to...

481
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:45,776
What I mean to say is,
if you would like to have a private goodbye,

482
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,278
you should probably do it soon.

483
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,114
Are we really there?

484
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,701
I think we might be.

485
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,956
<i>Dr Weir, I need to speak to you immediately.</i>

486
00:33:59,039 --> 00:33:59,873
<i>What is it?</i>

487
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,708
Meet me in your office.
I think I have an idea.

488
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,552
I'm sorry, it just came to me.

489
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:15,514
The fact that his mutation is progressed
as far as it has, may be his salvation.

490
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,807
Explain that.

491
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,185
His sweat glands are actually producing
trace amounts of their signature pheromone.

492
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:21,270
And?

493
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,731
When we were in the cave,
those bugs knew we didn't belong there.

494
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,359
So they didn't really fancy
us getting close to their nest.

495
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:28,861
I see where you're going with this.

496
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,612
If we can artificially create the pheromone,

497
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,781
we might be able to confuse them
enough to leave us alone.

498
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,283
Aye, that would work.

499
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,909
Well, that's an excellent plan, Carson!

500
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,952
I wish it was!

501
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,954
You can't do that, Doc?

502
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,163
No, it'd take days.

503
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,499
<i>But you said Sheppard only had 24 hours</i>

504
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,043
before the damage the retrovirus
was causing would be irreparable.

505
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:45,794
Exactly.

506
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,462
Well then, that's a terrible plan, Carson.

507
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:51,049
There's only one person on this base
that wouldn't need the artificial pheromone.

508
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:53,719
Sheppard?

509
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,597
He could walk right in that cave and
those bugs wouldn't pay him any mind.

510
00:34:56,638 --> 00:35:00,267
I'm not sure if you noticed or not,
but, Colonel Sheppard's not feeling very well.

511
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,187
He stopped taking the inhibitor we were administering.
It was able to keep him lucid.

512
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,022
I thought it's effectiveness had worn off.

513
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:05,606
<i>True.</i>

514
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:07,232
But I believe if we give him a massive dose,

515
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:10,402
he may be clear headed enough to complete
the mission before we lose him completely.

516
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,154
Yeah, but won't giving him
the natural inhibitor, like...

517
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,030
<i>Kill him.</i>

518
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,449
<i>Yes, it's a definite possibility.</i>

519
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,326
Even if I knew it would for certain,

520
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,662
I'd be tempted to offer him
one last hour of lucidity.

521
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,624
Do it.

522
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,418
Gear up.
Take him as far as the cave.

523
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,262
John?

524
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:39,848
<i>John!</i>

525
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,064
You're in the infirmary.

526
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:51,235
Sorry about the headache.
It's a side effect of the inhibitor.

527
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,820
Did I hurt anyone?

528
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,240
No, not seriously.

529
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,825
Did Ronon shoot me?

530
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,161
You had it coming.

531
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,705
<i>Look, we don't have a lot of time.</i>

532
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,667
This dose of the inhibitor drug
will only last about an hour.

533
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,795
How would you like to go on a mission?

534
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,803
- Now you realise that you may have to...
- It's already set to stun.

535
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,186
He's ready.

536
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,481
Ah! Good to see you up and...

537
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:30,899
about.

538
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,861
Alright, come on.
We don't have a lot of time.

539
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,034
Good luck.

540
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,757
Use this and collect as many as you can.

541
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:59,845
Oh God. At least a container full.
Do you understand?

542
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,643
<i>Colonel Sheppard?</i>

543
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,396
You know that we cannot go in there
with you, but you need to hurry.

544
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:12,024
It took us a little longer to get here,
than we would have liked.

545
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:25,806
What is that?

546
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,893
That's how long
I estimated the inhibitor would work.

547
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,979
So that means he's...

548
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,397
There's no way to know for certain.

549
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,464
We should go in.

550
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,300
And do what?

551
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,010
If the inhibitor has worn off...

552
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,428
Then he's beyond our help.

553
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:06,972
I hear something.

554
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,683
Colonel!

555
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,652
- Do you have enough?
- Aye, I think so.

556
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,083
It's not going to happen overnight.
You can bet on that.

557
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,794
But the transformation
has begun to reverse itself.

558
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,838
So eventually, he'll be back in uniform.

559
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,631
Eventually.

560
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,218
Well done Carson, for once again
elevating medicine to actual science!

561
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,636
Oh, thank you, Rodney.

562
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,847
You'll finally be able to get some sleep.

563
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,557
- Keep me posted.
- Alright.

564
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:53,810
<i>We might...</i>

565
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,145
Stay a while.

566
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,855
Well, if that's alright.

567
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,315
Of course.

568
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,534
If and when Colonel Sheppard
resumes his duties,

569
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,036
I hope you'll consider some
of the changes that I've made.

570
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,704
When he does,
that will be up to him.

571
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,290
Of course. The Daedalus will head
back to Earth in less than a week.

572
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,583
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

573
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,710
Well, we'll try and manage
without you, till you get back.

574
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:22,256
<i>Despite what you might think</i>
<i>about my intentions, Dr Weir.</i>

575
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,758
I'm not your enemy.

576
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:28,512
Believe me Colonel,
you don't wanna be.

577
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:44,778
Caught, lift, lock, serpentine,
lock and hold. Understood?

578
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,697
Colonel!

579
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,249
Should you be up and about?

580
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:01,378
I've been cooped up in that damn infirmary
for a couple of weeks. Give me a break.

581
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,132
<i>You are looking well.</i>

582
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,843
Are you feeling more like yourself?

583
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,847
Well, according to my DNA,
I'm 100% John Sheppard.

584
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:18,729
Although, I gotta say, I'm looking
forward to getting rid of this thing one day.

585
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,565
Doc says it'll clear up eventually.

586
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,194
So listen.

587
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:29,823
While I've been laying there the past few weeks,
I've been remembering things.

588
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:35,495
Some things I might have done
that you could call out of character.

589
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,540
You mean, when you attacked
the security detail.

590
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,626
That was one of them.

591
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,752
Yes.

592
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:47,299
There's another thing
I should probably apologise for.

593
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:48,634
Give it no further thought.

594
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,261
Good!

595
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,055
I won't.

596
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,849
Nice to have you back.

597
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,602
John.
