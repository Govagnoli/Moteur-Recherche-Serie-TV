1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,635
Alright, I'm about ready to call this one.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,054
Doesn't look like there are any survivors.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,057
The cullings are getting more and more intense.

4
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>Well, you said it yourself:</i>

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,269
too many Wraith woke up at the same time.

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,647
Too many mouths to feed or...

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,148
hands to feed.

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,485
Well, we're headin' back
to the Gate, meet you there?

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>Sounds like a plan.</i>
<i>McKay, Beckett you havin' any luck?</i>

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,073
Negative, Colonel, we haven't found anyone.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,908
<i>Make your way back to the Gate.</i>

12
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>Will do. Beckett out.</i>

13
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,163
So...

14
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,835
maybe you should pick some wildflowers from
around here I think she'd get a kick out of that.

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,961
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,756
You've got a date tomorrow tonight
with Katie Brown, right? She's a botanist

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,174
she never gets to go offworld, so...

18
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,552
- What's this now?!
- It's nothing, nothing.

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,345
You have a date, Rodney?

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,346
With a woman?

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,307
It is simply two adults sharing some friendly...

22
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,184
Yes, with a woman!

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,688
Well, she's excited about it.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,148
- Not sure why, though.
- How would you know?

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,901
Girls' poker night.
I know a lot of things, McKay.

26
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm sure it's none of your business.
This is an inappropriate field conversation.

27
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,447
What? I was just suggesting
you might wanna pick some flowers...

28
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,533
Yes, and maybe you should just do
your job, which is to protect us.

29
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,659
Shut up.

30
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,785
Shut up?  Let me tell you something...

31
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,037
Stop speaking!

32
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:22,958
Dart.

33
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,335
<i>We have a Dart incoming.</i>

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,839
Move it!

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,635
Seeing us will blow Atlantis' cover.

36
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,597
<i>Anyone get</i>
<i>a clear shot, you take it, understand?</i>

37
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,768
Scatter!

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,520
McKay!

39
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,971
It is heading towards the Gate.
We damaged it but it is still on its way.

40
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,641
Wait! McKay and Cadman
have been beamed aboard that Dart!

41
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,977
We can't risk the Dart
making it back to the hive ship.

42
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,403
Oh, crap!

43

Season 2 - Episode 4
Duet

46
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
I'm a doctor.
I can help.

47
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,777
What the hell d'you think you're doing?

48
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,030
It was reaching for the self-destruct.

49
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,282
He's the only one that can get Cadman and McKay out!

50
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,243
I seriously doubt he'd oblige.

51
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,662
<i>Well, we'll never know now, will we?</i>

52
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,456
Is everyone alright?

53
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,000
We're fine. Hanson, radio Atlantis.

54
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,378
We want Zelenka here asap. We've got a problem.

55
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,276
<i>Colonel!</i>

56
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,368
First time offworld?

57
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,202
Yes!

58
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,623
Well, if there were any more Wraith,
they would have attacked us by now.

59
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,582
Really?

60
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,794
If it makes you feel better.
Did you find what we want?

61
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,672
Well, yes, but it's very complex.

62
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,841
This interface controls the machine

63
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,509
that dematerialises people,

64
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,304
stores their information and then
rematerialises them again when commanded to.

65
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,430
Great.

66
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,516
Command it to!

67
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,392
I can't.

68
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,520
From what we can tell,
the materialiser is storing two lifesigns.

69
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,813
- Yes.
- Which is good!

70
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:18,068
Yes, but there is only enough power in the Dart's
energy cell to successfully rematerialise one of them.

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,781
Power to the rematerialiser has been
completely severed and emergency back-up
power has been completely run down.

72
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,991
OK.

73
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,702
You have to decide which one we're going to beam out.

74
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,453
It's a terrible choice to have to make.

75
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,329
It's easy.

76
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,957
Beam out McKay he'll figure
it out how to get Cadman free.

77
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,917
No, no, no, sorry I was unclear.

78
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,711
There's no way of telling which is which.

79
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,422
Yes. They just read as lifesigns.

80
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,340
Perfect.

81
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,342
Alright...

82
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,470
... that one.
Go. Stand aside.

83
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,645
Rodney, you OK?

84
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,363
His pulse is stable but
I need to get him back to Atlantis.

85
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,033
Teyla, Lorne, help the Doc
head back to the city with McKay.

86
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,245
We're gonna stay here with Zelenka
try to bring as much of the Dart back as possible.

87
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,712
All of his vitals are stable.

88
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,340
His body's reacting like it's been
struck by a Wraith stunner.

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,552
So you think once the initial shock is over,
we'll have the old McKay back?

90
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,596
I'm afraid so!

91
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,724
Have they had any luck with the wreckage?

92
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,975
No.

93
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,020
Lieutenant Cadman is still in there somewhere.

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,607
- Did you know her well?
-  No, not really.

95
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,652
She was with the new batch
that came aboard the Daedalus.

96
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,529
She seemed quite lovely, though.

97
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,781
She saved my life.

98
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,368
Well, you'll be the first person
I call when we find her.

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,953
Thank you.

100
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,127
<i>"That reminds me of my nephew's birth!"</i>

101
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,507
How's it coming?

102
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,718
Well, the good news is we were able
to stabilise the lifesigns signature.

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,179
Now it's just a question of getting
the machine online again.

104
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,681
Great. How do we power it up?

105
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,974
Well, that's the bad news.

106
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:19,273
The machine uses a very specialised
transformer to convert raw power
into highly stable, very specific stream of power.

107
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,651
Now the transformer's
crucial in operating the machine safely and...

108
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,570
... it's been damaged.

109
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,115
Don't suppose there are any spares in the trunk?

110
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,784
We're working on reverse engineering one.

111
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:31,368
Good.

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,787
Let me know the second you have something.

113
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,125
<i>"Well, OK then, come on kids, go go go."</i>

114
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,128
<i>"We have to finish this one!</i>
<i>Let's get going! Hurry!"</i>

115
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,980
Not bad, uh?

116
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,149
It's fine.

117
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,236
So what do you think of Atlantis?

118
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,323
It's fine.

119
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:14,870
Have you thought about what
you wanna do after you're done here?

120
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,373
Do you want me to leave?

121
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,836
No! No! Stay as long as you like. I'm just saying,

122
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,380
you know your way around,

123
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,550
you can take care of yourself in a fight...

124
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,970
Yeah! You hate the Wraith as much as we do...

125
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,724
OK, maybe more than we do.

126
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,768
But the point is...

127
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:44,483
we could use a guy like you around here
and you look like you could use a place to stay.

128
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,119
I'm not sure I'd fit in here.

129
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,081
There's only one way to find out.

130
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,125
Do I have to decide now, or can I finish eating?

131
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,294
Take your time.

132
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,464
And...

133
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,843
try these...

134
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,427
they work great!

135
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,403
Hello.

136
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,994
How're you feeling, Rodney?

137
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,664
Um, terrible.  What happened?

138
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,749
You were scooped up by a Dart.

139
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,293
Oh, great!

140
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,919
How'd I get out?

141
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,297
It's a long story,
but I'm glad to see you're doing well.

142
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,883
Hello?  Doctor Beckett.

143
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,259
Is that Cadman?

144
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,760
Doctor McKay.

145
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,597
Where is she?

146
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,681
I'm right here.

147
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,975
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.

148
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,268
What?!

149
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,228
Who said that?

150
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,313
I did.

151
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,439
You said "What?!"?

152
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,900
I said Lieutenant Cadman
is still trapped inside the Dart.

153
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,068
No, no, no, did you just say the word, "What?"?

154
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,652
No, I didn't.

155
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,279
McKay!

156
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,114
- Yes, where are you?
- I'm right here.

157
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,200
No, no, I'm talking to Cadman, shut up for a second.

158
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,202
- She's not here, Rodney.
- Yes I am!

159
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,579
You didn't just hear that,
you didn't just hear Lieutenant Cadman.

160
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,914
No, I didn't.

161
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,540
Headset.

162
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,085
I'm not wearing a headset!

163
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,629
McKay, where are you?

164
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,214
I'm right in front of Carson.

165
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,548
Oh no.

166
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,926
Put your hands over your eyes.

167
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,384
Why?

168
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,302
Just do it!

169
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:40,140
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.
I think maybe you're experiencing some sort of ...
Rodney, what are you doing?

170
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,934
Oh, this is terrible.

171
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,894
- What's terrible?
- I can see that!

172
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:47,689
I can see your hands over
your eyes as if they were my eyes.

173
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,816
Carson, hi

174
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,068
Hullo.

175
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,280
Who got us out of the Dart?

176
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,698
Zelenka,

177
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,576
but he only got you out.
Lieutenant Cadman is still trapped inside the Dart.

178
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,410
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,121
This cannot... be happening.

180
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,624
Cadman's not trapped in the Dart.

181
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,000
Excuse me?

182
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,002
She's in here.

183
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,551
Oh, nice work!

184
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,762
We were running out of power.
I knew hardly anything about the machine.

185
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,681
Who would have thought this
could be one of the side effects?

186
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:26,478
So instead of waiting to understand what it was
you were doing, you just sort of mashed
on the keyboard hoping something would happen!

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,021
Well, you're alive, aren't you?

188
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,565
Ask him if he knows how to fix it.

189
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,692
He doesn't know how to fix it!

190
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,776
What?

191
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,152
I'm talking to her!

192
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,320
You can hear her thoughts?

193
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:40,576
No, not her thoughts, thank God. I can hear when
she's speaking... when she's trying to speak.

194
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,620
Are you sure he should have been
discharged from the infirmary, Carson?

195
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,999
According to the MRI, he's as healthy as he ever was.

196
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,334
It doesn't feel very healthy in here!

197
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,879
Well, we can't all be track stars, now, can we?

198
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,632
It was her again.

199
00:11:55,674 --> 00:12:00,012
Maybe there's something wrong an MRI
wouldn't pick up, if you know what I mean.

200
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,892
I'm not crazy I just have
another consciousness in my brain.

201
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,227
So he just looks crazy.

202
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,607
I'm sure I do, but only because
Doctor Fumbles McStupid over here

203
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,567
- was in way over his head!
- Yes,...

204
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,613
yes, I made a mistake trying to save YOUR life.

205
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,283
Now, do you want to try to fix it,
or do you want to continue to berate me somewhat?

206
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,452
I'm perfectly capable of doing
both at the same time.

207
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,537
Now I assume you've tried to run
one of our own generators on it?

208
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,788
It's not as simple as that ...

209
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,664
Why not?

210
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,709
the trick is having it interface
with the Wraith machine in real time.

211
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,338
The power fluctuations are, are, are huge.
...If we overshoot just a little ...

212
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,048
- Wait, wait, what does that mean?
- ... we're screwed up.

213
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,257
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,344
Um, I'm sure if we can maybe run an interface
programme that will take care of all the ...

215
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,722
Hullooo?  Rodney?  Will you please answer me?

216
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,225
- Here's what I want us to try.
- Rodney!

217
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,937
- We'll take a... Naquadah generator...
- Ro-o-o-odney!

218
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,688
- ... and...
- Rodney.  Rodney!

219
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,398
- ... and...
- Rodney!

220
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,943
- RODNEY!
- YES!  WHAT?!

221
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,071
Stop ignoring me.

222
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,823
Well, stop asking stupid questions!

223
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,116
Rodney...

224
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,285
I will get you out of here, OK?

225
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,829
Now just be a good little girlie and keep quiet.

226
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:12,292
Don't you dare condescend me!
This is as much my problem as it is yours.

227
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,669
And do you have a degree in physics?

228
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,629
Well, what about mechanical engineering?

229
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,339
- Rodney?
- Yes!

230
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,050
Sorry. I'm sorry.

231
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,301
What, please?

232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,806
Why don't we let Zelenka handle this?

233
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,558
- I'm fine.
<i>- No.</i>

234
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,642
You're not.

235
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,811
And I'd like you to talk to Doctor Heightmeyer.

236
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,147
- I think it'd be more useful if I was...
<i>- Rodney.</i>

237
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,735
I'm not asking you.

238
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,750
Fine.

239
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,841
Oh, stop sulking. You're acting like a two year old.

240
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,009
This is your fault, you know.

241
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,968
How'd you figure that?

242
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,345
All you had to do was keep your mouth
shut while I was working.

243
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,473
You have no idea what it's like in here, OK?

244
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:13,228
Yes, yes, I do. I know exactly what it's like
in here because I live in here. I like it here!

245
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,271
Rodney?

246
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:14,938
Be cool!

247
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,316
Katie! Hi.

248
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,234
Is... everything OK?

249
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,322
Yes! Yes! Everything is just fine. I was just...

250
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,157
Talking on the radio! Talking on the radio!

251
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,783
Talking on the radio.

252
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,037
You're well, I take it?

253
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,459
I... heard you ran into some trouble offworld today.

254
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:40,464
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, but everything's fine now
it's all been sorted out. Back to normal.

255
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,924
Good.

256
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,218
So we're still on for tomorrow?

257
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,595
Yes, yes. Yes, actually, I'm...

258
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,764
very much looking forward to it.

259
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,099
In fact, I'm sure it'll be a...

260
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,477
you know, a wonderful...

261
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,562
evening, and what not.

262
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,315
Right! Well, I'll see you then.

263
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,488
You really know nothing about women, do you?

264
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,906
I know plenty.

265
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,991
Maybe this is a good thing.

266
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,117
Excuse me?

267
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,037
I could teach you a thing or two
about the opposite sex, McKay.

268
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,622
Lord knows you need it!

269
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,793
This is hell! This is my own personal hell!

270
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,362
Alright.

271
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,532
Let's try that again.

272
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,742
How about you try that again...

273
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,035
<i>Sir?</i>

274
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,747
Maybe that's enough for today.

275
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,128
How do you feel you're qualified
to help us with this problem?

276
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,004
I'm not.

277
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,549
Who could be? This was not covered in medical school!

278
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,510
But I have spent quite
some time as a couples therapist.

279
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,636
We're not a couple!

280
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,514
In any sense of the definition not a couple.

281
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,432
No!

282
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:20,314
In physics, a couple is defined as a pair of forces
equal in magnitude acting in opposite directions.

283
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,024
So you don't feel that applies here?

284
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,318
Yeah, that's very clever, but we're not equal forces.

285
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,194
Watch it!

286
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,531
And what I mean by that is she's just a voice
in my head, I have control of the body.

287
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,284
I've seen your body, McKay, you can keep it.

288
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,286
How do you know that?

289
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:39,875
She's been able to access the part of your brain that
creates speech and controls hearing why not movement?

290
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,252
Well if she could have, she would have by now.

291
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,546
Maybe you need to release control.

292
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,215
Why would I do that?

293
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,426
Because, like it or not, you're sharing that body.

294
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,555
The roles could have easily been reversed, Rodney,
you could be trapped inside her body.

295
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,684
And wouldn't you like a chance to say,
talk to others without having to go through her?

296
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,685
Yeah!

297
00:16:59,144 --> 00:16:59,978
Maybe.

298
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,689
- Maybe?
- OK, yes, I would want that.

299
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,441
So let her.

300
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,945
Close your eyes,

301
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:13,450
take deep breaths and stop
trying to control everything for a second.

302
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,496
<i>(Hello?)</i>

303
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,332
<i>(Hello?)</i>

304
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,501
Laura?

305
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,795
<i>(Oh, this is weird!)</i>

306
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,840
<i>(Hearing his voice when I speak!)</i>

307
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,967
Can you move?

308
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,260
<i>(I don't know.)</i>

309
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,553
<i>(Let me try.)</i>

310
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,976
OK, that's enough of that.

311
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,435
Oh, come on!

312
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,521
Doctor McKay, we were just starting to make progress.

313
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,274
Well, progress won't be necessary
if we can get her out of here.

314
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:49,570
Now, I have calmed down, so has she.
Let me get back to work.

315
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,863
OK.

316
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:55,033
Really? Oh, she... she's fine with this, by the way.

317
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,369
- Sorta.
- Sorta. So, yeah, should I...?

318
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,290
This is a P-90. It's a compact, lightweight,

319
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,792
incredibly sturdy for...

320
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,048
Good!

321
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:11,717
That's...

322
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,801
good.

323
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,053
Alright...

324
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,722
This is a nine millimetre,

325
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,015
semi-automatic...

326
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,272
That's good too!

327
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,107
I prefer this.

328
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,239
I can see why you would!

329
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,669
Alright! Let's give this bad boy a try.

330
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,546
Start her up and slowly ease her into it.

331
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,382
No, no, no, no. It's not ready.
Some of these calculations are not right.

332
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,718
Maybe you just don't understand them.

333
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,517
What the hell happened?

334
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,601
We started it up.

335
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,062
I said slowly ease her into it!

336
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,105
I was at three percent.

337
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,150
The power requirements are delicate.
We should have run more simulations before we...

338
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,486
Yes, yes! Twenty-twenty hindsight.

339
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,862
You shouldn't be here.

340
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:14,738
I'm sorry?

341
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,116
We are telling you these calculations are wrong.

342
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,412
Having two consciousnesses inside
of a single brain must be very taxing.

343
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,205
Listen...

344
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,749
You're making mistakes.

345
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,257
Now leave it to me,

346
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,592
before you do more harm than good.

347
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,733
You're up late.

348
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,819
I...

349
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,947
couldn't sleep I was, uh, trying to clear my head.

350
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,909
I, uh, hear the transformer test didn't go so well.

351
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,703
Well, you heard right.

352
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,205
Uh, listen.

353
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,000
I wanted you to know that

354
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,752
I gave the command to take the Dart down.

355
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:17,259
Well, much as I'd like to pretend that this is remotely
your fault, the thought of what would've happened
if you hadn't shot the Dart down is...

356
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,218
So,

357
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,219
we're cool.

358
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,013
No, you're cool, I'm fine.

359
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,932
You should get some sleep.

360
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,060
I could actually use some rest, Rodney.

361
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,563
She says she's tired.

362
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:32,900
Goodnight.

363
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,703
<i>(Busy?)</i>

364
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,789
No, no. Come in.

365
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,209
How're you feeling?

366
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,293
<i>(Fine.)</i>

367
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,671
Really?

368
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,799
<i>(Merely because of Cadman.)</i>

369
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,426
<i>(She's calming, you know?)</i>

370
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:46,098
<i>(Between you and me, I am damned lucky it was her.)</i>

371
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,058
Should you, uh...?

372
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,977
<i>(Oh, she's asleep can't hear a thing.)</i>

373
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,938
Well, yes, then, she seems like a lovely lady.

374
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,691
<i>(Oh! That is so nice!)</i>

375
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,862
<i>(Oh...)</i>

376
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,488
<i>(you wanna...)</i>

377
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,031
<i>(do me a favour?)</i>

378
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,243
<i>(You know, you wanna, uh,</i>
<i>ride shotgun on this date tomorrow night?)</i>

379
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,871
With Doctor Brown?

380
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:09,955
<i>(Katie.)</i>

381
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,707
You're going through with it?

382
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,711
<i>(Well, I've cancelled on her so many times.</i>
<i>I don't wanna mess this up.)</i>

383
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,382
But what d'you want me to do?

384
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:26,138
<i>(Listen. I don't think it's any big secret</i>
<i>that I am terrible with women.)</i>

385
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,185
<i>(Having someone there to cut me off when I start</i>
<i>making a fool of myself would be a great help.)</i>

386
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,856
<i>(I'd consider it a personal favour.)</i>

387
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,403
OK, Rodney, fine.

388
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:42,321
<i>(Great!)</i>

389
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,366
<i>(And, thanks!)</i>

390
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,938
Where am I?

391
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,816
Where are my clothes?

392
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,403
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

393
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,492
- It is two in the afternoon! Where the hell are we?
- We're in my room. Your mattress sucks.

394
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:31,828
That is a prescription mattress I need that for
my back. Now, how the hell did we get here?

395
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,373
- I walked here while you were sleeping.
- You did what?

396
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,251
Yeah, well, it was a lot easier
to use your body when you were asleep.

397
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,418
Pants!

398
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,380
- Where are my pants?
- They're over on the chair.

399
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,009
Seen it!

400
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,470
We have gotta set some boundaries!

401
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,265
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I'm kinda used to sleeping in the buff.

402
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,392
You have crossed a line here, Cadman.

403
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,270
I guarantee it was more traumatic for me.

404
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,148
Why are my legs burning?

405
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,526
Oh, I took us for a run before we went to bed.

406
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,319
Why in the world would you do that?

407
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,113
Because it helps me unwind.

408
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,199
OK, OK. This is very important.

409
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,494
Did you ingest any citrus?
I am deathly allergic to citrus.

410
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:19,168
Rodney, look I worked out, I came here
and I went to bed. Jeez, loosen up!

411
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,505
I would love to, but every muscle in my body
is sore from your stupid workout!

412
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,175
So what's on the board for today?

413
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,302
More of the same. Why do you have any ideas?

414
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,429
Yeah actually I do.

415
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,265
Don't look!

416
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,447
I thought we were supposed to be sparring today?

417
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,491
You were late. So Ronon and I...

418
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,625
What the hell do you think you're doing?

419
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,753
I wouldn't have hurt her.

420
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,089
You sure in hell looked like you were going to.

421
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,009
- You OK?
- I am fine.

422
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,768
I told him that he did not have to go easy on me.

423
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,729
You've gotta be careful what you say to this guy.

424
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,776
No, it is completely out of the question.

425
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,694
Why? You'd rather go it alone?

426
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,738
Oh yes, imagine that, I'd rather go it alone!

427
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,615
Well, consider the opportunity, right?

428
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,242
To have a woman there with you,

429
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,159
helping you out,

430
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,410
feeding you lines.

431
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,246
I really think you could learn something.

432
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,290
Thank you for the offer,
Cyrano, but I think I'll pass.

433
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:44,753
I was there when you bumped into her, OK?
I felt how nervous and awkward you were.

434
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,006
Well I'm sure that has nothing
to do with my current situation.

435
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,634
C'mon, Rodney, let me do this for you!

436
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,928
Maybe this is why this happened.

437
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,012
This is why this happened?

438
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,138
- Yeah.
- Are you insane?

439
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,142
Considering our situation here,
I think I've been extremely reasonable.

440
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,478
I can make this a living hell for you, Rodney.

441
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,273
This is something I wanna do, and we're doing it.

442
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,335
I wanted to apologise.

443
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,172
Come in.

444
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,302
Do not worry, Ronon.

445
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,930
It was ... impressive.

446
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,183
Please.

447
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,144
How are you finding your training?

448
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:45,189
You mean my test.

449
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,441
Is that what you think?

450
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,152
Am I wrong?

451
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,697
Colonel Sheppard believes
you can be of great help to us.

452
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,036
Why did you join them?

453
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:04,291
My people are strong and proud,

454
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,129
but Atlantis is the best hope for us all.

455
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:14,676
I suspect you see it too,
or you would have already left.

456
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:20,390
I am so sorry. I thought
he told you that I'd be joining you for dinner.

457
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,101
Well, he has been under a lot of stress lately.

458
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,562
Yes in fact that's why I'm here.

459
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,105
Is he alright?

460
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,107
I'm late sorry. Hi.

461
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,276
Carson kept me company.

462
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,238
Sit down the first course is all set to go.

463
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:35,864
- Carson?
- Rodney.

464
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:36,823
What are you doing here?

465
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,493
- You invited me!
- Oh, I did, did I?

466
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:40,911
Yes?

467
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,329
Please,

468
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,622
sit.

469
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:55,342
Don't start eating, you idiot! Make a toast first!

470
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,635
Yes, yes,

471
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,053
yes!

472
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,306
A toast

473
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,267
to you.

474
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,561
We've been working together for...

475
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:08,522
some time now, a short time, but...

476
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:12,067
in that time I've...

477
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,571
often found our interchanges very...

478
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,032
What I mean to say is that...

479
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,951
you're very funny,

480
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,328
and smart, and...

481
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,627
from what I can tell, you... make a delicious salad.

482
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,087
So,

483
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,505
to you.

484
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,299
Yes, cheers!

485
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,967
Very good! That wasn't so bad.

486
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,762
She's obviously into you, so at least
we have that working for us. Now, I was thinking

487
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,556
that we m...

488
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,807
Wait, McKay.

489
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,850
McKay.

490
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,227
Stop drinking the wine. You're gonna get drunk.

491
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:50,856
Actually, wait, yes!
You need that to loosen up a bit. Finish it off!

492
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,901
Good boy! Yeah!

493
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:05,454
Say something, McKay!
C'mon, say something that'll start a conversation.

494
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,291
So...

495
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,085
do you...

496
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,426
Yes?

497
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,137
Forgot what I was gonna say.

498
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,600
What was it?

499
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:32,189
<i>(OK, this is ridiculous.)</i>

500
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,238
<i>(Katie,)</i>

501
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,573
<i>(I really like you.)</i>

502
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:42,908
<i>(In fact,)</i>

503
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,786
<i>(the past few months here</i>
<i>have been made more liveable)</i>

504
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,287
<i>(thanks to you.)</i>

505
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,000
<i>(I wanted tonight to be special,)</i>

506
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,753
<i>(but for reasons I can't go into now,)</i>

507
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,672
<i>(I gotta leave.)</i>

508
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,718
I'm sorry to hear that.

509
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,930
<i>(But I don't want you to be insulted)</i>

510
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,600
<i>(or to wonder whether</i>
<i>or not I am interested in you.)</i>

511
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,310
<i>(Because I am...)</i>

512
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,145
<i>(I am very)</i>

513
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,606
<i>(very,)</i>

514
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,984
<i>(interested.)</i>

515
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,745
<i>(See you soon.)</i>

516
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,759
Give me back my body! We have to go back.

517
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:48,015
<i>(And do what? I bet that is the most honest</i>
<i>you've ever been with a girl and it wasn't even you!)</i>

518
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,934
Why are you doing this?

519
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:55,022
<i>(We're just trying to do too much too fast, McKay.)</i>

520
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,482
We should, we should go back.

521
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:58,775
<i>(Nope!)</i>

522
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,152
Alright

523
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:03,197
rock, paper, scissors.
I'm the left hand, you're the right.

524
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,573
Cadman!

525
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:05,574
<i>(Fine.)</i>

526
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,453
<i>(Yay! Paper beats rock we leave.)</i>

527
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,079
No, we...

528
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,375
<i>(Get a hold of yourself, man!)</i>

529
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,420
<i>Doctor McKay, report to the hangar.</i>
<i>Doctor McKay, report to the hangar.</i>

530
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,547
Hello! That's us!

531
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,301
Thank you!

532
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,392
We've been running simulations all day.
I think I may finally have something.

533
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:38,982
I was able to get the generator to run on a buffer
loop which tricks the Dart into taking only
the power that it needs without overloading.

534
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,735
Great. Good thinking. Can we, just, see it?

535
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,487
Anxious?

536
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:44,696
Yes.

537
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,031
OK.

538
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,449
Firing.

539
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,249
Alright.

540
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,793
Lifesigns holding steady.

541
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,171
Now, rematerialisation initiated.

542
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,012
<i>Now I'm no scientist,</i>

543
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,557
but those mice used to be a different colour.

544
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,267
This is never gonna end!

545
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,769
I'm gonna be stuck like this

546
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,312
forever!

547
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,030
I'm not sure it's a good idea, John.

548
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:30,993
Elizabeth, you've gotta see this guy in action.
He is an incredible shot

549
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,662
none of my guys can beat him
in a fight and he's ex-military.

550
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,539
Not a military on Earth.

551
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,207
The guy's got no place to go.

552
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:38,834
You're not just being charitable?

553
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:42,713
No, I'm not and I think he'd make
a great addition to my team.

554
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,339
We don't know anything about him.

555
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,424
Well, what's there to know?

556
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,052
Well, anything would be helpful.
He's not very forthcoming.

557
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,890
He's been on the run from the Wraith
for the past seven years. What do you expect? Listen

558
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,643
just talk to the guy. You owe him that at least.

559
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,024
OK.

560
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,072
I would like an apology.

561
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,741
Laura?

562
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,242
<i>(Forget about it!)</i>

563
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,411
You did take over his body without permission.

564
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,580
<i>(He doesn't ask permission when he takes over.)</i>

565
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,457
You... because it's my body!

566
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,499
<i>(Yeah,)</i>

567
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,461
<i>(and I'm a guest.</i>
<i>Try and be a little more courteous.)</i>

568
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,047
You see?! You see what I have to put up with!

569
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,381
<i>(Put up with?)</i>

570
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:30,594
There's a lot of stuff that
I'm not doing right now that I would be doing!

571
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,930
<i>(- I don't wanna hear about it...)</i>
<i>- Alright, you two.</i>

572
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,431
Settle down.

573
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:41,522
Thigh, strip, cut, lift, cut...

574
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,607
and finish.

575
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,400
Awesome!

576
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,569
Ronon.

577
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,113
Could I have a word?

578
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,200
Here.

579
00:33:56,245 --> 00:34:00,332
I understand Major Sheppard extended
an invitation to you to join his team.

580
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah, he did.

581
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,255
Well, he was supposed to speak to me about that first.

582
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,882
OK.

583
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,636
Look, it's not that I don't trust you, or

584
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:16,431
value any contributions you may have to make,

585
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:22,521
or that you will make if you do join us
it's just it is a rather big decision.

586
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,026
So how do you feel?

587
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,528
I'm thinkin' about it.

588
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:33,323
OK, good!  Well, I'm thinkin' about it too.

589
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,576
So I guess we'll just keep in touch, then?

590
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:36,869
OK.

591
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:39,997
OK!

592
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,331
Alright

593
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,751
remember the leading arm. Two knives.

594
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,461
Slice, cut!

595
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,338
You're the one who said set up rules.  Well, I did.

596
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,925
I followed them I stuck to them.
She basically hijacked me.

597
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,260
<i>(Hey,)</i>

598
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:59,266
<i>(you had a real opportunity to get inside the mind</i>
<i>of a woman and actually expand your horizons,)</i>

599
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,642
<i>(but no-o-o-o-o.)</i>

600
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:05,189
Did you ever for a second consider that I might
not want to get inside a woman's...

601
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,315
Rodney!

602
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,399
Rodney?

603
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,609
Rodney?

604
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,994
This is Heightmeyer. Get Beckett in here, stat.

605
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,256
What happened?

606
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,090
You had a seizure.

607
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:32,883
Why?

608
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:37,638
From what we can tell, the constant
fighting over the dominance of your brain is
having a deleterious effect on its lower functions

609
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,432
heart rate, respiration, organ function...

610
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,768
<i>(- That's not good.) </i>
<i>- Of course it's not good!</i>

611
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,895
- I'm not sure how long you can go on like this.
- What do you mean?

612
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,898
These misfires will
only increase in frequency and severity over time.

613
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,316
Well, fine,
she'll stop trying to take over control of my body.

614
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,943
It's not as simple as that, Rodney.

615
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,530
One of you has to release control.
One of you has to let go completely.

616
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:59,201
Ah, well, maybe if someone say,
you hadn't told her to try and take control
in the first place, none of this would have happened.

617
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,328
I was just trying to help both of you.

618
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,123
What happens to the person the one who lets go?

619
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:09,419
Well, we're not certain, of course
we've not often run into these situations before...

620
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,296
<i>(They would disappear.)</i>

621
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:14,716
<i>(I know they would,</i>
<i>cos I can already feel it happening to me.)</i>

622
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,927
<i>(It's getting harder to be in here.)</i>

623
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,846
<i>(It's taking more of an effort.)</i>

624
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,597
Has it always been like that?

625
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,140
<i>(Past few hours.)</i>

626
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,642
<i>(You haven't felt it too?)</i>

627
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,520
Well, of course
I have I just thought I was fighting with you.

628
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,564
Look where're we at?

629
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:33,443
Well, we've
successfully rematerialised a pair of mice.

630
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,946
<i>They were whole and correctly reconstructed...</i>

631
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,197
But?

632
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,117
They didn't survive.

633
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,998
I'm afraid if one of you doesn't let go,

634
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,750
both of you will die.

635
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,587
<i>I'll do it.</i>

636
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,383
Which one of you said that?

637
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:04,892
You don't have to do this.

638
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:09,021
Yes I do, Rodney.
It's your body and you're not gonna do it.

639
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,189
Oh, what makes you so sure?

640
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,316
They need you here, and

641
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,611
as much as I hate to admit it
I'm not as important as...

642
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:16,904
Stop it!

643
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,822
It's not true.

644
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:20,449
<i>(Carson!)</i>

645
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,577
<i>(I need something to write with.)</i>

646
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,953
What're you doing?

647
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,997
I wanna write a letter to my folks.

648
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,628
I'd appreciate it if you'd deliver it yourself
the next time you gate back to Earth,
Rodney explain what happened.

649
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,338
Well, I'm not sure when I'll...

650
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,839
The Gate!

651
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,758
We can use the Gate!

652
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,968
What're you talkin' about?

653
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:44,431
Well, the Gate dematerialises you as you
step into it, sending your information to the next
Gate so it can be rematerialised on the other side.

654
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,058
Well, we know that.

655
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:51,146
So if we can take one of the crystal control
modules from the Gate and interface it with the
Dart, we should be able to build a safer system.

656
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,398
Rodney, wait. I don't
think you're in any condition to do this, Rodney.

657
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,985
I don't have time to talk
I need to get this done before the next seizure.

658
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,078
Alright, let's do this.

659
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,080
Just because it works in simulation doesn't mean ...

660
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:13,961
I would prefer
not to suffer a fatal seizure while we wait for you
to round up more mice protesting. So, shall we?

661
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:14,962
Rodney.

662
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,381
Don't try to talk me out of this
I may very well listen.

663
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:20,676
I was just gonna say thanks.

664
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:25,180
Well, you're welcome. I can honestly say
that the entire experience has been very ...

665
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:26,265
Ah, about time.

666
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,392
Hold on, Rodney I thought all the mice died?

667
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,936
Well, what are we mice or men?

668
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,105
Are you sure about this?

669
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,815
Absolutely, yes.

670
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,658
- OK.
- Just ... give me a second.

671
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,082
Well, Laura, it's been,...

672
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,458
unique.

673
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,793
To say the least!

674
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,628
Good luck to us both, right?

675
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,754
Alright.

676
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,300
It's ready.

677
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,344
I suggest you take a step back.

678
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,765
Alright.

679
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,311
Wait!

680
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,618
<i>(Just in case this doesn't work.)</i>

681
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,543
Just, just

682
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:38,378
hit it.

683
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:45,969
OK

684
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,514
it's reading as two lifesigns.
Power levels are steady...

685
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,974
Get them out of there!

686
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:02,319
Let's get them to the infirmary.

687
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:08,992
Did you get the chance to talk to Ronon?

688
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,745
Yes, I did. Chatty fellow, isn't he?!

689
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,497
And?

690
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,917
- He would be your responsibility.
- I knew you'd say yes!

691
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:20,087
- I haven't said yes.
- Well, you were about to.

692
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,757
- Yes.
- There y'go!

693
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,191
<i>Feelin' better?</i>

694
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,407
Oh no!

695
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,743
<i>Over here!</i>

696
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,127
a little less crowded. You?

697
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:03,589
Same. It's nice to have my own body back.

698
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,132
You are doing supremely well.

699
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,509
Ah, good to hear.

700
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,136
Nice work.

701
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,015
- Well, it was your idea.
- Well, of course it was, but you...

702
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,391
you were...

703
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:15,684
there.

704
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,647
Lieutenant, way to survive
what I think may be my worst nightmare.

705
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,357
Thank you, Sir!

706
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,484
Yes, thank you!

707
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,738
I imagine you two might want a moment.

708
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,782
Actually, ma'am, I think I'd like some time alone.

709
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,660
Same here. It's... been a while.

710
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,621
Alright. Release them as soon as you can.

711
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,955
Aye.
