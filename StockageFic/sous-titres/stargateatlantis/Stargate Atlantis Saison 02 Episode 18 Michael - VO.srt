00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,404
<i>Elizabeth...</i>

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,073
Yes, Carson?

3
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,741
<i>He's awake.</i>

4
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>Blood pressure's fine, pulse normal.</i>
<i>You're bouncing back quite nicely.</i>

5
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,419
Bouncing back from what?

6
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,462
Hello, Michael.

7
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,256
Do you remember me?

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,093
No.

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,763
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir,
this is lieutenant colonel John Sheppard.

10
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,723
You serve under my command.

11
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,894
Do you know where you are?

12
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,815
I don't even know who I am.

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,985
Your name is lieutenant Michael Kenmore.

14
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,947
<i>You're in a private room off</i>
<i>the infirmary here in Atlantis.</i>

15
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,075
Is that familiar to you?

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,829
Atlantis...

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,331
Yeah.

18
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,208
I think.

19
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,545
You were a member of a team that went offworld.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,839
You were captured by the Wraith.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,218
I see you remember the Wraith.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,346
What did they do to me?

23
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,057
We're not quite sure yet.

24
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,977
We sent a rescue team for you, but...

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,897
you were wounded during the mission.

26
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,941
You've been unconscious for
days now. Had us worried sick.

27
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,319
Why can't I remember anything?

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,987
We don't know yet.

29
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,907
Hopefully, we'll learn more as we conduct further tests.

30
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,367
And in the meantime, I can assure you

31
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>that we will give you</i>
<i>the best possible care to help in your recovery.</i>

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,216
<i>Keep a close eye on him.</i>

33
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,718
Until we know more,
we need to proceed with caution.

34
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,889
This may just be the start of our problems.

38
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,879
What is that?

39
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,634
I'm afraid you have type one diabetes.

40
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:42,097
You require a daily injection of insulin
to maintain a normal blood glucose level.

41
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,391
You've managed it quite nicely, actually.

42
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:51,690
Michael, we believe you may be suffering from
what's called generalized dissociative amnesia,

43
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,027
which usually occurs
as a result of significant trauma.

44
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,695
Trauma...

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,155
caused by the Wraith?

46
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,449
We don't know for certain.

47
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,577
Hopefully, over time, your memory will return.

48
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,705
In the meantime,
we'll do our best to help you fill in the gaps,

49
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,042
a wee bit at a time so as not
to completely overwhelm you.

50
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,295
I'm already completely overwhelmed.

51
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,672
How much worse could it get?

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,431
I heard he was awake.

53
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,351
Aye, complete amnesia.
Doesn't remember a thing.

54
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,024
May I speak with him?

55
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,901
Of course.

56
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,697
You need to rest.

57
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,542
Hello, Michael.

58
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,627
I am Teyla.

59
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,755
You look familiar.

60
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,049
Do I know you?

61
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,092
Yes.

62
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,428
You assisted my team on a few missions.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,139
No, there's more, though.

64
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,016
Are...

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,893
are we friends?

66
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,562
Yes.

67
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,107
Well, that's the best news I've heard all day.

68
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,069
How are you feeling?

69
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,614
Physically, fine, but my mind is...

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,908
completely blank.

71
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,202
They said I'm a lieutenant.

72
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,956
You have only recently arrived in Atlantis, but

73
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,293
you have already proven yourself
to be one of the finest soldiers in this city.

74
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,838
Well, if I'm such a fine soldier,
how did I get captured by the Wraith?

75
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,800
Your team came upon a landed
Wraith cruiser and were ambushed.

76
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,345
<i>You sacrificed yourself in order</i>
<i>to give your team mates time to escape.</i>

77
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,848
Quite heroic.

78
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,602
Were you part of the team that rescued me?

79
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,478
Yes.

80
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,190
Well, then that makes you even more heroic.

81
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,403
He said I was familiar to him.

82
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,071
He asked if we were friends.

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,531
How did you respond?

84
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,782
I said we were.

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,745
After everything he's been through,
I thought some positive news could not hurt.

86
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,996
<i>I think you're right.</i>

87
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,958
Stabilization is the first critical stage
in his psychological treatment.

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,546
He's doing quite well so far, but it's important
we do what we can to ease his recovery.

89
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,049
What's the next stage?

90
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,134
Integration into the community.

91
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,220
Followed by relational development.

92
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,888
How is he doing physically?

93
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,973
<i>Excellent. Vitals normal,</i>

94
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,936
all he needs is a bit of physical
therapy to regain muscle tone and coordination.

95
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,812
Do you think he's ready to be released?

96
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,149
- I do.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

97
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,320
We still don't know if there are any
residual effects he might be carrying around.

98
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,031
What do you think, Doctor?

99
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,699
Is he ready to join the community?

100
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,410
A change of scenery could be very beneficial to him.

101
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,458
Alright then.

102
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,918
Release him.

103
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,393
These are your quarters.

104
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,982
<i>Does any of this look familiar to you?</i>

105
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,066
<i>No.</i>

106
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,033
It is a cowboy hat.

107
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,953
You come from a place called Texas.

108
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,664
Texas?

109
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,139
<i>They're your parents.</i>

110
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,443
What happened to the blue jello?

111
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,154
It's my favorite. All of a sudden,
it's off the menu. What gives?

112
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,239
Thank you.

113
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,335
Lt. Kenmore.

114
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,629
Well, so they tell me.

115
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,506
Call me Michael.

116
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,591
Michael, right. Yes, of course. Michael.

117
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:35,516
- I'm sorry, I'm probably supposed to know you, but...
- Right, right, the amnesia. Yes, of course, I heard.

118
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,184
I'm Dr. McKay.

119
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,644
<i>Rodney McKay.</i>

120
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,103
Doctor.

121
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,108
So you've been... released, I see.

122
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,402
Just now, but

123
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:52,199
I have some bodyguards following me
around everywhere, and colonel Sheppard's

124
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,284
<i>probably somewhere close by.</i>

125
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,412
They want to keep an eye on me
in case I suddenly...

126
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,872
freak out.

127
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,292
Yes, freak out, yes, but I don't think you're...
I mean, you're not gonna...

128
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,294
you're fine, aren't you?

129
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,797
I think so. I feel fine.

130
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,465
I guess time will tell.

131
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,759
Hopefully the amnesia won't be permanent.

132
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,973
Wraith materializer schematics?

133
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:17,850
Yes.

134
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,726
Yes, I was just...

135
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,812
just studying them, you know.

136
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,106
How did I know that?

137
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,860
One of your team's mission
objectives was to infiltrate...

138
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,405
a Wraith ship, and obtain...

139
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,073
you know...

140
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,158
intelligence.

141
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,661
- And our mission was successful?
<i>- Yes,</i>

142
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,789
- very successful.
- Except for getting captured.

143
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,751
Well, we've all been captured by the Wraith
at one point or another, haven't we?

144
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,922
It's just... important thing is that
you were rescued, safe and sound.

145
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,510
Safe, yes. The sound part, I'm not so sure of.

146
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,638
It's...

147
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,392
Well...

148
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,937
I guess I'd better be going.

149
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:04,980
Right.

150
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,440
You got it.

151
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,151
<i>See you.</i>

152
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,621
Defend...

153
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,663
defend...

154
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,123
parry...
strike.

155
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,384
It is all about catching your opponent off balance.

156
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,678
You succeeded.

157
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,598
Now you try.

158
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,518
I can't do that move.

159
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,394
Oh, yes you can.

160
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,523
You keep saying I'm a good fighter.

161
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,565
You are.

162
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,234
Very good.

163
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,736
Alright.

164
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,884
Well, you were right.

165
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,135
I can't believe I just...

166
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,264
<i>Keep your hands off her!</i>

167
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,723
<i>Ronon...</i>

168
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,017
We were sparring as part of his physical therapy.

169
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,269
Let him go.

170
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,188
Now!

171
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,733
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,904
Ronon is fairly new here in Atlantis. He's...

173
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,407
still making the adjustment
to our way of doing things.

174
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:43,036
He's clashed a few times with some of the personnel,
including yourself and even colonel Sheppard.

175
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,663
I'll just have to stay clear of him.

176
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,668
Whatever I did to make him angry, he doesn't look like
the kind of person you want to have as an enemy.

177
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,545
Give him time.

178
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,924
I'm sure you'll work out your differences,
put the past behind you.

179
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,801
The past...

180
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,887
whatever that is.

181
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,517
It's just so frustrating.

182
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,854
I didn't even remember the faces of my own parents.

183
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,356
They've been informed of your condition.

184
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,026
In time, we'll send you home
to be reunited with them but,

185
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,196
for now, I think it's best if we hold off.

186
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,116
So what do you think?
Will my memory ever return?

187
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,451
We can't be sure,

188
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,496
but we'll continue with these
sessions, perhaps even try hypnosis.

189
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,417
I just want to get back to normal.

190
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,004
Be like everybody else.

191
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,190
<i>It was so real. I...</i>

192
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,359
<i>I know it was a dream but,</i>

193
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,487
when I saw that face staring back at me...

194
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,993
They did something to me, didn't they?

195
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,871
The Wraith, during my capture?

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,541
They did something to my mind, maybe...

197
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,295
maybe they implanted something into my brain.

198
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,382
What did they do?

199
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,677
Tell me.

200
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,972
We do not know.

201
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,102
Listen...

202
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,730
many people here have had such dreams.

203
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,565
You are not the only one.

204
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,774
Really?

205
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,529
The constant fear of the Wraith
attacking, the way they feed on us?

206
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,573
It creates a tremendous amount of stress.

207
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,283
You've had the dream, too?

208
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:27,618
Yes,

209
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,162
many times,

210
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,414
and I know how frightening it can be.

211
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,627
He's only had the one dream?

212
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,628
<i>Yes.</i>

213
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,006
He believes the Wraith did
something to him during his capture.

214
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,050
Can you do something to help him?

215
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,386
Perhaps I could
give him a sedative to help him sleep,

216
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:51,058
or I could increase his dosage, although
I'd caution against that at this time.

217
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,435
Why? If it's helping, what's
wrong with giving him more?

218
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:58,607
Because, Rodney, I've specifically calibrated his
regimen according to his current physical condition.

219
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,443
<i>Any alteration could adversely affect his recovery.</i>

220
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:06,114
I say we remain patient, wait
to see if he has any more dreams.

221
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,702
If it's merely psychological, then
Dr. Heightmeyer should be able to help him through it.

222
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,955
Why do we not just tell him the truth?

223
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,625
I am finding it difficult keeping it from him,

224
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,295
and I am beginning to question whether
our course of action is the correct one.

225
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,772
<i>The dreams are most likely</i>
<i>due to post traumatic stress.</i>

226
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,316
Not at all uncommon in situations like yours.

227
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:45,070
<i>You could see Dr. Beckett after you leave,</i>
<i>have him prescribe something for sleep.</i>

228
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:45,946
I just...

229
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,282
I can't help thinking there's more to it.

230
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,242
Something's not right with me.

231
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,660
Do you feel sick?

232
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:52,536
No!

233
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,122
I mean, I feel like...

234
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,916
I don't know what it is, but...

235
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,293
it's not right.

236
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,836
It's not.

237
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:06,091
Everyone around here, I get the feeling like they
know something, something they're not telling me.

238
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,387
See? That. Your expression.

239
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,097
I see that a lot around here.

240
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,308
People being careful with me,

241
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,311
like they're trying
to figure out what to say next.

242
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,689
And you think this means that
they're keeping secrets from you?

243
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,649
Maybe not deliberately, but, yes.

244
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,653
I get the feeling they know something
about me, but aren't telling me,

245
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,197
and it's frustrating,

246
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,284
because if the Wraith did something to me,
I'd really like to know what it is.

247
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,415
<i>Lieutenant...</i>

248
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,541
Colonel.

249
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,918
Where you off to?

250
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:41,919
My quarters.

251
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,047
Dr. Beckett gave me some pills
to help me get some sleep.

252
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,049
I thought I'd give them a try.

253
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,384
No alcohol or heavy machinery.

254
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:50,886
Excuse me?

255
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,846
Nothing.

256
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,639
Sleep well.

257
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,890
Hey, Ronon...

258
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,060
I don't know
what happened between us in the past but,

259
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,940
if I ever did anything to hurt or
upset you, I just wanted to say that...

260
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,442
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,988
Ronon, shake the man's hand.

262
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,490
I don't think so.

263
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,869
He's trying to bury the hatchet.

264
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,329
It's not a bad idea, don't you think?

265
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,205
I gotta go.

266
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,748
Look, I just want to know...

267
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,962
Knock it off! Knock it off.

268
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,864
Lt. Kenmore, what are you doing up so late?

269
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,575
The pills Dr. Beckett gave me aren't working.

270
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,034
I'm going to go to the infirmary.

271
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,703
After you.

272
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,125
Hi.

273
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,088
Dr. Beckett...

274
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,502
<i>Delta wave frequencies are up 2.9 hertz.</i>

275
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,212
<i>Which means?</i>

276
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,673
<i>He may regain consciousness soon.</i>

277
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,856
<i>Versed, five milligrams!</i>

278
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,573
<i>Release me!</i>

279
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,922
<i>You will die for this!</i>

280
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,466
<i>Others will come for me!</i>

281
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,384
<i>They will...</i>

282
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,136
<i>They've got to find us first.</i>

283
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,555
<i>You're going to need a name.</i>

284
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,224
<i>How does Mike sound?</i>

285
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,118
You lied to me.

286
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,121
I'm a Wraith!

287
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,500
You were a Wraith, yes.

288
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:36,088
- Michael, please...
- Don't call me that, that's not my name!

289
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,131
Alright, take it easy.

290
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,425
If you would let us explain...

291
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,845
Go ahead.

292
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,221
Explain...

293
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,640
but no more lies.

294
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,350
<i>Alright.</i>

295
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,185
This is what we know of the Wraith.

296
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,314
They evolved from a creature
that we call the "Eratus bug".

297
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:59,027
<i>Now, that bug began taking on characteristics</i>
<i>of the humans it was feeding on,</i>

298
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,320
<i>and over time,</i>

299
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,406
became the Wraith that we know now.

300
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,783
So Dr. Beckett has developed a drug.

301
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,451
It's a retrovirus,

302
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:10,497
designed to suppress the "Eratus bug"
elements of the Wraith genetic code,

303
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,166
<i>leaving only the human aspects behind.</i>

304
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,086
It took some time to perfect,

305
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,714
<i>but we finally achieved a viable drug,</i>

306
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,217
which we then decided to test.

307
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,636
The injections?

308
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,347
The insulin?

309
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,640
Not insulin.

310
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,100
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,646
<i>You see, once the retrovirus was</i>
<i>administered and the transformation begun,</i>

312
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:38,317
another drug was needed to prevent
the Wraith elements from returning.

313
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:42,863
It's actually a combination of drugs which,
unfortunately, require a daily injection.

314
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,990
So what are you saying? That...

315
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,911
being a Wraith is some kind of disease?
Something...

316
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,787
<i>you think you can cure?</i>

317
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,667
What gives you the right to do this to me?

318
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,544
We're at war.

319
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,049
The Wraith will stop at
nothing to kill every one of us,

320
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,385
and we'll stop at nothing to
make sure that doesn't happen.

321
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,389
You made up everything.

322
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,226
My name...

323
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,938
The photograph of my parents.

324
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,609
It was my decision to keep the truth from you.

325
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:21,693
Why?

326
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,114
For one, we were concerned that if you were told,
you may react the way you are now.

327
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,993
The whole point was
to erase any trace of Wraith inside you,

328
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,870
not to keep reminding you of it...

329
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:36,750
and trust me, you're a hell of a lot
better off now than you were before.

330
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,212
Since we're telling the truth.

331
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,008
This whole thing was a bad idea.

332
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,385
No, it wasn't.

333
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,596
The retrovirus works, that much is clear.
Just look at the guy.

334
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,017
<i>If we can figure out how to deploy this</i>
<i>as a biological weapon, it's possible</i>

335
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,062
that we can hit entire hive ships
and turn them into humans.

336
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,231
<i>Well, that's still a ways off,</i>

337
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:03,944
and I've yet to develop an effective long-term dose
to keep the Wraith elements suppressed for a lifetime.

338
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,988
But the point is, we are getting closer.

339
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,032
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you may be able to make him look like a human,</i>

340
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,450
talk like a human,

341
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,536
but he'll still be a Wraith.

342
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,249
Nothing you do will ever change that.

343
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,051
Michael?

344
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,681
I know you are angry.

345
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,309
I am sorry for what you have been put through...

346
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:43,525
- But in time, I think you may come to see this is...
- Were you part of the team that captured me?

347
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,411
You told me before that...

348
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:59,041
you and your team
rescued me when I was captured by the Wraith.

349
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:04,630
But now I'm starting to realize
who did the actual capturing.

350
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,261
And you have the nerve to tell me you're my friend.

351
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:14,056
I would like to be your friend.

352
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,350
<i>I would.</i>

353
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,310
You expect me to believe that?

354
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,813
You may not understand this now,
but making you human,

355
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,316
- I believe this could make your life better.
<i>- Really?</i>

356
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,401
Because from what I was told,

357
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:29,530
you made me human in order to make

358
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,365
your lives better.

359
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,037
So tell me then...

360
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,543
What makes being human

361
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,461
better than being a Wraith?

362
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,712
They are evil.

363
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,298
They kill us...

364
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:49,883
feed on us,

365
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,220
- show no mercy, know nothing of compassion.
- Humans are different?

366
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:56,473
- Yes.
- So what you did to me...

367
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,979
that was done out of compassion?

368
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,360
Your feelings of betrayal are understandable but,

369
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,446
it's important you talk about them,

370
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,199
hopefully come to resolve them.

371
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,868
With you?

372
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,661
Yes.

373
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,413
Of course.

374
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,208
I already tried that once.
It didn't work out so well.

375
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,256
But something was cleared up for me, though.

376
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,928
Now I know what that strange
feeling was, the one that's been...

377
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,307
gnawing inside me.

378
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,103
Seems I can't shake those basic Wraith instincts.

379
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,147
Hunger...

380
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,690
aggression...

381
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,693
and now that I know the truth,

382
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:54,364
I feel them even more.

383
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,417
<i>Dr. Heightmeyer confirmed he believes</i>
<i>he's still experiencing Wraith compulsions.</i>

384
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,045
Is there anything more you
can do to help suppress them?

385
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,673
I don't know.
It could merely be a psychological manifestation.

386
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,760
Maybe we should up his dose.

387
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,847
Yeah, I know you said give it more time,
but now that he knows what's going on...

388
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,141
things might start going from bad to worse.

389
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,726
I agree.

390
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:24,686
He's due for his next injection now.

391
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,440
I could go ahead, increase the
dosage, and monitor him closely.

392
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:32,528
- Let's just hope he agrees to take it.
- Well, if he doesn't, we'll have to insist.

393
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:37,991
Who knows, maybe another big dose
might wipe his memory clean again.

394
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,452
And then what?

395
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,829
We start the lies all over again?

396
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,336
They want you in the infirmary.

397
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,715
Time for your injection.

398
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,871
<i>What are you doing?</i>

399
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,749
What do you want from me?

400
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,045
Just waiting for you to give me a reason to kill you.

401
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,677
Well, I guess I should thank you.

402
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,681
You're the only one around here
who's been honest with me from the start.

403
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,224
Lt. Kenmore...

404
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,893
the infirmary?

405
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,687
You heard him.

406
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,689
Better get moving...

407
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,233
Lieutenant.

408
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,789
This is sgt. Cole.
Kenmore's escaped.

409
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,084
Level five, east tower.
Ronon's also in pursuit.

410
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,234
Drop your weapon.

411
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,569
Just take it easy, Lieutenant.

412
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,071
Stop calling me that.

413
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,241
Drop your weapon.

414
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,069
I figured you'd forget to set it to stun.

415
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,656
<i>Sgt. Cole.</i>

416
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,409
He is dead.

417
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,503
<i>We can't keep him here.</i>

418
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,338
<i>Even locked up, he's too dangerous.</i>

419
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,882
We can take him to the Alpha site.

420
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,176
We'll sedate him first,
so he won't know where it is.

421
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,220
And then what?

422
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,015
Continue with the drug treatments.

423
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,474
Continue?

424
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,186
Dr. Beckett was about to
start increasing the dosage.

425
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,814
Hopefully, that will be effective in
eliminating any remaining Wraith impulses.

426
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,025
<i>Why are we even talking about this?</i>

427
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,360
He killed one of your people.

428
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,821
Your experiment didn't work.

429
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:04,740
We should kill him right now.

430
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,158
We can't kill him, Ronon.

431
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,411
- We're the ones who put him in this position.
- Hold on a minute, Doc.

432
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:12,039
<i>If we hadn't have given him</i>
<i>the retrovirus, he'd still be a Wraith.</i>

433
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,832
We wouldn't think twice about killing him.

434
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,959
<i>But we did give him the retrovirus.</i>

435
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,211
We made him human.

436
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:19,796
Now we have the responsibility to
treat him as we would any other...

437
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:20,756
He's not...

438
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,508
human!

439
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,301
He's a Wraith.

440
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,477
Carson, what do you think?

441
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,896
<i>Is it worth continuing with these treatments?</i>

442
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,650
I...

443
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,110
I don't know, I...

444
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:46,406
suppose it's worth seeing how
he fares with the increased dosage.

445
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,116
I agree.

446
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:51,662
We've come too far
with this just to abandon it now.

447
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,797
Would you please step outside?

448
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,719
What's going to happen to me?

449
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:13,267
You will be transported to another planet,
where we are establishing an offworld base.

450
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,645
You want to keep me
from learning more about Atlantis.

451
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:22,359
You're afraid that if a Wraith ship
comes close enough, I'll communicate with them...

452
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,571
tell them you're here.

453
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,700
I didn't want to kill him.

454
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:33,620
I just wanted to escape,

455
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,623
to get out of this place.

456
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,751
We would like to continue the drug treatments.

457
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:47,718
Dr. Beckett believes that an increased
dose would fully suppress any
Wraith urges you may still be experiencing.

458
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,849
The alternative is death.

459
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,187
<i>All of this up to the Jumper bay.</i>

460
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,189
EEG, defib, cardiograph.

461
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,234
Cross-check the medications on the list I gave you.
Make certain we're good for at least a week.

462
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,903
We've got a lot of equipment to take with us.

463
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,906
From what I understand, the Alpha site
is not exactly set up for this kind of work.

464
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,658
It's not set up for much of anything yet,
I'm afraid.

465
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,160
Hey, how are you holding up?

466
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,787
Oh, I don't know, because of me, a man is dead.

467
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,915
You can't blame yourself for that.

468
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,334
Elizabeth,
I'm the one who developed the retrovirus.

469
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,878
I'm the one who pushed for this experiment.
Of course I'm to blame.

470
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,713
And I'm the one who approved it.

471
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,632
This was my call, Carson.

472
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,010
So if there's any blame to be laid,
it starts and ends with me, alright?

473
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,599
Colonel.

474
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,477
Time to go.

475
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,276
<i>Clear.</i>

476
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,588
<i>It is alright, you are safe.</i>

477
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,801
What happened?

478
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,137
You were sedated for transport to the Alpha site.

479
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,309
Just a precaution.

480
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,231
How are you feeling?

481
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,609
Hungry.

482
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,865
I will see about getting you some food.

483
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,938
They call them meals ready to eat.

484
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,399
<i>It was all I could gather on short notice.</i>

485
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,945
Dr. McKay quite likes them, actually.

486
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,493
Let me help you.

487
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,921
That's okay.

488
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,969
You're different from the others.

489
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,140
I noticed it the first time I saw you.

490
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:44,728
You're the only person willing to understand...

491
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:50,400
The only one with a truly open mind.

492
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,587
The only one willing to show compassion.

493
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,848
Thank you, Teyla.

494
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,270
I knew I could count on you.

495
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,192
<i>Colonel!</i>

496
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:32,901
What happened?

497
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,446
I don't quite know, he somehow managed to get
free of his restraints and take Teyla hostage.

498
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,658
He forced the security detail outside the
infirmary to drop their weapons or he'd kill her.

499
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,828
- Where'd they go?
- Up the ridge. There are other teams on their way.

500
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,299
Just a precaution.

501
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,177
I know...

502
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,179
you're angry, I lied to you...

503
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:03,098
but you had no right to do this to me.

504
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,976
I won't let you experiment on me any more.

505
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,062
Let's go.

506
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,948
He's changing directions.

507
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,742
The tracks are difficult to follow.

508
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,620
He's good.

509
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,665
But you can follow them, right?
I mean, that's your thing.

510
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,251
Among many other things.

511
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:32,878
This way.

512
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,341
What are you doing?

513
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,135
We need to leave this planet.

514
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,096
And go where?

515
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,143
I don't know.

516
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,628
These are the SOs who were guarding the Gate.

517
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,353
Teyla!

518
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,523
Dammit!

519
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,654
What is this place?

520
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,284
That way.

521
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,086
We need to figure out the last address dialed,
if that's even possible.

522
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:59,047
- We need to get McKay out here.
- No, we don't.

523
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,925
Trust me,
he's the only one who can figure this stuff out.

524
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,094
Look.

525
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,606
How much further must we walk?

526
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,525
We'll rest up ahead.

527
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,698
I am sensing something.

528
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,118
There are Wraith nearby.

529
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,163
Yes, there are.

530
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,168
<i>It is not too late.</i>

531
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,377
We can still go back.

532
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,962
Dr. Beckett can give you an injection,

533
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,006
- take away the pain.
- No!

534
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,552
This is how it's supposed to be.

535
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,472
I'm returning to what I was.

536
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,478
What I am.

537
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:26,885
This...

538
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,763
is what I was drawn to.

539
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,307
They are aware of us.

540
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,354
They are coming.

541
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:39,356
I know...

542
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,568
and I will return to them.

543
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,155
Then we shall be enemies again.

544
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,619
We never stopped being enemies.

545
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,540
What will you do with me,
feed on me?

546
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,209
Is that why you brought me all this way?

547
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,963
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the urge...

548
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:10,220
And now that I'm truly able to feed again...

549
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,767
I feel it even more.

550
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,314
Then go ahead.

551
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:48,133
<i>Fall back!</i>

552
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,151
He's alive.

553
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,328
<i>He had completely transformed back into a Wraith?</i>

554
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,580
Well, not completely, but well on his way.

555
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:21,917
His reversion occurred at a much more
accelerated rate than we anticipated.

556
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:25,170
Unfortunately, his memory of what
we did to him remained intact.

557
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,172
Should have killed him when I had the chance.

558
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,131
He's right.

559
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:33,011
We are totally screwed. Not only has our dear
lieutenant's rejoined the Wraith, but he's taken with
him the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.

560
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,139
God knows what type of intel he was
able to pick up during his stay.

561
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,433
They will send another wave of hive ships.

562
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,143
Probably already on their way.

563
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:43,939
And this time I'm guessing they're not
going to fall for the whole invisibility trick.

564
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,361
We need to come up with a new defense plan.

565
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:53,115
We're going to need more firepower.
