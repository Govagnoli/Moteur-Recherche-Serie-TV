00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,128
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,214
I'd like to report for duty, ma'am.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,716
What do you think you're doing here?

5
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,384
- Just give me something to do.
- I don't think so.

6
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,427
Don't push me around!

7
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:11,887
Where's the rest of the enzyme?

8
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,806
Lt Ford might have been your friend,

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,058
but he's not anymore.

10
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,020
We are only here searching for a friend.

11
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,647
You guys all think I'm crazy or something.

12
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,523
No, no-one thinks that.

13
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>We think we can help him,</i>

14
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,025
if we can find him.

15
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,860
This drug is messing with your head!

16
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:27,736
I'm not just fine.

17
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,196
I'm better than fine.

18
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,575
Lieutenant!

19
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,452
Don't!

20
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,831
Ford!

21
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,335
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

22
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,088
<i>Well, keep complaining about it</i>
<i>and we may get there faster.</i>

23
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,510
<i>Well, couldn't we have met these people on a tropical</i>
<i>beach planet, populated by tall, blonde women?</i>

24
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,596
Whoever wants to speak with us,
obviously values their privacy.

25
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,723
Yes, well I value my time and this is a waste of it.

26
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,601
What's a waste of time, is listening to you, Rodney.
This is a mission.

27
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:04,022
Yeah well, it strikes me that this is a mission better
suited to one of the... lower echelon teams.

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
Lower echelon?

29
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,733
He means to say, less important.

30
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,653
Got a tip from one of Teyla's contacts.
We're following it up.

31
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,198
And this is like what? The umpteenth tip
we've followed up in search of a ZedPM?

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,949
- Rodney?

33
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,326
Look, I just want to make it clear
that every second I am out of my lab

34
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,454
is a second the galaxy goes
without another ground-breaking...

35
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,967
We have to get them through the Gate
before their people realise they are missing.

36
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,575
You guys OK?

37
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,494
Oh yeah, fine.

38
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,665
Seems like a whole lot of trouble to go through,
just to get us to dinner.

39
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,130
Not a talkative bunch, are you.

40
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,007
We'll release you from your bindings

41
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,884
if you promise not to attack us.

42
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,761
Sure.

43
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,680
Yeah. We promise.

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,690
Before we untie them,
they had to know that they are among friends.

45
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,610
Ford?

46
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,738
Thought I was dead, didn't you Sheppard?

47
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,834
Season 2 - Episode 10
The lost boys (part 1)

Transcript: Scifigate.net
Sous-titres: Team SG-66 - www.seriestele.net

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:55,801
Guys.

50
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,678
Guys please.

51
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,303
Eat!

52
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,180
<i>Eat.</i>

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,062
<i>Well men,</i>
<i>this used to be my team.</i>

54
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,147
Not this one.

55
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,816
<i>But I think he's OK, too.</i>

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,693
What is all this?

57
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,195
Some local vegetables.

58
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,864
A sorta alligator thingy.

59
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,949
<i>Tastes like salted meat. It's good. Try.</i>

60
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,286
I'm not talking about the food.
What the hell is going on?

61
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
Who are these men?

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,788
Why bring us here like this?

63
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,039
That's a lot of questions.

64
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,291
Pick one.

65
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:30,627
Pick one.

66
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,670
That's good.

67
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>Where did you find him, Sheppard?</i>

68
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,092
Maybe you should start with how you managed
to escape being caught by the Wraith Dart?

69
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,263
What? I get nervous, I get hungry.

70
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,476
OK, the Dart.

71
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,188
Ford!

72
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,909
You're not getting off this planet!

73
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,502
<i>I have no idea how long I was in the Dart.</i>

74
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,630
<i>Next thing I knew, I was on a Cruiser</i>

75
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,341
<i>and I was awake.</i>

76
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,592
It's the enzyme.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,094
Makes you almost immune to a Wraith stunner, so

78
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,763
when you're dematerialized from the Wraith Dart,

79
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,223
you were awake as opposed to...

80
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,474
As opposed to dead!

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,906
I cut open it's enzyme pouch.

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,783
Took my fill.

83
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,451
Made my way off the ship.

84
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>You can get around pretty easy on a Wraith ship.</i>

85
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,333
<i>They're not used to people making it aboard,</i>
<i>so there's next to no security.</i>

86
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,054
I walked off with enough enzyme
to last me a little while.

87
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,681
<i>Tracked down the stargate.</i>

88
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,016
Dialled the first friendly address I could remember.

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,614
I need a place to stay and a hot meal.

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,534
And what do you got to trade?

91
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,207
What'll that get me?

92
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,084
No weapons.

93
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:39,923
So?

94
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,009
What'll that get me?

95
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,056
I still don't really understand.

96
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,933
Look at me. I got shot.

97
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:50,976
I healed.

98
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,896
I can see farther. Clearer than I ever saw before.

99
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,564
<i>I told them about the enzyme.</i>

100
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,901
<i>How it makes you stronger and more aware.</i>

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,152
<i>More resilient.</i>

102
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,071
<i>How to give us a fighting chance against the Wraith.</i>

103
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,574
I mean, look at me.

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,242
Look at me!

105
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,124
I walked off a Wraith Cruiser!

106
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,295
It works.

107
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,755
I wanna try it.

108
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,509
<i>Wait a second.</i>

109
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,220
All your people here.

110
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,305
All your men.

111
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,182
They're on the enzyme?

112
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,059
Of course.

113
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,207
No!

114
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,709
We don't do it like that anymore.

115
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,003
Let's get him back home.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,634
<i>As our numbers kept growing,</i>
<i>we needed more and more of the enzyme.</i>

117
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,028
Nice work.

118
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,280
Thank you.

119
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,199
<i>This should give us a steady stream of the enzyme.</i>

120
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,161
Time to focus on some bigger issues.

121
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,541
<i>Aiden.</i>

122
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:42,129
Do you mean to tell us that there are
live Wraith here in this cave?

123
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,006
That's right.

124
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,385
The Wraith can communicate
with each other over a distance.

125
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,429
But not between stars.

126
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,557
<i>They'd have to be in this solar system.</i>

127
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,641
You taught me that.

128
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,144
Yes well, good for me.

129
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,106
It doesn't matter.
They can't communicate if they're unconscious.

130
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,609
Why'd you jump us?

131
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,571
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

132
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,031
It was the only way to get you here.

133
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,325
Why didn't you just tell us where you were?
You know we would have come.

134
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,784
Yeah, you and a special ops team.

135
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,827
No, no!

136
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,913
I know you think I'm crazy.

137
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,292
I brought you all here to show you that you're wrong.

138
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,629
I mean, do I look crazy?

139
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,382
Do I seem out of control?

140
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,093
Are we speaking in relative terms, or...

141
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,430
Look. Jace here has really fine tuned the enzyme.

142
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,975
We know how to administer it now and to regulate it.
Refine with it.

143
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,061
We've gotten so good we can even lace food with it.

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,483
Excuse me?

145
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,151
Congratulations.

146
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,237
You've just had your first dose.

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,696
What?

148
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,284
I thought long and hard about how
to show you that the enzyme was safe.

149
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,872
To convince you that it was the first step
to defeating the Wraith.

150
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,290
So you could convince Weir.

151
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,376
- Convince the military.
- Are you out of your mind?

152
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,294
- Hey! Settle down, McKay!
- No I will not settle down!

153
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,380
I have been drugged against my will,
you little punk!

154
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,048
You should not have done this Aiden!

155
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,716
Be as mad as you want.

156
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,177
Couple of days, you'll be thanking me.

157
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,096
We'll all have a good laugh about this.
Now eat up.

158
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,101
I'm itchy. I'm itchy all over.

159
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,603
This is exactly what happened
when I toked pot once in college.

160
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,480
Everyone stay put.

161
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,191
Let him go.

162
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:29,945
Ford!

163
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:31,822
Look.

164
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,533
I know what you're trying to do. I get it, I do.

165
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,618
But you're going about his all wrong.

166
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,746
Weir isn't going to listen to us
if we're all hopped up on the enzyme.

167
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,206
Your food was clean.

168
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,586
Why?
Why me?

169
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,088
You're gonna be the witness.

170
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,510
You're gonna be the one to tell Weir,
that her most trusted team has taken
the enzyme and is better because of it.

171
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,179
Look buddy.

172
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,932
Why don't you come back with us.
Have Beckett look you over?

173
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,809
- That's the best proof.
- No.

174
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,520
No, I've thought this through.

175
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,771
This is the plan.

176
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,194
- Look, I don't know what you're thinking...
- You're free to roam around as much as you want.

177
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,156
You're all a part of the team, now.

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,333
OK.
So why aren't these guys watching us?

179
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,417
Ronon is right.

180
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,337
They went to great trouble to get us here.
Why would they allow us to leave?

181
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,796
Just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

182
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,465
Oh, that little bastard!

183
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,759
- There it goes.
- See, this is what I was afraid of.

184
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,593
What'd he do?

185
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,470
He's taken all the necessary control crystals.

186
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,347
Something I showed him how to do on a mission,
I might add!

187
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,598
Well, that's not good.

188
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,683
That is the understatement of the year.

189
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,101
Alright! See what you can do!

190
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,020
OK, why don't we just take them?

191
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,523
All we gotta do is get our hands on one stunner.
I can take them all.

192
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:52,110
Yeah, maybe, but if we mess it up, whatever trust
we might have been given, will disappear.

193
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,196
You wanna make them trust us?

194
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,908
We play it cool, we let 'em get comfortable.
They're bound to make a mistake.

195
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,618
And in the meantime?

196
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,286
We play along.

197
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,125
How are you guys feeling?

198
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,211
I didn't eat that much.
I feel fine.

199
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,965
Perhaps if we were able to fast, they would be
unable to administer the enzyme.

200
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,884
I doubt that.
I don't think they'd have a problem forcing us.

201
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,179
This thing is useless and I ate my face off.
And I can tell you, I can feel it working!

202
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,515
There's a good possibility that everything
you're feeling right now might be

203
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,267
- psychosomatic.
- Oh, is that right, Professor Science?

204
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,018
Is that your expert opinion?

205
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,061
Yes it is.

206
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,980
Well I can tell you, when they up the dosage,

207
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,899
the side effects will be very real
and very unpredictable.

208
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,819
<i>You're back early.</i>

209
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,322
Janev's kind of a closed society.

210
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,326
Very polite, very courteous, but completely
uninterested in having anything to do with us.

211
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,620
Well better that than hostile, I suppose.

212
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,290
Colonel Sheppard's team.

213
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,791
Three hours overdue.

214
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,251
It wouldn't be the first time.

215
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,502
Any radio contact?

216
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,379
None since they left.

217
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,673
Well, you know those guys.

218
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,967
What do I know about those guys?

219
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,138
Just that they tend to get all caught up
in whatever it is they're doing

220
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,640
and sometimes they don't check in.

221
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,309
They forget how much you worry.

222
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,228
We worry.

223
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,731
- Collectively, I mean.
- Yes we do.

224
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,442
Yeah, we do.

225
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,527
OK guys, looks like we're heading back out.

226
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,737
Thank you Major.

227
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,821
You're welcome.

228
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:24,286
Seriously! I'm getting... I'm getting... chills,
hot flashes, chills and hot flashes again and again.

229
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,537
None of you are feeling that?

230
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,624
The enzyme side effects are gonna be
the least of his concerns if he keeps this up.

231
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,125
I know. Just be patient.

232
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,793
Historically,
that hasn't been a strength for me.

233
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,628
I know!

234
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,713
Sheppard, Teyla!

235
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,718
Kanayo's running a mission offworld.
I want you to go with him.

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,511
Why?

237
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,803
We're running an op.

238
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,097
Time you might wanna see the men in action.

239
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,434
Sure!
Wherever you need us.

240
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,894
Just give us some weapons and...

241
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,395
<i>Nice try.</i>

242
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,689
No, you're gonna hang back and watch with Kanayo.

243
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,942
Don't worry, you won't be in any danger.

244
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,360
That's a load off my mind.

245
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,069
Good.

246
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,737
What about us?

247
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,366
Jace'll give you the grand tour.
Show you what we've done with the place.

248
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,242
How's that sound?

249
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,701
Oh, it sounds delightful.

250
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:09,748
Good, good. Then if Sheppard tries anything offworld,
you'll be nice and close for me to kill you both.

251
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,835
Can't think of a better way of spending the afternoon.

252
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,461
Move!

253
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,465
Looks like he's asking you to go.

254
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,580
Are those guards Genii?

255
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,914
Yes.

256
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,292
What exactly are we doing here?

257
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,377
The Genii have spies all over the galaxy.

258
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,631
For whatever reason, if one of them can't
make it back to the Genii homeworld,
their leaders have established safehouses.

259
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,634
When they need a place to unload on
gear or a place to hide, they come here.

260
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,510
That's useful.

261
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,305
Yeah, we've found it to be an excellent
source of information and supplies.

262
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,099
How did you find them in the first place?

263
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,685
I was a Genii spy.

264
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,274
If you're one of them,
why don't you just walk in there.

265
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,360
Well I used to, but eventually
they realised that I'd betrayed them.

266
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,362
I can see how they would.

267
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,364
We rely on raids now.

268
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,200
Why? What more do you guys want?

269
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,702
We don't have all the pieces we need for the Lt's plan.

270
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,331
Right. And which plan would that be, again?

271
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,583
All will be revealed when the time is right.

272
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,921
Well, good. I hate for things to be revealed too early.

273
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,551
<i>How are you powering these Genii computers?</i>

274
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,303
We stole a Talnoran generator.

275
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,931
They're a pain to keep serviced, but they do the job.

276
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,267
Actually, we just got
our hands on some Palation solar cells,

277
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,146
but I haven't been able to figure out how to
interface them yet. Have you used them before?

278
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,315
Can't say that I have.
What do you, what do you do here?

279
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,191
We study the Wraith.

280
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,984
Oh yeah? How's that going?

281
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,446
Some of our discoveries,
have been quite exciting, actually.

282
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,906
Like what?

283
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,826
Well for one, they seem to be territorial.

284
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,956
Very much so, it turns out.
They're not a united foe, like we once believed.

285
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:14,706
Really.

286
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,918
Yes, in fact I believe
they're fractioning even further.

287
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,505
Now, my understanding of
their language is fairly limited,

288
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:26,593
but they seem to be trying to establish a system
that would restrict intership communications.

289
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,263
What? Why would they stop
sharing information with each other.

290
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,349
Ford thinks it might have to do
with your friend's ability to read their minds.

291
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:37,145
If she taps into them, only one ship
would be compromised, not the whole fleet.

292
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,772
What, all this because of Teyla?

293
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,401
Well for one, she may not be
the only one that possesses that ability.

294
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,444
Fair enough.

295
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:51,285
And two. I think that the lack
of food in the galaxy has created
some deep divisions within the Wraith cells.

296
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,705
And you got all that from...

297
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,039
this?

298
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,124
Yes.

299
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,711
To be honest, I could use some help.

300
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,129
How's your Wraith, Doctor?

301
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,508
It's OK. Let me see what you got.

302
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,107
That's better.

303
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,611
You guys still need to work together.

304
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,947
We're stronger as a team.

305
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,785
You wanna spar a little?

306
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,958
We're cool, right?

307
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,836
You're not holding a grudge or anything.

308
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,048
I did save your life.

309
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,509
I remember.

310
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,136
You know, it's funny.

311
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,932
If you ask a dozen people who they thought
would win in a fight between you and me,

312
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,478
people would choose you, hands down.
Hell, I'd choose you.

313
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,939
But we went toe to toe.

314
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah, we did.

315
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,275
Till Sheppard showed up.

316
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,278
So I guess it's still undecided.

317
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,824
Look, all I'm saying is,
why do you think I was able to fight you like that?

318
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,576
It's the enzyme.

319
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,204
Look what it did for me.

320
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,165
Imagine what it could do for you.

321
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,795
I'm not the bad guy here, Ronon.
I'm just trying to help.

322
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,718
You'll come around.
I know you will.

323
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,852
We've just finished our scans, Ma'am.
They're not here.

324
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,854
Do you think they've headed to another planet?

325
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:47,442
It's possible, but as you know,
it's standard procedure to check in and tell us first.
They didn't do that, so...

326
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:50,237
They might have been taken offworld against their will.

327
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,697
Yeah.

328
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,244
Alright. Can you get me
the last few addresses dialled from that DHD?

329
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,291
Maybe somebody can,
but that's a little out of my skill set.

330
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:04,168
I'll send Zelenka.

331
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,004
Good call. Lorne out.

332
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,552
So, what's the plan?

333
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,220
We take them by force.

334
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,431
That's some ground-breaking strategy there.

335
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,893
I think the Colonel is interested
in the type of attack.

336
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,103
We plan to overpower them.

337
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,398
I think it's best if we just watch.

338
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,280
Now.

339
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,373
What kind of plan is that?

340
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,374
One that works.

341
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,959
One of your men got hit.

342
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,338
Well it should be safe for us now.

343
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,553
This guy's dead.

344
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,972
So you see, you are not invincible.

345
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,766
We're close enough.

346
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,893
There are skills to the art of war, Kanayo.

347
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:06,730
Don't you tell me how to run my missions.
You're just here to watch.

348
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,782
Look familiar?

349
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,492
It's our C4.

350
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,077
We're stealing it back.

351
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,036
For what purpose?

352
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,788
For the Hive.

353
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,498
As in hive ship?

354
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,209
Yeah. That's the Lt's plan.

355
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,672
You're gonna help us destroy a Wraith hive ship.

356
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,262
One of the added bonuses
of killing the Wraith is,

357
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:42,474
every now and again you get
your hands on a couple of these.

358
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,853
Now thanks to Jace and some of the
computers that we borrowed from the Genii,

359
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,314
we've been able to figure out the
exact flight path of one of their hive ships.

360
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,693
It's decimating all inhabited worlds in it's path.

361
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,403
It has to be stopped.

362
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,949
I've been able to calculate that in the next several
days it'll be forced to make a hyperspace pause,

363
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,909
<i>very near an unihabited planet.</i>

364
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,744
that happens to have a stargate.

365
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:07,291
We gate to that planet, get on a hive ship,
plant the C4 in the Dart Bay and get out.

366
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,919
<i>We could save thousands, if not,</i>
<i>hundreds of thousands of lives.</i>

367
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:13,839
So?

368
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,014
You heard me.

369
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:27,728
Let me see if I can couch what Colonel Sheppard
means by wow, in more explicit terms.

370
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,313
That is a terrible plan.

371
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:29,855
Rodney.

372
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,357
Made all the more frightening by the
fact that you think it's a good plan.

373
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,442
What's wrong with it?

374
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,736
What's right with it?
Look, let's just for a second,

375
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:41,283
give in to reckless abandon and assume
it would be possible to plant a single charge,
large enough to destroy an entire hive ship.

376
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,161
We're planning on secondary explosions in the Dart Bay.

377
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,287
Regardless!

378
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,956
The hive ship will be on a hyperspace pause, yes,

379
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,710
but it will not enter the planet's atmosphere.
Nor will it take up any sort of stable orbit.

380
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,420
It will be flying through space.

381
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,131
Which means, that unless your enzyme allows you
to jump higher than you've let on...

382
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,591
We've a space ship.

383
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,927
Oh yeah? Really.

384
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,971
And what's it made out of? Bark?

385
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,265
No, it's real, McKay.

386
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:10,437
In fact, it's the only ship I'd feel
comfortable using on a mission like this.

387
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,618
OK, where'd you get it?

388
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,911
Does it matter?

389
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,955
None of us has had much success flying it.

390
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,999
Banged it up pretty bad in the last couple of landings.
It's in need of some repairs.

391
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,668
And a real pilot.

392
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,795
This is why you brought us here.

393
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,630
It's the reason I've waited till now, yes.

394
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,841
- Assuming this guy can get it working again.
<i>- He can.</i>

395
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,801
These people are the best at what they do.

396
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:44,096
Look, you fly, you scoop us up, you
take us to the Hive, you drop us off.

397
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,181
All we need, is time to lay the charge.

398
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,308
We'll be in and out of there before the
Wraith have any idea what's going on.

399
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,351
It's perfect.

400
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,894
It is far from perfect!

401
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,063
But, it is possible.

402
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,106
Colonel.

403
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,066
What? Are you honestly considering this?

404
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,026
It's on it's way to a culling, Rodney.

405
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,696
Yeah and I am sorry about that,
but this is insane!

406
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,406
Maybe not!

407
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:06,618
Jace has been trying to get it working,
but he's not you, McKay.

408
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:07,911
Can you fix it?

409
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:08,912
Probably not.

410
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,247
That usually means yes.

411
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,708
Aren't you the one, not taking the enzyme?

412
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,543
You're supposed to be the clear
voice of reason here.

413
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,170
Look, can you fix it?

414
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:21,383
Even if I could, I wouldn't. I'm sorry,
drug me all you want, I'm not doing this!

415
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,762
Let me talk to him. He'll come around

416
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,181
OK.

417
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:29,725
Rodney!

418
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:34,354
Look, maybe you are on the enzyme,
maybe Ford lied, because no rational
person would think that was a good plan.

419
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,232
Look, a million things could go wrong,
I know that, but just...

420
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,527
Look stop! Shut up and listen.

421
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:45,324
You fix that Dart, we all get outta here. I know
it's risky, but Ford's not thinking straight, so...

422
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,575
What are you talking about?

423
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,494
I'll insist you're all on the away team.

424
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:53,248
I'll scoop you up and instead of flying out
to the hive ship, we fly out to Atlantis.

425
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,541
How?

426
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,211
That Dart's gotta have it's own DHD, right?

427
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,253
Of course.

428
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,340
Well, you get that thing flight worthy, we all go home!

429
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,884
Right, of course!

430
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,263
You see, I would have thought of that myself,
before I became a drug addict.

431
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,057
I'm sure you would have.

432
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,518
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,521
Alright. OK.

434
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:18,649
<i>Damn it, this just doesn't work.</i>

435
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,525
That good?

436
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,945
These things are not designed to store Gate addresses.

437
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,112
What can you give us?

438
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,406
Well, every time the gate is dialled,

439
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,743
it's like a residual imprint
is left on the control crystals.

440
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,827
Which means?

441
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,748
Well, I've managed to mine
about fifty addresses, but

442
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,292
no idea if they're correct or
what order they were dialled in.

443
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,837
Fifty? That's a lot of planets to check.

444
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,048
Yes, And that's assuming that they're correct.

445
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,467
OK, so long story short?

446
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:50,931
It's going to be next to impossible
to find Colonel Sheppard and his team,
based on what I can get from this DHD.

447
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:55,352
Great. OK, pack it up. Let's take what you've got.
We'll go over it on Atlantis.

448
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,188
Weir's not gonna be happy about this.

449
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,109
How'd that go?

450
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:10,117
Well, he'll do it, but we need some conditions.

451
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,577
What?

452
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,954
Dial back McKay's enzyme doses.

453
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:14,705
No!

454
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,500
Look! We're under some time constraints here.
I'm not saying the enzyme wouldn't help.

455
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:23,380
I'm saying, we need him standing still and
thinking, not running laps because it feels good.

456
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,135
Ronon and Teyla?

457
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,678
Stick to the plan.

458
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,764
Fine, what else?

459
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,894
I'll fly it, that's obvious, but I want
McKay, Teyla and Ronon on the strike team.

460
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,979
It's not a good mission for McKay.

461
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,439
<i>- It could get rough in there.</i>
<i>- Look,</i>

462
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,776
suddenly we need a door opened, or a
computer hacked. McKay should be there to do it.

463
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,820
That's why he's on my team in the first place.

464
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,575
Is that it?

465
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:07,549
No.

466
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,954
No. You fire it up now, it'll only explode.

467
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,584
OK.

468
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,428
We're close.

469
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,604
It's a good plan.

470
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:46,231
I couldn't have done it without you, Sir.

471
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,692
Well, I'm glad you trust me enough to bring me here.

472
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,532
What's wrong?

473
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,661
I wanna go home.

474
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,418
Let's go.

475
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:10,172
<i>Give McKay the DHD</i>
<i>crystals and let's get outta here.</i>

476
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,716
I can have you back on Earth within an hour.

477
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,385
No.

478
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,096
<i>We have to do this first.</i>

479
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,433
I have to prove to them that we can do this.

480
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,269
You don't have to prove anything to anyone, Lieutenant.

481
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:37,407
I saw your cousin and your Grandparents,
when I was back to Earth.

482
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,912
They miss you.
A lot!

483
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,918
This whole MIA thing is killing them.

484
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,211
They're strong.

485
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,630
They can wait.

486
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,760
If anyone's ever going
to take me seriously ever again,

487
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,595
we have to do this.

488
00:27:58,637 --> 00:27:59,680
Listen, Aiden...

489
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,639
No.

490
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,143
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna talk about this.

491
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:15,320
Well, part of me thinks he brought us
here cos he knew we'd bring him back.

492
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:21,159
I think subconsciously, he knows what
are plan is and he's fine with it.

493
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,043
Give it back!

494
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,380
Or what?

495
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,821
Come on guys. Guys! Stop!

496
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,204
What the hell's gotten into you two?

497
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:11,126
Oh, right. Never mind.

498
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,672
We need to talk about this?

499
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,466
About what?

500
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:18,509
<i>The enzyme works.</i>

501
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,844
No-one's saying it,
but we're all thinking it.

502
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,471
It works.

503
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,600
I must admit, I have noticed
an increased amount of strength.

504
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,394
Maybe Ford is right.

505
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,314
Maybe it's worth looking into seeing
what this stuff can do.

506
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:38,111
They were an hour late in delivering
our doses yesterday and I felt awful.

507
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:43,033
It frightens me how reliant my body has become
on the enzyme always being in my system.

508
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,786
What would happen if we
suddenly could not receive it?

509
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,539
The only negative is that
you gotta keep taking it.

510
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,582
I'd wanna stay on it.

511
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,167
How about you?

512
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:56,004
The fact that I'm even
considering it, makes me feel...

513
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,675
So?

514
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,636
It's ready.

515
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:10,060
OK, now... Could you move?

516
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:13,063
Look, this is probably gonna
make you a little uneasy, but

517
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:15,524
when the canopy forms, it's perfectly opaque.

518
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,734
Then, how am I gonna fly this thing?

519
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:21,196
The whole thing is one giant heads up display. It'll
show you all the pertinent information that you need.

520
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,197
Yeah, you mean in Wraith!

521
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,826
Which is why I've installed an interface
to translate a lot of the readouts.

522
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:28,579
And by a lot, you mean all? Because
my Wraith's not all that good.

523
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,580
Enough to get you by.

524
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:30,831
I knew you could do it.

525
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,416
<i>Right on time.</i>

526
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:35,169
Kanayo's gonna get you suited up.
You should get ready.

527
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,003
Right.

528
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,598
Seems a little nervous.

529
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,601
You know McKay. He'll be fine.

530
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,436
You know how to dial the DHD on this thing?

531
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:53,729
The address is memorised.

532
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,856
Good.

533
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,276
<i>Listen, I should probably tell you,</i>

534
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,528
there's been a slight change of plans.

535
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,030
Oh yeah?

536
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,406
Kanayo!

537
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,744
Don't even think about it!

538
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,543
What the hell you doing?

539
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,921
McKay's going to stay here,
while we do the op.

540
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:19,963
Take him!

541
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:24,176
This wasn't part of the plan.

542
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,677
Neither was you heading back to Atlantis.

543
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,391
You didn't really buy the whole
'I wanna go home' speech, did you?

544
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,444
Always underestimating me Sheppard.
You need to stop doing that.

545
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,696
Complete the mission and McKay lives.

546
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,824
We can't complete the mission, Ford.
It's a bad plan!

547
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,493
You said it was a great plan.

548
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,329
You didn't buy the whole
'It's a great plan' speech, did you?

549
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,083
Get this Dart in the air and come scoop us up.

550
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:03,423
And the Dart DHD only dials to the
planet we're going to and back here.

551
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,426
Just in case McKay's life isn't enough
to get you to do the right thing.

552
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,931
Aiden.
What are you doing?

553
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,559
Just making sure you guys
hold up your end of the bargain.

554
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,145
It's OK, give them back their weapons.

555
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,565
Are you sure?

556
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,985
Yeah. If we're gonna do this,
we all gotta work together.

557
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,166
Good luck to us all.

558
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,343
Stand by for pick-up

559
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,990
If they were OK, they would have radioed in by now.

560
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,783
I understand that, ma'am.

561
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,623
I want everyone who is cleared for offworld
activity, to help with the search.

562
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,919
The Daedalus is on its way from Earth and they'll be
able to help, but until they get here, it's up to us.

563
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,675
And I know that, but I need you to understand
that it is gonna take a very long time to
search all the planets on our list.

564
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:31,178
It could take months.

565
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,264
We can't afford months. Major.

566
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,600
And I know that, too.

567
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,019
Good.

568
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,121
This is gonna take some getting used to.

569
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:08,715
Come on! And we were getting along so well.

570
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,553
Auto Pilot. NO!

571
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,977
R2, I need you to turn
the auto pilot off!

572
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,270
Now!

573
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,693
Worth a try.

574
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,731
Jace!

575
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,403
We have to go after them!

576
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,280
No-one would have survived that fall.

577
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,408
We have to get out of the open.

578
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,122
You guys OK?

579
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,458
<i>No, we're not OK!</i>

580
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,044
You beamed half
of us off the edge of the platform.

581
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,213
Teyla and Ronon?

582
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,173
Is that all you care about?
You murdered my men!

583
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:34,510
I've lost all control of the Dart.
I had to release you blind.

584
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,095
Maintain radio silence until we lay the charge.

585
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,680
Negative! We need to stay in contact.

586
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:39,556
<i>Their ship...</i>

587
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,558
You should leave that radio on, Aiden.

588
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,809
Don't tell me what to do.

589
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,321
Ford.

590
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,323
Ford?

591
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,574
Ford!

592
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:58,450
Damnit!

593
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,955
I'd prefer not to.

594
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,584
Oh boy!

595
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,423
Would you mind checking tomorrow?

596
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:19,721
This is not good.

597
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:24,977
What is that?

598
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,353
It's an alarm.

599
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:27,938
That shouldn't happen.

600
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,981
No it shouldn't.

601
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:31,900
Sheppard, you there?

602
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,946
<i>Sheppard, you there?</i>

603
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,656
I think I might have set the alarm off.

604
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,200
You guys be careful,
cos there's probably some guards on the way.

605
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,494
Too late.

606
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:45,372
If you wanna live, stay behind me.

607
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,049
You want some?

608
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,384
No, I'm good, thanks.

609
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:58,510
- You sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

610
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,596
Look, don't you
think that they should be back by now?

611
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,764
I mean, how long does it take to
fly there and fly back, you know? I mean

612
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:06,059
I say it's a minute from here to the gate.

613
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,604
Ten, tops from their gate to the hive ship.

614
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:13,734
Twenty to get in and lay a charge and and what,
ten more to get back out and home, right? So...

615
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,152
Worrying really isn't going to do anything.

616
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,570
Yeah well, I subscribe to a
different school of thought.

617
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,531
- They're fine!
- You can't possibly know that!

618
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,912
- I got a gut feeling.
- Yeah, well I have a different gut...

619
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,584
feeling.

620
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:34,838
Ford!

621
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,215
What's your position?

622
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,384
Ford!

623
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,612
Ah, dammit!

624
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,558
Keep fighting!

625
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,418
And thanks to several modifications,
the specifics of which are encrypted in this databurst,

626
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:59,965
we believe we can streamline
our power consumption a further 30%.

627
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,681
Also at the time of this transmission,

628
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,517
Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing and is

629
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,603
is presumed...

630
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,816
Colonel Sheppard's team is still missing.
End transmission.

631
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,366
Are you alright?

632
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,244
I'm in a holding cell?

633
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:30,913
Yes.

634
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,207
On a hive ship.

635
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,377
Well then, no, I'm not doing so good!

636
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,463
I can't believe you screwed up!

637
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,256
I did what?

638
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,842
You set off the alarm.
You ruined the mission.

639
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,721
The Dart went on auto-pilot,
the second I got close to the hive.

640
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,932
You're lucky I was able to get you out!

641
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,308
Why would it do that?

642
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,976
Why would it go on auto-pilot?

643
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,479
That's what Jumpers do
when they gate to Atlantis.

644
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,189
Well, why didn't you say something?

645
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,982
Why didn't I say something?

646
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:01,360
You want me to fail.

647
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,863
<i>- You want me to look bad.</i>
<i>- That's right, you snot nosed brat!</i>

648
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:08,408
I put my team's life on the line,
just to prove you wrong!

649
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:11,036
We got company.

650
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,048
Move away.

651
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,133
What do you want?

652
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:30,097
The one who flew the ship.

653
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,559
Why don't you start with me?

654
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,855
<i>Wait!</i>

655
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,065
You want me.

656
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,877
It's alright.

657
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,045
There's always a way out.

658
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,047
If he dies,

659
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:05,799
you die.
