1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,920
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,257
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,967
- Do we have that much time, Sheppard?
- No

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,471
<i>You do realize that long-term exposure</i>
<i>to these levels of radiation is extremely dangerous?</i>

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,973
Our scientists tell me otherwise.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,935
<i>- How many of these ships do you have?</i>
<i>- Just the one.</i>

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,940
<i>Commander Augustus Kolya.</i>

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,816
We are in control of Atlantis.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,945
Sheppard has just disabled another generator.

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,780
Yes, Ladon, I'm aware of that!

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>Reinforcements are arriving now, commander.</i>

12
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>We already have serious flooding</i>
<i>in the north and west piers.</i>

13
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,873
Oh, it's no use! The City conduits just
can't handle this kind of raw power.

14
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,875
I think I know where we can get another nuke.

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,628
Major, I don't know how sympathetic
the Genii will be to our situation.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,548
You heard our message.
The Wraith are at our doorstep.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,884
We have an opportunity for you to test your weapon.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>This is Weir.</i>

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
I've got the prototypes.

20
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,354
<i>How much further?</i>

21
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,398
Just around this next corner.

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,900
When was the last time you had any contact with them?

23
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,653
They came under fire about half an hour ago.

24
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,948
The major told me to head
to the Gate and radio for backup.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,408
I haven't heard from them since.

26
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,743
They were under fire
and you didn't head back to help?

27
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,454
Major Lorne told me to stay by the Gate.

28
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,706
You did the right thing.

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,171
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,716
Is that the building you were in?

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,844
Shouldn't there be villagers?
Why aren't they trying to put out the fire?

32
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,096
The fire's out. That's just steam and smoke.

33
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,390
Let's take a look. You stay here with Lindsay.

34
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,683
Right. Sure.

35
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:44,479
Oh, and hey, if you hear gunfire, just know that
that's me holding back our attackers all on my own?

36
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,638
<i>A fire like this would have burned the whole</i>
<i>village if someone had not dealt with it.</i>

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,766
<i>Somebody put it out. They just didn't</i>
<i>want to stick around and talk about it.</i>

38
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,312
It's not safe to be up here.

39
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,605
Thanks for that.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,828
I got something.

41
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,176
Damn it.

42
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,678
<i>What?</i>

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,351
Dog tags.

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,982
These are Lorne's.

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,665
What the hell happened out there?

46
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:32,087
As you know, Lorne and his team have
the weekly detail of escorting Dr. Lindsay to 177.

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,841
Yes, the one who's educating the people
on more effective agricultural and fishing methods.

48
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,092
Yeah, that's right.

49
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,012
Things were going along smoothly
until our guys were attacked.

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,263
Just like that, out of the blue?

51
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,514
It seems that way.

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,224
By who, the villagers?

53
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,225
I don't know.

54
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,979
Lindsay's not a real useful source of
information right now. She's a little shook up.

55
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,733
Beckett gave her a sedative.
Hopefully she'll be able to give us more info later.

56
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,776
Unscheduled offworld activation.

57
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,577
What have you got?

58
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,706
No IDC, but we are receiving a pretty
weak transmission on the VHF band.

59
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,999
Audio and video.

60
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,250
Let's see it.

61
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,213
Atlantis base, this is Ladon Radim.

62
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,048
<i>Are you receiving transmission?</i>

63
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,341
He's one of Kolya's men.

64
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,635
Yeah, I know who he is. We can't answer this, though.

65
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,971
I need the Genii, of all people,
to believe that Atlantis has been destroyed.

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,306
Well, I know we got the word out.

67
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:30,646
My men have witnessed your teams dialing and returning
through the Stargate to Atlantis more than once.

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,484
Now, from that, I can deduce that the rumors
of your City's demise are greatly exaggerated.

69
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,195
- Sneaky. I'll give them that.
<i>- Your secret is safe,</i>

70
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,906
as long as you respond to this transmission.

71
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,617
Open a channel.

72
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,662
<i>Atlantis base, this is Ladon Radim.</i>

73
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,622
We hear you. This is Weir.

74
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,874
Dr. Weir...

75
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,461
I was beginning to fear the rumors
of your destruction were true.

76
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,671
What do you want?

77
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,172
I have something to trade.

78
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>Don't think I don't recognize you, Ladon.</i>

79
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,552
You're a member of Kolya's strike force.

80
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,471
You tried to forcibly take this City from us.

81
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>Why would we want to do business with you?</i>

82
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,268
Because I have defected from the Genii.

83
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,144
Well, good luck with that.

84
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,941
And I have a Zero Point Module.

85
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,951
And I have a tentative truce with the Genii
that I'm not very eager to jeopardize.

86
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,036
The Genii got what they wanted.

87
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,330
They want no more from you...

88
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,041
and this is of no use to me...

89
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,838
But I know how important these devices
are to your continued survival.

90
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,923
<i>Now, we can discuss this in person.</i>

91
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Lower your shields and allow me</i>
<i>safe passage into the City.</i>

92
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,014
We're not interested, Ladon.

93
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,104
This is far, far better than the last trade
you made with the Genii, Doctor,

94
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,564
<i>and you know it.</i>

95
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,109
<i>I'm transmitting the Gate address to the planet I'm on.</i>

96
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,612
You can send a team to search me if you wish,

97
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,697
but I am unarmed and alone.

98
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,574
<i>I'll be here for two hours.</i>

99
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:11,205
If I don't hear from you within that time,
this Zero Point Module will be lost to you forever.

100
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,333
The choice is yours.

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,937

104
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,615
A ZedPM is a ZedPM.
Who cares where it comes from?

105
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,868
<i>- We've already got one.</i>
- Yes, one.

106
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,495
- Two is better than one.
<i>- And three is better than two. Look,</i>

107
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,456
we all know that eventually the Wraith
are going to discover we're still here.

108
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,001
Having more power means that we have more options.

109
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,712
We might even be able to light up
the engines and get the City to fly.

110
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,631
Really?

111
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,717
No...
but we still need it.

112
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,219
Well, flying City or not,

113
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,096
I think we should consider this.

114
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,851
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you the one
the Genii threatened to kill on two separate occasions?

115
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,853
He says he's alone,
and he's willing to be searched.

116
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,564
Wait a minute.
We should be dealing with Lorne and his team,

117
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,774
<i>find out what happened to them.</i>

118
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,779
Teyla and Ronon will continue with that investigation,

119
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,282
and you can join them once you finish up with this.

120
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,747
Alright, get a MALP ready with the lifesigns detector.

121
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,875
I'm not sending my team in there blind.

122
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,506
We're getting telemetry back from the MALP.

123
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,174
Only reading one lifesign.

124
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,885
- Then so far he's telling the truth.
- So far.

125
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:38,435
As I'm sure your machine has already
determined, I am unarmed and alone.

126
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,355
You can go ahead and send your team to search me.

127
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,192
Go ahead.

128
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,151
Yes, Sir.

129
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,327
They're peaceful people. They really are.

130
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,247
I just can't imagine the villagers
doing something like this.

131
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,498
Tell us what happened.

132
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,252
We were invited into one
of the villager's homes for tea,

133
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,380
a welcoming custom we've been
through a dozen or so times.

134
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,551
Dira, one of the villagers,
asked for a word with me in private.

135
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,053
- She took me downstairs...
- You went alone with her?

136
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,764
They're farmers and fishermen.

137
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,182
I've been dealing with them for months.

138
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,268
- I trusted them.
- Yeah, that was a mistake.

139
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,143
Ronon...

140
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,523
Go on.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,278
Once I was downstairs, I heard the first shots.

142
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
- They sounded like Wraith blasts...
- Wraith?

143
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:35,367
I can't be sure, but, yes,
that's what it sounded like.

144
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,538
<i>Major Lorne radioed me from upstairs</i>
<i>and told me to go to the Gate and</i>

145
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:40,998
call for backup.

146
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,960
The rest you know.

147
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,088
Did this, Dira try to stop you?

148
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,756
No.

149
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,467
Did she look surprised when she heard the shots?

150
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,928
I don't remember.

151
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,722
Can you think of any reason,

152
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,018
any reason at all, that the people of this village
would want to attack Lorne and his men?

153
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,312
No.

154
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,363
He's clean, Sir.

155
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,451
What, no ZPM?

156
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,663
I sent it to another planet for safekeeping.
How stupid do you think I am?

157
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:26,251
From what I remember, I gave you a pretty
good crack on the head last time we met.

158
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,545
I guess I was kind of hoping it made you simple.

159
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,172
No, it didn't,

160
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,508
but ever since then,
I've been plagued with headaches.

161
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,177
You're just saying that to be nice.

162
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,470
What do you want for it?

163
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,138
I'll only talk with Weir.

164
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,973
Do I make you nervous?

165
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,683
Not at all, Major.

166
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,811
I'm just not interested in talking to the errand boy.

167
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,025
That's lieutenant colonel errand boy to you.

168
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,837
It's not them.

169
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,339
What do you mean?

170
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,842
These bodies you found are not Lorne and his men.

171
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,178
But they were wearing their dog tags.

172
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,806
I don't know what to tell you.
I've run the DNA test three times now.

173
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,183
- Then Lorne and his men could still be alive?
- Aye.

174
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,019
Dr. Lindsay heard Wraith stunners
before the fire broke out.

175
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,566
- But this wasn't a Wraith attack, so...
- So whoever it was wanted us to think they were dead.

176
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,733
But who?

177
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,986
What could they possibly want with Lorne?

178
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,279
We need to go back,

179
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,738
question the villagers.

180
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,658
Okay,
but regular radio contact, please.

181
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,995
<i>Dr. Weir, we have Ladon.</i>

182
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,454
What has he said?

183
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,706
<i>Not much.</i>

184
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>Apparently he doesn't like me.</i>

185
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,834
Okay, take him to my office.

186
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,919
<i>Your office? Really?</i>

187
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,213
Really, Colonel. I'm on my way.

188
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,758
You two be careful.

189
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,603
Dr. Weir, thank you for your warm...

190
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,479
What do you want for the ZPM?

191
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,024
You people aren't much for small talk, are you?

192
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,817
Not with criminals, no.

193
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,570
As a member of Kolya's strike team,
I was following orders.

194
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,072
I harbor no ill will towards you or your people.

195
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,115
That's nice.

196
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,201
It's the truth.

197
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,703
What do you want for it?

198
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:31,126
I need about a hundred machine guns, a couple
dozen grenades, and any C4 that you have to spare.

199
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,836
Sounds like you're having a party.

200
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,798
Explain... how is turning you into
a threat in our best interest?

201
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,467
The real threat are the Genii.

202
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,429
Their nuclear weapons are fully operational,
and it's my considered belief

203
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,183
that they will soon begin using them
as a first-strike offensive weapon,

204
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,311
not just against the Wraith,
but human populations as well.

205
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,772
Now, you give me and my men the arms we need,

206
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,107
you'll never have to worry about the Genii again.

207
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,734
You're planning a coup.

208
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,278
Yes, and you're going to help me.

209
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,375
<i>Cowen has led our people for too long.</i>

210
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,336
Yes, it's true he's made the Genii
a force to be reckoned with,

211
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,881
but the Cowen of the past bears little
resemblance to the Cowen who's in power now.

212
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:18,882
How so?

213
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,344
He's become obsessed with uniting
the galaxy under a single ruler.

214
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,929
And that would be him?

215
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,015
He thinks it's the only chance
we have at defeating the Wraith.

216
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,560
Whether the galaxy likes it or not.

217
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:34,106
Commander Kolya was the only Genii who could
stand up to him, keep him under control.

218
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,024
He went missing several months ago.

219
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,361
We suspect Cowen had him murdered.

220
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,446
But you can't prove it?

221
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,323
Not yet.

222
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,826
And in Kolya's absence...

223
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,911
Our people were looking for leadership.

224
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,371
They looked to me.

225
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,665
Get to the part where you find the ZPM.

226
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,793
Kolya often spoke
about the Brotherhood of the Fifteen.

227
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,545
The last mission you encountered him, no?

228
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,173
The last time he tried to kill me, yes.

229
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:04,178
Finding resources for the resistance
has been next to impossible.

230
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,723
We have a few rifles, limited ammunition,

231
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,017
nowhere near enough to stage a rebellion.

232
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,311
So you thought if you found a ZPM,

233
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,979
we would give you everything you needed.

234
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,899
<i>It's very hard to find trading partners</i>
<i>who don't fear the Genii.</i>

235
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,193
Cowen has spies all over the galaxy.

236
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,738
I figured you'd be more than willing to help
if we could give you something of value.

237
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,240
How do we know
you'll be any better than Cowen?

238
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,951
Look, I know you don't trust me...

239
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:32,331
but if Cowen uses his new atomic
weapons to enslave other worlds,

240
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,625
then the Genii are no better than the Wraith,

241
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,127
and you can have your ZPM,

242
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,838
but you must help me stop that from happening.

243
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,848
Never heard of her.

244
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,517
Are you certain?

245
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,309
Dira.

246
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,853
She was friends with the men
who were killed last night.

247
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,606
I said I never heard of her.

248
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,904
This is a small community, friend.
Surely you know her.

249
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,323
She lived in the house that burned down.

250
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,867
We would just like
to ask her some questions.

251
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,495
I just tend to my bar

252
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,579
and my family.

253
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,208
I mind my business,
and I suggest you do the same.

254
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,880
We want to know why our friends were killed.

255
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:22,840
Ronon...

256
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,758
He knows something.

257
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,552
Everyone here knows something.

258
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,554
Let him go.

259
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,227
Who are you trying to protect?

260
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,565
If you knew what's best for you,
you'll both go back from where you came.

261
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,906
They're watching us.

262
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,118
They'll kill us all if you're not careful.

263
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,078
Who?

264
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,251
We can protect you, help you fight them.

265
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,378
No, you can't.

266
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,173
Leave me be.

267
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,112
Do you believe him?

268
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,866
Well, he has a ZPM.

269
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,534
No, I mean about the other stuff.

270
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,244
Evil Cowen.

271
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,373
He's lying about something.

272
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:44,796
When Cowen handed over two of his atomic
weapons to us, it was a sort of olive branch,

273
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,508
and I would hate to jeopardize what
little momentum we have going with them.

274
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,676
- Stick with the devil we know.
- Exactly.

275
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,930
So we give them the heads-up?

276
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,890
Tell the Genii he's planning something?

277
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,683
I think so.

278
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,936
I'll tell Ladon that

279
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,688
we need a bit more time and
to set up a way to contact him.

280
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,025
I left one of our best special ops
guys on the planet when we searched him.

281
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,152
If Ladon goes anywhere, my guy will find him.

282
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,070
Good thinking.

283
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,780
Could have been Mensa.

284
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:23,585
I hope Beckett found some sort of clue,
because this was a giant waste of time.

285
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,087
<i>Excuse me!</i>

286
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:26,964
You...

287
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,632
You left this behind.

288
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:29,842
It's not ours.

289
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,511
Yes, it is.

290
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,223
Of course.

291
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,016
How foolish of me.

292
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:38,976
Thank you.

293
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,604
What's inside?

294
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:43,689
Not here.

295
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,990
<i>You know, I'm not sure that you've</i>
<i>sufficiently trained me in actual combat.</i>

296
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,533
<i>I don't know how much use I'd be in a...</i>

297
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,954
<i>- fight-our-way-out kind of scenario.</i>
<i>- Well, I look at it this way...</i>

298
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:04,084
<i>The Genii have tried to kidnap you on numerous</i>
<i>occasions to mine that big old brain of yours.</i>

299
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:04,710
<i>Yes?</i>

300
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,130
Well, if we get into trouble, I'll
just trade your life for mine.

301
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,506
Oh. Funny.

302
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,049
Don't worry.

303
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,635
If you survive,
I'll mount some sort of rescue mission.

304
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,469
Eventually.

305
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,431
Dr. McKay.

306
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,310
Oh, and it's
lieutenant colonel Sheppard now, I hear.

307
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,312
Somebody's been paying attention.

308
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,318
I'm afraid I don't have much time, but,
please, tell me, what I can do for you?

309
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:35,073
We were just checking in, saying hi, since we really
haven't been in contact since the last culling.

310
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,367
We barely survived the last culling.

311
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,413
<i>I can't help but think how close</i>
<i>to extinction we came as a people.</i>

312
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:46,251
Our former ambitions have been
tempered by the real world, I'm afraid.

313
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,714
We've been busy trying to fulfill
our people's most basic needs.

314
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,717
You know, we could help with that.

315
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,429
You know, with supplies, even manpower.

316
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,097
And why would you do that?

317
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,809
Well, we probably wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for the nukes you gave us, so...

318
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,436
We owe you one.

319
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,814
We are a proud people, Sheppard,

320
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,734
but we do know
how to accept help when we need it.

321
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,361
On that note,

322
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,741
we've been contacted by a Genii named Ladon.

323
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,037
At last, the real reason why you're here.

324
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,914
What has he been saying?

325
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,999
Oh, it was something about,

326
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,962
conquests of other worlds using your atomic weapons.

327
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,383
He's been telling the Manarians that I've
been slaughtering our own people for food.

328
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,596
Ladon blames me for Kolya's disappearance,

329
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:44,434
<i>and while, yes, it's true I</i>
<i>neither respected nor liked the man,</i>

330
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,312
I had nothing to do with his presumed demise.

331
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,315
Anything he tells you is a lie.

332
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,484
He's trying to mount a rebellion.

333
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,986
Let him try.

334
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,949
He commands a couple of dozen men
and has no weapons to speak of.

335
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:02,870
Believe me, the city's plumbing is
of more concern to me right now.

336
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,999
But still, you didn't have to tell me.

337
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:11,086
Apprising me of Ladon's plans was the act of a friend.

338
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,756
Well, if you... want to contact
us, we have a new number.

339
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,303
I've known for some time that Atlantis
survived the Wraith attack, Colonel Sheppard.

340
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,306
<i>I hope you'll accept it as an act of good faith</i>

341
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,516
that your secret is safe with the Genii.

342
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,816
My men will see you to the Gate.

343
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,615
That was refreshing.

344
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,909
He didn't try to kill us even once.

345
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,377
<i>My special ops guys followed Ladon to M6R-867.</i>

346
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,464
Looks like he's occupied a warehouse
in a bombed-out, abandoned city.

347
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,050
It was most likely destroyed by
the Wraith and never reinhabited.

348
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,970
We did a quick fly-over in a cloaked Jumper and sure
enough, there are about 20 lifesigns in the building.

349
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,680
20 lifesigns on the whole planet, actually.

350
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,265
So Cowen's intel was accurate.

351
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,808
Yeah, it appears that way, yes.

352
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,438
- Even if these men
are highly trained and armed to the teeth...
- Which, most probably, they are not.

353
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,398
they're no match for our guys.

354
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:14,691
A raid?

355
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,776
Oh yes, a raid.

356
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,279
If this is their main base of operations,
I'm willing to bet the ZPM is there.

357
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,531
And, what, just steal it?

358
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,409
Well, the brotherhood stole it from us.
Ladon stole it from the brotherhood.
It's not really stealing. It's...

359
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,369
Recovery.

360
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:29,998
Look, we tell Ladon we're ready to do
business, he needs to send a dozen
guys here to help carry back supplies.

361
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,083
Along with the ZedPM.

362
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,584
He won't do that, but sure, we can ask.

363
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:37,214
When they get here, we detain them,
leaving eight men in the building for
two small strike teams to deal with.

364
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,634
Okay, it's worth the risk.

365
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,969
Go get us a ZPM.

366
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,028
What is it?

367
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:01,780
I do not know.

368
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,326
<i>These are pictures of some of the</i>
<i>Atlantis offworld team members.</i>

369
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,251
- There.
<i>- Major Lorne.</i>

370
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,461
Why would the villagers have these?

371
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,924
The writing on the side here is in a
bunch of different languages,

372
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,677
offering a great reward for their capture.

373
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,054
I bet they've been circulated to dozens of planets.

374
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,558
I hope you are wrong.

375
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,698
<i>Offworld activation!</i>

376
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,248
Everybody, relax.

377
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,876
We don't want to tip them
before they're all in position.

378
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:12,851
Dr. Weir?

379
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,727
That's right.

380
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,604
<i>I am Dahlia Radim.</i>

381
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:16,772
Radim?

382
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,149
Yes, I am Ladon's sister.

383
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,526
Where are our supplies?

384
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,654
Where is our ZPM?

385
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,491
Ladon will send it through once
we have returned to our world safely.

386
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,243
I thought you might say that.

387
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:32,955
What's going on?

388
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,207
I'm sorry, but you're being temporarily detained.

389
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,333
Colonel?

390
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,167
Go ahead.

391
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,502
<i>You have a go.</i>

392
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:39,378
Understood.

393
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:45,551
All right, use non lethal force wherever possible, so
the men with stunners, take the point. That being said,

394
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,595
if they engage us, do what you need to do.

395
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:26,800
Clear!

396
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,179
Start doing a room sweep.
You three with me. We're finding Ladon.

397
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,014
Did you see me almost stun that guy?

398
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,682
I must have missed it.

399
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,059
Yeah, but if he was, like a step to the right,
I would have stunned him for sure.

400
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:36,727
Good for you.

401
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,937
It's... this way.

402
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,237
How did it go?

403
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,363
What did we miss?

404
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,740
We have some guests.

405
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:50,908
Yeah, I can see that.

406
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,076
Dr. Weir, there is something you need to see.

407
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,536
Let's go to my office.

408
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,539
<i>- What's all this?</i>
<i>- It's a wanted list.</i>

409
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,210
We figure it's on as many worlds as
there are languages on the photos.

410
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,004
Who would do that?

411
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:08,383
We are not sure, but the planet where
Lorne's team disappeared is quite poor.

412
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,596
It is conceivable they gave up Lorne
and his men for some sort of reward.

413
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,389
To who?

414
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,099
And why aren't we on it?

415
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,267
Excuse me?

416
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:18,810
Sheppard's on the list.

417
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,562
McKay is on the list.

418
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,189
Why aren't Teyla and me?

419
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,649
What, you're feeling left out?

420
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,402
I just want to know who thinks I'm not a threat
and give them a chance to change their mind.

421
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,658
The gene. They all have the gene.

422
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,952
- The gene of the Ancestors?
- Yes.

423
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,913
Naturally or not, all these
men possess the A.T.A. Gene.

424
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:42,876
But why would someone want people simply
because they possess a certain kind of gene?

425
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,296
Maybe they think
it will hurt our ability to operate the City.

426
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,632
But Ronon, that's why you're not here.

427
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,136
See, most of Edison's team is
on the list, except Toriel.

428
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,181
He's the only one on that team
that doesn't have the gene.

429
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,891
It still doesn't make any sense.

430
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,687
I suggest you call these men
back if they are offworld.

431
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,646
Yes.

432
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,775
Most of these guys are on
an operation with Sheppard right now.

433
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:12,447
We are raiding Ladon's warehouse
and stealing back the ZPM.

434
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,993
<i>We detained most of his team when they came</i>
<i>here to pick up the weapons we offered them.</i>

435
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,578
Once Sheppard and the team get back,

436
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,415
I will suspend all of their offworld activity
until we can get to the bottom of this.

437
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,376
<i>Dr. Weir, please report to the infirmary.</i>

438
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,503
On my way, Carson.

439
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,923
This is probably about the bodies.
You two should come along.

440
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:50,861
One tango.

441
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,446
Middle of the room.

442
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,576
What? Isn't that right?

443
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,228
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

444
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,563
What a surprise.

445
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,232
Drop it.

446
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:30,901
Alright.

447
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,237
Feel safer?

448
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,404
A little bit.

449
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:36,657
Is that it?

450
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:38,617
It is.

451
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,244
Slide it over.

452
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,794
It could be booby-trapped to blow up in your face.

453
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,045
<i>Relax, Sheppard.</i>

454
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,089
I have no interest in killing you.

455
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:07,855
It's all yours.

456
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,314
One ZPM.

457
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:22,035
One that's probably been out
of power for a thousand years.

458
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,750
Oh, that's gas.

459
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,217
Don't worry. It's not going to kill you either.

460
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:41,930
I think I know who's behind this.

461
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:42,598
Okay.

462
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,309
Whoever these bodies belong to,
they didn't die in that fire.

463
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:46,768
They died before they were burned?

464
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,897
Aye, mostly from internal bleeding
and the breakdown of the bone marrow.

465
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,190
What does that mean?

466
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,277
That means they probably died
of severe radiation poisoning.

467
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:56,653
Now, from what I know,

468
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,197
there's only one race of people

469
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,575
that could possibly be exposed to the amount of
radiation that would cause this kind of damage.

470
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,827
- The Genii.
- Aye, exactly.

471
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,454
If the Genii are behind this...

472
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,372
We need to call back Sheppard's team.

473
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:17,925
How do you feel?

474
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,888
Like I've been gassed.

475
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,934
How come it didn't affect you?

476
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,520
I was injected with what I just gave you.

477
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:33,815
Where are my men?

478
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,903
Oh, they'll wake up in an hour or so
with a pretty big headache. But they're fine,

479
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,946
just like you.

480
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,533
I'm a lot of things right now,
but fine isn't one of them.

481
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,869
I stumbled across the dead ZPM in our archives.

482
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:50,666
One of our operatives found it hundreds of years
ago, didn't know what it was, filed it away.

483
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,877
I'm sure he had no idea how
valuable it would eventually be.

484
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,046
So that was your plan?

485
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:01,385
Lure us here, take our weapons,
trade us for some more,

486
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,512
arm your rebellion. Is that about it?

487
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,014
Couldn't be more wrong.

488
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,101
There is no rebellion, Colonel Sheppard.

489
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:14,940
Ladon here has only the best
interests of the Genii at heart.

490
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,989
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

491
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,997
What have we got?

492
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,874
Not sure yet, ma'am.

493
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,834
I'm not reading an IDC.

494
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,213
What the hell is going on here?

495
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,674
I want to talk with Dr. Weir.

496
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,467
The Gate has to be active.

497
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,136
<i>It already is.</i>

498
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,762
Oh. Well...

499
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,479
Dr. Weir, this is commander Cowen,
leader of the Genii.

500
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,565
Where is colonel Sheppard?

501
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,192
<i>Well, he's right here with me,</i>

502
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:02,863
along with the men you
sent to storm this complex.

503
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,532
Some would view that as an act of war.

504
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,203
We were just trying to quell
your rebellion before it started.

505
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,623
<i>I think we both know</i>
<i>what your intentions were, Doctor.</i>

506
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,125
<i>And now it's time you became aware of mine.</i>

507
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,754
I will release your men,
but I expect something in return.

508
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,757
We have 12 of your own.
How about a straight trade?

509
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,803
The Genii you've imagined as your
potential hostages are terminally ill.

510
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,805
<i>They volunteered for the mission.</i>

511
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:32,893
<i>They knew they were never coming back</i>
<i>from the moment they heard of my plan.</i>

512
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:35,646
Why are you doing this?

513
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,900
The Genii people need
the Lantian ships you call Jumpers.

514
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,069
<i>I believe you have 10 of them.</i>

515
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,906
<i>You have one hour to bring them all here.</i>

516
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,616
And if I don't?

517
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:53,830
<i>We will kill one of your team</i>
<i>every 15 minutes until our demands are met.</i>

518
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,793
Oh! and we will be starting with colonel Sheppard.

519
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,805
It's no use.

520
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:12,975
The doctors on our world
have tried to cure all of us.

521
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,894
I don't mean to speak ill of your doctors,

522
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,522
but our medicines are
a lot more advanced than theirs.

523
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,524
I know what you're trying to do.

524
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,985
There's really nothing sinister about it, love.

525
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,320
They won't give your men back.

526
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,907
Even if you cure us, Cowen will never relent.

527
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,118
I'm afraid that's not my department.

528
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,996
Now, are you experiencing any pain at all?

529
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,122
Why?

530
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,790
Why would you help us?

531
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,376
Because I'm a doctor. That's what I do.

532
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:40,711
Why you would do this,

533
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,505
allow yourself to be used like this?

534
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,842
I'm dead anyway. What does it matter?

535
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,261
Not yet, the last time I checked your pulse.

536
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,388
Besides, even if there was no hope,

537
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,600
I'd prefer to die surrounded by
my friends and family, in my own home.

538
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:58,812
I am doing this to ensure
that my friends and family have a home.

539
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,939
Can't you understand that?

540
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,318
This is the one thing
that I can do and I am glad to do it.

541
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,206
What do you want with the Jumpers?

542
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,168
What do I want with

543
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,007
invisible space ships that can fly
to other worlds and even deliver our atomic weapons?

544
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:29,468
Well, since you put it that way.

545
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,679
They're never gonna deal.

546
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:35,641
You're going to have to kill us.

547
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,102
I fully expect to have to kill you.

548
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,273
Looking forward to it that much?

549
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,986
Why didn't you just take us
hostage when we came to visit?

550
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:52,950
Why take two hostages if you could have a dozen?

551
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,119
Take him to his cell.

552
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:07,339
Even if we give you the Jumpers, none
of the Genii will be able to fly them.

553
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:08,465
Oh no?

554
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,216
Why's that?

555
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:10,843
You know why.

556
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:16,765
Well, if you're referring to the ancient gene,
I'm working on a treatment
that could artificially produce it.

557
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:20,352
In fact,
we've been collecting samples for some time.

558
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,937
From where?

559
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:29,862
<i>Lorne...</i>

560
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,322
Starting to put it all together?

561
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,324
I'm getting there.

562
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:37,536
Major.

563
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,620
Boys.

564
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,789
Colonel.

565
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,670
Way to be alive.

566
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,547
Thanks, Sir.

567
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,007
So...

568
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,592
you come to rescue us?

569
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:56,722
Well, until about a moment ago, I thought you were
dead but now that I see you speaking and breathing...

570
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,640
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

571
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,058
Well, good.

572
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,312
Let me know if
there's anything we can do to help.

573
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,064
Lieutenant Miller performed
a cloaked scan of the planet.

574
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:10,652
It looks like the Genii have moved in a massive
amount of troops over the past 15 minutes.

575
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,988
I'm afraid they have us greatly outnumbered.

576
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,618
Any attempt to extract our men would
result in many casualties on both sides.

577
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,119
Let me get in there and see what I can do.

578
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,831
No, the last thing I need is for more
of us to fall into their hands.

579
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,334
How are our Genii guests doing?

580
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:29,213
Well, they have a number of different symptoms
and ailments, but they all trace back to one thing,

581
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,048
radiation poisoning.

582
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,719
Well, McKay warned them that the shielding for
their fission experiments was dangerously insufficient.

583
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:36,929
I guess they didn't listen.

584
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,180
Aye.

585
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,599
Can you cure them?

586
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:44,728
There are some experimental treatment
protocols I've been able to get my hands on,

587
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,981
although some of them are just too far
gone to do anything but pain management,

588
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,901
but I do believe I can save at least eight of them.

589
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,569
Alright,

590
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,072
let's hope they will trade their people for ours.

591
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,573
Do we have a backup plan?

592
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,660
We're not handing 10 of our Jumpers over to the Genii.

593
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,329
Let's just hope this works.

594
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,166
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

595
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,837
<i>Most of your people can be cured,</i>
<i>including Ladon's sister.</i>

596
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,508
Oh, I understand.

597
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,427
What you need to understand is I don't care.

598
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,721
What?

599
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:23,141
<i>I think you're playing for time, Dr. Weir.</i>

600
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,894
Your people can be cured.

601
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:32,192
Now, let me return them to you,
and let them live out the rest of their lives
with their families on their home world.

602
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,444
The Genii need those Jumpers.

603
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,698
Until you are prepared to part
with them, this conversation is over.

604
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,993
You kill one of my people,
and we are in a state of war.

605
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,744
Oh, yes, yes.

606
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:46,248
Well, I don't quite know how I'll live with myself.

607
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:50,085
I will contact you again in 15 minutes

608
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,714
<i>so you can decide whether you</i>
<i>would like Dr. McKay to live.</i>

609
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:57,593
In the meantime,
you have forfeited the life of colonel Sheppard.

610
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,469
Cowen, wait!

611
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,936
Kill him.

612
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:10,272
Yes, Sir.

613
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,822
What the hell happened?

614
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,741
We got gassed.

615
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,201
Are we in some sort of trouble?

616
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:27,164
Was it the gas or the prison cell
that was your first clue?

617
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,047
Time's up.

618
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,516
Anything?

619
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:48,393
We're still connected,
but he's turned the radio off.

620
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,604
I'm not getting any signal.

621
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,189
Damn it!

622
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:53,815
Elizabeth,

623
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,818
what if we offer them one Jumper
in exchange for colonel Sheppard?

624
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,196
Carson, we have less than
15 minutes before they kill McKay.

625
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,615
You can deliver all the Jumpers you want.

626
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:02,950
They're going to kill everyone.

627
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,868
We need to attack them now.

628
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,961
Weir says your Dr. Beckett can cure
the people I sent through the Gate.

629
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:15,087
Is that true?

630
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,464
Beckett's the best doctor in two galaxies.

631
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:18,757
If there's a cure,

632
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,509
he's got it.

633
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:24,721
We're letting them go.

634
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:36,024
Hidden away at the bottom of
this building is a nuclear device.

635
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,651
Where did you get your hands on that?

636
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,195
You forget I'm the chief scientist.

637
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,864
I made it.

638
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,073
You're going to start your coup.

639
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,410
I needed Cowen and
his elite guard together in one place.

640
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,496
I knew the chance at some
Puddle Jumpers would get him here.

641
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,455
Good one.

642
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,417
Most of my men are waiting for me
on our home world.

643
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:54,960
Tonight,

644
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,046
the leadership of our people changes hands.

645
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,633
You were just going to leave us here
to be vaporized with the others.

646
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,886
Yes, I was...

647
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,139
but things have changed.

648
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,016
Let's go.

649
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,944
Go see what's keeping him.

650
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:32,497
It's alright.

651
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,416
I'm just escorting these prisoners.

652
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:44,009
There's a hidden passage this way.

653
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,678
We shouldn't run into any more resistance.

654
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,059
<i>Commander Cowen, someone has freed the Atlantians.</i>

655
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,268
What?

656
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,565
Ladon, come in!

657
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm receiving Dr. McKay's IDC.

658
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,111
Defense teams stand by!

659
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,696
Lower the shield.

660
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:10,911
Rodney!

661
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:11,828
It's Ladon.

662
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,830
He's letting us go in exchange for his people.

663
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:14,790
Ladon's in charge?

664
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,416
Well, he's about to be.

665
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,085
He really was planning a coup.

666
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,921
Apparently, we're a part of the plan.

667
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,425
Ladon, come in!

668
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,635
<i>This is Ladon.</i>

669
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,761
What's going on?

670
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:30,472
I'm sorry it had to come to this, Cowen.

671
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,808
<i>You have served our people well.</i>

672
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,395
What have you done?

673
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:39,982
Shield up.

674
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,073
Now, please,

675
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,701
I would like to see my sister.

676
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,710
What are you doing?

677
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,879
We found a malignant tumor
in your sister's left lung.

678
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,922
We had to remove it as soon as possible.

679
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,090
Not to worry.

680
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,758
It was a complete success.

681
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,468
She did great.

682
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,845
And then she'll be cured?

683
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,889
She's not out of the woods entirely,

684
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,433
but if she keeps up with her treatments...

685
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,228
Many Genii suffer from similar afflictions.

686
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,815
We'd be more than happy to cure
as many of your people as we can...

687
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,776
the ones who survive your coup, that is.

688
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,778
I don't anticipate any more casualties.

689
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,529
Good.

690
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:29,406
Let's make that a condition.

691
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,784
My day is far from over.

692
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,995
I must return to my planet.

693
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:36,288
We'll take good care of her.

694
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,497
I promise.

695
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:39,833
Thank you, Doctor.

696
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,559
The coup was successful.

697
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,896
Ladon Radim is the new leader of the Genii.

698
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,731
Wow, that was fast.

699
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:07,903
Yeah, once people found out Cowen
and his elite guard were out of the picture,
his loyalists laid down their weapons.

700
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:12,199
They're billing it as a bloodless coup
because no one died on their home soil.

701
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:16,620
So a nuclear explosion and the lives of
an entire battalion of men don't count?

702
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,580
Yeah. It's all spin.

703
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,832
What do you think the fallout's going to be?

704
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:25,254
Well, historically, most coups end up with
the new government being about as bad as the old one.

705
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:29,091
I don't know, he seemed pretty
grateful we saved his sister.

706
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,050
There's that.

707
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,802
And he did save me and my team.

708
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:33,512
There's that, too.

709
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,265
So I say we call it a win.

710
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,766
Who's spinning now?

711
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,060
Alright.

712
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:42,688
Then I say we call it a night.

713
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,481
That we can do.
