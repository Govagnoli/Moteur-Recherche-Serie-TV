00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:03,363
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,807
Tara? Oh, God.

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,451
Somebody!

4
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:11,366
- Things just got worse.
- How?

5
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,445
End-of-the-world worse.
Willow's going to destroy it.

6
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,124
l love you.

7
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,888
Things have really sucked lately.
That's all gonna change.

8
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:23,850
And l wanna be there when it does.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,085
Make me what l was.

10
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:29,802
- We will return... your soul.
<i>- (screams)</i>

11
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:39,289
<i>(# slow Turkish music)</i>

12
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:54,762
<i>(# music changes to faster tempo)</i>

13
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:57,482
<i>(deep breathing)</i>

14
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:47,882
Ugh! Argh!

15
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,244
lt's about power.

16
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,530
- Who's got it. Who knows how to use it.
<i>- (growling)</i>

17
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,287
So...

18
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,767
- Who's got the power, Dawn?
- Well...

19
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,406
- l've got the stake.
- The stake is not the power.

20
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,322
But, he's new.
He doesn't know his strength.

21
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:22,683
He might not know those fancy martial-arts
skills they inevitably seem to pick up.

22
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:24,729
Who's got the power?

23
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,089
- He does.
- Never forget it.

24
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:32,485
lt doesn't matter how well prepped or
how well armed you are, you're a little girl.

25
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:33,892
- Woman.
- Little woman.

26
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,851
- l'm taller than you.
- He's a vampire, OK? Demon?

27
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,446
Preternaturally strong?

28
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,890
- Skilled with powers no human could...
- Excuse me. l think l'm stuck.

29
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:47,768
- You're stuck?
- My foot's caught on a root or something.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,047
l don't even know how l got down there.
lf you could give me a hand...

31
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,210
- So, he's got the power.
- Zip it.

32
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,684
l really appreciate it. lt's so dark,
and l don't even know what l'm doing here.

33
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,805
Whoa!

34
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,851
Ooh! Thanks. That was a help.

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,368
Unfortunately, it was the last...
<i>(wheezing)</i> thing you'll ever do.

36
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:13,968
Listen up. l'm the Slayer.
You don't wanna get into it with me.

37
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,408
You want blood? You can have hers.

38
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:22,252
Power. He's got it, he's going to use it.
You don't have it, so...

39
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,049
Use that. Perfect.

40
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,284
Argh!

41
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,444
Buffy!

42
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,645
lt's real. lt's the only lesson, Dawn.

43
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:25,286
- lt's always real. Let me see.
- lt's nothing. lt's just a scrape.

44
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,926
- Plus, l had a plan the whole time.
- Really?

45
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:32,642
Yeah. l planned to get killed,
come back as a vampire and bite you.

46
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,088
- You wanted to be trained.
- The next time...

47
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,811
You did pretty well.

48
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,844
- l did?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,768
Cos, with the rolling thing, l was actually
using his strength. lt was very t'ai chi.

50
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:50,404
- Plus, l nearly got the heart.
- My first time out, l missed the heart too.

51
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,764
- No way.
- Just the once.

52
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:58,449
- Well, the next vampire l meet...
- The next vampire you meet, you run away.

53
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,208
l just wish that was all we had to worry about.
Vampires, demons...

54
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,682
they're nothing compared to what's coming.

55
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,845
l know. l just can't believe it's back.

56
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,926
Believe me, l thought l was long past it.
l guess you never are.

57
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:16,884
A few more days till it starts, and...
then we'll never know what's coming next.

58
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:20,966
lt is my great pleasure and privilege
to announce the official opening -

59
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,692
on the very ground that it first stood upon -

60
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:28,449
of the brand-new, state-of-the-art,
Sunnydale High!

61
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

62
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,492
- That doesn't belong there.
- No, it doesn't.

63
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:12,291
That's the flora kua ulaya.
Native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.

64
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:15,763
ls there anything
you don't know everything about?

65
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,845
Synchronised swimming.
Complete mystery to me.

66
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,244
Yep, Paraguay.

67
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,722
- Where's it come from?
- Paraguay.

68
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:34,284
- You brought it through the earth.
- lt's all connected.

69
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:38,286
The root system, the molecules, the energy.

70
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,882
- Everything's connected.
- You sound like Miss Harkness.

71
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:48,051
- She's taught me a lot.
- Then why aren't you in your lesson?

72
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,967
- Sorry.
- lt's all right. l think she was just...

73
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,965
Afraid. Yeah.

74
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,486
They all are.

75
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,805
The coven is...

76
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,647
They're the most amazing women
l've ever met.

77
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,726
But there's this look that they get.

78
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:08,601
Like l'm gonna turn them all
into bangers and mash, or something.

79
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,685
Which l'm not even really sure what that is.

80
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,845
They're cautious. l trust you understand that.

81
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,288
l don't have that much power, l don't think.

82
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,970
Everything is connected.

83
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:24,049
You're connected to a great power,
whether you feel it or not.

84
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,886
Well, you should just take it from me.

85
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,171
You know we can't.
This isn't a hobby or an addiction.

86
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,248
lt's inside you now, this magic.

87
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,443
You're responsible for it.

88
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,685
- Will they always be afraid of me?
- Maybe. Can you handle that?

89
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,764
l deserve a lot worse.

90
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:47,571
- l killed people, Giles.
- l've not forgotten.

91
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,407
When you brought me here,
l thought it was to kill me.

92
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:56,886
Or to lock me in some mystical dungeon
for all eternity, or... with the torture.

93
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:01,209
lnstead, you... go all Dumbledore on me.

94
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:04,167
l'm learning about magic,

95
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,485
all about energy and Gaia and root systems...

96
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,810
Do you want to be punished?

97
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,444
l wanna be Willow.

98
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,923
You are. ln the end, we all are who we are.

99
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,250
No matter how much
we may appear to have changed.

100
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,725
- Dawn? Xander's here.
- Just a minute!

101
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:42,249
- You're gonna be late.
- l'm comfortable with that.

102
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,052
- Morning.
- You gotta eat something. l made cereal.

103
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,522
- OK!
- You're unconscionably spiffy.

104
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,446
Client meeting.
How exactly do you <i>make</i> cereal?

105
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,366
You put the box near the milk.
lt was on the Food Channel.

106
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,843
- You want something?
- l ate. l'm good. How are you?

107
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:02,049
My sister's going to the same high school
that tried to kill me, l can't change districts,

108
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,968
l can't afford private school, and l can't
begin to prepare her for what might happen.

109
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,521
So, peachy with a side of keen,
that would be me.

110
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,649
Here's something for what ails you.

111
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,327
- Have you got the rest?
- Take a look.

112
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,089
- Hey, check out Double-o-Xander.
- Go, talk with your mouth full.

113
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:28,530
l've got two crews working on
this diabolical, yet lucrative new campus.

114
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,891
One here finishing the science building,
and one here reinforcing the gym.

115
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:35,885
There are no pentagrams,
no secret passageways.

116
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,203
Everything's up to code and safe as houses.

117
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:42,605
- Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?
- Maybe you're just paranoid.

118
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,684
There is one interesting detail.

119
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,129
l managed to scare up the plan
from the old high school.

120
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:51,364
You remember the very centre
of Sunnydale's own Hellmouth?

121
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,966
- Under the library.
- Right.

122
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:59,367
So l lined up the plans new and old, and right
exactly where the library was, we now have...

123
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:01,250
Principal's office.

124
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,370
- So, the principal's evil?
- Or in a boatload of danger.

125
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:07,968
The last two principals were eaten.
Who'd even apply for thatjob?

126
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,647
l guess we'll see.
Ooh, we have to leave though.

127
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,691
- Got everything? Books, lunch, stakes?
- Check thrice.

128
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,333
- Did you give her the...
- No, l was saving it.

129
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,085
What is it?

130
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,604
Back-to-school gift.

131
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:28,648
- lt's a weapon, isn't it?
- Yes. lt is.

132
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,568
l'll take her to class, have a look around.

133
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:40,043
- l'll be on-site here, so if you have any needs.
- Thanks.

134
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:52,211
Remember, if you see anything strange, or...

135
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,170
- dead...
- l got it.

136
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:58,928
And stay away from hyena people,
or any lizardy-type athletes.

137
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,083
Or if you see anyone that's invisible...

138
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:05,007
l think it's pretty safe to say
l'm not gonna see anybody that's invisible.

139
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:08,483
You could still drop out.
Only nerds finish high school.

140
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:12,282
lt's not fair for you to try and scare me
on my first day of high school.

141
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:16,161
- Cos, it is <i>so</i> redundant.
- This place is evil.

142
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,524
<i>(man)</i> Tough to let 'em go, huh?

143
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,166
- Hi.
- l'm Robin Wood, new principal.

144
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,567
Oh. Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.

145
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,405
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

146
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:32,248
So you're the new principal.
l... expected you to be more... aged.

147
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,931
You seem a bit young
to have such a grown-up daughter.

148
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,731
No!

149
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,565
No... sister.

150
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,645
Oh, right... of course!

151
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,604
You didn't really think she's my...

152
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,968
- lt's my hair. l have mom hair.
- No.

153
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:53,444
l have heard of you, Miss Summers, you
graduated from the old high school, right?

154
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,842
- Yeah, how did...
- l better get back to work.

155
00:12:55,933 --> 00:13:00,290
Gotta start deadening young minds.
lt's really nice to meet you. You have fun.

156
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:05,603
- That was suspicious.
- You betcha. Bye.

157
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:08,571
- Ooh! Dawn...
- l know! You never know what's coming,

158
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:12,851
the stake is not the power, <i>To Serve Man</i>
is a cookbook, l love you. Go away!

159
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,244
<i>(class bell)</i>

160
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,333
OK. l'm Mr Longren.

161
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:23,723
Why don't we go around the room
and introduce ourselves?

162
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,168
Let's start with...

163
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,924
lt's not mom hair.

164
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,925
You can't protect her.
You couldn't protect me.

165
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,204
Get out, get out, get out!

166
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,764
l love to dance. l like music.

167
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:10,768
l'm very into Britney Spears' early work,
before she sold out, so...

168
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:15,643
mostly her finger painting
and macaroni art. Very underrated.

169
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,844
Favourite activities include
not ever having to do this again, and...

170
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,366
Dawn!

171
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:26,613
- What?
- We have to go, it's not safe.

172
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,247
But...

173
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,366
We... l mean, l... saw...

174
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,045
Can l help you?

175
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,484
No. l...

176
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,731
Dawn, l just thought you were in danger...

177
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,132
of... smoking.

178
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,524
l'll... be around.

179
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,924
l also have a sister.

<i>(# "So High" by Strange Radio)</i>

181
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,611
God, they're depressing.

182
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,366
Who are they kidding
with that happy shiny crap?

183
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,486
Six weeks tops,
and she's calling on me for vengeance.

184
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:26,768
Ooh, he'd better run for cover(!)

185
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,451
What's that supposed to mean?

186
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,047
Oh, sweetie, you know exactly what it means.

187
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,249
- Excuse me?
- lt's the talk of the Order.

188
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,769
They're calling you Miss Soft Serve.
Tell me you don't know this.

189
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:39,605
But... who?

190
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:43,606
Listen, Anya. l know l've always been
a little competitive with you.

191
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:47,049
There was that thing in the Crimean War.
We laugh about it now,

192
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,488
but the fact is, l've always looked up to you.

193
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:53,282
You were the single most hard core
vengeance demon and everybody knew it.

194
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:55,443
Do l have to mention Mrs Czolgosz?

195
00:16:57,053 --> 00:17:00,568
- Good times.
- And then you lost your powers.

196
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,645
lt happens, and...
you fell for this Xander guy.

197
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,408
lt was a glitch. A summer thing.
l am so back in the vengeance fold.

198
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,484
No deaths. No eviscerations.

199
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:12,406
You're not goading women
into anything inventive.

200
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:13,528
l don't know...

201
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,288
Waitress downtown wished her husband
was a frog? You made him French!

202
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,565
He's smelly!
And with a little moustache, she...

203
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:25,965
- Listen, Anya. lf it was just me...
- What do you mean, if it was just you?

204
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:30,046
D'Hoffryn? The lower beings?
They're all feeling the heat.

205
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:35,608
Something's rising. Something older than the
Old Ones, and everybody's tail is twitching.

206
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:39,368
- This is a bad time to be a good guy.
- What is this, an intervention?

207
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:42,331
- Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?
- Sweetie...

208
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,045
they are.

209
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,771
So, how's it looking?
Does the place pass inspection?

210
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:57,651
Oh, it's great! lf you're a zombie ghost thing.

211
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,328
So school's back in session, huh?

212
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,884
Seems like old times.

213
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:10,482
- So, zombies or ghosts?
- l'm not sure. They were in the mirror,

214
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,451
but they disappeared.
But they touched me. l think.

215
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:17,287
- Let's just start with dead and pissed.
- They were after you personally?

216
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,887
Talked about protecting people.
Told me to leave.

217
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,964
No damage though?

218
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:26,205
l may have destroyed Dawn's social life
in 30 seconds. Apart from that, no.

219
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:29,922
Being popular isn't so great.
Or so l've read in books.

220
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:34,404
This isn't a coincidence. The school
being rebuilt? lt means something.

221
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,248
As in what?

222
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,730
Can l borrow a pencil?

223
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,361
- Thanks a lot.
- Aargh!

224
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,372
Are you all right?

225
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,161
l'm sorry.

226
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:06,128
There was a bee. lt flew in my eye.

227
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,130
l'm very allergic.

228
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,051
l think it's gone.

229
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,523
- Can l go to the bathroom?
- Of course.

230
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,412
Guess it runs in the family.

Ooh! Sorry!

234
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:15,042
Miss Summers.
l didn't know you were still about.

235
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,124
- l was looking...
- l thought, in general,

236
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:20,011
it was customary for a person
who's graduated to...

237
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,051
you know, go somewhere else.

238
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,730
Well, it's a new campus.
Just getting to know it.

239
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,407
You know, make sure it's safe. For my sister.

240
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,852
Hey.

241
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:47,851
- What's wrong?
- There's someone in here.

242
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,164
lt's only me.

243
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,925
No. lt's not.

244
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,686
You know, l... have to be honest,

245
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:03,766
l actually know a little bit more
about you than l let on before.

246
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,205
- lsn't that interesting.
- Oh, it really is.

247
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,488
Let's get you out of here, OK?

248
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,044
Maybe we can get some air.

249
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:19,605
- l'm Dawn.
- Kit.

250
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:26,444
- Saw something pretty creepy, huh?
- You wouldn't believe me.

251
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:33,324
l kinda sorta think l will.
Was there a pencil involved in any of...

- Giles, l... can't!

255
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:03,007
- God, it's...
- Just breathe.

256
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,165
What happened?

257
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,244
What do you remember?

258
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:18,648
We were talking... and... l felt...

259
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,724
<i>(rumbling)</i>

260
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,604

00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,883

There's... deep... deep black, there's...

264
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,732
l saw... the earth, Giles.

265
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,451
- l saw its teeth.
- The Hellmouth.

266
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:49,412
lt's gonna open.

267
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,484
lt's gonna swallow us all.

00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,324
Hey. Hey, wake up.

269
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:08,284
Please wake up.

270
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,524
Oh, God.

271
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,804
Are you OK?

272
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:21,003
- We have to leave.
- You're not wrong.

273
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:26,367
Come on. There's gotta be a staircase.

274
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,446
The school board recommended
l read your record.

275
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:35,731
lt's quite a page-turner.
Kind of a chequered past.

276
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:41,892
More like a plaid.
A kind of a clan tartan of badness, really.

277
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:44,009
You know, but there were factors.

278
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,205
What did you see?
When l found you in the stall.

279
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,012
A girl.

280
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:56,847
She said she died here, and that everybody
dies here and that... we would too.

281
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,083
Here l was worried about not fitting in.

282
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,845
<i>(both scream)</i>

And l saw a...

00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:15,128
lt was a janitor. He was yelling at me.
l thought he was just pissed, but...

288
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,444
- l saw him in the light.
- Wait, you came down stairs? Where?

289
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:23,971
Man, l got no clue. l ran away like a girl.
l don't know this place at all.

OK.

291
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:31,168

- You really think you can run away?

292
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:36,651

- Lesson one - it's always real.

Hear me. Right! Oh, l got a present!

297
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,452
What is it?

298
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:53,562
A weapon.

299
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:58,773
- lt's clear your sister looks up to you...
- No, she's much, much worse than me.

300
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:02,209
A troublemaker.
Expulsion is really the only way to go.

301

You know, or you could
suspend her for three... years.

302
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:10,211
How about we give her a chance first?
Just as long as she keeps her grades up...

330
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,369
- Dawn!
- She's not gonna hear you.

331
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:45,286
- This place is like a maze.
- This place is ours now.

332
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,364
lt was built on our graves.

333
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:51,332
All we want is for you to leave,
so we can rest again.

334
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:56,762
Actually, l'm thinking all you want
is to get between me and that door.

335
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:01,684
Who's for finding out why?

336
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,443
lf at first you don't succeed...

337
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:19,372
Cheat.

338
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,684
Dawnie, we have to get out...

339
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,365
Spike?

340
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,049
Are you real?

341
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,568
Buffy... duck.

342
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:00,603
What? Duck? There's a duck?

343
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,971
No visitors today. Terribly busy.

344
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,003
Told you to get out.

345
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,370
- They'll probably show up in a sec.
- Nobody comes in here.

346
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,892
- lt's just the three of us.
- Have you seen Dawn?

347
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:27,568
- She's down here with some kids.
- Don't you think l'm trying?!

348
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,489
l'm not fast. Not a quick study.

349
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:39,048
l dropped my board in the water
and the chalk all ran.

350
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,645
Sure to be caned.

351
00:29:43,053 --> 00:29:45,044
Should've seen that coming.

352
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,725
What did you do?

353
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,692
l tried...

354
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,924
l tried to cut it out.

355
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,284
<i>(phone rings)</i>

356
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:30,367
- Dawn?
- Buffy, where are you?

357
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,647
l...

358
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,568
- lt's in my instinct...
- Where are you?

359
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,521
l don't know. ln a room by the furnace.

360
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,889
Near where we fell in.
They dragged us in here then disappeared.

361
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,612
- Yeah, they came after me too.
- What do they want?

362
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,730
- So far, to piss me off.
- Please, tell me it's working.

363
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:54,171
l'm damage-bound. But ghosts can't touch
you and zombies can't disappear, so...

364
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,721
- Not ghosts.
<i>- (Dawn) Who was that?</i>

365
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:58,966
Hold on.

366
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,645
You know what they are?

367
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:05,366
Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman,
raised to seek vengeance.

368
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,648
A four-year-old could figure it.

369
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,570
Hang tight. l'll find you.
These things can hurt you.

370
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:15,202
You could hurt them too.
Find a weapon. l'll come for you.

371
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:18,805
- You gonna help me out?
- This is my home. l belong here.

372
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:20,372
Always been here.

373
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,925
Cheers for stopping by.

374
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,925
lt's in the walls.

375
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:31,364
<i>(whimpering)</i>

376
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:34,164
l'll... get back to you.

377
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:41,692
Guys?

378
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,604
Resentful dead guys?

379
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:52,850
This can't be good.

380
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:58,164
Come on. Manifest spirits,
raised up, controlled by a...

381
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,012
talisman.

382
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:07,922
Xander.

383
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,642
We need to find some kind of a weapon.
Just to hold them off.

384
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,725
l got these.

385
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,404
Kit, give me your bag.

386
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,090
- Do you think they're gonna come back?
<i>- (mocking)</i> Think they're gonna come back?

387
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:40,086
We never left. We'll always be here.
Just like you.

388
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:42,047
No.

389
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,283
Why do you think we picked you?

390
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:47,888
The ones no one will miss.
The ones that don't belong.

391
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:54,166
Spend all your time trying to get out of high
school, and now you'll never, ever leave.

392
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:00,122
Aargh!

393
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,452
Whoa!

394
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,644
Contracty goodness.

395
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,643
Talisman... talisman.

396
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,927
You can thank your sister for this.

397
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:25,253
- Thanks, sis.
- We need to keep them at bay.

398
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,612
The bag!

399
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:03,252
Yes!

400
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,245
Talisman.

401
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,723
- You really wanna keep this up?
- What are you gonna do? Kill us?

402
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,525
Aargh!

403
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:32,922
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

404
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,366
The talisman must have been destroyed.

405
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:38,648
How'd you know it was a talisman?

406
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,284
There's always a talisman.

407
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,966
The real question is, who put it there?

408
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,965
Come on, you guys.
Let's go find a way upstairs.

409
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,044
Assuming there is one.

410
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:55,050
You really weren't kidding about this place.

411
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,124
l guess it hasn't changed.

412
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,128
l don't know. lt seems smaller.

413
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:07,529
You're gonna be OK. School's intense,
but you'll do all right if you're careful.

414
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:10,571
And, you might wanna
think about sticking together.

415
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,245
Thank you.

416
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,764
Yeah, l mean it.
You are the coolest mom ever.

417
00:35:19,213 --> 00:35:21,204
O... K! Come on!

418
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:24,285
We still have a few more classes
to live through.

419
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:33,650
- Curiouser and curiouser.
- What is?

420
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:36,613
Carlos Trejo and Kit Hollburn, right?

421
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:41,209
Possibly the only two students in this school
whose files are as thick as yours was.

422
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:43,170
You really did your homework.

423
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:47,849
l was looking for one or both of them
to implode right before midterms...

424
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:52,002
but now l see that you got 'em
socialising and hugging, and actually,

425
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:54,687
if l'm not mistaken, headed <i>to</i> class.

426
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,731
Well, we shared an... encounter.

427
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,850
l know you were probably
happy to get out of this place,

428
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,845
but, l gotta tell you, Miss Summers,
l think you belong here.

429
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,084
- Hamnoo?
- Listen, l know this school's reputation.

430
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:09,812
What, you think l got this job
based on seniority?

431
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:14,011
We got troubled students here, and just
enough money to keep it from caving in.

432
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:18,769
- Yeah, you might need a little extra there.
- We do have a community outreach program,

433
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:22,482
and the money we could pay you
wouldn't even fold,

434
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:28,011
- but it would be a couple of days a week.
- Are you... asking me to be a counsellor?

435
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:31,768
We have a guidance counsellor,
but the kids could use someone...

436
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,083
- closer to their age who still...
- l'm in.

437
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,686
What, you're serious? You did hear
the part about the money, right?

438
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:44,564
Yeah, l heard. My schedule might be
a little fun-tastic... but l'll work it out.

439
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:49,161
- l'd like to keep an eye on this place.
- Well, that's great!

440
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:53,926
lt's not even noon and l've bullied
my first family member into helping out.

441
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:56,208
l'm gonna be the best principal ever.

442
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:01,291
<i>(Spike) Everything is...</i>

443
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:05,485
l had a speech. l learned it all.

444
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,925
Oh, God, she won't understand,
she won't understand.

445
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,607
Of course she won't understand, Sparky.

446
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,244
l'm beyond her understanding.

447
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:21,767
She's a girl! Sugar and spice and everything...
useless unless you're baking.

448
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,084
l'm more than that.

449
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:27,085
- More than flesh.
- More than blood.

450
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:32,964
l'm... you know, l honestly don't think there's
a human word fabulous enough for me.

451
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:38,252
Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips.
Assuming their lips haven't been torn off.

452
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,563
But notjust yet. That's all right though.

453
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,124
l can be patient.

454
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:48,011
Everything is well within parameters.

455
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:52,082
She's exactly where l want her to be.

456
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,124
And so are you, No.17.

457
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,844
You're right where you belong.

458
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:05,045
What'd you think, you'd get your soul back
and everything would be jim-dandy?

459
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:09,331
A soul's slipperier than a greased weasel.
Why do you think l sold mine?

460
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:15,767
Well, you probably thought that
you'd be your own man. And l respect that.

461
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,844
- But you...
- ..never will.

462
00:38:18,853 --> 00:38:20,844
You'll always be mine.

463
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,047
You'll always be in the dark with me.

464
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,727
Singing our little songs.

465
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,962
You like our little songs, don't you?

466
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:35,168
You've always liked them,
right from the beginning.

467
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:39,202
<i>(whispers)</i> And that's where we're going.

468
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:41,967
Right back to the beginning.

469
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,887
Not the bang. Not the word.

470
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,204
The true beginning.

471
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:53,486
The next few months
are going to be quite a ride.

472
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:57,771
And l think we're all going to learn
something about ourselves in the process.

473
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,572
You'll learn you're a pathetic schmuck,

474
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,328
if it hasn't sunk in already.

475
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,125
Look at you.

476
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,684
Tried to do what's right.

477
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:10,965
Just like her.

478
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,444
You still don't get it.

479
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,842
lt's not about right.

480
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,924
Not about wrong.

481
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:26,164
lt's about power.
