<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:06,539
l'm a guy with his ear to the ground,
but even l can feel it.

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:10,696
<i>Something's coming. l don't know</i>
<i>what exactly, but something's brewing.</i>

4
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>And it's so big, ugly and damned, it makes</i>
<i>you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces.</i>

5
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:18,573
You'll live in there.
lt looks like a closet, but it's a room now.

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,338
And l hate this plan. l don't understand
when his problems became yours.

7
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,062
The school basement is making him crazy.

8
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:28,931
lt's just things are different now.
He has a soul.

9
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,615
Mom?

10
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:37,572
<i>Get off her and let her talk to me!</i>

11
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:42,501
Things are coming, Dawn.
When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you.

12
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,459
No!

13
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:48,932
This last year will seem like cake after
what l put you and your friends through,

14
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:51,412
<i>and l am not a fan of easy death.</i>

15
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>The whole good-versus-evil,</i>
<i>balancing-the-scales thing? l'm over it.</i>

16
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,982
But believe me, l'm going for a big finish.

17
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:05,417
From beneath you, it devours.

18
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:08,697
What do you mean?
How do you know Spike?

19
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:12,856
What do you mean, how?
He was the guy that... Oh, what's the word?

20
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:16,253
- Sired.
- Yeah, he was the guy that sired me.

21
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,014
<i>(knocking)</i>

22
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:30,256
- OK, OK, l'm coming. l'm up.
- <i>(knocking continues)</i>

23
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:34,382
lt's 4.30 in the morning.
Sweet mama-lution.

24
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,931
- Who is it?
- <i>(Buffy)</i> lt's me.

25
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:41,578
- Buffy?
- Where's Spike? Xander, is he here?

26
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:46,737
- He's out. At least he was when l got home.
- Any idea where he went?

27
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:51,578
l don't know. Creature of the night, Buff.
He's probably out creaturing.

28
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,813
Why, what happened?

29
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:57,057
ls he in trouble?

30
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,134
l hope not.

31
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,901
<i>(humming of "Early One Morning")</i>

32
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,381
<i>(Spike hums "Early One Morning")</i>

33
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,580
Nora?

34
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,621
Nora?

35
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,180
Buffy?

36
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,982
<i>(Dawn)</i> She's not here.

37
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,011
Dawn? Oh, my God.

38
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,294
What are you...

39
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,261
Dawn, what happened here? What...

40
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,935
You're cut.

41
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,856
- l'm all right.
- Let me see, make sure.

42
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,173
l saw Mom.

43
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,299
What?

44
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,102
She was here, Willow. l saw her.

45
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,822
She was here, and she spoke to me.

46
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,461
Sweetie...

47
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:08,776
No, she was right here,
and... then she wasn't. She...

48
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,218
lt wasn't her.

49
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:14,579
- What?
- At least, l don't think.

50
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:21,494
l saw something too, and it looked like...
someone else.

51
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,699
But it wasn't.

52
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,694
l don't understand.

53
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:30,095
lt's the big bad, Dawn.
The one we knew was coming.

54
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,974
But that's what she said.

55
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:37,261
Mom, she said that things were coming,
that things were on their way,

56
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:40,858
and... that she loved us.

57
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:46,574
So it had to be her, right?
l mean, her warning was true.

58
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:52,135
l don't know. l just don't think
we can trust anything right now.

59
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,374
So maybe the evil thing
messing with you was here too.

60
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:59,661
Only maybe it was the thing
trying to keep mom away.

61
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,416
Cos she was trying to protect me.

62
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,578
Maybe.

63
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,292
Why would a vampire lie
about who sired him?

64
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:16,458
What's that? Some kind of status symbol for
the undead? "My sire can beat up your sire."

65
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,613
l'm not saying l don't believe him.

66
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,571
You just don't want to.

67
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,213
OK, let's look at this objectively.

68
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:28,818
Figure it out in a cold,
impersonal, CSl-like manner,

69
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,861
cos we're a couple of carpet fibres
away from a case.

70
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,901
Spike can't be doing this.
He couldn't if he wanted to.

71
00:06:34,983 --> 00:06:38,498
- Why not?
- Pain chip, remember? He can't hurt anyone.

72
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,619
lt didn't stop him from hurting you.

73
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:44,662
Hey, objective here.
Maybe the chip's not working any more.

74
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:50,056
- Oh, it's working. l've seen it.
- ls it? Or is that what he wants you to think?

75
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,818
- You think it's an act?
- l don't really know. And neither do you.

76
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,781
No. There's something. l can feel it.

77
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,900
He's different. He's changed.

78
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,936
And, if it is an act, then the Oscar goes to...

79
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,536
<i>(door opens)</i>

80
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:11,855
Well, this can't be good -
you here at this hour.

81
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:16,172
- ls there trouble?
- No. No trouble.

82
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,094
l was just...

83
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:19,901
We were just...

84
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,415
Right.

85
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:26,415
None of my business. No worries.

86
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,775
Spike, l...

87
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,858
How was your night?

88
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,093
lt was all right.

89
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:42,620
And yours? Did you... bag any baddies?

90
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,693
One.

91
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:47,774
Vampire.

92
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:51,701
Someone l used to know, actually, a little.

93
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,621
Holden.

94
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,978
Holden Webster.

95
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,738
You knew him, huh?

96
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,780
That must've been a picnic.

97
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:08,779
Yeah.

98
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:15,575
Well... l'm gonna turn in before l drop.

99
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,380
Night.

100
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:28,293
You see that? You see how he reacted
when you mentioned Webs?

101
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,261
Cool as Cool Whip.
What's up with that?

102
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:36,337
The sun's coming up. l need to go and check
on Dawn. We need to keep an eye on Spike.

103
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:40,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa. When you say "we"
you mean me. Me's gotta go to work.

104
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:43,494
- l got a big meeting in a couple of hours.
- This is serious.

105
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,337
We cannot let him leave this house
until we know if he's killing again.

106
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,175
We need someone to watch him.

107
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,812
- Uh-uh. Forget it, Harris.
- You said you'd do it on the phone.

108
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:58,978
That was before you told me Spike's killing
again. You want to leave me alone with him?!

109
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:02,817
- Didn't mind being alone with him before.
- What was that?

110
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:08,899
Nothing. Look, we don't actually know
that he's killed anyone. You know, lately.

111
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,861
- Might all just be a mistake.
- But you don't think so.

112
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:17,176
Have you searched his room for clues?
Trophies from victims?

113
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:22,212
Killers like to keep trophies sometimes.
Scalps, necklaces made from human teeth.

114
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:26,262
lt didn't occur to me to look,
but thanks for the tip.

115
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:29,460
You'll be safe here.
Plenty of sunlight for you to hide in.

116
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,295
What? That's it?

117
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:35,695
You're not gonna leave a crossbow or a
flame-thrower? Something to protect myself?

118
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,935
We don't want him to know we suspect.
lf he tries to leave, don't confront him.

119
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:45,893
Call Buffy and just let her know that
he's on the move. You're gonna be fine.

120
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,896
Better be, cos if l get vamped,
l'm gonna bite your ass.

121
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,942
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- What was that?

122
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:00,856
<i>(door shuts)</i>

123
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:03,776
Dawn? Dawn!

124
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:07,014
Buffy, it's OK. She's OK. Not hurt.

125
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:10,140
She's just exhausted. Finally fell off to sleep.

126
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,818
- What the hell happened? lt looks like...
- Hell happened? Yeah.

127
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:18,897
This big evil that's been promising to
devour us? Well, l think it started chomping.

128
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,498
- Oh, God. And it started with Dawn?
- Both of us.

129
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:28,135
Buffy, this thing knows us. lt made us think
that we were talking to people we knew.

130
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,139
Mine said it came with a message from Tara.
But Dawn actually saw...

131
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,974
your mother.

132
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:45,058
This thing - it had me for a while.

133
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:49,295
l mean, before it started letting loose
with the pulse-pounding terror.

134
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:53,615
But before that,
the lies were very convincing.

135
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,978
ltjust seems real.

136
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,091
Lies?

137
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,892
Maybe to confuse us, to mess us up.

138
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,895
Or maybe just to be cruel.

139
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:10,295
Vampire l killed last night
told me Spike sired him.

140
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,938
Two nights ago.

141
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,332
Well, that's impossible. Right?

142
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:23,021
So maybe it was another one.
A fake out. You got one too.

143
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:26,857
- lt wasn't a real vamp.
- Dusted real enough.

144
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:30,413
- Buffy, do you think Spike is...
- l can't.

145
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,414
l hope not.

146
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,975
But if l'm wrong and he is...

147
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:43,499
then l have to see it for myself.

148
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,701
l have to be there to stop it.

149
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:38,895
Anya, do be specific and tell a fella
just exactly what you're doing here.

150
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,975
Well...

151
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,860
Spike...

152
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:49,581
l'm... here, obviously...

153
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,612
for... um...

154
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,581
sex.

155
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:58,539
Uh...

156
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,500
Beg pardon?

157
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,653
You and me.

158
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,893
Here and now.

159
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,655
Let's go.

160
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:10,418
Let's... get it on, you big bad boy.

161
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:13,381
Wait, Anya. Just a minute.
This is not exac...

162
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,897
ls that a stake?

163
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,099
Yes. Kinky.

164
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,458
- Well, yeah, but what do you...
- Shh.

165
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,613
No questions.

166
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:24,933
No talking.

167
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,139
l can't help it.

168
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:33,901
l can't stop thinking about you and us
and our brief but unforgettable time together.

169

Why else would l be here?

170

that you're some whacked-out serial killer.

Forget l said that.

172

lt's craziness talking.
lt's just nerves. Nerves.

173
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:53,057
Nerves and... and horniness.

174
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,341
Oh, just shut up, William, and take me.
Take me now.

175
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,822
- Anya.
- Hm?

176
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:16,660
lt's not that l'm not tempted. Obviously,
if things were different, you're a right catch.

177
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,772
l got it. No problem. l understand.

178
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:24,015
- You think l'm fat.
- What?

179
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:27,379
- lt's either that or the haircut.
- The do's quite fetching.

180
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,931
- Oh, right. Now you like the haircut.
- Love it.

181
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:33,299
Sure, as a friend. You were more fun
when you didn't have a soul.

182
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,613
Oh, come on.
l've just explained...

183
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:41,938
Soulless Spike would have had me upside
down and halfway to happy land by now.

184
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,218
l need my pants.

185
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,457
l didn't mean to hurt your feelings, love.

186
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,262
Who's hurt? l'm fine.

187
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,620
Right.

188
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,612
Look, l've got things to do.

189

00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,098
- The girl. Last night.
- What girl? What are you talking about?

217
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:26,621

Did you kill her? Did you turn her?

- Well, l certainly didn't off her.

Where are you getting this?
You know l can't.

223

Right. The chip.

No, not the chip!
Not the chip, dammit.

225
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:55,418
You think l'd go to the end of the underworld
and back to get my soul and then...?

226
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:59,894
Buffy, l can barely live with what l did.
lt haunts me.

227
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,774
All of it.

228
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:07,254
lf you think that l would add
to the body count now, you are crazy.

229
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:12,895
So you go looking for drunk co-eds
cos you're hungry for conversation?

230
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:16,134
- Oh, is that what this is? Right.
- What?

231
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:19,659
- You're jealous.
- Don't play games. Not now.

232
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:23,941
You saw me chatting up another bird,
giving the eye to somebody else.

233
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:27,538
- Touched a nerve, didn't it?
- Don't flatter yourself.

234
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:33,573
lt burns. But you can't admit it, so you trump
up some charge that l'm back on the juice.

235
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:38,453
- This vampire l killed told me...
- Told you what? That l go out?

236
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,899
Yeah, l talk to people. Women.

237
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:46,659
- l talk to them cos l can't talk to you.
- Oh, Spike, save it.

238
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:49,655
As daft a notion as
"soulful Spike the killer" is,

239
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:55,295
it is nothing compared to the idea that
another girl could mean anything to me.

240
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:59,812
This chip... they did <i>to</i> me.

241
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,939
l couldn't help it.

242
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,981
But the soul, l got on my own.

243
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:07,054
For you.

244
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,781
- l know. But...
- So, yeah. l go and pass the time.

245
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,694
With someone.

246
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:22,335
But that's all it is, is time. Cos God help me,
Buffy, it's still all about you.

247
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:29,581
- Spike, this vampire told me you sired him.
- That doesn't mean...

248
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:33,133
He said you killed him,
dumped him in a parking lot somewhere.

249
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:37,614
- And you believed him? Vampires aren't...
- l did follow you last night.

250
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:42,219
You didn't look lonely or casual to me.
You looked like you were on the prowl.

251
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:45,852
- You can't know that.
- So, then, tell me. Tell me what happened.

252
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,379
- You talked to her, then what?
- We talked. That's all l remember.

253
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:52,216
- All you remember?
- l don't know. l go out.

254
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:57,058
l talk to people or l don't.
lt's boring. lt all bleeds together.

255
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:00,055
- Well, if you seem to forget that much...
- Not that.

256
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:03,453
The taste of human blood.
That, l'd remember.

257
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:08,663
You were camped out on the Hellmouth
talking to invisible people. Recently.

258
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:12,053
- How can you be sure of...
- No! You are wrong.

259
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:17,775
You've got an accusation
from a pile of dust, and not a shred of proof.

260
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,331
So l'll get some.

261
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,658
OK, guys, find me some evidence
that he did this.

262
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:40,101
- Really? Are you sure that's what you want?
- Find me proof that he didn't.

263
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:44,461
You only think Spike is turning people
cos that vampire told you so, right?

264
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:49,139
But that night,
we were all told things that weren't true.

265
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,975
Maybe.

266
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,531
What? What "maybe"?

267
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:57,616
Just because those weren't
the spirits of, you know, our people,

268
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:02,140
just because it was some evil thing,
doesn't mean what they said can't be true.

269
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:06,057
l used to tell the truth all the time
when l was evil.

270
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,782
We can't assume anything.
We need hard facts.

271
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:13,732
lf Spike is biting people again, shouldn't
there be more dead people with neck trauma?

272
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:17,133
Right? And we can find that.

273
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,691
- No.
- No, we can't find that? But that's easy.

274
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:21,580
That computer's a moron.

275
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:27,579
l mean, no, there's not really
an increase in neck injuries. But...

276
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:29,540
But what?

277
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:32,660
Missing people. Eight, maybe.

278
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,339
Oh, ten of them.

279
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,938
No bodies, they're just missing.

280
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,332
Mostly young. Lots of girls.

281
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:48,739
So it's true. What that vampire
told Buffy turned out to be true.

282
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:50,734
Maybe.

283
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,815
But it still doesn't prove that it's Spike.

284
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:57,612
Right now,
he's the only one who knows for sure.

285
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:30,294
- No, no, no. You're not going out.
- l have to go.

286
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,613
Buffy was very clear
on the not leaving of you.

287
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:36,742
l know what she told you. lt's not true.
Let me go, and l'll find a way to prove it.

288
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,974
OK, l'm gonna list the reasons
that won't happen. One...

289
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:41,862

00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:18,335
l need to see you. There's a house.
634 Hoffman Terrace.

332
00:31:18,423 --> 00:31:20,812
l'll meet you.

333
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:25,579
You shouldn't have done that.

334
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:27,779
lt's not time yet.

335
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,660
Not nearly.

336
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,337
You're going against the plan.

337
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,578
But we can make it work.

338
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:51,494
Down here.

339
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,732
You won't come down?

340
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,253
l understand.

341
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,141
lt's a risky proposition.

342
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:15,058
There's an order. The Slayer's not in order.
But it can't hurt to play.

343
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:19,819
- Get your claws in the mouse, you know?
- You are not here.

344
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:32,817
All right. What do you wanna show me?

345
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,701
l've been remembering.

346
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,661
The girl. l walked her home.

347
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,176
The one you saw.

348
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:44,857
And the one before that.

349
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:48,541
And l think l killed her.

350
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:53,697
And l think l... l think l killed...
the lady who lived here.

351
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:57,933
And... and there might be others.

352
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:02,381
Oh, my God.

353
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,140
Here.

354
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,142
l-l think l buried them here.

355
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,495
Spike, why?

356
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:20,258
Well, l don't know, do l?
l don't even know how. l shouldn't be able...

357
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:24,575
<i>#</i> Early one morning
just as the sun was rising

358
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:29,134
<i>#</i> l heard a fair maid sing
in the valley down below

359
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,097
- <i>#</i> Oh, don't deceive me
- What? What is it?

360
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,617
<i>#</i> Oh, never leave me

361
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:38,332
<i>#</i> How could you use a poor maid...

362
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,776
Spike!

363
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:48,292
What are you doing? Oh!

364
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,938
Spike, listen to me. You don't wanna do this.

365
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,538
And it's just about to get fun.

366
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:06,412
Oh, God.

367
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,533
You know what l want you to do.

368
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:38,419
They're waiting for you.
Take her, taste her. Make her weak.

369
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,540
Spike, no!

370
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,059
l remember.

371
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:45,092
You failed them.

372
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,378
Now she's gonna kill you.

373
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,215
You lose, mate.

374
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:57,695
Sorry, ma'am, but it's my job.

375
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,212
Do it fast, OK?

376
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,774
He said you would do it.

377
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,854
Who said?

378
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,180
Me.

379
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,494
lt was me.

380
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,773
l saw it.

381
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:54,538
l was here the whole time,
talking and singing.

382
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,778
There was a song.

383
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:03,332
- What are you talking about?
- l don't know.

384
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,937
Please, l don't remember.

385
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,412
Don't make me remember.

386
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:13,896
Make it so l forget again!
l did what you wanted!

387
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:19,131
There's something here.

388
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:27,255
Oh God, no. Please. l need that.

389
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,336
l can't cry this soul out of me.

390
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,857
lt won't come.

391
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:37,062
l've killed, and l can feel them.

392
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:40,901
l can feel every one of 'em.

393
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,135
There's something playing with us.

394
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:54,020
All of us.

395
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,853
What is it?

396
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:04,411
Why is it doing this to me?

397
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,460
l don't know.

398
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:14,055
Help me.

399
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,380
Can you help me?

400
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:24,654
<i>(Buffy)</i> l'll help you.

401
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:31,692
<i>(Anya)</i> And you believe him?

402
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:36,299
<i>(Buffy)</i> You didn't see him down there.
He really didn't know what he'd done.

403
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:38,692
lt wasn't in his control.

404
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,935
Oh, an out-of-control serial killer.
You're right, that <i>is</i> a great house guest.

405
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,379
Wait. ls he... is he staying here?

406
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:50,820
l don't know. But l'm not letting him
out of my sight, that's for sure.

407
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:54,498
Buffy, he's been feeding on human blood.
That's gotta do stuff.

408
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,132
l'm not keeping him around just to help him.

409
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:02,535
l think there was something there,
talking to him, making him do things.

410
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,456
Something like what was talking to us?

411
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,900
Maybe. And if it was, then it's been
screwing with Spike big time.

412
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,258
So, you want him around because...?

413
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:14,652
There's something evil working us,

414
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:19,100
and to have a chance to fight it,
we need to learn everything we can about it.

415
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:22,061
This thing has been
closer to Spike than any of us.

416
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:26,978
- And if you wanna understand it...
- l'm gonna have to get close to Spike.

417
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,497
- lt's too dangerous.
- <i>(Buffy)</i> l don't have a choice.

418
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,416
Whatever this thing is from beneath us,

419
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,971
it's bad,

420
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,180
and it's only getting worse.

421
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,334
Oh, dear God!

422
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:53,692
Robson, are you here?

423
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:57,174
Robson?

424
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:59,060
<i>(groaning)</i>

425
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:07,983
You too?

426
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:18,301
- Dear God, l thought you were...
- Gather them.

427
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,977
- What?
- lt's started.

428
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:24,940
lt's all right. l understand.
l'll take care...
