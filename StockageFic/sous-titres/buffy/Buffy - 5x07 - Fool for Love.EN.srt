1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,932
Spike. He's known as William the Bloody.

2
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:09,008
Earned his nickname by torturing
his victims with railroad spikes.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,653
Spike has fought two slayers
in the last century

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,122
and he's killed them both.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,088
I can't bite anyone.
I can't even hit people.

6
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:27,563
I've got this cute little
government chip in my head.

7
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,451
She's everywhere. She's haunting me.

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,252
Buffy, I love you. God, I love you so much.

9
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,047
God, no.

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,487
I need to know more about where
I come from, about the other slayers.

11
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:51,166
Maybe if I can learn to control this thing,
I could be stronger, I could be better.

12
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:06,447
You know, it's probably none
of my business, but I just gotta ask.

13
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:11,003
Did you smell this bad when you were alive?

14
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,411
Cos if it's a postmortem thing,
then boy, is my face red.

15
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,085
But, just so you know,

16
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:21,006
the field of personal grooming has come
a long way since you became a vampire.

17
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,323
You're going?

18
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,927
Butyou were havin'
so much fun a minute ago.

19
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,404
Buffy. What happened?

20
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:23,883
I can't believe I passed out.
Do you think I'm a total wuss now?

21
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:28,330
Yeah. I like a girl who can play a few
hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.

22
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:33,328
- You said it wasn't that bad.
- I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.

23
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:38,168
- Well, at least no major organs got kebabbed.
- I still think you need to see a real doctor.

24
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:41,928
Then I'd be in a real hospital, which
would get my real mom real freaked out.

25
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,288
I can't do it. Don't worry.

26
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,763
Accelerated healing powers
come with the slayer package.

27
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,321
And the boyfriend with
combat medical training?

28
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,802
That's just a Buffy Summers bonus.

29
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:56,681
So tell me about the bad guy or guys.
What do you thinkthey were?

30
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,650
- Vampire.
- How many?

31
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,084
One.

32
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:05,371
So, what? He was
a super-vampire or somethin'?

33
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,445
No, he was the regular kind.

34
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,364
He just beat me.

35
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,404
That ever happen before?

36
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:20,445
I'm in the best physical shape of my life.
If you're asking how it happened, I don't...

37
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,649
- Dawn.
- Sorry to interrupt the sex-capades.

38
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,442
I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.

39
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,369
- Hi, Riley.
- Hey, Mrs Summers. How're you feelin'?

40
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:35,243
Fine. Bordering on chipper and,
tomorrow, planning on being obnoxious.

41
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,127
Glad to hear it.

42
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:41,047
Buffy, when you have a minute I'd like
to go over the grocery list for next week.

43
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:45,570
- You got it.
- Are you disinfecting something?

44
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:47,492
Mine.

45
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:51,088
Some nail polish experiments
are doomed before they even begin.

46
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,641
Butyou keep pushing the envelope, honey.

47
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:00,169
Did I just pull a slayer-related
Mom cover-up thing?

48
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,053
- Come on, who's the man?
- You are.

49
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,323
A very short, annoying man.

50
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,090
If I show you something,
you promise you won't tell?

51
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,249
Cool.

52
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,962
- I mean, gross.
- And Mom cannot know. OK?

53
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,323
You'll help me with the household stuff?

54
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,927
I save your butt and you
dump all your chores on me?

55
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,651
Dawn.

56
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:34,727
I got it. You're covered. We're good.
Just lucky it's not bikini season.

57
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:40,045
So, Dawn takes household duty.
I'll take tonight's patrol.

58
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,601
- By yourself?
- Just a sweep.

59
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:46,252
Do me a favour?
Will you take the gang along with?

60
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,801
OK. I will patrol with the group tonight.

61
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,970
- When do I get to patrol?
- Not until you're... Never.

62
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,921
What's with the hand move?
D'you see that? Does it mean somethin'?

63
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:21,451
It's code. I think it
breaks down to "choo-choo".

64
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,524
It probably means to follow him.

65
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,331
That, or wait here for him.

66
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:33,844
Ask.

67
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:37,887
Riley! What's the... all about?

68
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:42,251
It means yell real loud so the vampires who
don't know we're comin' will have a chance.

69
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,563
See, now he's all mad and sarcastic.

70
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,725
Because you were doin' all the yellin',
Mr Stealthy Pants.

71
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:51,044
- It's their fault.
- If we split up, we could cover more ground.

72
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:54,485
I'll take the cemeteries,
you guys get the Bronze.

73
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,609
Are we not being covert enough?

74
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:59,253
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

75
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,483
We'll be sneakier. Promise.

76
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:05,809
OK. Just ditch the chips and watch my back.

77
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,484
Done.

78
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:16,363
You know what he's like? He's like a cat.
You know, a big jungle cat.

79
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,331
How come I'm not like that? It's just so cool.

80
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,284
I think you're cool.

81
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:31,169
Here's another one.
Early 18th-century slayer.

82
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:34,529
Good. Let's hope she'll be
more helpful than this last one.

83
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,173
- Why? What does it say?
- Same as all the others.

84
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:41,724
Slayer called, blah, blah. Great protector,
blah, blah. Scary battles, blah, blah.

85
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,532
Oops. She's dead. Where are the details?

86
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,365
Details?

87
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:50,241
Well, it says this slayer
forged her own weapons.

88
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:56,968
Gotta love a gal with an anvil. But where
are the details of the Slayer's last battle?

89
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:00,602
You know, what made that fight special?
Why did she lose?

90
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:05,769
- You didn't lose last night, Buffy. You just...
- Got really close.

91
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:10,569
I slipped up, Giles. I've been training
harder than ever and still I...

92
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:15,086
And there's nothing in any of these books
to help me understand why.

93
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:21,410
I mean, I realise that every slayer comes
with an expiration mark on the package.

94
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,690
But I want mine to be a long time from now.

95
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,570
Like a Cheeto.

96
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:30,487
If there were just a few good descriptions
of what took out the other slayers,

97
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:34,486
maybe it would help me understand
my mistake, to keep it from happening again.

98
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:41,046
Yes, well, the problem
is that after a final battle,

99
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:48,406
it's difficult to get any...
Well, the Slayer's not... She's rather...

100
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,370
It's OK to use the D-word, Giles.

101
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,968
Dead. And hence not very forthcoming.

102
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:58,326
Why didn't the watchers keep fuller
accounts of it? The journals just stop.

103
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,725
I suppose if they're anything like me,
they just find the whole subject too...

104
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,162
Unseemly?

105
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:09,527
Damn. Love ya, butyou watchers
are such prigs sometimes.

106
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,489
Painful, I was going to say.

107
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:21,372
Butyou're right. Accounts of
the final battles would be very helpful.

108
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:24,729
But there's no one left to tell the tales.

109
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,122
What?

110
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,651
Ow.

111
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:35,851
Wait. Not ow. Are you feelin' all right,
Slayer? This stuff usually hurts.

112
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:39,531
- Don't even start, Spike.
- What do you want?

113
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,332
Slayers. You killed two of them.

114
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,927
I did.

115
00:09:47,013 --> 00:09:49,288
You're gonna show me how.

116
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,523
There are quite a few American
beers that are highly underrated.

117
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,729
This, unfortunately, is not one of them.

118
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:06,647
Update, Spike. We're not here
to discuss the fine choice of hops.

119
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,851
It's about two slayers: one in China during
the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York.

120
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,367
Both got killed by you.

121
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:15,762
Tell the tale, you get the cash.

122
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:20,051
Right. You wanna learn all about how I
bested the Slayers and you wanna learn fast.

123
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:24,012
Right, then. We fought.
I won. The end. Pay up.

124
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:27,051
- That's not what I...
- What did you want? A quick demo?

125
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:30,125
A blow-for-blow description
you can map out and memorise?

126
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,443
It's not about the moves, love.

127
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:37,926
And since I agreed to your little proposition,
we can do this my way. Wings.

128
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:41,127
- What?
- Spicy buffalo wings.

129
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,522
Order me up a plate. I'm feelin' peckish.

130
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,610
Excuse me...

131
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:54,682
As I thought.
Some nasty thing got a taste of you.

132
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:58,088
Don't get all excited. I'm fine.

133
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:02,530
Right. Stuck with a creature you loathe,
diggin' up past uglies, cos you're fine.

134
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,531
- Just tell me what I wanna know.
- I told you.

135
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:07,968
No one's narrating
on an empty stomach here.

136
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:13,968
- Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
- Well, what can I tell you, baby?

137
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,362
I've always been bad.

138
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:21,330
Luminous. No.

139
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,926
Irradiant's better.

140
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,403
Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?

141
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:35,487
Quickly. I'm the very spirit of vexation.
What's another word for "gleaming"?

142
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:42,523
It's a perfectly perfect word as words go,
but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.

143
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:53,411
Cecily.

144
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:13,172
I merely point out that it's a mystery,
and the police should keep an open mind.

145
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:16,086
William, favour us with your opinion.

146
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:19,370
What do you make of this rash
of disappearances in our town?

147
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,489
Animals or thieves?

148
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,645
I prefer not to think of such dark,
ugly business at all.

149
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,644
That's what the police are for.

150
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:33,088
I prefer placing my energies
into creating things of beauty.

151
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:38,167
- I see. Well, don't withhold, William.
- Rescue us from a dreary topic.

152
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,811
Careful.

153
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:43,930
The inks are still wet.
Please, it's not finished.

154
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,004
Don't be shy.

155
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:50,406
"My heart expands.
'Tis grown a bulge in it,

156
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:53,929
Inspired by your beauty, effulgent."

157
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:56,484
Effulgent?

158
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,243
And that's actually
one of his better compositions.

159
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:14,088
Have you heard? They call him William the
Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry.

160
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:20,646
It suits him. I'd rather have a spike through
my head than listen to that awful stuff.

161
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:25,608
Cecily?

162
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:28,684
Leave me alone.

163
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:35,691
They're vulgarians.
They're not like you and I.

164
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,044
You and I?

165
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:44,447
I'm going to ask you a very personal question
and I demand an honest answer.

166
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,524
Do you understand?

167
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,768
Your poetry, it's...

168
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:54,892
They're not written about me, are they?

169
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,924
They're about how I feel.

170
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,724
Yes, but are they about me?

171
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,167
- Every syllable.
- God.

172
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,723
I know. It's sudden and...

173
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,767
Please, if they're no good,
they're only words,

174
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:19,402
but the feeling behind them...

175
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,530
- I love you, Cecily.
- Please, stop.

176
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:28,607
I know I'm a bad poet, but I'm a good man

177
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:34,851
and all I ask is thatyou try to see me...

178
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:38,648
I do see you. That's the problem.

179
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,044
You're nothing to me, William.

180
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,245
You're beneath me.

181
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,244
Watch where you're going.

182
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:35,885
And I wonder what possible catastrophe
came crashing down from heaven,

183
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:40,561
and brought this dashing stranger to tears?

184
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:44,289
Nothing. I wish to be alone.

185
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,964
I see you.

186
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:50,682
A man surrounded by fools
who cannot see his strength,

187
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:54,210
his vision, his glory.

188
00:15:56,493 --> 00:16:00,202
That and burning baby fish
swimming all around your head.

189
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,127
That's quite close enough.

190
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:09,373
I've heard tales of London pickpockets.
You'll not be getting my purse, I tell you.

191
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,244
Don't need a purse.

192
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:19,890
Your wealth lies here and here.

193
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:27,442
In the spirit and imagination.

194
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:34,087
You walk in worlds
the others can't begin to imagine.

195
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,210
Yes.

196
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,123
I mean, no.

197
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:45,205
I mean, Mother's expecting me.

198
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,528
I see whatyou want.

199
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:52,969
Something glowing and glistening.

200
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,044
Something...

201
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:58,970
effulgent.

202
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,884
Do you want it?

203
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:10,602
Yes.

204
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,365
God, yes.

205
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,364
Guys.

206
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,924
- Whatyou got?
- That's him.

207
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,484
Let's go.

208
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:50,881
- It sounds like a party.
- Forget about crashing.

209
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:54,886
There's too many of'em. We'll come back
at daybreak, when they're asleep.

210
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:58,688
It's OK. We can kill 'em
just as dead in the morning.

211
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:03,604
Nine in the corner.

212
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,688
So you traded up on the food chain.
Then what?

213
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,082
No, please.

214
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:13,291
Don't make it sound like something
you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel.

215
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:17,412
Becoming a vampire is
a profound and powerful experience.

216
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,726
I could feel this new strength
coursing through me.

217
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:25,408
Getting killed made me feel alive
for the very first time.

218
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:29,851
I was through living by society's rules.

219
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,484
Decided to make a few of my own.

220
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,483
Course, in order to do that,

221
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:41,843
I had to get myself a gang.

222
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:45,243
Perhaps it's my advancing years
that makes me so forgetful.

223
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,450
Remind me. Why don't we kill you?

224
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:51,807
What's that?

225
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,207
It's Spike now.

226
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:02,125
- You'd do well to remember it, mate.
- I'm notyour mate.

227
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:06,725
- And when did you start talking like that?
- We barely got out alive because of you.

228
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,327
Everywhere we go,
it's the same story and now...

229
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,928
You've got me and my women
hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft -

230
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:17,086
all because William the Bloody
likes the attention.

231
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:21,326
This is not a reputation we need.

232
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:25,201
I'm sorry. Did I sully our good name?
We're vampires.

233
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:28,445
- All the more reason to use finesse.
- Bollocks.

234
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:33,846
That stuffs for the frilly cuffs-and-collars
crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.

235
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,207
And every time you do,
we become the hunted.

236
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,361
I think our boys are going to fight.

237
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:44,365
The King of Cups expects a picnic.

238
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:49,212
- But this is not his birthday.
- Good point.

239
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:53,252
Yeah, you know what I prefer
to being hunted? Getting caught.

240
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:57,563
- That's a brilliant strategy. Pure cunning.
- Sod off.

241
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,453
Come on, when was
the last time you unleashed it?

242
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:08,607
All-out fight in a mob, back against the wall,
nothing but fists and fangs?

243
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,366
Don'tyou ever get tired of fights
you know you'll win?

244
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:15,003
No. A real kill, a good kill -
it takes pure artistry.

245
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,163
Without that, we're just animals.

246
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,164
Poofter.

247
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,764
Now you're gettin' it.

248
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,928
You can't keep this up forever.

249
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:42,526
If I can't teach you,
maybe someday an angry crowd will.

250
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:46,049
That or the Slayer.

251
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:50,647
What's a slayer?

252
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:54,164
After that, I was obsessed.

253
00:21:55,013 --> 00:22:00,246
To most vampires, the Slayer was the subject
of cold sweat and frightened whispers.

254
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,964
But I never hid.

255
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,684
Hell, I sought her out.

256
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:10,812
If you're looking for fun, there's death,
there's glory and sod all else, right?

257
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:13,407
- I was young.
- So how'd you kill her?

258
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,284
Funny you should ask.

259
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:22,289
Lesson the first:

260
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,887
a slayer must always reach for her weapon.

261
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,250
I've already got mine.

262
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:41,649
Good thing, too.

263
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:46,682
Become a vampire, you got
nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl.

264
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:49,684
That's you, honey.

265
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,284
Backthen,

266
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,684
it was her.

267
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,292
Just like I pictured it. This good for you?

268
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,963
I'm sorry, love,

269
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:35,123
I don't speak Chinese.

270
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,842
A fella could get used to this.

271
00:24:51,613 --> 00:24:56,926
Spike, look at the wonderful
mess you've made.

272
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,568
That's a slayer you've done in.

273
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:04,649
Naughty, wicked Spike.

274
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:31,565
You ever hear them say the blood
of a slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?

275
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:40,481
Here, now. Have a taste.

276
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:26,412
- So where have you two been?
- May I tell?

277
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,723
No need to be humble.

278
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:32,044
My little Spike just killed himself a slayer.

279
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:40,531
Congratulations.
I guess that makes you one of us.

280
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:45,725
Don't be so glum, mate. The way you tell it,
one slayer snuffs it, another one rises.

281
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,850
I figure there's a new Chosen One
getting chosen as we speak.

282
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:54,724
I'll tell you what, when and if this new bird
does show up, I'll give you first crack at her.

283
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:00,166
I smell fear.

284
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:04,212
- Yeah, this whole place reeks of it.
- It's intoxicating.

285
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:08,002
Let's get outta here.
This rebellion's startin' to bore me.

286
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,412
It was the best night of my life.

287
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,964
And I've had some sweet ones.

288
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,884
What are you lookin' at?

289
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:47,528
You got off on it.

290
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:51,049
Well, yeah. I suppose
you're telling me you don't?

291
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:56,961
How many of my kind
do you reckon you've done?

292
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:59,044
Not enough.

293
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:05,532
And we just keep comin'. Butyou can kill a
hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand,

294
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:11,370
and the armies of Hell besides
and all we need is for one of us

295
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:15,241
sooner or later to have the thing
we're all hoping for.

296
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:18,044
And that would be what?

297
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,208
One good day.

298
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,801
You asked and I'm tellin'.

299
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:32,249
The problem with you is you got
so good you think you're immortal.

300
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,484
Not really. I just know I can handle myself.

301
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:38,371
Then how do you explain this?

302
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,491
So that's it? Lesson over?

303
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,564
Not even close.

304
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:52,566
Come on.

305
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:59,643
Killed with her own weapon.

306
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,168
They ought to put this in a museum.

307
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:05,006
You know what they put in museums?

308
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,169
Mostly dead things.

309
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:31,411
Give it to me.

310
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:42,563
- What?
- Lesson the second: askthe right questions.

311
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:44,644
You want to know how I beat 'em?

312
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:51,124
The question isn't "How'd I win?".
The question is "Why'd they lose?".

313
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:54,444
What's the difference?

314
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,167
There's a big difference, love.

315
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,848
- How'd you kill the second one?
- A bit like this.

316
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:08,928
- That didn't hurt?
- I knew I couldn't touch you.

317
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:15,330
If there's no intent to hurtyou, then that chip
they shoved up my brain never activates.

318
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,483
lf, on the other hand...

319
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:26,571
- See? Now, that hurt.
- Yeah? This hurt, too?

320
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,163
Definite pain there.

321
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,448
How'd you kill 'em, Spike?

322
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:41,731
- You're not ready to know.
- I'm ready.

323
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:44,481
OK, then. Went like this.

324
00:30:56,173 --> 00:31:00,371
The first one was all business, but
the second, she had a touch of your style.

325
00:31:36,173 --> 00:31:40,610
She was cunning, resourceful.
And did I mention? Hot.

326
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:44,010
- I could've danced all night with her.
- Think we're dancing?

327
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:45,731
That's all we've ever done.

328
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:53,607
And the thing about the dance is,
you never get to stop.

329
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:58,683
Every day you wake up, the same question
haunts you: "Is today the day I die?"

330
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:08,212
Death is on your heels, baby,
and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.

331
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:17,932
And part of you wants it.
Not only to stop the fear and uncertainty,

332
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:20,811
but because you're just
a little bit in love with it.

333
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:40,007
Death is your art. You make it
with your hands, day after day.

334
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:46,369
That final gasp. That look of peace.
Part of you is desperate to know:

335
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:50,446
"What's it like? Where does it lead you?"

336
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:53,361
And now, you see, that's the secret.

337
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:56,525
Not the punch you didn't throw
or the kicks you didn't land.

338
00:32:56,613 --> 00:33:02,404
She merely wanted it.
Every slayer has a death wish.

339
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,644
Even you.

340
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:33,242
The only reason you've lasted as long
as you have is you've got ties to the world.

341
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:38,245
Your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies.

342
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:42,691
They all tie you here,
butyou're just puttin' off the inevitable.

343
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:47,849
Sooner or later, you're gonna want it.

344
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:53,172
And the second that happens,

345
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:56,373
you know I'll be there.

346
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,648
I'll slip in.

347
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:01,247
Have myself a real good day.

348
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:09,087
Here endeth the lesson.

349
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,207
I just wonder if you'll like it
as much as she did.

350
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:15,091
Get out of my sight, Spike. Now.

351
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,362
Did I scare ya?

352
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:23,162
You're the Slayer.
Do somethin' about it. Hit me.

353
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,809
Come on. One good swing.
You know you want to.

354
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:30,407
- I mean it.
- So do I.

355
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:32,723
Give it me good, Buffy. Do it.

356
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:34,804
Spike.

357
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,053
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,405
Come on. I can feel it, Slayer.

359
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:50,367
You know you wanna dance.

360
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:54,131
Say it's true.

361
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,608
Say I do want to.

362
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:04,571
It wouldn't be you, Spike.

363
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,889
It would never be you.

364
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,802
You're beneath me.

365
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:59,645
- Spike, what are you doing?
- "Beneath me"?

366
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:02,008
I'll show her.

367
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,482
Put her six bloody feet beneath me.

368
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:09,048
Hasn't got a death wish?

369
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:12,447
Bitch won't need one.

370
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:22,683
OK, I'm trying to be supportive here,
so don't drive a stake through my heart.

371
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:26,448
Butyou can't kill Buffy.

372
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:29,172
She's the Slayer.
She is so gonna kick your ass.

373
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,926
I've got two barrels here
that'll prove you wrong.

374
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:35,528
I knew you'd take this personally.
You are so sensitive.

375
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:39,013
How are you gonna kill her? Think.

376
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:42,768
The second you even point that thing at her,
you're gonna be all...

377
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:47,006
Then you'll get bitch-slapped up and
down Main Street unless she stakes you.

378
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:50,802
Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours,

379
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:54,882
but she'll be dead
just a little longer than that.

380
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:57,965
Fine. But don't come
crying to me when you fail.

381
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:01,881
You couldn't kill her before you got the chip.
You had plenty of chances.

382
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:07,043
- Why can'tyou kill her?
- You're the one who keeps bringin' her up.

383
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:10,330
I haven't said a word about
the Slayer since we left California.

384
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,608
She's on the other side of the planet, Dru.

385
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,088
Butyou're lying.

386
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:19,371
I can still see her floating
all around you, laughing.

387
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:24,802
Why? Why won'tyou push her away?

388
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:27,532
But I did, pet. I did it for you.

389
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:30,932
You keep punishing me.

390
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,243
Carrying on with creatures like this.

391
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:40,202
OK, you guys obviously have
a thing going on here.

392
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,602
I have to find my pleasures, Spike.

393
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:48,681
- You taste like ashes.
- So this is my fault now?

394
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:53,926
I didn't know she was seein' somebody.

395
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,566
- I should take off.
- Yeah, why don'tyou do that?

396
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,081
You can't blame the girl, Spike.

397
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:09,966
You're all covered with her.

398
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:13,612
I look atyou,

399
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:16,207
all I see is the Slayer.

400
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:25,725
- I put together that grocery list for you.
- Great. Thanks, hon.

401
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,966
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

402
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:34,285
- Have you seen my conditioner?
- Did you look under the sink?

403
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,727
Where are you going?

404
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:46,202
I was hoping to put this off, but...

405
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:51,564
You knowthe "nothing" that I've been
dealing with for the last couple of weeks?

406
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,803
It might not be nothing.

407
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,612
What is it?

408
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:03,126
I'm staying overnight at the hospital
for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.

409
00:39:05,453 --> 00:39:07,489
It's only one night.

410
00:39:07,573 --> 00:39:13,170
And they say, even if there is something,
it's still very early if they didn't see it before.

411
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:17,404
I'm gonna be fine.

412
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,202
I know you will.

413
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:16,647
What do you want now?

414
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:28,569
What's wrong?

415
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,284
I don't wanna talk about it.

416
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,328
Is there something I can do?
