1
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:33,281
Thanks for the relocate.
I perform better without an audience.

2
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,130
You were thinking, what,
a little helpless co-ed before bed?

3
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,927
You know very well, you eat this late...

4
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,683
you're gonna get heartburn.

5
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:03,003
Get it? Heartburn?

6
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,529
That's it?

7
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,604
That's all I get?

8
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:14,767
One lame-ass vamp with no appreciation
for my painstakingly thought-out puns.

9
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,130
I don't think the forces
of darkness are even trying.

10
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,489
I mean, you could make
a little effort here, you know?

11
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:25,484
Give me something to work with.

12
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,852
Watch your mouth, little girl.

13
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,050
You should know better
than to tempt the Fates that way.

14
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,762
Cos the Big Bad is back. And this time...

15
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,241
The Bronze is more fun this year, isn't it?

16
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,722
Cos of the gloating factor alone, you know.

17
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,850
We're all about college now.
We've got heady discourse.

18
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,208
No curfews, mom-and-popless hootenanny.

19
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,922
Co-ed dating prospects
who find townies sexy and dangerous.

20
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,448
- What, I can dream.
- Right.

21
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,843
So if college is so great, why are
we here and why is it more fun?

22
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:11,609
Because the Bronze is nice and familiar.
It's like a big, comfy blanky.

23
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,890
I was under the impression
that I was your big, comfy blanky.

24
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,761
You're my person blanky.
This is my place blanky.

25
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:22,445
With all the shock of the new,
it's nice to have one place

26
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,605
that you can come back to
where everything's predictable.

27
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:28,127
- Hello, all.
- Giles, trouble?

28
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:33,241
Oh, no, Buffy. Don't get up. Nothing like that.
I just, you know, I thought I'd drop by.

29
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:36,564
Latte, anyone? On me?

30
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:42,523
So much for your
"predictable blanky" theory, Will.

31
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,888
Sorry.

32
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,284
Splendid. Well, it's ages
since I've been to a gig.

33
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:59,051
Well, don't look that way.
I'm down with the new music.

34
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,363
And I have the albums to prove it.

35
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:05,048
Yes, but it's your cutting-edge
eight-tracks that keep you ahead.

36
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,567
Don't scoff. I've seen Giles' collection.

37
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,803
- He was an animal in his day.
- Thank you.

38
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:14,045
OK, why not? If the Stones
can still keep rolling, why can't Giles?

39
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,330
Exactly. I think it's brave that you're here.

40
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:20,769
Well, thank you, all.
You've made me feel right at home.

41
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,522
Well, isn't home that empty place
you're trying to escape?

42
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:31,289
Dip a finger in me

43
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,443
And paste my word...

44
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,845
- Oh, yeah. Veruca's playing tonight.
- Yeah, every Wednesday. I told you.

45
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:43,165
Let me be distraction

46
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:47,405
Let me be dream

47
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,246
So, Oz, what about Dingoes?
When are you guys here again?

48
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,567
Oh, we're up next Friday.

49
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:03,210
Dip a finger in me

50
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,804
They're good, aren't they?

51
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,527
Nothing special.

52
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,811
Yeah. She's quelle Fiona. Colour me bored.

53
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:17,883
Really? I think she's rather remarkable.
Such presence for someone her age.

54
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,683
I can feel you twist

55
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,606
I can feel you writhe

56
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:31,483
Because you're with me

57
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,204
It's in the sandblaster.

58
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,003
What's in the sandblaster, Will?

59
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,129
It's a dream. Come back to me.

60
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,722
All Geminis to the raspberry hats.

61
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:15,521
- Now you're fakin'.
- Am not.

62
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,364
Just a little.

63
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:27,167
- Morning.
- Morning.

64
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,605
- Bad dream?
- I guess.

65
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:34,046
But the waking-up part makes up for it.

66
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,811
It's always so busy in there.

67
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,884
Not always.

68
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:44,565
A few things shut my brain up completely.

69
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:48,482
Anything I can help you with?

70
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:56,005
I gotta get to class right now
but... tonight for sure.

71
00:06:57,173 --> 00:07:01,086
I don't know about tonight, unless
the extreme Jerry Garcia look turns you on.

72
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:04,850
Night before the full moon.

73
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:08,164
Oh, that's right. And I have a thing.

74
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:11,928
There's this Wicca group on campus
I wanted to check out.

75
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:15,369
They have orientation
on the three nights you're wolfy.

76
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,728
And it's probably totally silly, but...

77
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,407
Well, go. Show 'em how it's done.

78
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,611
Are you sure? You can lock yourself up?

79
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,289
It's only this one month. After orientation
they meet on different nights.

80
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:30,364
I'll be fine.

81
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,891
OK. As long as you don't mind.

82
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:38,847
The only thing I mind
is being away from you for three nights.

83
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,165
Ms Summers, I want you to prepare
to lead a discussion group

84
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:57,323
next class on the paper topic.

85
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:00,450
- That was smart work.
- What do I have to do?

86
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:04,489
If you have any questions,
bring them up with one of the TAs.

87
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,524
Are you OK? How'd you do?

88
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,165
This is good. I mean, this is excellent.

89
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,851
You did better than me. This is so unfair.

90
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:24,927
You made me jealous of you
academically. Buffy!

91
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,044
I know. Can you believe it?

92
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,012
Wow. I guess Professor Walsh
isn't so ogrey after all.

93
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:35,290
And she wants me
to lead a discussion group next class.

94
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:39,651
That means more work, right?
Shouldn't she have a better reward system?

95
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,567
You know, like a cookie
or a toy surprise, like at the dentist?

96
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,486
She wants you to lead a discussion group?

97
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,609
OK. Jealous again.

98
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,082
Jealous, jealous... OK, I'm back.

99
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:54,290
Hey, I'm meeting Oz at the café.
You wanna come?

100
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:56,728
I'll buy you that celebratory cookie.

101
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,964
Great. I'm TA-bound now
and then I will catch up with you guys.

102
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,044
Cool.

103
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,853
What are you gonna do, sit on the ground?

104
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,243
- My girlfriend's comin'.
- There's room.

105
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,730
Big lunch.

106
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:32,692
I like to eat. I hate chicks who are, like,
"Does it have dressing on it?"

107
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,365
Agreed.

108
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,683
- You guys were tight last night.
- I guess.

109
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:43,005
- The amps still sound dirty to me.
- What are you using? 50 or 120?

110
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,692
- Hey.
- Hey.

111
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,964
Hey.

112
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,044
You wanna sit down?

113
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:14,202
So you should be using a 50. Blue Voodoo -
not your best bet unless you dig the distort.

114
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:19,492
Music talk, huh? Cool.
I love to listen to Oz talk about the biz.

115
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:22,282
What do you like again? I know you told me.

116
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,887
There's a couple of good ones.
The Johnson Mil.

117
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:28,204
- The No.1 is Redbone.
- No.1? No. I gotta go with Hound Dog.

118
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:32,650
Me too. That's a great song.
I mean, Elvis, what a guy.

119
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,403
- You a big Elvis fan?
- The biggest.

120
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,848
Well, I mean, after Dingoes, of course.

121
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:43,130
We're actually talking amps. But it's easy
to get confused, the names they give 'em.

122
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:53,450
You know, I gotta bail. I'll call you later.

123
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:07,044
I should go, too.

124
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,844
Good shirt.

125
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,933
Check out the rapid exits. Was it me?

126
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,485
Me. I don't speak musicianese.

127
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:26,527
How come you didn't tell me I look like
a crazy birthday cake in this shirt?

128
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:30,049
- I thought that was the point.
- He thinks she's sexy.

129
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:34,172
He gets this blushy thing
going on behind his ears.

130
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:38,563
- That's for me only.
- It doesn't mean anything.

131
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,850
So Oz checks out another girl. He loves you.

132
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:45,972
I know. I know. And I don't
wanna be the kind of girl

133
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:49,887
who freaks every time
my boyfriend notices somebody else.

134
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:53,966
I mean, I have wrong feelings
about other guys sometimes,

135
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,602
but I feel guilty and I flog and punish.

136
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:02,050
Exactly. I'm sure Oz
is flogging and punishing himself...

137
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:05,170
This is sounding wrong before I even finish.

138
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:09,565
Look, I promise you, in a couple of days
it's gonna be like "Veruca who?"

139
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:12,453
- You think?
- Absolutely.

140
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,289
Oz just isn't the type to stray.

141
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:19,524
Not tonight, anyways.
He'll be locked in a cage.

142
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:06,084
Hello?

143
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,486
Oh, God!

144
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,404
Morning.

145
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:27,523
That was some night.

146
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,203
So it appears.

147
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,602
Right. You don't remember.

148
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:41,443
It's like that at first, but then little bits
and pieces'll start coming back to you.

149
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,243
- So you're a...
- Werewolf groupie.

150
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,561
Nobody else gets it done for me.

151
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,247
- What?
- Kidding.

152
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,164
You know what I am.

153
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,531
You've known
since the first time you saw me.

154
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,444
Now, you...

155
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,286
need to relax.

156
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,364
Not a possibility.

157
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,493
So what do you wanna do?

158
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,532
God!

159
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:25,049
The kids in this dorm
need Fashion 101 in a big way.

160
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,771
Or we could start right here at home.

161
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,243
I'm not making a statement.

162
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,928
Just wanna get back to my place,
figure out why we got out of our cages.

163
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:40,403
- You have a cage?
- Don't you?

164
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:45,569
Yeah. It has a little wheel with
a plastic ball and a cute little bell in it.

165
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,413
God! Somebody's domesticated
the hell out of you.

166
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:52,212
It's my choice. I don't wanna hurt anybody.

167
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:56,969
Maybe. Or maybe you just don't
wanna admit what happened to you.

168
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,886
Maybe you just wanna pretend
like you're a regular guy.

169
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:03,170
Well, I am.
I'm only a wolf three nights a month.

170
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:07,405
You're the wolf all the time,
and this human face is just your disguise.

171
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:09,688
You ever think about that, Oz?

172
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:13,049
I'm going to check the paper,
see if we did any damage last night.

173
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:15,124
We did.

174
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,524
But only to each other.

175
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:22,051
I know some part of you remembers that.

176
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:28,205
It doesn't take a full moon.
We could do it again...

177
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,204
right here.

178
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,328
We aren't going to.

179
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,768
This ends right now.

180
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,923
I can help you, Oz.

181
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,288
You're scared. I was, too.

182
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:47,002
But then I accepted it, the animal.
It's powerful.

183
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:52,326
Inside me all the time. Soon you just
start to feel sorry for everybody else

184
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:56,452
because they don't know what
it's like to be as alive as we are.

185
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,171
As free.

186
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,884
Free to kill people?

187
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:08,204
I won't do that.

188
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,568
You shouldn't.

189
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,644
You don't understand.

190
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,484
But you will.

191
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,962
You'll see that we belong together.

192
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:23,205
No. I know where I belong.

193
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,762
See ya tonight.

194
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:35,962
Two of them. It was unbelievable.
The fact that I survived at all is a miracle.

195
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,009
Excuse me, Ms Walsh.

196
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:40,687
Be careful when you walk
around campus after dark.

197
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,731
- I was attacked by wild dogs last night.
- Wild dogs?

198
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,929
- Two.
- Biggest things I've ever seen.

199
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:49,528
The first one was... well, for a moment
I thought it was a gorilla.

200
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:51,683
Did you have a question, Buffy?

201
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:55,288
No. No, I was just sayin' howdy.

202
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,523
Fine. See you in class.

203
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,844
Yeah?

204
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:11,404
- Hey.
- Hey.

205
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,491
- New look.
- You too.

206
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,648
Laundry day kinda came and went.

207
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:34,205
Hey, I'm sorry if I was weird yesterday

208
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,091
with you and Veruca.

209
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:39,482
I didn't notice anything.

210
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:44,251
Really? Cos I felt all spazzy.

211
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,642
No.

212
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:53,725
Good. Guess it was just me
worrying for nothin' again.

213
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:59,368
Me and my busy head,
always thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'.

214
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:05,532
Well, now you can stop. Everything's fine.

215
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:09,165
Maybe you could help me stop.

216
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:14,925
I'd really, really appreciate
anything you could do.

217
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,127
What? What's wrong?

218
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,562
Sorry, l...

219
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,528
- You don't want to?
- It's not that. I do. I just...

220
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:42,163
I didn't get any sleep, I guess.

221
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:44,768
I'm really beat.

222
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:46,844
Right.

223
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:50,606
Busy wolf night. I get it.

224
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:53,287
It's totally OK.

225
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:59,365
- Willow, you don't have to...
- No, I should. I don't have much time.

226
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,648
I'll see you later.

227
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,086
..treaty of1648
that ended the Thirty Years' War?

228
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:12,290
- Peace of Westphalia.
- Yalta?

229
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:14,648
- You moron!
- That's incorrect.

230
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,928
That dinette set should be mine.

231
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,405
Buffy! Excellent! Come in.

232
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,127
- Hi.
- Can I get you anything? Tea?

233
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,842
I made a very interesting moussaka
last night, if youre hungry.

234
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,766
Pass on the tea. And the... moose, thank you.

235
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:42,491
- You come on business, I hope?
- Yes. Lucky you, people may be in danger.

236
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:47,124
- I only meant that I'm at the ready.
- Here's the deal.

237
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:51,968
One of my professors said that she was
almost attacked by two wild dogs last night

238
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,089
under the light of a nearly full moon.

239
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,165
- Werewolves. Two of them?
- Could be.

240
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:03,327
Well, I've not seen anything about
the attacks in the newspapers or on the news.

241
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:06,007
- Have you spoken with Oz?
- My next stop.

242
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:09,085
Right. Get right on it.
I'll see what I can find out.

243
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,324
- And you report back to me.
- ASAP. Promise.

244
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:24,131
- Hey, Will. Mom let you in?
- She seemed cranky.

245
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:29,241
Yeah. We're having a little landlord-tenant
dispute, so I'm withholding rent.

246
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,052
An effective, and might I add, thrifty tactic.

247
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,363
- Why?
- She won't let me put a lock on my door.

248
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:37,331
I suspect she's afraid
I'll start having "the sex".

249
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,847
Yeah. Parents wait
till you're out of the house.

250
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,527
- Or under it.
- Or under it,

251
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:45,446
to start worrying about stuff like that.

252
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,728
It's mostly too late.

253
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:54,287
So, I know why I'm sitting in a dank,
sunless little room. But why are you?

254
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:56,762
Well, things with Oz are weird.

255
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:01,449
And I talked to Buffy about it,
but I think we're in guyville here.

256
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,206
I need a translator from the "Y" side of things.

257
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:07,330
Well, last time I checked,
I had the creds. Hit me.

258
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:14,450
What does it mean
when a girl wants to... you know...

259
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:18,363
If youre doing it,
I think you should be able to say it.

260
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,488
- Make love.
- Wild monkey love

261
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,643
or tender Sarah McLachlan love?

262
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,487
Any kind. But what if the girl wants to

263
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:31,087
and the guy doesn't?

264
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:34,370
- That's a bad sign, right?
- Could be.

265
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:39,891
Or she caught him in one of the seven
annual minutes he's too preoccupied to do it.

266
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:45,605
- Well, say the girl's been noticing...
- Will, I've deciphered your ingenious code.

267
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:50,972
OK. Say I've been noticing
Oz notice someone else.

268
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,725
- A woman.
- And is this chick noticing back?

269
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:57,123
Most definitely.

270
00:22:57,213 --> 00:23:00,410
Well... have you asked Oz about it?

271
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:05,445
Well, I thought about it, but then
he'll think I'm all jealous and worry.

272
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,127
But you are. And odds are, he feels it.

273
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,569
I'll bet that's all there is
to the weird you're feeling.

274
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:15,771
You guys should talk things out, Will.
You'll both feel better.

275
00:23:29,013 --> 00:23:30,162
Hey.

276
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,924
- Got out, huh?
- Yeah.

277
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:36,009
- Any news about attacks?
- No.

278
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:41,446
But I did hear about a woman
being chased by two wild dogs.

279
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:43,522
Two? Really?

280
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:47,322
You don't remember anything
like that, do you? Another wolf?

281
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:51,884
No. When the change comes,
it's like... I'm gone. Total blackout.

282
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:57,411
Well, if I find werewolf No.2 out on patrol
tonight, you might have a roomie in there.

283
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,284
Oz?

284
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,933
Oz, are you OK?

285
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:10,211
And if it's possible,
you seem more monosyllabic than usual.

286
00:24:11,813 --> 00:24:13,610
I'm OK. Thanks.

287
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:21,803
I step out of my skin

288
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:27,245
You wouldn't know me now

289
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:33,604
Couldn't you go away?

290
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:38,242
Shouldn't l?

291
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:45,965
Leave me the hard part

292
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:51,369
It's all I want

293
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,404
I need

294
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,727
I won't be

295
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,411
Your soft one

296
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,968
I won't be encircled

297
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:19,449
You might become

298
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:25,971
Something I need

299
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:33,448
To destroy

300
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:37,968
So this is why you called me here?

301
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,004
To see your Habitrail?

302
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:47,446
Right before sunset,
I get a little buzzed, you know?

303
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:49,125
Come here.

304
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:53,445
I'm not getting in that stupid cage with you,
if thats what this is all about.

305
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,524
We belong outside.

306
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:01,890
You can't run loose tonight. And not
just because you might hurt somebody.

307
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:05,010
I know people that'll be
out there, hunting for us.

308
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:08,608
So you're saying I should spend
the whole night with you.

309
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,003
Alone. Locked in a cage.

310
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:14,927
You'll be safe.

311
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:16,890
Not from you.

312
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:22,128
Isn't that the point
of this cosy little arrangement?

313
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:28,212
It's coming. Do you feel it?

314
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:33,730
- It's like blood boiling.
- I feel it.

315
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,131
I've wanted you even before I ever saw you.

316
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:42,211
I sensed you. Did you sense me?

317
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:47,253
- Come in here.
- Did you?

318
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:32,768
- Willow.
- Oh, my God.

319
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,170
Oh, my God.

320
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,042
I know what you saw. It wasn't...

321
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:52,572
I had to. I had to lock her in there with me.

322
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,889
I bet.

323
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,362
She's like me. A wolf.

324
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:02,169
Well, I knew you two
had a lot in common, but...

325
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:04,926
Don't touch me!

326
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:10,967
She was gonna hurt somebody.
I didn't have a choice.

327
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,650
But you did. You could've told somebody.

328
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:20,129
Your solution... just put you two
together in a room all night?

329
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:24,329
- Girl's got a point.
- Leave.

330
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:26,684
- I'm just sayin'...
- Now!

331
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:37,366
- I'm sorry.
- I knew.

332
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,290
I knew, you jerk.

333
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:46,887
And you sat there
and you told me everything was fine?

334
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,004
And that's as bad as... as...

335
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,168
I know how it feels. I remember.

336
00:28:56,373 --> 00:29:00,810
So, what, this is payback? I had this coming?

337
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:05,127
- No, it's not...
- Because I thought that was behind us.

338
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:10,246
And you know, what happened with Xander,
it doesn't compare.

339
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:18,009
Not with what you and I had. Not with
whatever you've been doing with her.

340
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:20,288
I don't know what Veruca and I have done.

341
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:24,924
When I change, it's like...
it's like I'm gone and the wolf takes over.

342
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:29,845
But before this, when you were regular Oz,

343
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,847
you had feelings for her, didn't you?

344
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:36,925
No. I could sense something, but...

345
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:39,004
But you wanted her.

346
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:42,566
Like, in an animal way?

347
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:48,563
Like, more than you wanted me?

348
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,691
Willow!

349
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:27,088
- Willow, are you OK?
- Thank you. I was too far away.

350
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,884
It was lucky. She almost got hit.

351
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:32,004
Willow, what's the matter?

352
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,364
Maybe you should take her home.

353
00:30:38,613 --> 00:30:42,162
Whatever it is,
it's not worth hurting yourself over.

354
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,083
I have to go.

355
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:53,324
I have to find Veruca before the sun sets.

356
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:57,565
I will, though.
When I do, this thing stops. She's bad news.

357
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,365
Do you want me to get you
something before I take off?

358
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,011
Kleenex?

359
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:09,402
Chocolaty... chocolate anything?

360
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,686
No.

361
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:14,810
I'll come back as soon as this is finished.

362
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:17,691
I just want you to take it easy, OK?

363
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,764
Riley was right.

364
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,805
The main thing is
put the blame where it belongs.

365
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:25,851
- Don't hurt yourself.
- OK.

366
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,924
OK.

367
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:33,287
- You're OK?
- I'm fine. I promise.

368
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:35,644
I love you.

369
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:47,162
"Put the blame where it belongs."

370
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,324
So you haven't seen her around?

371
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,884
OK. Thanks, man.

372
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:11,482
- Where is she?
- I don't know. I checked all the usual haunts.

373
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:15,088
But I know the areas we're drawn to.
I'm sure I can follow her scent.

374
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:18,768
- We'll try that, then.
- Look, Buffy, you should know that...

375
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:23,051
Oz. Now might be a good time
for your trademark stoicism.

376
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:39,365
I conjure thee...
by Borabis, by Satanis and the devil.

377
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:45,244
As thou art burning, let Oz and Veruca's
deceitful hearts be broken.

378
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,090
This way!

379
00:32:58,453 --> 00:33:03,163
I conjure thee, by the Saracen Queen
and in the name of Hell.

380
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,927
Let them find no love or solace.

381
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:09,004
Let them find no peace as well.

382
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,049
She's near here.

383
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,124
I can smell her.

384
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:22,565
Or the dirty pile of clothing
she left on the ground.

385
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:26,407
They could be from the other night
when she turned into a werewolf.

386
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:30,964
Unless she wanted to throw you off the scent.

387
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,762
Willow!

388
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:44,688
Let this image seal his fate.

389
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,367
Not to love, only hate.

390
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:06,204
For a minute I thought
you might actually play rough.

391
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,522
Sometimes you have to, you know?

392
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:15,842
To keep what's yours,
sometimes you have to kill.

393
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:24,244
Well, how about that?
The sun's almost down.

394
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:44,286
Can't say I'm surprised
you didn't go through with your little hex.

395
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,729
- You don't have the teeth.
- You don't know what I have.

396
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:51,488
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know what you love.

397
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,772
I have his scent on me right now.

398
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,845
- Don't touch her again.
- Come stop me.

399
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,644
I like it rough, remember?

400
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:12,164
You wanna hurt me, hurt me.
You leave her out of this.

401
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:15,609
How can l? She's the reason
you're living in cages.

402
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:20,968
She's blinding you. When she's gone,
you'll be able to admit what you are.

403
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:27,845
You don't wanna find out what I am.

404
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,924
You're an animal.

405
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,888
Animals kill.

406
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,124
You're right.

407
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:42,249
We kill.

408
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,764
Oz?

409
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,966
I'm not quite sure I understand.

410
00:37:11,053 --> 00:37:13,692
There was just so much
going on with Oz and Willow.

411
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,606
There still is.
But I just thought you should know.

412
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:20,208
This fellow in the woods,
he was in military garb?

413
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,523
And he was toting some serious weaponry.

414
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:26,447
The thing is, I saw some guys dressed
exactly like him on Halloween night.

415
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,763
I just assumed they were in costume.

416
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:32,603
- But maybe they were working.
- I wanna know what's up.

417
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:36,686
The guy got in my way.
I almost didn't catch up with Oz in time.

418
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:41,562
- And as it was, I was too late to...
- You saved Willow.

419
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:44,242
Right now she wishes I hadn't.

420
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,007
Giles, I've never seen her like this.

421
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:52,371
It's like it hurts too much to form words.

422
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:57,251
You've felt that way yourself
and you got through it.

423
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:01,406
Yeah. I ran away and went to hell
and then got through it.

424
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:06,048
- I'm hoping she doesn't use me as a model.
- Fair enough.

425
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:10,330
I just don't know
how they're gonna deal with this.

426
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,568
Hello.

427
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,804
Hi.

428
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:34,965
What are you doing?

429
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:40,444
I'm going.

430
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:45,084
Now?

431
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:51,126
- That's your solution?
- That's my decision.

432
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:55,611
- Don't I get any say in this?
- No.

433
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:03,924
Veruca was right about something.

434
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:06,846
The wolf is inside me all the time.

435
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:12,241
And I don't know where that line
is any more, between me and it.

436
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:16,887
And until I figure out what that means,

437
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,122
I shouldn't be around you.

438
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,723
Or anybody.

439
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:25,929
Well, that could be a problem.

440
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:30,803
Cos people... kind of a planetary epidemic.

441
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,884
I'll find someplace.

442
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,249
Well, how long?

443
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,767
I don't know.

444
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,769
Oz,

445
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:47,447
don't you love me?

446
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:52,249
My whole life...
I've never loved anything else.

447
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:11,608
Oh, God. Oz.

448
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:26,647
