<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:03,662
Anya!

3
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,624
l thought you were with Giles
studying how to not kill people.

4
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:07,456
l just got back.

5
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,935
Are you asking me to be a counsellor?

6
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:13,701
Spike's insane in the basement,
Xander's there doing construction.

7
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:16,425
- l was wondering why l...
- Have this job?

8
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,064
l still haven't finished college.

9
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,865
These students need someone
who understands them.

10
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:23,619
l need someone
who understands these students.

11
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,584
- You did good work on her. She looks good.
- Thanks.

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,261
- She's all set for the service tomorrow.
- Good.

13
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:46,379
- All right then. l'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.

14
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,816
- Hey!
- Sorry.

15
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:16,422
33 minutes. Since when do we go to
all this trouble for one lousy vampire?

16
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:19,100
Excuse me, one lousy <i>potential</i> vampire.

17
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,905
Vampire by vampire.
lt's the only way l know.

18
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:23,385
<i>(knocking)</i>

19
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,420
l think this thing has
a freakin' child lock on it.

20
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:36,340
- Shh!
- l'm not the shortest one here.

21
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:39,577
- l don't know why l had the kid coffin.
- l know it's my job...

22
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,863
No. l'm sorry. l wanna help.

23
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:46,018
l've been stressed lately.
l'm sorry l took it out on you.

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,745
No big. Been kinda stressed myself.

25
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,545
The whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.

26
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,015
She's here, but not "part of the gang" here,

27
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:57,940
and hopefully not "under my feet here
in another time dimension" here.

28
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:03,100
There is Willow. There's the looming
humungo bad. And it's a school night.

29
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:07,498
l should be cuddling up to my insomnia,
worrying about how l'll mess up tomorrow.

30
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,656
You'll be fine. A great counsellor.

31
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:14,376
lt's my first week talking to the kids.
What if their problems are weird and tricky?

32
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:18,744
l think you underestimate your familiarity
with the world of weird and tricky.

33
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:22,421
- This job's perfect for you.
- Check out perfect me.

34
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:25,464
Taking my sister
on an educational outing to the...

35
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,695
Dead body.

36
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:29,823
l don't know. Amateur opinion here,
but she looks dead.

37
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:32,500
l mean like natural-causes dead.

38
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,339
The paper said she had
unusual cuts on her neck.

39
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:40,500
Maybe she cut herself shaving
and then died naturally of embarrassment.

40
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,702
- She looks...
- <i>(Buffy)</i> Peaceful.

41
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:45,581
l am not peaceful.

42
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,783
That l can help with.

43
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:55,217
l always thought closed caskets
were more tasteful anyway.

44
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,460
Hello?

45
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,537
Come in!

46
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,059
Hi.

47
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,704
Mr Miller sent me here.

48
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,059
- Do you know why?
- l'm not sure.

49
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,143
Maybe cos this guy was picking on me.

50
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:32,294
- l don't wanna talk to you.
- OK. That's fine.

51
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:36,015
- l'm serious. l don't wanna talk.
- OK.

52
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:40,543
You know, l hate to miss bio, but
l thought it was best l come speak with you.

53
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:43,902
- So, what's on your mind?
- On my mind?

54
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,580
Are you worried about school?

55
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:52,376
- Friends, girls, your parents?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it. My parents.

56
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,900
- So, what about them?
- Um...

57
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,181
lssues of divorce.

58
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,735
You know, it's awful being teased.

59
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:03,738
But the thing is, with bullies, they're just...

60
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:05,703
lnsecure?

61
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,822
Yeah, everyone says that.

62
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:11,819
You know, l'm really tired
of everyone being so insecure.

63
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,816
Divorce is terrible.
My parents got divorced when l was a kid.

64
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:28,704
Yeah, my parents are happily married.

65
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,504
lt's hard.

66
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,781
l feel left out.

67
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,660
But l'm also concerned about girls.

68
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,936
OK, l'm just bored.

69
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,696
Maybe l should get back to bio?

70
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,018
Stick up for yourself.

71
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:54,384
You need to show this bully that you're not
gonna take any more of his sh... guff.

72
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,538
- Any guff.
- Cos that's what l did.

73
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:03,258
l stuck up for myself. The other day after
class, l jumped him in the parking lot,

74
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,861
and slammed his stupid-ass insecure face
right into the pavement.

75
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,425
You what?

76
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:12,499
l guess that's another reason
Mr Miller wanted me to see you.

77
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,542
Do you think
l should pound on him some more?

78
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,778
- l bet she's giving them great advice.
- Absolutely.

79
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:24,304
Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking
out for them. l just wish she believed it.

80
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:29,904
She's still stressing over the whole "dropped
out of college, not actually qualified" thing.

81
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:33,262
Plus the salivating Hellmouth
under her feet and the whole...

82
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,702
"From beneath you, it devours."
Not the friendliestjingle.

83
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:40,984
lt's no "l like lke" or
"Milk: it does a body good."

84
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,217
l know. lt's gonna be bad.

85
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:48,185
lt's gonna be real bad.
And l wonder, will l...

86
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:53,135
Well, if it comes, when it comes,
will l be able to help?

87
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,419
- l think so.
- l don't know.

88
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:59,145
l don't know what l can do.

89
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:03,936
- Frankly, l'm scared of what l might do.
- Yeah, l get that.

90
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:09,384
Figuring out how to control your magic
seems a lot like hammering a nail.

91
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,503
Fine, hear me out.
So you're hammering, right?

92
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,544
lf you hold the end,
you have the power, but no control.

93
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:18,982
lt takes two strokes to hit the nail in,
or you could hit your thumb.

94
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,943
- Ouch.
- So you choke up.

95
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:25,781
Control, but no power. lt could take
like ten strokes to knock the nail in.

96
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,903
Power, control. lt's a trade-off.

97
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:32,422
- That's actually not a bad analogy.
- Thanks.

98
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,339
Except l'm less worried
about hitting my thumb,

99
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:38,623
and more worried about
going all black-eyed baddie

100
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:43,143
and bewitching that hammer into cracking
my friends' skulls open like coconuts.

101
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,217
Right. Ouch.

102
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:47,943
Sorry.

103
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:52,336
Xander, being back here. l don't know...

104
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,097
lt'll take time.

105
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,784
Are you sure you're ready for this?

106
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,343
Hey.

107
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,217
lt's me.

108
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,580
l'm scared.

109
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,865
l don't wanna be left all alone.
My brother's joining up with the marines.

110
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,938
You know, if he knew l was making
a fool of myself, he'd smack me in my head.

111
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,462
- l'm being stupid.
- Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.

112
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:28,664
Yeah, you know, he's a man.
l'm just all messed up right now.

113
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:32,864
You are not messed up. lt's not
messed up to worry about your brother.

114
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:38,259
What if he doesn't come back?
What if he gets blown up?

115
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,656
Have you talked to him?
Have you told him how you feel?

116
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,021
No. No, l don't wanna talk to him.

117
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:46,859
l don't wanna do that.
l don't wanna talk to him.

118
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,937
- OK.
- D'you understand?

119
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:54,536
- So, Josh, what's on your mind?
- Well, l'm worried that l'm gay.

120
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:59,256
OK, first of all, l think it's great that
you would come and talk to me about this.

121
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:04,978
And second of all, you should know there is
nothing shameful about being gay. Nothing.

122
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,261
l know. lt's just...

123
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:11,180
l'm not positive,
so l was thinking that...

124
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:15,817
Why don't you go on a date with me
so l can be sure?

125
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:25,018
lt sounds like it's difficult for you.

126
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:29,384
Like maybe your sister makes it hard
for you to establish your own identity.

127
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:34,096
You said she's controlling, she doesn't
let you make your own decisions...

128
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:40,341
- And she borrows my clothes without asking.
- l understand. That must be hard.

129
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,941
- So, you're not doing your homework?
- l guess not.

130
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:49,862
lt all just... seems kind of... whatever.

131
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,902
High school can seem frustrating.

132
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,944
But if you just get through it,
you can go to college,

133
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:58,780
or you can join the French foreign legion,
or anything you want.

134
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,302
Yeah, well,
l'm not gonna do all that stuff.

135
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:05,025
OK, no foreign legion. l get that.

136
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:10,817
Changing your name, and being indentured
for all those years, and occupying Algeria...

137
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:13,181
l'm not graduating from high school.

138
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:17,100
- Why not?
- l really like that shirt. Where'd you get it?

139
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:22,055
Cassie, don't change the subject.
Why won't you graduate?

140
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:25,540
Because next Friday l'm gonna die.

141
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,662
- What?
- Can we talk about something else?

142
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,943
- No, we have to talk about this.
- Just...

143
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,974
- Never mind.
- What makes you feel like this?

144
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,304
- Feel like what?
- Like you wanna hurt yourself.

145
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:51,904
Oh, l'm not gonna commit suicide
if that's what you're saying. No way.

146
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:54,659
OK. Then what are you saying?

147
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,534
l don't mean to be a pain. You seem nice.
l know you're just trying to help.

148
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:02,665
- But l'm wasting your time.
- No, you're not. This is why l'm here.

149
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,941
Why do you think you're gonna die?

150
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:08,655
l don't think it, l know it. l just know.

151
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:12,705
What do you mean, you know? Are you
saying that someone's going to hurt you?

152
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,936
- Has someone threatened you?
- No.

153
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,143
No, l just know that next Friday l'm gonna die.

154
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:21,821
Some things l just know.
l don't know how, l just do.

155
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,385
- Like l know there will be coins.
- Coins?

156
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,503
Mm-hm. Lots of coins.

157
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:31,577
Weird ones.

158
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:36,694
And l know that you'll go someplace
dark underground. l don't know.

159
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:40,017
- What do you mean, "underground"?
- l know you'll try to help...

160
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:44,304
- l don't understand what you're saying.
- But you can't, OK?

161
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:50,101
l gotta go. Trig. l don't want Mr Corrigan
sending me to Principal Wood again.

162
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,495
- Please...
- Thanks for being so nice.

163
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:56,784
l do like that shirt. You should put a sweater
on so it doesn't get stained. l gotta go.

164
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,336
- Cassie, wait, please...
- Gotta go.

165
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,781
- What am l supposed to do?
- You did it.

166
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,539
- You reported the situation to me.
- And?

167
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:09,575
Listen, it's hard. Kids this age, they're hurting,
they're pissed off, and they say things.

168
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,100
Sometimes they say awful things.

169
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:16,782
When l was in high school, l had a thing
with this guy, right? Real bully.

170
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:22,304
l told everyone that he'd better sleep with
one eye open cos l was gonna bust his ass.

171
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:27,585
Well, l got suspended. Talk like that is taken
pretty seriously where l come from.

172
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,896
The hood?

173
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,454
Beverly Hills.

174
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,344
Which is <i>a</i> hood.

175
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,502
Listen, the point is,
l was talking big because l was scared.

176
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,817
l couldn't bust a move,
let alone someone's ass.

177
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:47,263
Most of the time, that's what it is
when these students act out. Fear, pain.

178
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:50,418
But sometimes it's notjust talk, right?

179
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:55,580
Every time there's a threat like this, we do the
same dance. lnform teachers, search lockers.

180
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,784
But we can't know what's gonna happen.
We can't search their brains.

181
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:03,142
We just... We just do what we can.

182
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:08,505
lt's not enough. l need to fix this. l don't
usually get a heads-up before somebody dies.

183
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:12,261
- What do you mean, "usually"?
- No. Not since...

184
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:18,021
l mean, l'm sure it's not usual
to get a chance to stop something like...

185
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,779
l need to do something.
l have to make this better.

186
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,299
Oh! Oh.

187
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,183
Shoot.

188
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,618
l have a job for you.

189
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,904
What are you drawing?

190
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,705
Don't you have a history test to study for?

191
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:46,823
When are you gonna design me a tattoo?

192
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:50,455
A tattoo? Oh, right. l can imagine that.

193
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:54,698
Come on. Design something
and maybe we can get matching tattoos.

194
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:58,257
How about like a snake
with some fire coming out of its mouth?

195
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,701
Or a sexy hula girl
that wiggles when you flex?

196
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:04,699
Yeah, now you're talking. Sexy hula girl.
But a sexy snake hula girl.

197
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:05,980
<i>(Cassie laughs)</i>

198
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,819
You are so ridiculous.

199
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:13,818
So, l was thinking...
maybe we should go to that dance after all.

200
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,939
What do you mean?
l told you l don't wanna go.

201
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,859
l assumed you were kidding.

202
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:24,178
- lt'll probably be lame anyways.
- Well, yeah, but lame is funny.

203
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:28,054
And, you know, maybe fun if,
you know, we're hanging out together.

204
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:31,661
- We hang out together all the time.
- Right.

205
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:36,058
And therefore we should hang out
together at the winter formal.

206
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,501
Hey. Um...

207
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:43,216
l'm in ceramics class with you.
l'm Dawn Summers.

208
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:46,696
l forgot if we had
an assignment last week. l spaced.

209
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,697
Right. Um...

210
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:52,825
Hey, Dawn. Yeah, we did have an assignment,
but l didn't write it down.

211
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,374
l think something to do with glazes.

212
00:15:55,466 --> 00:16:00,779
As scintillating as the pottery talk is,
l'd better actually go study.

213
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,254
- l'm Mike, by the way.
- Hi.

214
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,383
- l'm sorry. l didn't mean to...
- Don't worry about it.

215
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,459
l better go hit the books if l'm gonna
ace this test. Nice meeting you.

216
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,344
- Cass, l'll see you later?
- Yep.

217
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:21,017
- Hey, Mike, you're gonna get a B.
- Oh, A-plus, baby, A-plus.

218
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,783
So, is that any good?

219
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:29,336
- Yeah. Actually, yeah.
- What do you have to read it for?

220
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:32,099
Oh, just for me, l guess.

221
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:35,656
l stopped reading homework assignments.
l just read what l want.

222
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,864
That's so cool. l'd do that, but my sister
would be down my neck in a second.

223
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,902
Summers.

224
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:45,103
Hey, are you the counsellor's little sister?

225
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,539
No.

226
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:49,982
She's <i>my</i> sister. Lucky me, huh?

227
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:53,536
No, no, she's really nice.
l actually just saw her this morning.

228
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,856
Oh, really? What about?

229
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,941
l'm sorry, that's none of my business.

230
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,586
No, l don't care.

231
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,578
So, Mike's a cutie.
Are you guys going to that dance?

232
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,703
- No, l don't think so.
- Oh.

233
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:13,984
- l mean, didn't he ask you?
- Only like 105 times.

234
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,945
- And you said no?
- 106 times.

235
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,860
No, l can't go.
l'm not gonna be around that night.

236
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,256
Cassie's records all show the same thing.

237
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:30,225
Good grades, good kid,
then, all of a sudden, not-so-good grades,

238
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:34,219
absenteeism, comments
about apathy and depression.

239
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,615
- So the question is, what changed?
- Right.

240
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,345
lf she did have psychic vision,
that would explain it.

241
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,099
Do you really think this girl
is some kind of precog?

242
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,576
l don't know.
l told you about the shirt, right?

243
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:50,535
You spilled coffee. l'm not saying you don't
have Slayer grace, but it's not the first time.

244
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:56,383
Maybe you're trying so hard to help you're
seeing paranormal when there's just normal.

245
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,740
Maybe. But maybe not.

246
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:05,378
- You want me to check her medical records?
- Her doctor already sent them.

247
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:11,540
Strep throat. Ear infections.
Yeast infections. None of my business.

248
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,617
No real info here.

249
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:16,539
- Have you Googled her yet?
- Willow, she's 17.

250
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:19,857
lt's a search engine. Look.

251
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,665
OK, let's see what Cassie Newton pulls up.

252
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:26,144
Hey, look. Check this.
She's got her own site.

253
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:29,616
A day and a half of researching,
and we finally try looking up her.

254
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,424
Wow, that's a lot of poems.

255
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,862
Poems. Always a sign
of pretentious inner turmoil.

256
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:40,061
"The sheets above me cool my skin,
like dirt on a madwoman's grave."

257
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:44,936
"l rise into the moonlight white
and watch the mirror stare."

258
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,586
"The pale fish looks back at me."

259
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,816
"Pale fish will never swim."

260
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,374
"My skin is milk for no man to drink."

261
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,344
"My thighs unused, unclenched."

262
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,860
"This body is not ready yet."

263
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:02,098
"But dirt waits for no woman,
and coins will buy no time."

264
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,617
"l hear the chatter of the bugs.
lt's they alone will feast."

265
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:08,900
OK.

266
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:12,376
- Death really is on her brain.
- We all deal with death.

267
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:16,095
This girl isn't dealing.
She's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss.

268
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,939
- She has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
- l don't know.

269
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,814
l mean, a lot of teens post some
pretty angsty poetry on the web.

270
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:27,855
l even posted a melodramatic love poem
or two back in the day.

271
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,618
Love poems?

272
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,743
- l'm over you now, sweetie.
- Love poems.

273
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:36,421
Look, all l'm saying
is that this is normal teen stuff.

274
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:40,977
You join chat rooms, you write poetry,
you post Doogie Howser fanfic.

275
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:45,415
lt's all normal, right?
Let's see what other sites there are.

276
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,861
You guys are way off track.
l got a hunch.

277
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:51,222
Oh, wait, no. Here's something.
No, that's Phillip Newton.

278
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,456
No, that's her dad. Open it.

279
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:57,505
Guys, l'm telling you.
l got this case cracked wide open.

280
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:00,817
l got the perp fingered.
l told you about Mike Helgenburg?

281
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:03,136
- The guy that asked her to the dance?
- Right.

282
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,504
The one that keeps asking her to the dance.
l'm thinking, who likes to be rejected?

283
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,295
Nobody. l'm thinking,
some people can't handle the rejection.

284
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,219
- l'm thinking that...
- Hey, l got something.

285
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:19,903
Whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing
the peace. There's a lot of charges here.

286
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,546
- Her dad's a drunk?
- A violent drunk?

287
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:28,019
We'd better find out. l have his address
right here. You got your keys?

288
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:30,666
- Yeah.
- Guys, l'm telling you.

289
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:35,740
l'm liking Mike Helgenburg for the perp.
Let's collar him before he... lawyers up.

290
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:42,019
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
would break down this door.

291
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:44,859
And Buffy the counsellor?

292
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,618
Waits.

293
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,935
- Mr Newton?
- That's right.

294
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,335
l work at your daughter's school.

295
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,065
l need to talk to you.

296
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,297
So, is she screwing up her grades again?

297
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:07,857
Because she's not
the sharpest apple in the barrel.

298
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:11,336
She's got some problems. But it's...

299
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:14,065
- lt's you we wanted to talk about.
- What about?

300
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:16,740
We know you've been picked up by the police.

301
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:21,377
We wanted to know if you still... drink a lot.

302
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,616
What's that got to do with Cassie?

303
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:29,064
Frankly, we were worried that you might
drink too much and hurt Cassie.

304
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,655
- That's all.
- Oh.

305
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,938
l see. That's all.

306
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,175
You just come in here
in the middle of the night, into my home,

307
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,942
and start accusing me
of beating on my daughter? That's all?

308
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:49,541
- We just wanna make sure that Cassie's...
- Well, that's a lie!

309
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:55,496
Who told you this? Did Cassie's mother
put you up to this, cos l pay my support, OK?

310
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,383
To the dime.

311
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:03,462
She just wants to take away the one weekend
a month l get to be with my girl.

312
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,980
- Which is when?
- What?

313
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,057
Which weekend is it?

314
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,584
l just had her last weekend.

315
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:13,978
Look.

316
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:22,060
l may not be the greatest dad in the world,
but l don't beat up my daughter.

317
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:25,980
So, you won't be seeing her this Friday, then?

318
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:30,215
Not unless my ex-wife
gets a personality transplant.

319
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,501
- OK.
- OK, what?

320
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,666
OK now you'll get out of my house?

321
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:38,214
Yeah, we will.

322
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,417
lt's not him.

323
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,864
He's not the one who does it.

324
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:56,575
Thank you for trying, but l probably
shouldn't have told you anything.

325
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:00,375
You're making such a big deal out of it,
and l want it to all just go away.

326
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:03,822
- Are you talking about killing yourself?
- No, of course not.

327
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:07,103
- Then fight. Try.
- There's no point. l told you...

328
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,495
Doesn't sound like someone
who wants to live.

329
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,658
You think l want this? You think l don't care?

330
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:17,456
Believe me, l want to... be here, do things.

331
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:23,817
l wanna graduate from high school,
and l wanna go to the stupid winter formal.

332
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:30,105
l have this friend, and...
it would be fun to go with him.

333
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,375
Just to dance and hear lame music.

334
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,900
To wear a silly dress and laugh and stuff.

335
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,975
l'd like to go.

336
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:47,422
There's a lot of stuff l'd like to do.

337
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:51,385
l'd love to ice-skate at Rockefeller Center.

338
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:54,060
l'd love to see my cousins grow up,

339
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:57,980
cos they're really mean
and l think they're gonna be fat.

340
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:01,263
l'd love to backpack across the country or...

341
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,184
l don't know, fall in love.

342
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:11,861
But l won't. l just never will.

343
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:16,383
You will. Cassie, you will.
You just have to tell us what you know.

344
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:19,299
You have to tell us everything.
Please, help us.

345
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:21,456
l can't. l just know it's gonna happen.

346
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:26,745
l don't know why and l don't know how,

Nothing.

There's evil.

Her name is Cassie Newton.
Please, do you know anything specific?

Well, there's nothing in this one.

What've you got?

394
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:03,621
- Where's your hall pass?
- Free period.

395
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:06,174
You seem kind of upset.
Something on your mind?

396
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:10,145
No, not really.
Well, l got a lousy B in Egyptian history.

397
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,786
Knew this stuff cold,
so that pisses me off.

398
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:15,903
- You get pissed off a lot?
- No, l...

399
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:19,820
Let me cut to the chase. l hear you can't
get a date for the winter formal.

400
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:23,694
Whoa, look. l know it's yourjob
to talk to kids with problems,

401
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:26,903
but honestly, l don't have any. l'm fine.

402
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:31,059
All right, it's really no big deal.
l have a friend that l really wanted to take.

403
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,698
l don't know. l guess
she doesn't see me that way.

404
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:37,095
- She makes me crazy.
- Crazy?

405
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:40,098
Yeah, sometimes l just...

406
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:45,615
That's... that's funny.
You're Dawn's sister, right?

407
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:46,775
Uh...

408
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:49,175
That's right. Dawn is <i>my</i> sister.

409
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:52,303
Oh, that's so weird.
l was just thinkin' about her.

410
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:57,103
l was thinkin' if, you know,
Cassie won't budge, maybe l'll ask Dawn.

411
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:01,896
You aren't mad at Cassie,
with her rejecting you like that?

412
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,135
Nah.

413
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:07,458
She's a girl right? Making boys crazy
is like yourjob description.

414
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:14,946
You're asking my sister to the dance,
and she's your <i>second</i> choice?

415
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,624
l'll be keeping an eye on you.

416
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:27,339
Seems like someone's
got quite a coin collection, huh?

417
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:34,095
You wanted to see me?

418
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,222
You have locker number 281?

419
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:38,820
Yeah, why?

420
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:43,821
l want you to tell me what this is,
and what this has to do with Cassie Newton.

421
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:47,262
- l don't know. lt's late. l'll miss my bus.
- l know it's late.

422
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,783
That's why l don't have time to mess around.
So you need to talk to me. Now.

423
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,460
Believe me, if l knew anything, l'd tell you.

424
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:57,060
l just... don't.

425
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,256
You know why l came back
to Sunnydale High?

426
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,940
- To creep me out?
- To help.

427
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:09,024
l'm a counsellor here because l wanna help.

428
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:12,985
l know what it's like to walk these halls
and feel lost, alone.

429
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:16,820
l just wanna make things better. Connect.

430
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:23,783
And l'll connect with your face if you don't
stop wasting my time and help me do my job.

431

l...

432
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:28,539
- Please...
- A girl could die.

433

She's some weirdo suicidal poet girl.

434
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,214

They've got this plan...

- What?
- Buffy told you about me, right?

439
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,536
- She told you to pretend to be my friend?
- No.

440
00:31:56,626 --> 00:32:00,665
Maybe. Cassie, she was scared.
She wanted to help you.

441
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:03,021
- Well, she can't.
- Maybe she can.

442
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:07,975
She's not like you think.
She's got powers... of helping. And...

443
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:11,900
Look, she was worried and now l'm worried
and l wasn't pretending at all.

444

451

00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,222
lt was his idea!

487
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,695
Back off. Get back!

488
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:02,220
Get back, you stupid bitch.

489
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,822
You're gonna die!

490
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:09,496
Do you know how lame this is?

491
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:14,262
Bored teenage boys trying to raise up
a demon. Sorry it didn't show.

492
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:20,296
l bet it's cos you forgot the boom box playing
some heavy-metal thing, like Blue Clam Cult.

493
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:25,344
l think that's the key
to the raising of lame demons.

494
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,420
That lame demon?

495
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:48,537
Dude, help!

496
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:02,660
No!

497
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:17,099
- Spike?
- Here to help. No hurting the girl.

498
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:19,746
Untie her. l'll take care of this.

499
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,864
Ah!

500
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,264
Uh!

501
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:34,544
- Who are you?
- l'm a bad man.

502
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:42,095
No, no, please...

503
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:08,703
She'll tell you.
Someday she'll tell you.

504
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,258
You OK?

505
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,421
Ow. Ow.

506
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,460
You can't be dead.

507
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,140
Where are my infinite riches?

508
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,460
Ow! lt bit me!

509
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,537
Come on.

510
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:48,617
- Help! Help me, please! l'm bleeding.
- Sorry.

511
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:51,300
My office hours are ten to four.

512
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,897
lt's all OK now.

513
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,978
l hope you're not too disappointed.

514
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,658
See?

515
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:11,938
You can make a difference.

516
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,417
And you will.

517
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,179
Cassie?

518
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:24,977
Cassie. Cassie.

519
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,735
No, come on. Cassie.

520
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:30,418
Cassie.

521
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:45,298
How was her mom?

522
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:46,978
OK.

523
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:51,497
As OK as...

524
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:58,495
She told me their family
had a history of heart irregularities.

525
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,775
But she never told Cassie.

526
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,417
Cassie didn't know?

527
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:08,855
Then it was fate?

528
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,222
l think she was gonna die,
no matter what, wasn't she?

529
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:15,582
- lt didn't matter what you did.
- She just knew.

530
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,977
She was special.

531
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:23,016
l failed her.

532
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:25,256
Uh-uh. No.

533
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:30,024
You didn't, cos you tried.

534
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:33,064
You listened, and you tried.

535
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:36,775
She died cos of her heart, not cos of you.

536
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:41,300
She was my friend cos of you.

537
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:47,223
l guess sometimes you can't help.

538
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,457
So what then?

539
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:54,699
What do you do when you know that?

540
00:39:57,066 --> 00:40:01,582
When you know that maybe you can't help?
