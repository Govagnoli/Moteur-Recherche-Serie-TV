1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,169
Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'':

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:09,281
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.

3
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:10,402
Dawn.

4
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:13,485
- OK, your mom's in recovery.
- ls she all right?

5
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:16,246
l think your mother's going to be fine.

6
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:19,251
- l wanna show you something.
- Harder.

7
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:25,888
Buffy.

8
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:29,602
l've given you everything that l have.
My heart, my body and soul.

9
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:32,287
l just don't feel it. They want me back, Buffy.

10
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:35,807
The military. l'm leaving tonight.

11
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,248
Riley!

12
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:53,367
You ever have that feeling
where there's something to do

13
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,921
and you forgot what it was?

14
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:57,922
Nope.

15
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:01,369
l've been having that feeling
and l just realised what it was.

16
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,650
Three weeks ago Riley asked me
to borrow a Crescent wrench.

17
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,645
l keep having this feeling
l'm supposed to give it to him.

18
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,452
That's not going to happen
unless he comes back.

19
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,889
You know, not to get the Crescent wrench.
Just to come back.

20
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:19,565
l just mean, sometimes l sort of forget
that he's gone. lt's, like, ''Where's Riley?''

21
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:23,848
''Oh, wait, the Central Republic
of Where-ln-The-Hell.''

22
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:26,969
Xander?

23
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,602
lf you ever decide to go, l want a warning.

24
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,048
You know, big flashing red lights

25
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:37,092
and one of those clocks that
counts down like a bomb in a movie,

26
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:42,248
and there's a bunch of coloured wires, and
l'm not sure which is the right one to cut,

27
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,166
but l guess the green one,
then at the last second ''No. Red.''

28
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:50,327
And then it stops with three tenths
of a second left, but then you don't leave.

29
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:53,450
- Like that, OK?
- Check.

30
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,807
Big bomb clock. Come here.

31
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,204
Maybe it's her.

32
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:13,846
Well, maybe it won't happen to us because
it's all about her messing things up.

33
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,403
She couldn't make it work with Angel,
and then she let Riley go away.

34
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:23,692
Yeah, relationship debris is kind of
piling up on the Buffy highway.

35
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:26,526
Humans make the same
mistakes over and over.

36
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,808
l saw it when l was a vengeance demon.

37
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:32,886
Some guy dumps a girl, she calls me,
l exact vengeance, blah, blah, blah.

38
00:02:32,973 --> 00:02:35,726
The nextyear, same girl, different guy.

39
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:39,965
After you smite a few of'em you start
going ''My goodness, young lady.''

40
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,567
''Maybe you're doing
something wrong here too.''

41
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:44,769
l don't think it's a pattern with her.

42
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,844
No, it's just...

43
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,444
You know, nowthat it happened again,

44
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:56,289
man number two, l wonder
how she's dealing with it.

45
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,970
- Sister Abigail, the choir is ready.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,647
What was that? He looked like a demon.

47
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:55,168
Yeah, he did. Are you OK?

48
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,048
- Yeah, l think so.
- Here.

49
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:04,843
So, about being a nun.

50
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:10,323
You know, with the whole
abjuring the company of men.

51
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:13,450
How's that working for you? The abjuring.

52
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:16,483
Good.

53
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:20,009
Yeah. Do you have to be super-religious?

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,288
- Well...
- How's the food?

55
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,213
All right. Switch. Left lead.

56
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,289
You thinkthey might be able to help us?

57
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:29,002
lf you mean are they gonna help us
find out something about Glory...

58
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,210
l sawthat coming.
You're dropping your shoulder.

59
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,446
The resources that the Watchers'
Council have at its disposal...

60
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,606
- The Central Library alone is just...
- Don't talk about the books again.

61
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:43,447
You get all... And sometimes there's drool.

62
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:48,926
l'm sorry, but we've exhausted the materials
l have here, and we're coming up empty.

63
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,404
You're still dropping your shoulder. l can see
when you're going to go with your right.

64
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:57,131
You're doing it again.

65
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,924
Sorry.

66
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:03,449
So, Glory's all you're gonna
talkto them about, right?

67
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,411
- Let's take a break.
- Answer me.

68
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,528
l'm not going to mention Dawn's name.
l wouldn't do that, l promise.

69
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,443
Butyou're gonna tell them about the Key?

70
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,922
That Glory's looking for
something called the Key?

71
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:19,130
Well, knowing her goal is crucial.

72
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:23,923
l mean, if anything helps them
uncover her origins, her plans...

73
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:28,530
l know. lt's just, l trust these watchers
about as far as you could throwthem.

74
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,365
Thank you very much.

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:37,485
l'm freaked about the idea of giving them any
information that could lead them to Dawn.

76
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,451
Truly, Buffy, if l saw an alternative...

77
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,809
lf the lnitiative were still around,
l'd consider using them,

78
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:49,013
but they're gone, and Riley was
the last link we had to the government.

79
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:55,247
- l'm sorry. l didn't mean to...
- lt's OK.

80
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,927
You can say his name.

81
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:02,962
l'm doing all right. These things happen.
People break up and they move on.

82
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:07,169
For a while it feels like the end
of the world but, big picture...

83
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:09,404
Not so huge.

84
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:13,761
Not so huge? l just said it feels like
the end of the world. Don'tyou listen?

85
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,847
l'm teasing.

86
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,447
Sort of. l'll be OK.

87
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,446
Well, l do hate to go if you're feeling badly.

88
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:31,766
Look, if it helps you find out something
about Glory, l'm thrilled to have you gone.

89
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,450
You're going away for a week? That's great.

90
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:39,162
- Yes. Everybody seems delighted about it.
- l get to run the store, right?

91
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:45,641
You? Well, it's quite a lot for one person
to take care of. The trashmen, for example.

92
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:50,204
They've been making such a mess in the alley
the recycling people can't get in to collect.

93
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:53,126
- Somebody has to talkto them.
- l can take care of that.

94
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:58,082
l'm envious, Mr Giles. A trip to England
sounds so exciting and exotic.

95
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:01,961
- Unless you're English.
- Don't worry about the shop.

96
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:06,205
- We can open, close and deal with everyone.
- We can come by between classes.

97
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:09,365
Usually l use that time
to copy over my class notes

98
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:12,365
with a system of different-coloured pens,

99
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:16,241
but it's been pointed out to me
that that's, you know, insane.

100
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:18,325
l said quirky.

101
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,881
Hello. l work here. l'll take care of everything.

102
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,806
- Yeah, Anya can do it.
- Thanks, sweetie.

103
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,604
- Well said.
- Yes, well, Anya,

104
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:32,290
while l completely trustyou to take care
of the inventory and the money,

105
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,683
dealing with people
requires a certain finesse.

106
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,531
l have finesse.

107
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:42,492
l have it coming out of my bottom. l can
completely lie to the health inspector.

108
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:46,361
l can distract him with coy smiles
and bribe him with money and goods.

109
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,250
See there? She'll be great.

110
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,131
Don't worry. l'll help her
take care of everything.

111
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:54,489
lt'll be shipshape. Better, it'll be shopshape.

112
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,451
Xander, she's talking to Giles
like l'm not here. Make her stop.

113
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,923
- Perhaps l'd better call the airline.
- l'm trying to help. Tell her.

114
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:07,962
- Schedule an earlier flight back. Excuse me.
- Tell her that l don't need her help.

115
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:11,932
- So, how goes the slaying?
- l killed something in a convent last night.

116
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:16,529
ln any other room, a frightening declaration.
Here, a welcome distraction.

117
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:21,050
- Tell us all about the killing, Buff.
- Pretty standard. Vampire staking.

118
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,011
But l met a nun, and she
let me try on her wimple.

119
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,084
OK, now we're backto frightening.

120
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,243
You with the actual clothing, who are you?

121
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:42,292
- Dawn, come look at this.
- ls it hard to recognise me?

122
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,770
No more bathrobe.

123
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,209
l looked at it today and
there it was, all fuzzy and blue,

124
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:51,409
and l just couldn't stand it any more.

125
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,882
l don't thinkthe rest of us will miss it much.

126
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:57,090
- lt was getting a little ripe.
- Maybe we should burn it.

127
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:00,802
- lt would keep the bugs away.
- lt doesn't smell.

128
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:05,728
Fine, make your funny jokes at the expense
of the woman with the hole in her skull.

129
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:09,087
Let's go. l think we've tired her out.

130
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:25,881
- Whatyou doing?
- Playing soccer.

131
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,282
Can l hang out in here?

132
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,364
Don't touch anything.

133
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,691
- You took down his pictures.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:45,846
l think l would've done that sooner.

135
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:49,403
Like: ''Don't wanna see that face again.''

136
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:54,250
lt wasn't like that. l was never angry with him.

137
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:57,964
OK, that's a lie.

138
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,444
But it's not like l didn't want to see his face.

139
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:10,003
l was just starting to kinda like the guy,
and then he's gone. So fast.

140
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:13,365
lt wasn't really so fast. Him leaving.

141
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:19,125
According to everyone who isn't me,
it was kind of gradual.

142
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:26,171
- Does that make it any better?
- No.

143
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:30,332
Because you should have noticed earlier?

144
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,445
Stop being insightful. lt's creepy.

145
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,684
lt hurts.

146
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,847
ln all kinds of horrible ways.

147
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,606
ln the way where l'm furious at him,

148
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:50,526
in the way where l blame myself,

149
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:54,447
in all the little ways l imagine
how l could have fixed things.

150
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:58,968
lt'll get better.

151
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,850
Won't it?

152
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,009
l hope so.

153
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:06,084
Yes. lt has to.

154
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:13,687
l'll just keep going like l have been,
and every day it'll get a little bit better.

155
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,684
Really? Every day?

156
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:20,690
Not really. But it'll be better soon.

157
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,531
lt still feels a little sudden to me,

158
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,571
with him gone where no one can talkto him.

159
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,407
Butyou never know.

160
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,961
Maybe he'll come back.

161
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:38,844
Maybe he'll hate the jungle or maybe
he'll want to give it another try.

162
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,051
l could say all the things l didn't get to say.

163
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:51,844
There's somethin' l got to tell you
about showing you Riley in that place.

164
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:56,482
l didn't mean to...

165
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:03,571
Anyway, l know you're feeling
all betrayed - by him, not me.

166
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:08,124
l was trying to help, you know.
Not like l made him be there, after all.

167
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:11,011
Actually trying to help you.

168
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,209
Best intentions.

169
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,252
l mean, pretty state you'd be in,
thinkin' things were all right

170
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,246
while he's toddlin' halfway round the bend.

171
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:26,453
l'll insult him if l want to.
l'm the one who's on your side.

172
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:31,288
Me. Doin' you a favour, and
you bein' dead petty about it.

173
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:36,766
Me, gettin' nothin' butyour hatred and
your venom and... You ungrateful bitch.

174
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:09,765
Buffy, there's somethin' l wanted to tell you.

175
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,207
Good, and hellebore?

176
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:17,411
- lt's up and to the right.
- Hellebore, one of my favourites.

177
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:22,169
lt's powerful stuff. l tried to use it
to de-ratAmy and it didn't work.

178
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,847
But l think it might have
made her really smart.

179
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,403
She keeps giving me these looks
like she's planning something.

180
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,882
Rubbing her paws together.

181
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,890
What are you two doing?

182
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:39,205
- We're gonna try out a few spells.
- There's this thing where you create light,

183
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,251
and we thought, what if we
could make simulated sunlight?

184
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:47,930
Yeah, so there Buffy is, middle of the night,
and she finds this whole nest of vamps,

185
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,322
and then she just goes ''Presto!''

186
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:52,768
Only it won't be ''presto'' exactly.

187
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:55,970
And there's a floating ball of sunlight.

188
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,692
- Vamps get dusty.
- Don't look right at it, though.

189
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,082
That's swell, butyou can't use this stuff.

190
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:05,166
Giles has only been gone two days
and you're already causing trouble.

191
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,928
- You shouldn't do things while he's gone.
- You're the fish.

192
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:13,008
- What?
- The fish in the bowl, in The Cat in the Hat.

193
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:17,006
He was always saying that the cat shouldn't
be there while the mother was out.

194
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:21,003
- What are you talking about?
- A book. This cat does all this mischief.

195
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:26,042
lt's so cute. He balances a bunch of stuff,
including that fish in the bowl. And...

196
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,012
But don't try it when you're six or you're
not allowed to have fish for five years.

197
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:33,483
You're referencing literature
l have no way to be familiar with

198
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,768
so that l feel left out, and you're stealing.

199
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,732
l'm not stealing. l'm just taking
things without paying for th...

200
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,442
- ln what twisted dictionary is that stealing?
- Maybe we should just pay.

201
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,765
Anya, Giles would be totally fine
with this. Come on, it'll be fun.

202
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:52,889
We could show you howto do some stuff.
You could be floatin' pencils by tonight.

203
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:56,362
Sometimes l miss having powers.

204
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,853
l know what this is. This is peer pressure.

205
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,891
Any second now you'll make me
smoke tobacco and have drugs.

206
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,724
Look how easy.

207
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,248
Don't float the merchandise.

208
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,409
Stop that.

209
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,530
Look at this. My two favourite girls.
Three favourite girls.

210
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,730
Xander, Willow's stealing. She's a burglar.

211
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:28,442
Right. The cunning, broad-daylight
in-front-of-everyone burglar.

212
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,570
Xander, l'm just doing a spell to help Buffy.

213
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,883
Xander, Giles left me in charge. Tell her.

214
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,842
- Judge Xander requesting a recess.
- You shouldn't pull him into this.

215
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,527
Yeah, see? Tara's with me. Protect me, Tara.

216
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,648
Xander, what l'm doing, it's a good thing.

217
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,521
And if it doesn't work, Giles
never even needs to know about it.

218
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,122
Oops.

219
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,009
The cash resister.
What did you do with it? Dear God.

220
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,811
l'll fix it.

221
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,364
Recursat.

222
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,087
There, all back. Good as new.

223
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,687
Money. Did you hurt the money?

224
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,651
Money good? She endangered the money.

225
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:16,609
Of course, that's what she cares about.
''l like money better than people.''

226
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:20,652
''People can so rarely be exchanged
for goods and/or services.''

227
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:24,442
- She's pretending to be me.
- Can you even believe how she's acting?

228
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,967
Know what? l'm tired of being in the middle.

229
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:29,772
- l won't letyou pull me into this.
- l'm not.

230
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:33,368
Whatever the issue is between you two,
just figure it out without me.

231
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:35,931
Xander, don't go.

232
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,851
- You made him mad.
- Me?

233
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,005
Tara, who do you think he was more mad at?

234
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:53,121
You know, l think maybe you guys
have some stuff you need to work out.

235
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,602
You know, just really talk.

236
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:05,604
- Fleabane.
- 15 cents.

237
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:11,329
- Salamander eyes.
- Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain.

238
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,881
- Bindweed.
- That's a pricey one.

239
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:18,448
Would you stop that? lt's very distracting.

240
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,972
Fine. Make your little ball
of sunshine. l'll be quiet.

241
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,525
Good, because this spell is very sensitive.

242
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:29,685
Once l begin,
any nonritual word can disrupt it.

243
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,972
Fine.

244
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,044
OK, here we go.

245
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,927
- Did you startyet?
- No.

246
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:46,404
This is it.

247
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,405
Spirits of light, l invoke thee.

248
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:54,529
Let the gloom of darkness part before you.

249
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:59,562
Let the moonlight be made pale
by your presence. Spirits...

250
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,644
ls it done?

251
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:06,449
Spirits of light, grant my wishes.

252
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:10,492
- l'm sorry. l thoughtyou were done.
- Do you wanna screwthis up?

253
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:14,523
No. l'm sure you can do that all on your own.

254
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,969
Anya, whatever really has you mad,
why don'tyou just say it,

255
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:20,886
like you do every thought
that stomps through your brain?

256
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:25,364
- l believe l have said it.
- No. You haven't. Come on. Let it out.

257
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,252
He's not a ball of sunshine.

258
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:06,202
New semester, new classes.

259
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:10,081
Whole new vistas of knowledge
to be confused and intimidated by.

260
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,802
l thinkthis one's gonna be fun.
GreekArt is gonna touch on so many things.

261
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:18,284
- Mythology and history and philosophy...
- The professor spit too much when he talked.

262
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:22,002
lt was like being at SeaWorld.
''The first five rows will get wet.''

263
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,732
That was just enthusiasm.

264
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,202
lt seemed very much like saliva.

265
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:31,764
- We'll sit farther back next time.
- Good plan. l need to keep this course.

266
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:36,802
The only other thing that fits into
my schedule is Central American Geopolitics.

267
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,884
And no, thank you.

268
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:43,042
l even hear the word '' jungle'',
and all l can think of is him.

269
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,409
You know, ''ls that the one Riley's in?''

270
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:50,405
Really don't need a daily
two o'clock knife in the heart.

271
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:52,882
ls it that bad?

272
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:57,042
Sort of. But l'm starting to get
perspective on the whole situation.

273
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,170
Maybe Riley's where he's supposed to be.

274
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,086
Maybe he needed to be where he was needed.

275
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:06,285
Willow says that things
always happen for a reason.

276
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,922
Butyou ever notice people
only say that about bad things?

277
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:11,924
But not for me the furrowed brow.

278
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:16,131
What do you say we go pick up Willow
and indulge in an after-school hamburger?

279
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,522
We could. She might still
be at the magic shop.

280
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,764
l was there earlier and she and
Anya kinda got in this squabble.

281
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:25,289
Xander and l cleared out. He was pretty upset.

282
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:27,364
Anya and Xander are in trouble?

283
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,369
No, l said that all wrong. lt was nothing.

284
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:34,605
Willow and Anya were fighting, and then
Xander snapped at both of them and he left.

285
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,092
He left?

286
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,243
Xander leftAnya?

287
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,963
No. Not ''left her'' left her. He just left.
lt was only a little thing, really.

288
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,682
Little thing? See, the thing is,
the little things get bigger,

289
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,333
and if you don't catch the little thing,

290
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:54,043
then you have this whole huge thing.

291
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:57,887
Not them with the little things.
They can't break up.

292
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:00,009
- l think...
- They have a beautiful love.

293
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,084
l thinkthey'll be fine.

294
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,566
- They have a miraculous love.
- What?

295
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:09,004
A miraculous love.

296
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,762
That car. We're still on his trail.

297
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:19,244
l don't even get how we made that guy
because, wow, advanced.

298
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,326
No one made him. He must have been
trapped in that crystal, and you released him.

299
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:26,689
l released him? No,
this was definitely a ''we'' thing.

300
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:30,288
Or a ''you'' thing.
lt definitely feels like a ''you'' thing.

301
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:34,924
Look, just find the reversal spell. And hurry.
Look what he did to that lamppost.

302
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:38,369
l'm trying. Put the top up.
The pages are all blowy.

303
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:42,162
l don't know howto. l only just
figured out what the left pedal does.

304
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,244
lt makes us stop.

305
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:48,524
You don't know howto drive?
Why didn'tyou say?

306
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:52,528
Well, l couldn't know if l could
until l tried, could l?

307
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:57,010
This is very, very bad.
There's an ogre on the loose...

308
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,446
Troll.

309
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:00,683
- What?
- Troll on the loose.

310
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:05,289
Now hold on. l'm gonna press the right
pedal harder. l expect us to accelerate.

311
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:10,205
There's a troll loose and
you're gonna crash Giles' car.

312
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:13,922
lt's likely. You should have listened
to me and not done the spell.

313
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:18,006
- Giles put me in charge.
- He can be an idiot. The smart kind, but still.

314
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:22,405
- Xander agreed.
- Right. Xander doesn't step out of line.

315
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:25,166
- Well, what do you mean by that?
- Nothing.

316
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:32,727
- Find that spell quickly.
- That's gone.

317
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:41,565
Watch it.

318
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,211
lt's you.

319
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:46,046
Spike, don't let me stop you
from not being here.

320
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,124
l was here first, you know.

321
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,364
Go away.

322
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:58,122
Why would l do that, when it's buggin'
you so much having me here?

323
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,770
They have chicken wings, too. Also a sort
of a flower-shaped thing made from an onion.

324
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,844
lt's brilliant.

325
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:10,404
Are you talking to me hoping l'll get so
depressed l'll impale myself on a fork?

326
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,446
Lovely thought.

327
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,889
lf l don't hurtyou myself, the chip
wouldn't zap me. l could eatyou.

328
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,206
- Beat the onion thing all to hell.
- Those are mine.

329
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,127
My, my. Someone's in a temper.

330
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:28,209
This all sympathetic misery
borrowed from the Slayer?

331
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,970
What? No, nothing to do with Buffy.

332
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,285
So she's all right, then?
Not holding grudges?

333
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:41,523
What are you talking about? What does Buffy
have to do with anything? What grudges?

334
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,207
OK. No need to talk about it, then.

335
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:49,162
l'm sure she's merrily slaying some pals
of mine, havin' a grand old time.

336
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,527
This is very bad.

337
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,522
Willow? Anya?

338
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:57,208
They're not backthere either. They're gone.

339
00:24:57,293 --> 00:25:00,171
Buffy, something's been here
and Willow's gone.

340
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:03,325
Don't worry. We'll get her back, l promise.

341
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:06,371
Come on, this thing's
probably leaving a huge trail.

342
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,404
Puny receptacle.

343
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:23,643
You do well to flee, townspeople.

344
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:26,367
l will pillage your lands and dwellings.

345
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:31,812
l will burn your crops and make merry sport
with your more attractive daughters.

346
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,124
Mark my words.

347
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:39,572
Ale.

348
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:42,292
l smell delicious ale.

349
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,683
They get in these fights and they
both look at me like l'm the referee.

350
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:52,801
l'll say something aboutAnya, and Willow'll
get this ''what do you see in her?'' look.

351
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,885
l knowthat look.
A lot of people never really got Dru.

352
00:25:55,973 --> 00:26:00,603
Well, she was insane. Then l get all torn

353
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:06,131
because Willow's my best friend and l really
value her opinion, butAnya's my girlfriend.

354
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:09,285
What does the Slayer think of
all this friction in the ranks?

355
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:12,331
- Can't be good for morale.
- l don't know.

356
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,686
She's a little preoccupied, maybe.

357
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:20,608
lt's understandable, what with all the upset,
all that blamin' of innocent bystanders.

358
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:23,253
- What?
- l mean, did she want to be made a fool of?

359
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:27,246
And what does a person have to do
to make it right? Watch it, mate.

360
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:31,130
On second thought, do whatyou like.

361
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:33,283
Ale. Yes.

362
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:35,284
Fragrant ale.

363
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:40,565
So, think l should run get Buffy?

364
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:53,128
Barmaid. Bring me stronger ale,
and some plump, succulent babies to eat.

365
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:56,604
l'm gonna run get Buffy.
Or maybe you could fight him.

366
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,890
l could do that, but l'm paralysed
with not caring very much.

367
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,964
You there.

368
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,089
Do you know where there are babies?

369
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:07,563
- What do you think? The hospital?
- What? Shut up.

370
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:11,326
- Listen...
- l find myself very hungry.

371
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:15,929
- When l'm hungry l grow short of patience.
- Well, we can take care of the ''hungry'',

372
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,891
so how's aboutyou just sit down
in one of the sturdier chairs

373
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,329
and we could have a calm
talk and something to eat?

374
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:25,962
- Can it be babies?
- Well, not so much.

375
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:31,162
But maybe some roast pigs and stags and...

376
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,930
- much hearty grog.
- They've got this onion thing...

377
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:38,130
You cannot appease me. Do not try.

378
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:40,284
More ale.

379
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:45,608
Xander. You shouldn't be here. There's a troll.

380
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:48,844
A big guy? Hammer?
l think l noticed him.

381
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:52,288
l wish Buffy was here.

382
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:53,806
l'm here.

383
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:55,884
l wish l had a million dollars.

384
00:27:56,893 --> 00:28:00,488
- Just checking.
- What's going on? Where did he come from?

385
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:03,931
Hello, Buffy.

386
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:08,928
Willow stole ingredients and released him
from a purple crystal. He's a troll.

387
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,802
- You did this?
- Me? No, we.

388
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:17,092
- l mean, us. Her. lt's very complex.
- We can stop him. Willow, do the spell.

389
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:22,047
- ''Let the conjuring be...''
- Stop.

390
00:28:23,773 --> 00:28:29,245
- Nobody lets me finish.
- You told the witch to do that, Anyanka.

391
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,688
You seem determined
to put an end to all my fun,

392
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:34,241
just like you always did when we were dating.

393
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:42,485
You dated him?

394
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:46,043
- You dated a troll?
- And we're what? Surprised by this?

395
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,131
Well, he wasn't a troll then.
He was just a big dumb guy,

396
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,966
and he cheated on me
and l made him into a troll,

397
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:55,409
which, by the way, is how l got
the job as a vengeance demon.

398
00:28:57,813 --> 00:29:00,088
l did not cheat.

399
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,529
Not in my heart. lt was only one wench.

400
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:08,804
l had had a great deal of mead.
The next thing l know, l'm a troll.

401
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:14,967
You did this, Anyanka.
You will die for this.

402
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,728
Butyou seem to enjoy the being a troll.

403
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,446
l adjusted.

404
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,763
And then what happened? Witches.

405
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,526
Filthy, dirty, disgusting witches.

406
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:31,687
They trapped me. l was imprisoned
in that crystal for centuries.

407
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:35,402
A curse on all witches. All must die.

408
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:38,132
- Willow, again.
- ''Let the conjuring be undone.''

409
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,727
- ''Return the beast to native form.''
- Witch, stop.

410
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:44,726
''Keep him far from us and ours
as long as my voice shall sound.''

411
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,526
- lt did not work.
- OK, wait. ''Let the conjuring...''

412
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:40,606
- Where is he?
- Gone.

413
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:45,323
Xander, follow him. Anya, Willow, go to the
magic shop. Find a spell that will stop him.

414
00:30:58,453 --> 00:31:02,332
- What are you doing?
- Makin' this woman more comfortable.

415
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:06,691
l'm not samplin', l'll have you know. Just
look at all the lovely blood-covered people.

416
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:11,801
l could, but not a taste for Spike.
Not a lick. l know you wouldn't like it.

417
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:16,926
You want credit for not feeding
off bleeding disaster victims?

418
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,969
Well, yeah.

419
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,089
You're disgusting.

420
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:25,044
What's it take?

421
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:30,969
Hurry up. l'm taking everything on
relocation spells, suspension spells,

422
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:35,683
and - what the heck - spells to make him
really sleepy because... slightly better.

423
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,402
ln case we need 'em, l'm getting
more of all the things you stole.

424
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:42,291
- l didn't... Why do you do that?
- What?

425
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:47,209
You're so rude. l mean, sure, at first,
ex-demon, doesn't knowthe rules.

426
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:50,968
- Well, you been here for ever. Learn the rules.
- Rules are stupid.

427
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:57,292
Great, whatever. l just thoughtyou might
be interested in learning to act more human.

428
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:02,049
Some of us enjoy it. Look for spells
with dimensional portals, too.

429
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:06,843
l am a human. And there are many
humans who are stranger than me.

430
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:10,962
Uh-huh, but unless l'm really wrong
about Crazy Larry at the bus stop,

431
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:13,442
he's probably not gonna
turn Xander into a troll.

432
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,525
Well, now, that's a very complicated proced...

433
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:23,644
You think l'm gonna hurt Xander?
l would never hurt Xander.

434
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:27,564
- You really think l would do that.
- Anya, it's whatyou do.

435
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:30,486
You spent, what,
a thousand years hurting men?

436
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,326
You gotyour ''thousand years
of hurting men'' gold watch.

437
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:37,531
l was a demon then, and l don't even
have any powers now. ls this the spell?

438
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:42,326
Only if you want him to double in size
and grow extra arms, which... Let's not.

439
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:46,770
And by the way, you weren't a demon when
you turned Olaf into Lord of the Hammers.

440
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:49,208
You managed that.

441
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,927
Also, there's other ways to hurt Xander.

442
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:55,490
l don't do magic now.
You're the one with that kind of power.

443
00:32:55,573 --> 00:33:00,169
D'Hoffryn offered you my old job. You're
closer to being a vengeance demon than l am.

444
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,972
- Xander should be afraid of you.
- He's my best friend.

445
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:07,285
You don't want anyone else to have him.
l know what broke up him and Cordelia.

446
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:10,445
- lt was you. And your lips.
- No, it was not.

447
00:33:11,653 --> 00:33:16,329
Well, yes it was so, but that was a long
time ago. Do you think l'd do that again?

448
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,086
- Why not?
- Well, hello. Gay now.

449
00:33:19,493 --> 00:33:23,202
Butyou're always doing all you can
to point out how much l'm an outsider.

450
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:27,127
You've known him since you were infants.
You'll always know him better than l do.

451
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,363
You could poison his mind against me.

452
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:32,172
You're insane. l am not gonna take him away.

453
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:34,813
- And l am not gonna hurt him.
- Well, l'm not either.

454
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:41,726
l knew it.

455
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,611
You two, performing more spells.

456
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:50,365
l could be out pillaging, devouring babies,
making merry with the local virgins,

457
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,050
but instead, l had to come
all the way back here to kill you.

458
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,930
Run.

459
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:07,042
No. Get away from them.

460
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:11,365
l will get away from them, after l kill them.

461
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:14,206
You are not touching these women.

462
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,771
You wish for more? Admirable.

463
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:00,688
You fight well, although you are a tiny man.

464
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:09,649
l shall reward you.
Only one of your women shall die,

465
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,372
and you shall be the one to choose.

466
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:22,128
- Did he just say...?
- Choose.

467
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:26,570
Anyanka or the witch.
One of your women must die.

468
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:28,166
No.

469
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:33,369
You are one crazy troll. l'm not choosing
between my girlfriend and my best friend.

470
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:36,809
- That's insane troll logic.
- Go, Xander. l love you.

471
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:40,967
Good for you. You are a loyal man.

472
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,166
Xander.

473
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:47,409
Now. Choose.

474
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,207
- Olaf, no.
- l'm not choosing.

475
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:53,565
Then you shall be the one who dies.

476
00:35:53,813 --> 00:35:58,728
No. Choose me.
Just don't take him. Don't take Xander.

477
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:03,091
E conspectu abeat monstrum.

478
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,806
Damn.

479
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,724
- Buffy.
- Tara, stay back.

480
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:12,571
The hammer. His strength's in the hammer.

481
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:23,610
- How can l help?
- Distract him from Buffy.

482
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,729
- Piss him off.
- l don't know how.

483
00:36:25,813 --> 00:36:29,488
Anya, l have faith in you.
There is no one you cannot piss off.

484
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:35,321
Olaf, you're as inadequate
a troll as you were a boyfriend.

485
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,601
You're hairy and unattractive.

486
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:43,332
Even women trolls are
put off by your various odours.

487
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:47,372
lnstrumentum ultionis, telum fabuloso,

488
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:50,331
surge, surge, terram pro voca.

489
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:55,888
Your menacing stance is
merely mildly alarming.

490
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:01,529
- And your roar is less than full-throated.
- Desist.

491
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:06,403
My God, woman. lt's been a thousand years

492
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:11,521
and yetyou are as aggravating
and emasculating as ever you were.

493
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:16,485
Vola cum viribus, dominum tuum nega. Vola.

494
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,053
- Good job.
- You too. Very irritating.

495
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,453
So. Your power's in your hammer?

496
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:39,802
Oh, yeah. l forgot he still
has all that troll strength.

497
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:43,886
You shall all die.
l will dispense no mercy now.

498
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:58,168
What are you fighting for,
minuscule blonde one? Your friends?

499
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:01,650
These two? They will never last.

500
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:05,052
Anyanka is very difficult to live with,

501
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,727
and he...

502
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:10,007
He's ludicrous and far too breakable.

503
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:13,412
Their love will never last.

504
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,567
She's got him now.

505
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,723
Poor baby.

506
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,847
You really dated him?

507
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,127
Yes.

508
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,522
- Butyou like me better.
- Yes.

509
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,447
And Willow likes you too,
but not in a sexy way, cos she's gay.

510
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:42,967
She's not gonna try to
break us up, so it's all OK.

511
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:46,841
Their love will last for ever.

512
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:53,326
The transposition be complete.

513
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:02,487
- Where did you send him?
- The land of the trolls. He'll like it.

514
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,610
- Full of trolls.
- lt's hard to be precise, though.

515
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:08,161
Alternate universes don't stay put.

516
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:11,165
Trying to send him to a
specific place is sort of like...

517
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:14,890
trying to hit a puppy
by throwing a live bee at it.

518
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:19,003
Which is a weird image,
and you should all just forget it.

519
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:22,563
lt's possible that he's in
the land of perpetual Wednesday

520
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,645
or the crazy melty land.
Or the world without shrimp.

521
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,530
There's a world without shrimp?

522
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:29,444
l'm allergic.

523
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,808
He's probably in troll land.

524
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:36,489
l only care that he's not here,
and l got this nifty souvenir.

525
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:41,362
Oops.

526
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:43,728
The place is trashed enough anyway.

527
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:46,407
But see how well things worked out?

528
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:53,767
And look atyou guys.
So good and alive and together.

529
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:57,682
So together and good,

530
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:00,524
and alive.

531
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:03,165
Oh, God.

532
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:06,092
l'm just so happy for you.

533
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:15,166
l cringe to think what the place would have
looked like if l'd been away for longer.

534
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:19,644
Maybe we would have had time to clean it up
if Willow used some magics to help.

535
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:22,770
Yes, cos nothing could
possibly go wrong with that.

536
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,482
Rupert, l still don't understand - thank you -

537
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:32,682
why the other watchers made you go
to England when they don't know anything.

538
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,488
Well, they don't know ityet.

539
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:38,690
l mean, they had no record
of Glory or anyone like her,

540
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:42,607
but based on the information l've
given them, they're gonna look into it.

541
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:46,282
They might have something soon.

542
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:49,092
What about the Key? Were they all over it?

543
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:52,607
Yes. You know all of this?

544
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:55,732
l got some of it myself. Buffy told me the rest.

545
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,167
Well, they're interested, certainly,
and full of theories.

546
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,682
Most of them nonsensical.

547
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:09,252
They don't knowthat it's Dawn?

548
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,482
No.

549
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:15,403
l still can't even begin to grasp this.
l mean, she's my little girl.

550
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,764
lt is disorienting.

551
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:22,644
Giles, what happens if they figure it out?
What would they do?

552
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,724
l don't know.

553
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:29,569
l can't even think about this. lt's too...

554
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,722
l'll get some more milk.
