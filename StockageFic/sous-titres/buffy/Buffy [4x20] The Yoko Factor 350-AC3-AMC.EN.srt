00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,408
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:06,882
- Get dressed.
- Finn stays in the brig.

3
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,568
Helping an HST escape
is a court-martial offence.

4
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:13,362
- You'll make matters worse.
- Talk later. Stealthy escape now.

5
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,650
Buffy. I leave now, I can't ever come back.

6
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:22,242
Spike, come with me.
You're going to help me with my problem.

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,927
I'm going to help you with yours.

8
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:30,533
- You have to be with the person you love.
- I am.

9
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,362
It's complicated because of Tara.

10
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:37,325
Are you freaked?

11
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:41,686
I have to tell you some stuff about my past.

12
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,883
And it's not all stuff you’re gonna like.

13
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,521
And on "Angel":

14
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,047
You didn't think I'd find you, did you?

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,010
- This won't happen.
- You'll stop me?

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,367
- Don't.
- Faith, go.

17
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,364
Don't you move a...

18
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:00,171
I have someone in my life now, that I love.

19
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:03,290
You don't know me now,
so don't come here with your new life

20
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,809
and expect me to do things your way.
Go home.

21
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:12,328
- And the men?
- These are exceptional boys.

22
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:17,771
Their capture ratio just keeps increasing.
They're keeping it together.

23
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:19,889
Morale's a problem.

24
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:23,648
The death of Professor Walsh,
the escape of the prototype...

25
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:28,249
Controlling the HSTs is getting harder. We
have overcrowding in the containment areas.

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,893
- Quite a mess.
- It's not my mess, sir.

27
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:36,805
I'm just holding the fort while you
figure out what you wanna do with the place.

28
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:40,965
This incident with Finn was unfortunate.

29
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:47,285
Fell in with a bad crowd. Frankly, I don't think
he was ever the soldier you all hoped he was.

30
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,651
- Boy thinks too much.
- Nevertheless, we want him back.

31
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,127
- The government's invested...
- We'll catch up to him.

32
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,683
My feeling is
he won't stray too far from the girl.

33
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:00,964
Yes...

34
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:05,288
Buffy Summers.
Our data banks don’t have much on her.

35
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,970
She's just a girl.

36
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,044
She's a lot more than that.

37
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:14,172
- The Slayer's dangerous.
- Yes. She makes things interesting.

38
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:19,566
No. See, you're not getting it, Mr Bits.
You're gonna be interestingly dead.

39
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:23,885
Little Miss Tiny bollockses up the plans
of every would-be unstoppable bad-ass

40
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,168
who sets foot in this town.

41
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,481
I just want you to know,
when the big ugly goes down,

42
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:32,007
the Slayer's gonna be right in the thick of it.

43
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:35,483
- You ready for that?
- I'm counting on it.

44
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,566
- Two slayers.
- That's right.

45
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,922
- And you killed them both?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,844
- I killed the hell out of them.
- Yet you fear this one?

47
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:47,723
Watch it, mate.
I don't fear anything, just know my enemies.

48
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,364
Do you? Then why haven't you
killed this slayer yet?

49
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,444
Because.

50
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:59,249
Stinking rotten luck is why. On top of that,
now I've got this buggering chip up my head.

51
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:04,612
Yes. Your behaviour-modification circuitry.
I know what you feel.

52
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:07,127
- Not likely.
- You feel smothered.

53
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:12,082
Trapped like an animal, pure in its ferocity,
unable to actualise the urges within.

54
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:17,362
Clinging to one truth. Like a flame
struggling to burn within an enclosed glass.

55
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:20,327
That a beast this powerful
cannot be contained.

56
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:25,124
Inevitably it will break free
and savage the land again.

57
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,489
I will make you whole again.
Make you savage.

58
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,563
Wow.

59
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,723
I mean, yeah.

60
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,691
I get why the demons all fall in line with you.

61
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:43,403
You're like Tony Robbins,
if he was a big, scary Frankenstein-looking...

62
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,203
You're exactly like Tony Robbins.

63
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,761
I will restore you to what you once were,

64
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:53,289
when I have the Slayer
how and where I want her.

65
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:58,286
Easier said.
She's crafty, her and her little friends.

66
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:02,764
- Friends?
- There's your... What do you call it? Variable.

67
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:04,605
The Slayer's got pals.

68
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:08,288
You want even odds in a fight?
You don't want the Slayerettes about.

69
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,728
Take them away from her.

70
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,804
Now, there's a plan.

71
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:18,482
Working solo, she won't have a chance to
come after us when the wild rumpus begins.

72
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:22,725
Plus, it'll make her miserable.
And I never get tired of that.

73
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:30,003
Yeah. Leave 'em to me.

74
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:35,165
You can't hurt them. What can you do
to make sure they're out of the picture?

75
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,687
Not a blessed thing.

76
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:39,764
They're gonna do it for me.

77
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,171
Know if she's back yet?

78
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:11,006
LA Woman? Haven't heard from her.

79
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:15,006
She'll probably come here first thing, though.
Who's your buddy?

80
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:18,403
So you don't have to be GI Joe
while your civvies are gettin' washed.

81
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,961
Try those on. You'll feel like a new man.

82
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,249
Would this man have a bright red nose
and big, floppy feet?

83
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:33,690
- I'm sorry. That's the cabin fever talking.
- But as post-apocalypse splendour goes...

84
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,082
- I've done wonders with the place.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:39,245
Still, the sooner Buffy gets back,
the better I'll feel.

86
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,563
You and me both, big guy.

87
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:44,648
I take it you're not an Angel fan either?

88
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:50,285
Well, it's not like I hate the guy.
Just, you know, the guts part of him.

89
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:54,889
Can't blame you. But to be fair,
it's not him you hate. It's the curse.

90
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,964
Right?

91
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,609
What did Buffy tell you?

92
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:04,729
About Angel? Everything.

93
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:07,646
More than I wanted to know sometimes.

94
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:13,967
She loved him.
He turned evil. He killed people.

95
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:16,647
She cured him. He left.

96
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,808
- Interesting little curse.
- One moment's happiness.

97
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:25,129
- What do you mean?
- You know, it's his trigger.

98
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:28,250
Angel's an OK guy,
if he's mopy and sad and brooding,

99
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,882
but you give him even
one second of pure, real pleasure...

100
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:36,842
- And that sets him off?
- Only in a kill-your-friends kind of way.

101
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:42,803
And you know what makes Angel happiest?
I'll give you a hint. It's not crème brûlée.

102
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:49,044
Buffy.

103
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:57,004
Sex with Buffy.

104
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:03,883
She kind of left that part out?

105
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,362
Yeah, she did.

106
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:15,327
That explains a lot of things
that I wish weren't explained.

107
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,246
That's all ancient history.

108
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,086
She went running to LA
to bone up on her history.

109
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,209
No. I'm sure it's boneless.

110
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:29,602
She just needs to make sure everything's OK.
She's probably back already.

111
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:32,207
Maybe.

112
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,012
You'll feel a lot better when you see her.

113
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,328
I guess we'll see.

114
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:46,481
lf I leave here tomorrow

115
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:53,126
Would you still remember me?

116
00:08:55,293 --> 00:09:00,208
Well, I must be travelling on now

117
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:05,846
There's too many places I've got to see

118
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:13,248
And if I stay here with you, girl

119
00:09:14,893 --> 00:09:18,727
Things just couldn't be the same

120
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:25,411
Cos I'm as free as a bird now...

121
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,207
For someone who's got "watcher"
on his résumé,

122
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,683
you might wanna cast an eye
to the front door every now and again.

123
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,764
What do you want?

124
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,605
Knew I left one.

125
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,923
- Buffy around?
- Why?

126
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,129
I need to speak to the lady of the house.

127
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:49,491
Be a pet and give her a message. Tell her
I might have something she might want.

128
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:52,406
And what might that something be?

129
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,366
Information. Highly classified.

130
00:09:56,893 --> 00:10:00,886
Not cheap word-on-the-street prattle.
I'm talking about the good stuff.

131
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:02,964
Thrill me.

132
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,044
It's nothing I know.

133
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:09,046
Think I'd come running over saying,
"I've got a secret, beat me till I talk"?

134
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,842
There's files in the Initiative.
I'm pretty sure I know where.

135
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,205
- Files?
- Yeah. Secrets.

136
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,527
Mission statements. Design schematics.

137
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:28,324
All of Maggie Walsh's dirty laundry, which
I guess would include lots of tidbits about...

138
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,524
- Adam.
- Well, yeah.

139
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:35,930
Say someone was to risk his life and limb...
Limb, anyway, to obtain said files.

140
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,732
It might be worth a little something.

141
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:42,842
At this point a cynical person
might think that you were offering

142
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,652
just what we need when we need it most.

143
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:49,169
That person'd be right, Rupert.
Supply and demand.

144
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:52,245
- And it won't be cheap this time.
- What do you want?

145
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,690
A year's supply of blood, guaranteed
protection, merry bushels of cash

146
00:10:56,773 --> 00:11:01,085
and, most important, a guarantee
that I'm not to be in any way slain.

147
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:04,923
Done.

148
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,163
With a smile and a nod from you?

149
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:11,292
Sorry. Not close to good enough.
This deal's with the Slayer.

150
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,012
- I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her?

151
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:17,608
Great comfort, that.
What makes you think she'll listen to you?

152
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,763
Because.

153
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,690
- Very convincing.
- I'm her watcher.

154
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:28,842
I think you're neglecting
the past tense there, Rupert.

155
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:32,164
Besides, she barely listened to you
when you were in charge.

156
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,882
- I've seen the way she treats you.
- Yes? And how's that?

157
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:38,965
Very much like a retired librarian.

158
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:43,368
I've got what she wants
as long as she has what I want.

159
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,126
Spread the word.
She knows where to find me.

160
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,124
I'll think about it.

161
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:55,688
I keep thinking
"OK, that's the cutest thing ever."

162
00:11:55,773 --> 00:12:00,085
And then she does something cuter
and completely resets the whole scale.

163
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:04,371
- Did you see her yawn earlier?
- Yes. I thought I was gonna die.

164
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:09,724
- I love you, Miss Kitty Fantastico.
- We've got to get her a real name.

165
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,129
It's so cool that she's ours.

166
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:17,648
Yours. That she's yours is cool.

167
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,647
She can be ours if you want.

168
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:27,245
You still need an elective.
How about sophomore-level psychology?

169
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,610
Kinda psyched out since Professor Walsh.

170
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:34,686
Maybe something fun like drama.
I could be dramatic.

171
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,363
You cannot have more catnip.

172
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,163
You have a catnip problem.

173
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,204
Definitely drama.

174
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:50,850
I haven't even dealt with the housing
situation yet. Have you done anything?

175
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:56,963
I hear there's some off-campus places
that are cool for groups to go in on.

176
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:00,284
I just figured you'd be
dorming it up with Buffy again.

177
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,364
We haven't really talked about it.

178
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:07,322
I used to assume we'd be roomies through
grad school, well into little-old-ladyhood.

179
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:12,362
You know, cheatin' at bingo together
and forgettin' to take our pills.

180
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:14,091
But?

181
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,164
But I don't know.

182
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:20,562
It hardly feels like we're roomies now.

183
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:24,692
She's busy with Riley and I'm gone a lot too.

184
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,164
I guess I should ask her.

185
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:43,487
- Riley.
- I got a little tired of sitting around waiting.

186
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,691
- So...
- You joined the circus?

187
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:51,962
Xander took my clothes
to clean 'em. Left me these.

188
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:54,726
Does he hate me
in some way I don't know about yet?

189
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:59,125
I think I would've attracted
less attention in my uniform.

190
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,807
Is it OK for you to be here?

191
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,811
You tell me.

192
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:09,011
I just meant with the government branch
hunting you down and all.

193
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,970
I'm good.

194
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:15,649
It took me a while,
but I patched into their frequency.

195
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:21,489
- Can't sneak up on a guy if he's listening in.
- You're the sneakiest.

196
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,803
Why they hired me.

197
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,370
You OK?

198
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,324
Yeah. I just...

199
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,925
- Angel kind of upset me.
- How?

200
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:46,886
- It's not that interesting.
- Got my attention.

201
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:52,167
He just spun my head a little.

202
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,009
You don't wanna talk about it.

203
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,090
Deconstructing Angel can wait.

204
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:02,722
Right now I just wanna get out there
and patrol and find Adam.

205
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,486
We can talk about it later.

206
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,450
It's the pants, isn't it?

207
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:12,725
It's OK. I couldn't
take me seriously in these either.

208
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,690
Riley, it's not that big a deal.

209
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:20,365
Why don't I get out of your face?
You had a long trip.

210
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,251
- You don't have to go.
- It's OK.

211
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:29,010
Besides, I have to recharge them
every two hours or they go dead on me.

212
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,084
OK.

213
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:40,523
Here. You should've saved
the ensemble from last time.

214
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:46,085
- I'm not a clothing delivery service.
- He is, kind of. He did Riley yesterday.

215
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,329
Hello.

216
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:52,610
This is just swell.

217
00:15:55,013 --> 00:16:00,041
Gotta say, liking this quite a lot.
Kinda changes the balance of power...

218
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,724
Come on. You gotta be kidding.

219
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:09,002
That chip in your head means
you can't even point a gun? How humiliating.

220
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,323
Doesn't work anyway. It's a fake.

221
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:16,168
- Not even a decorative gun?
- Give it up for American chipmanship.

222
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:21,691
It doesn't work? What about self-defence?
I'm taking a risk here, you know.

223
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,252
Can I tell you how much I really don't care?

224
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:29,170
Attitude. See how far
that'll take you in boot camp.

225
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:33,761
I hope you get one of those
tough-as-nails drill sergeants

226
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:37,641
who's only hard on the men to keep
them alive when the bullets start flying.

227
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,282
- I love that stuff.
- Boot camp? Yeah, like, I'd go there.

228
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,326
What, you changed your mind?
Not gonna join?

229
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:49,247
- You're joining the army?
- OK. One: Ow.

230
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,769
Two: Where'd you get that idea? Three: Ow.

231
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:58,485
- I'm not joining the army.
- Good. Stopped that nonsense just in time.

232
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:02,361
I was never... Who'd you hear this from?

233
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:08,050
Your girlie mates were talking. Something
about being all you can be. Or all you can be.

234
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,443
You know, having a laugh.
Figured you were signin' up.

235
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:14,525
Have you got anything
larger in the toy-gun line?

236
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,526
Can you believe this?
Like I'm some sort of useless lunk.

237
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:23,562
It happens I'm good at a lot of things.
I help out with all kinds of stuff.

238
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:29,364
I have skills and stratagems.
I'm very... Help me out.

239
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:34,165
- He's a Viking in the sack.
- Terrific. You didn't have these cleaned.

240
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,326
This is so like them, lately.
It's all about them and the college life.

241
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:43,692
You know what college is? It's high school
only without the actual going to class.

242
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,764
High school was kinda like that, too.

243
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:50,290
The point is, I'm working hard to make a
living. It's nothing but a huge joke to them.

244
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:54,572
"Xander got fired from Starbucks.
Xander got fired from that phone-sex line."

245
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,326
- They look down on you.
- And they hate you.

246
00:17:57,413 --> 00:18:00,610
- But they don't look down on me.
- It was just a laugh.

247
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:03,651
There's no need to go insane over it.

248
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,884
- Is anybody talking to you?
- Sir, no, sir.

249
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,084
- Don't shoot.
- Give me a reason not to.

250
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:28,291
- You're killing humans now?
- Not yet. Beating you senseless should do.

251
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:34,209
I can have a patrol here in under a minute.
Here's the plan. You go your way, I'll go mine.

252
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,291
- I'm checking out that cave.
- My orders exactly.

253
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,206
- Alone?
- We're spread a little thin, so yeah.

254
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,448
- Family's tearing apart.
- Family?

255
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,206
What kind of family are you? Corleones?

256
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:57,404
Weren't until you showed up.

257
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,764
What? No girls in the club?

258
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,686
You think you're
the first girlfriend Riley's had?

259
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:08,404
A big head on that skinny body. No. You're
just the first to get him to commit treason.

260
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:13,089
Riley had a career. He had a future till he
met you, and yeah, I got a problem with that.

261
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:16,051
A future? A future doing what?

262
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,170
Illegal experiments? Torture? Murder?

263
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:24,403
- So killing someone isn't a problem for you?
- Less and less. Get the hell out before l...

264
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:27,087
Touch me and you'll see
what slayer strength is like.

265
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:30,006
- I think it's about time you showed me, then.
- Yes.

266
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,647
I think that would be interesting.

267
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,089
Get out of here.

268
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,810
I'm not moving.

269
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:58,210
- Thank you.
- Go. Get out.

270
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,410
No.

271
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,885
- I think I lost the buggers.
- Any luck with the disk?

272
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:57,842
I took what they had.
Should be something useful on one of 'em.

273
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,731
- Hope so.
- What are we looking for?

274
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:04,203
- Anything about Adam.
- Any problems getting in and out?

275
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:08,002
No. A couple of them made me
on the way out, but I took care of 'em.

276
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:11,324
Gave them
a good running-away-from, did you?

277
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:13,722
Yeah. When do I get paid?

278
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:18,846
When Willow tells me
you've brought us something useful.

279
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,290
I could've gone straight to the Slayer,
you know.

280
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:36,731
I let you pretend you're in charge. Now you
need Red's permission to finish the deal?

281
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:39,566
As soon as we see what's on the disks.

282
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:44,372
- It looks like gibberish.
- Gibberish?

283
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,806
- They're encrypted.
- Wonderful.

284
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:50,685
Can you fix 'em?

285
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:55,403
Crack a government encryption code
on my laptop? Easy as really difficult pie.

286
00:21:55,933 --> 00:22:00,324
You're not exactly the whiz these days either.
God, I'm never gonna get paid.

287
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,529
- I am a whiz.
- She is a whiz.

288
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,401
If ever a whiz there was.
I just need some time.

289
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,768
No. I just heard you weren't...

290
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:13,131
Your mates said you weren't playing with
computers so much. Into the new thing.

291
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:15,727
- What new thing?
- You know, you two.

292
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:20,168
- The whole Wicca thing.
- They were talking about that?

293
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:23,165
Can we get back to business?
I've got a deal at stake.

294
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:27,246
- What did they say?
- That it's a phase. You'll get over it.

295
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,407
What? Who said that?

296
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:32,927
Was it Buffy?
Cos, you know what she means by...

297
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:37,165
No, she was defending you cos
Xander said you were just being trendy.

298
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:39,926
- Trendy?
- I don't know what they were going on about.

299
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:43,130
A person wants to be a witch,
that's their business.

300
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:47,603
- I knew Buffy was freaked.
- You should talk to her. I'm sure...

301
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:51,083
Pressing business, ladies.
Don't wanna get sidetracked.

302
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:53,243
Still got your monsters to fight.

303
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,526
Cell capacity maxed out three days ago, sir.

304
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:00,605
At this pace, there'll be
nowhere to contain the hostiles.

305
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:05,972
They're animals. We pack 'em in until we're
out of room, then we pack 'em in some more.

306
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:11,002
- They'll start tearing each other apart, sir.
- I have no problem with that scenario.

307
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:18,565
Backup. Request immediate backup. Over.

308
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:21,929
They're tearing us apart over here.
Two men down.

309
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:25,483
Come out of nowhere.
Mayday. Repeat. Mayday.

310
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:30,967
Immediate backup.
We're in the alley behind the school building.

311
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,802
Where the hell is...
Back. Fallback. It's coming.

312
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,281
Riley Finn.

313
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:06,411
I know you?

314
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:08,927
We have a friend in common.

315
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,121
Angel.

316
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:18,723
Welcoming committee your idea?

317
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:26,732
The way I heard it,
you were all peaceable now.

318
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:30,852
You didn't by any chance go and lose
that pesky soul again, did you?

319
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,163
Don't push me, boy.

320
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:38,928
Now what possibly could've happened with
Buffy that would make you lose your soul?

321
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,004
That'd be between me and her.

322
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:45,249
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see an old girlfriend.

323
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,245
- You think I'll let that happen?
- Think you can stop me?

324
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,005
I surely do.

325
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,006
- Angel.
- Hi. Can I come in?

326
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,410
I guess.

327
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,802
I need a little more than that.

328
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:32,924
Come in.

329
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:43,568
- You're hurt.
- You too.

330
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,571
I'll live.

331
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:51,121
Wanna tell me
who ran your face into a doorknob?

332
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:54,444
Not really. It's not world-in-peril stuff.

333
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:58,765
Let me guess. You thought of
something else really hurtful to say

334
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:02,323
and couldn't use the phone because
the funniest part is the look on my face...

335
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,450
Buffy, please. I really don't have a lot of time.

336
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,484
What's going on?

337
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:13,487
I told you you weren't coming near her.

338
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:18,370
You've got to be kidding me.
This is why you came?

339
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,603
No. This was an accident.

340
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:25,608
Running your car into a tree is an accident.
Running your fist into a face is a plan.

341
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:28,924
- Please explain this to me.
- Put that gun down.

342
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:32,808
It's pretty much all I got left,
so I'm thinkin' not.

343
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:36,203
He attacked four of my men, Buffy.
He's up to his old tricks.

344
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:39,285
- He won't hurt anybody. Tell him.
- Might hurt you.

345
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:42,922
- Please try.
- Some threat. You can barely stand.

346
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:46,802
- Trigger finger feels OK.
- You actually sleep with this guy?

347
00:27:46,893 --> 00:27:50,522
OK, stop it! That is enough!

348
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:56,245
I see one more display of testosterone
poisoning and I'll put you both in hospital.

349
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,849
Anybody think I'm exaggerating?

350
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,441
He started...

351
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:13,608
Riley.

352
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:17,652
I'm sorry. Just wanted
to know that you were safe.

353
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:21,123
I need to talk to Angel for a minute.

354
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,204
- What?
- Riley, please.

355
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:29,763
I'm not leaving this room.

356
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,570
I mean it.

357
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:48,604
I'm not movin' a muscle.

358
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:56,524
OK. I come to see you, to help you,
and you treat me like I'm just your ex.

359
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,763
- Technically...
- Shut up.

360
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,208
Then you order me out of your city.

361
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:04,808
Then you come here
and start pounding on my boyfriend?

362
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:08,727
I would really like to know:
what the hell are you trying to do?

363
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,088
I was trying to make things better.

364
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,608
- It's goin' pretty good, don't you think?
- Swell.

365
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:37,561
I couldn't leave it like that.

366
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,004
The way I spoke to you.

367
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,011
I came to apologise. I had no right.

368
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:47,922
And Riley?

369
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:50,925
I got jumped by some soldiers.
He came in in the middle.

370
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:55,484
He wasn't real forthcoming
with the benefit of the doubt.

371
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,609
Put yourself in his place.

372
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:02,604
I get it.

373
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:10,845
You weren't entirely wrong,
what you said in LA.

374
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,886
We don't live
in each other's worlds any more.

375
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:20,886
I had no right to barge in on yours
and make judgments.

376
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:24,003
I'm still sorry.

377
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,562
Thank you.

378
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:30,884
And next time I'll apologise by phone.

379
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:36,371
Things are pretty tense around here.

380
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:42,043
- They really are.
- Can I do anything?

381
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:48,047
Honestly? I think the best thing
you can do right now is...

382
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:50,124
OK.

383
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,728
It means a lot that you came.

384
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,770
- Riley?
- Yeah?

385
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,962
I don't like him.

386
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:15,331
Thank you.

387
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:41,125
Now that was fun.

388
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:44,283
You were successful?

389
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:47,445
- Easier than I'd thought it'd be, too.
- You're sure?

390
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,366
I feel it in my bones.

391
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:53,092
Call it "the Yoko Factor".

392
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,801
Don't tell me you've
never heard of the Beatles?

393
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:01,602
I have. I like "Helter Skelter".

394
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:03,923
What a surprise.

395
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:07,005
The point is,
they were once a real powerful group.

396
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:11,405
It's not a stretch to say they ruled the world.
When they broke up, everyone blamed Yoko.

397
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:15,202
But the group split itself apart.
She just happened to be there.

398
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:20,765
You know how it is with kids. They go off to
college and grow apart. The way of the world.

399
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:25,051
So you separated the Slayer from her friends.
I'm pleased.

400
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:32,932
Since we've got all our ducks in a row
and not talking to each other,

401
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:35,686
I guess it's time for the grand plan.

402
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:39,561
The one where I get the chipectomy?
You got everything you need?

403
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,850
No. There's one more thing.

404
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,483
How bad are you hurt?

405
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,292
Don't know yet. Night's still young.

406
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,486
Riley, I have to tell you something.

407
00:33:03,573 --> 00:33:07,930
- Figured.
- Maybe you wanna sit down.

408
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:10,004
I'm fine.

409
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,692
- Riley, l...
- Wait.

410
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:16,287
Me first.

411
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:20,084
Buffy...

412
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:23,123
I feel like we've gotten really close.

413
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,408
At least, I thought we had.

414
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:30,805
I don't know much about Angel
or your relationship with him.

415
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,011
But all I ask is,

416
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,687
if you’re gonna break my heart, do it fast.

417
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:42,888
What?

418
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:46,966
- You think that Angel and l...
- Didn't you?

419
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:50,204
No. Of course not.

420
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,050
How can you even ask me that?

421
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:59,401
- I don't know. Xander said...
- Xander?

422
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:03,532
- He's the deadest man in Deadonia.
- No. It's not his fault.

423
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:08,366
I prodded, and he explained
how Angel went bad.

424
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,330
The trigger.

425
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:17,212
After that, I went a little nuts.

426
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:21,605
On the one hand, I should believe in us.

427
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:27,006
But, on the other, sometimes things happen
between exes and when I saw he was bad...

428
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,687
He's not bad.

429
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,612
Seriously? That's a good day?

430
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:39,769
There you go. Even when he's good,
he's all Mr Billowy-Coat King of Pain.

431
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,651
- Girls really like that...
- Riley, stop.

432
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:45,684
See? Nuts.

433
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:56,482
Have I ever given you any reason
to feel that you can't trust me?

434
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,565
No.

435
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:02,762
Then why with the crazy?

436
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:08,883
Because I'm so in love with you
I can't think straight.

437
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:13,402
Tell me about it.

438
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:21,644
Riley.

439
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:24,929
I still have to tell you something.

440
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:28,206
- And there's no easy way to...
- Just say it.

441
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:34,609
Forrest is dead.

442
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,324
I'm so sorry.

443
00:35:40,813 --> 00:35:43,281
There was a fight.

444
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,364
Adam killed him.

445
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,444
I barely got away.

446
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:55,328
I know there's nothing that I can say
that's gonna make this better.

447
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:58,325
But we will find this thing and destroy it.

448
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:02,721
I have to go.

449
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:05,202
- Are you sure?
- I have to go now.

450
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,924
It's still encrypted.

451
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,973
Willow's working really hard on it.

452
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:25,250
OK. How long before you uncrypt it?

453
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,124
Hours. Days, maybe.

454
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:31,888
Anyone suggesting months
would not be accused of crazy talk.

455
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:37,252
Whatever happened to Latin? At least when
that made no sense, the Church approved.

456
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:42,843
I can't wait around, Will. The disk
is no good to me unless you crack it soon.

457
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:45,684
We worked really hard getting that.

458
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,890
- Xander delivered clothing.
- Church-approved.

459
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:51,762
Sorry, you guys. We're on a clock here.

460
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:54,731
Adam was at that cave,
so maybe he was there for a reason.

461
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,646
I could go back, scope it out,
track him if I have to.

462
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:01,362
Right. Then maybe you'll get lucky
and he'll still be there.

463
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:05,366
He can rip your arms off for you.
Buffy, you can't go back alone.

464
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,967
You never train with me. He'll kick your arse.

465
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:11,489
- Giles.
- Sorry. Was it a bit honest? Terribly sorry.

466
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,212
So she doesn't go alone.
Giles, weapons all around.

467
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:16,409
You're not going, Xander.

468
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:19,488
You'd get hurt.

469
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:26,282
OK, you and Willow do the superpower thing.
I'll putt around the Batcave with Alfred here.

470
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:29,524
No, I am no Alfred, sir.
No, you forget. Alfred had a job.

471
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,844
Willow is not going either. I'm doing it alone.

472
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:36,369
Great. And then,
when you have your new "no arms",

473
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:39,968
we can say "It's a good thing
we didn't get in the way of that."

474
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:44,683
Maybe we can help in other ways.
Want some new fighting pants, Buff?

475
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:47,162
- You guys, this isn't helping.
- Wow.

476
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:49,972
We're already in the way. We're good at this.

477
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:53,682
I'm so good you might have to ship me
off to the army to get me out of the way.

478
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,333
- The army?
- You didn't know I knew, did ya?

479
00:37:56,413 --> 00:38:00,929
- You two talking about me behind my back.
- Us talking about you?

480
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:05,327
How about you telling Riley
every last detail of my life with Angel?

481
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:08,166
Besides, when is there any "us two"?

482
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:11,609
You two are the two who are "the two".
I'm the other one.

483
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:15,971
But maybe that all changes
when I'm doing sit-ups over at Fort Dix?

484
00:38:16,053 --> 00:38:18,044
Fort Dix?

485
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:23,124
- Are you drunk?
- Yes. Quite a bit, actually.

486
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:25,404
Stop it.

487
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,529
- This is stupid.
- Stupid?

488
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,808
You finally had the guts to say it to my face.

489
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:34,569
I didn't say you were stupid.
So stop being an idiot and let me fix this.

490
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:40,203
OK, I need you. I need both of you,
all the time. Just not now.

491
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:45,051
- Adam is very dangerous.
- Wait. How do you need me, really?

492
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:50,129
You're good with the computer stuff, usually.

493
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:53,849
- And there's the witch stuff.
- "Witch stuff"?

494
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:59,405
- What exactly do you mean by "witch stuff"?
- You guys, what is happening? This is crazy.

495
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:02,610
No, it's not.
It's all finally making perfect sense.

496
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,253
I'm not going to miss a moment of it.

497
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:09,123
You think this'll go on for a while?

498
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:12,004
Hard to say.

499
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:19,091
- Nice bathroom.
- Like the tile.

500
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,051
If I did join the army, I'd be great.
You know why?

501
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:25,091
I might get a job that
couldn't be done by a Border collie.

502
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:28,324
- That's it. I'm going to bed.
- You'd do wonderful in the army.

503
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,088
Think the umbilical cord
between you and Anya could stretch that far?

504
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,403
I knew it. I knew you hated her.

505
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,801
I'm not the one being judgmental here.

506
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:42,010
- I'll leave that to you and Buffy.
- Judgmental?

507
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:46,371
If I was any more open-minded about the
choices you make my brain would fall out.

508
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:49,328
And superior. Don't forget that.

509
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:52,450
You may be better than us.
It doesn't mean you can be superior.

510
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,809
You guys, stop this.
What happened to you today?

511
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,647
It's not today. Buffy, things
have been wrong for a while.

512
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:03,487
- Don't you see that?
- What do you mean, wrong?

513
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:07,043
They certainly haven't been right, since Tara.

514
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:10,409
We have to face it.
You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend.

515
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:15,044
No. It was bad before that. Since you two
went off to college and forgot about me.

516
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:18,682
Just left me in the basement to...
Tara's your girlfriend?

517
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:21,890
- Bloody hell.
- Enough.

518
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:25,329
All I know is, you wanna help, right?
Be part of the team?

519
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,085
- I don't...
- No, you said you wanted to go.

520
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:31,448
So let's go. All of us.

521
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:37,483
We'll go to the cave with you two attacking
me and the funny drunk drooling on my shoe.

522
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,643
Maybe that's the secret way to kill Adam.

523
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:43,892
- Buffy...
- Is that it? Is that how you can help?

524
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:47,967
You're not answering me.

525
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,521
How can you possibly help?

526
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:04,969
So I guess I'm starting to understand
why there's no ancient prophecy

527
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,851
about a Chosen One and her friends.

528
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:12,610
If I need help,
I'll go to someone I can count on.

529
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:24,493
I've been waiting for you.

530
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,803
And now I'm here.

531
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:42,169
