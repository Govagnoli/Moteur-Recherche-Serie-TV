00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,044
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:07,842
- Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
- Glory isn't a demon. She's a god.

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:12,688
We had to hide the Key.
Made it human and sent it to you.

4
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:14,331
- Dawn.
- I'm not real.

5
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:16,927
You're the Key? Go. Before she finds you.

6
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:18,128
She's here.

7
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,922
I won't help her find the Key.
I would never do that to an innocent...

8
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,573
- An innocent?
- It's not a person.

9
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:29,127
- What about the Key?
- He indicated that it was a person.

10
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:33,491
- I'll tell you who the sodding Key is.
- The vampire is lying to me.

11
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:37,361
The Slayer is going to kick your lopsided ass.

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,124
- Professor Lillian?
- Buffy.

13
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,729
I'm sorry that I missed the lecture today.
Was it good?

14
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,329
Of course it was.

15
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,853
- Do you want me to try?
- Yes. Thanks.

16
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,811
The slide is stuck in the thing.

17
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,849
OK.

18
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:12,892
I just came by to tell you
that I have to drop this class.

19
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:16,292
All my classes, actually.

20
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:18,648
I'm not finishing the semester.

21
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,452
I wish...

22
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,286
I just... I can't be in school right now.

23
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,409
I have to take care of my sister.

24
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:28,961
Yes. I thoughtyou might.

25
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:33,564
I was very sorry to hear aboutyour loss.

26
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,168
I have these forms from
the registrar's office that I need you to sign.

27
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,244
Oh. Yes.

28
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:50,010
Thanks.

29
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,684
Is there something else?

30
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,604
No.

31
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:02,684
Yes. Yeah.

32
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:07,568
I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoyed this class.

33
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,451
I mean, I knowthat I wasn't
the best student, but I really learned a lot.

34
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:15,882
And I really like poetry.

35
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,487
I really do.

36
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,969
- Sorry.
- I'm glad you like poetry, Buffy.

37
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:28,649
I wish I had time for it.
But I just don't right now.

38
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,372
Well, maybe short poems.

39
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:36,732
Yeah. Like those Japanese ones
that... sound like a sneeze?

40
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,804
- Haiku?
- Right.

41
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:43,091
Maybe those.
And hopefully I'll be back next semester.

42
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,532
When I'm more myself again.

43
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,448
Benjamin. This is a pleasant surprise.

44
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,252
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You're not late.

45
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,962
- But, sir...
- You can't be late to a job you don't have.

46
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:02,649
Interestingly enough, I've decided to give
your job to someone who'll actually do it.

47
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:06,802
Honest to God, I've been calling you
for two weeks. Where have you been?

48
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:11,603
I didn't wanna... I'm sorry to fire you,
but I need somebody I can count on.

49
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,729
I haven't been here...

50
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,886
I haven't been here in two weeks.
There's an explanation for this.

51
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,612
Which I can't exactly give you.

52
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:23,965
I... Can I just tell you it's not my fault?

53
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:29,526
Sure. You can also tell me
that the dog ate your homework,

54
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,207
or maybe eating Twinkies made you do it,

55
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:36,571
or maybe, yeah, that there's really
a wicked, demonic creature living inside you

56
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:40,851
that takes control of your body
and forces you to do its bidding.

57
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:44,451
Take responsibility for your actions, Ben.

58
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,206
All right. This...

59
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,887
Oh, forget it. Just forget it.

60
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:52,533
This is so unfair.
You're taking everything away.

61
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:55,127
Everything I worked for,
I earned, I care about.

62
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:59,684
These are my choices.
This is my life, and you're ruining it!

63
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,412
No. No.

64
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,882
Not here. Not now, please.

65
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,127
I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben.

66
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:11,762
I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben. I'm Ben! I'm Ben!

67
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:18,171
I'm hungry.

68
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,521
We got this part right, that's for sure.

69
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:20,129
Lot of sucky things in this dimension.
Bubble baths? Not one of'em.

70
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:24,210
- Know what I mean?
- I am in thunderous agreement,

71
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,488
O glittering, glistening Glorificus.

72
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,087
I wasn't talking to you.

73
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:34,171
Begging your pardon, and begging
in general, but were you talking to me?

74
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:38,129
Yeah, right. Like any of you
have ever bathed anyway.

75
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,966
Oh, but we do, Your Scrumptiousness.

76
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,851
We bathe in your
splendiferous radiance, your...

77
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:47,721
How aboutyou shut up and listen to me,
you disgusting little fools?

78
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,932
OK.

79
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:54,643
Now, I asked for the Key,
and you brought me a vampire.

80
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:58,123
A pulseless, impure, follicly fried vampire.

81
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,169
Loofah.

82
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,490
So, what I think we have here

83
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,041
is a failure for you to do your frickin' jobs.

84
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,203
Pardon my French.

85
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:10,249
Mimosa.

86
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,649
Vitamins.

87
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,725
So rack your minion brains
and tell me everything you saw

88
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,123
when you were spying
on Buffy and her wacky pals.

89
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,010
Everything.

90
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,722
- Then I'll figure out who the Key is.
- You lied to me?

91
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:35,484
Didn't... lie... exactly.

92
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:39,646
Really? What about all the times I asked you
how school was and you said "fine"?

93
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,530
Well, it was.

94
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,889
You didn't ask if I was in it when it was fine.

95
00:06:46,293 --> 00:06:51,367
I don't know what to say. I'm sure you're
aware that the past few months, you know,

96
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,207
have been kind of hard for Dawn.
Not that I'm saying that's an excuse.

97
00:06:55,293 --> 00:07:00,083
I understand. Your mother was a lovely
woman, and we'll all miss her very much.

98
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:05,687
- I know how difficult it must be.
- It is. Especially for Dawn.

99
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,923
She's just a kid.

100
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,287
Well,

101
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:14,083
I think we both knowthat Dawn
is a lot more than " just a kid".

102
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:21,612
She's a talented young girl
with a sharp mind,

103
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:24,082
when she puts the effort in.

104
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:28,927
I realise there's been some ball-dropping,
but I'm sure this will all...

105
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,005
Dawn, why don'tyou
wait outside for a few minutes?

106
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:06,087
Honey. Old saying:
"A watched customer never buys."

107
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,131
They would if they were patriotic.

108
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,567
OK, I'm goin' in.

109
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,803
- Patriotic?
- Yes.

110
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:18,681
I've recently come to realise
there's more to me than just being human.

111
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,162
I'm also an American.

112
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:26,088
I suppose you are, in a manner of speaking.
You were born here. Your mortal self.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,208
Well, that's right, foreigner.

114
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,648
So I've read a lot about
the good old "us of A",

115
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,567
embracing the precious ideology
that's helped to shape and define it.

116
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,405
- Democracy?
- Capitalism.

117
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:40,610
A free market dependent on
the exchange of goods for currency.

118
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:44,447
A system of symbiotic beauty,
apparently lost on these old people.

119
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,127
Look at 'em. Perusing the shelves.

120
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:51,445
Undressing the merchandise
with their eyeballs. All ogle, no cash.

121
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,522
It's not just annoying, it's un-American.

122
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:59,126
Appalling. Almost as if they no longer
think money can buy happiness.

123
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:04,201
Totally un-American.
Oh, and you know what else is un-American?

124
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,409
- French people.
- You don't say.

125
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:11,806
From what I hear, they don't tip. French old
people? That's really the bottom of the barrel.

126
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:16,762
An, how's about we try being a bit
less prejudiced and a bit more inclusive?

127
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:19,162
Not us, justyou.

128
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:22,723
Fine. I'm gonna make
those fogeys buy things.

129
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,441
Hey, what's up?
It's Dawn Giovanni and the Buffster.

130
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,331
- Hi.
- Hey, everybody.

131
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:42,123
- Everything went well at the university?
- Yep. I'm all dropped out.

132
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,647
Good on you. Welcome to the real world.

133
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:48,169
Lot of fun to be had on the outside.
You'll see.

134
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,802
It's just for now. I thinkthat
I'll probably go back next semester.

135
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:56,683
That's cool, too. Whatever you choose,
you've got my support. Just think of me as...

136
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:01,321
as your...

137
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:06,203
I'm searching for supportive things, and I'm
comin' up all bras, so something more manly.

138
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,807
Think of me as that.

139
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,566
Seriously. Whatever you need.

140
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:15,882
Thank you. Actually, I need
to talkto Giles alone for a minute.

141
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,291
Cool.

142
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:21,490
Dawn, why don'tyou
get started on your homework?

143
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,007
If you need help... Will, could you?

144
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,210
OK.

145
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,281
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

146
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:37,082
She's messing up.
I'm messing up. It's a mess.

147
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:41,248
- You'll just have to putyour foot down.
- I try.

148
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,450
It's just... my foot's
not used to being put down.

149
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:49,003
I wantyou to do it.
You can be the foot-putting-downer.

150
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,563
- No, Buffy. I don't think I can.
- Please?

151
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,328
Pretty please? I mean,
your foot is way bigger than mine.

152
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:59,564
And you're so much more
a grown-up than me.

153
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:04,488
Dawn needs an authority figure,
a strong guiding hand. She'll listen to you.

154
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:06,564
Like you always have.

155
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,923
I listen.

156
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:12,808
I do.

157
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:17,245
Then perk up your ears.

158
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,370
I may be a grown-up, butyou're her family.

159
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,646
Her only real family now.
She needs you to do this.

160
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:30,086
Right.

161
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,646
She needs me.

162
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,008
Me, the grown-up.

163
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:41,247
The authority figure. The strong
guiding hand and stompy foot that is me.

164
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,971
That's the spirit.

165
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,403
OK.

166
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:49,132
- I can do this.
- I know you can.

167
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,044
- Please?
- No.

168
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,884
OK.

169
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,964
Here we go.

170
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:05,487
Early to bed, early to rise, balanced breakfast,
hospital corners. It's a new beginning.

171
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:07,643
Discipline. Authority.

172
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:10,804
Order.

173
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:15,441
What is this? I thought
I told you to do your homework.

174
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:18,445
- I was.
- Please don't lie to me.

175
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,564
- I'm not.
- We were acting out a geometry problem.

176
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:25,531
Cos I read this really neat article that said

177
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:29,845
kids learn math better if you stimulate
their visual learning pattern.

178
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:33,972
You know, using the right side
of the brain instead of just the left?

179
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,771
Stuff like that.

180
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:40,005
So we made a triangle with our bodies.
And that's when I called Xander obtuse.

181
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,881
And he got really grumpy. And then
Dawn said we were "a cute" triangle.

182
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,806
And, well, hilarity ensued.

183
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,803
Right. Well, you know what I think?

184
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,805
I think maybe Dawn should
do her homework at home.

185
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,530
But it was working. I was really learning.

186
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:01,411
Please getyour stuff.

187
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:05,211
Fine. Don't listen to me.

188
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:08,171
Please don't be grouchy with her.

189
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:12,531
Who among us can resist
the allure of really funny math puns?

190
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:16,003
It's really important that
Dawn finishes her schoolwork.

191
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:19,324
Yeah, I know. But we were having
good, clean, educational fun,

192
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:24,248
and then all of a sudden it was all gloom and
doom and the outlawing of human triangles.

193
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:28,761
It's really important that Dawn
finishes her schoolwork right now.

194
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:31,765
I know it is, and I'm a big fan of school.

195
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,970
You know me. I'm like,
"Go to school. It's your birthday."

196
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:37,248
Or something to that effect.

197
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,963
I knowthatyou mean well. Butyou just don't
understand, and there's no way you could.

198
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,647
I do so understand, and...

199
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:49,124
- You're stressed out.
- I'm more than stressed out. I'm freaked out.

200
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,962
Yeah, well, maybe
you need a break, to de-freak.

201
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:58,046
You could go to the World Culture Fair
if you want to, with me and Tara.

202
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:01,842
- I don't think so.
- Come on. You can bring Dawn.

203
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:05,164
It'll be fun. Good, educational-type fun,

204
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:07,528
in a discipline-y sort of way.

205
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,729
I can't do it, Will.

206
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,725
Don't worry. It's not like I don't have a life.

207
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:15,202
I do. I have Dawn's life.

208
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,330
Ready?

209
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:26,004
So it's her. Under our noses all this time.

210
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,447
I like the detailed workthose monks did.

211
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,047
Quirks, foibles, passions.

212
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,125
It's all so cute, so... human.

213
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,925
You know? Pretty convincing, really.

214
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,962
But not convincing enough.

215
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,331
You all know your assignments.

216
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,487
I think it's time to collect the Key.

217
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:05,973
It wasn't anything, really. Buffy was just
a little crabby at Dawn about her schoolwork.

218
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:08,692
- Well, it's understandable.
- Yeah, sure it is.

219
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:12,368
I'd totally be blowing off classes
if I were in Dawnie's shoes.

220
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,809
Sweetie, you wouldn't blow off
a class if your head was on fire.

221
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:19,408
- And I meant Buffy.
- Buffy what?

222
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:24,328
Understandable, about the crabby.
She has to look after Dawn now.

223
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:29,203
Yeah, but not in a Miss Minchin's
Select Seminary for Girls way.

224
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:32,842
She's just gonna make
Dawnie more rebellious.

225
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,005
I had to deal with
my brother's problems after...

226
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,732
I mean, you can't really
know what it's like to...

227
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,804
Yeah, I knowthat.

228
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:47,330
- I didn't mean to...
- No. I just...

229
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,007
I know I can't know whatyou went through.

230
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:55,488
But I just... It's no big.

231
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:58,406
- I made you mad.
- No. No.

232
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:03,009
- All I meant was...
- It's OK. This Buffy thing, let's just forget it.

233
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:07,006
No, please. I mean,
tell me if I said something wrong.

234
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:11,086
Otherwise I know I'll say it again.
Probably often and in public.

235
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,368
No. I was Snippy Gal.

236
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:16,206
It's just... I know I can't...

237
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,284
On some level...

238
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:23,803
It's like my opinion isn't worth anything
because I haven't been through...

239
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,722
I didn't lose my mom, so I don't know.

240
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,964
Well, I'm not the expert.

241
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,613
I mean, I've only lost the one.

242
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,852
Do I act like the Big Knowledge Woman?

243
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,211
No.

244
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:51,490
Is that "no" spelled y-e-s?

245
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,564
S-o-r-t of.

246
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:58,124
I mean, I just feel like the junior partner.

247
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,052
You've been doing everything
longer than me.

248
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:06,285
You've been out longer. You've been
practising witchcraft way longer.

249
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:09,763
Butyou're way beyond me there.
In just a few...

250
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:13,846
I mean, it frightens me
how powerful you're getting.

251
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,248
That's a weird word.

252
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,371
"Getting"?

253
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,842
It frightens you?

254
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,084
- I frighten you?
- That is so not what I meant.

255
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,971
I meant impresses. Impressive.

256
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:33,569
Well, I took Psych 101. I mean,
I took it from an evil government scientist

257
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,009
who was skewered by
her Frankenstein-like creation,

258
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,402
but I know what a Freudian slip is.

259
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,611
Don'tyou trust me?

260
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:47,287
- With my life.
- That's not what I mean.

261
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:52,803
- Can't we just go to the fair?
- I don't feel real multicultural right now.

262
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,530
What is it about me thatyou don't trust?

263
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:02,322
It's not that. I worry, sometimes.

264
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:06,681
You're changing so much, so fast.

265
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:09,731
- I don't know where you're heading.
- Where I'm heading?

266
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,442
- I'm saying everything wrong.
- No. I think you're being pretty clear.

267
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,923
This isn't about the witch thing.
It's about my other changes.

268
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,004
I trustyou. I just...

269
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:24,011
I don't know where I'm gonna fit in,
in your life, when...

270
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:27,085
When I change back?

271
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:31,166
Yeah, this is a college thing,
just a little experimentation

272
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:35,644
before I get over the thrill
and head backto Boys Town.

273
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:41,008
- You thinkthat?
- Should I?

274
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:46,008
I'm really sorry that I didn't
establish my lesbo street cred

275
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,687
before I got into this relationship.

276
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:54,248
You're the only woman
I've ever fallen in love with, so...

277
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,450
how on earth could you
ever take me seriously?

278
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,885
- Willow, please.
- Have fun at the fair.

279
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:15,003
OK. So I thinkthe next step
is to make a chart, a schedule.

280
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:18,563
I'll write down the things
you're supposed to do and when to do them.

281
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:23,681
Then I'll leave a box next to it, which you can
mark with an X when you've done the task.

282
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,051
What?

283
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:29,284
You want gold stars?
OK. You can have gold stars.

284
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:32,410
I don't want gold stars.

285
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:35,212
I don't want any of this.

286
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,007
I'm just trying to give you a normal life.

287
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,084
Good luck.

288
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,452
What? What am I doing wrong now?

289
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,084
This is for real, Dawn.

290
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,323
No, it's not.

291
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:59,326
I'm not real, so why would
my exciting graph of chores be real?

292
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,405
Who cares if a Key
gets an education anyway?

293
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:08,205
It's a chart, not a graph. And you are real.

294
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,362
Yeah? Those monks put
grades K through eight in my head.

295
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,411
Can't we just wait and see
if they drop nine in there too?

296
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,565
Damn it, Dawn. This is serious.

297
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,292
Why? Why should I care about any of this?

298
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:24,171
Because they'll take you away!

299
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:33,802
Take me away?

300
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,771
What do you mean?

301
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,890
They'll take you away from me.

302
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:45,445
That's whatyour principal told me
when you weren't in the room.

303
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,172
If I can't make you go to school,

304
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:51,245
then I won't be found fit
to be your legal guardian.

305
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,363
Where would I go?

306
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:04,489
I don't know.

307
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:08,452
Dad, maybe. Or foster care.

308
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,922
I didn't really wanna ask.

309
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:18,442
You could've told me that.

310
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,404
I just did.

311
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:21,930
Is this seat taken?

312
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:25,443
I hope this isn't a return.

313
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:29,731
Everyone wants petrified hamsters,
and they're never happy with them.

314
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,210
You all right?

315
00:22:35,293 --> 00:22:36,692
Yeah.

316
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:40,209
Ah, yes, because your good mood
is both obvious and contagious.

317
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:43,690
I had a fight with Tara. It was awful.

318
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:46,971
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

319
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:53,047
- You two don't quarrel much, do you?
- Never. Until today.

320
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:56,522
- Well, it's over.
- Over?

321
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:59,047
How can it be over? I just found her.

322
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,324
The quarrel is over.

323
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:06,083
Yeah.

324
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:11,725
You'll feel better when you've apologised and
know you can fight without the world ending.

325
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:15,647
I know it all seems bleak now
but, as they say, "This too...

326
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:19,283
shall pass."

327
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,611
- Wow!
- What do we have here?

328
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:30,164
- He's one of those things that work for Glory.
- Yes. How helpful.

329
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:35,327
I do indeed work for the god. Let me go
if you do not wish to incur her anger.

330
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,850
Well, she's not here. What a marvellous
opportunity for you and me to talk.

331
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:45,087
I will not betray Glorificus. I will never talk,
no matter what heinous torture...

332
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,802
Actually, you're talking quite a lot,
just not about the right things.

333
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,724
Tell us why you're here.

334
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:54,442
No words shall pass my lips
that would bring peril to Glorificus.

335
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:00,082
Girls, get the twine that's on the counter.
Let's tie him up.

336
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:04,051
Don't! I'll tell you anything. Please.

337
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:08,527
Whatever you want. Just... Anything.

338
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,605
- What happened?
- He changed his mind.

339
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:15,402
I'm... I'm supposed to watch.

340
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:20,044
We're watching the Slayer's people
while Glory fetches the Key.

341
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,693
- Glory knows who the Key is?
- Oh, God.

342
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:25,241
- We've gotta call Buffy.
- Too late. Too late.

343
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,405
Glorificus will find the witch
and you can't stop her.

344
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:31,166
- Witch? What do you mean?
- Tara.

345
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:35,644
She's new among you. It wasn't hard to figure
out. The Glorious One will have found her.

346
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,248
- Willow, wait. I'll...
- No. Call Buffy and go look in Tara's room.

347
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,722
I'm gonna checkthe fair.

348
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:45,649
This is nice.

349
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,486
Just hangin' out, just us girls.

350
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,962
You like this sort of thing, don'tyou?

351
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,366
Don't make a sound.

352
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:03,124
Nah. They won't help you.
I'd kill them. You knowthat.

353
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,449
There's no one here that can stop me.

354
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,801
I'll kill her and...

355
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,884
and them.

356
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,891
I'll kill him and her and her.
And it'll all be your fault.

357
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:26,045
Kinda funny, isn't it?
All these people here and...

358
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:30,365
no one who can do a thing,
not a person who can help you.

359
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:35,921
But that's people for ya.
They're pretty worthless.

360
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,851
But Keys, on the other hand,

361
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:43,811
Keys are worth a very lot.

362
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:54,443
You lying little tramp.
You're not the Key. You're nothing.

363
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:59,004
Just another worthless human being!
I hate being lied to.

364
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,681
It makes me feel so betrayed.

365
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:09,722
You wanna make it all better?

366
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:14,523
If you tell me who the Key really is,
I'll letyou go.

367
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:19,403
Think about it. You think your hand hurts?

368
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:24,726
Imagine whatyou'd feel
with my fingers wiggling in your brain.

369
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,609
It doesn't kill you.

370
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,649
What it does...

371
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:33,203
is make you feel like
you're in a noisy little dark room,

372
00:26:34,413 --> 00:26:37,166
naked and ashamed.

373
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:41,804
And there are things in the dark
that need to hurtyou because you're bad.

374
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:45,169
Little pinching things that go in your ears

375
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:48,643
and crawl on the inside of your skull.

376
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,885
And you know, if the noise
and the crawling would stop,

377
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:55,965
thatyou could remember howto get out.

378
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,602
Butyou never, ever will.

379
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,524
Who is the Key?

380
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:20,211
Fine.

381
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,249
Let's get crazy.

382
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,169
Tara!

383
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,723
Tara! By the force of heart
and mindful power,

384
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:37,053
by waning time at the waxing hour,

385
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,647
I... when I decree...

386
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:41,771
What is it? What is it?

387
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,650
No! No!

388
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,563
...that she I love must now be free!

389
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,530
Tara!

390
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:54,972
No!

391
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:58,762
Tara? Tara, are you OK?

392
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,321
It's dirty. It's all dirty.

393
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:06,208
And all over me. Dirty. Dirty.

394
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,887
I'm bad. Bad.

395
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,246
Tara!

396
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,803
Tara, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

397
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,449
Can't she go home now?

398
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:35,287
Unfortunately, no. Hospital policy
dictates we keep her for the night.

399
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:38,092
But does she have to?
I can take care of her at home.

400
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:43,008
It's poisoned. Why did I tell you that?
It has to be checked, though.

401
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:48,286
- She your sister?
- It has to be verified.

402
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:52,082
Anyone can tell you that.
Of course. Of course, of course.

403
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:54,164
She's my everything.

404
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:59,889
You can get her released in the morning. But
she must spend one night in the psych ward.

405
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,966
Just for observation. We'll keep an eye
on her, do a couple of basic tests,

406
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:07,443
then you take her home.
Does that sound fair?

407
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:11,970
Well, sit tight, then, and I'll send
a nurse by in few minutes to pick up Tara.

408
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:23,892
Man, words cannot express
how much I hate this place.

409
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:27,204
- It's dreadful.
- It's like communism.

410
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:32,002
Will, I'm so sorry.

411
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,364
They kill mice.

412
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,772
Tara.

413
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:59,447
I'm sorry it took me so long. But Dawn's safe
with Spike, so I can stay as long as you need.

414
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:05,525
- I'm so scared.
- Nothin' to be worried about, kid.

415
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,003
No one's gonna hurtyou.

416
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:12,086
Oh, yeah? The same "no one"
who did that to you?

417
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:16,644
What, these? It's just a few bruises.
Nothin' to write home about.

418
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:20,523
Hey, chin up, platelet.

419
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:25,050
And don't get scared. Maybe Glory doesn't
wanna kill you. Maybe it's something...

420
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,930
Worse?

421
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:58,405
- Hey.
- You wanna know what I'm scared of, Spike?

422
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:01,850
Me.

423
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:08,166
Right now, Glory thinks Tara's the Key.

424
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,044
But I'm the Key, Spike.

425
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:15,244
I am.

426
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,891
And anything that happens to Tara...

427
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,964
is cos of me.

428
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:24,806
Your bruises, your limp...

429
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:29,007
that's all me, too.

430
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:34,044
I'm like a lightning rod for pain and hurt.

431
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:38,522
And everyone around me suffers and dies.

432
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:44,286
I must be something so horrible...

433
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:50,446
to cause so much pain and evil.

434
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:53,648
Rot.

435
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:57,931
What do you know?

436
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:00,243
I'm a vampire.

437
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,166
I know somethin' about evil.

438
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,562
You're not evil.

439
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,051
Maybe I'm not evil.

440
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:15,332
But I don't think I can be good.

441
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:22,971
Well, I'm not good, and I'm OK.

442
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:27,012
Don't! Please don't with that treachery!

443
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:32,372
I told the cats. And now
I beg my mother sitting all alone.

444
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:36,048
Bye, Tara. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.

445
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:40,529
Willow. No. It's just for one night.

446
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:43,923
Yeah, I know, but... it's a whole night.

447
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,011
I don't think I can sleep without her.

448
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:50,086
You can sleep with me.

449
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:57,522
Well, now, that came out a lot more
lesbian than it sounded in my head.

450
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:02,251
Will, you just have to rest.
OK? Right nowthere's nothing you can do.

451
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,964
Yes, there is.

452
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:09,887
No. No way. You cannot
even think about taking on Glory.

453
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:12,533
You saw what she did.
I can't let her get away with it.

454
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:16,925
No. You have to let her get away with it.
Even I'm no match for her. You knowthat.

455
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:20,085
- But maybe I am.
- You're not. And I won't letyou go.

456
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:22,926
This is notyour choice. It's mine.

457
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:24,924
This is not the time.

458
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:27,925
When, Buffy? When is? When youfeel like it?

459
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,604
When it's someone you love
as much as I love Tara?

460
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,161
When it's Dawn? Is that it?

461
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:39,452
When we have a chance.
We'll fight her when we have a chance.

462
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:44,525
You wouldn't last five minutes
with her, Willow. She's a god.

463
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,962
Fine. I'll wait.

464
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:53,003
It's the only way.

465
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,890
Yeah.

466
00:33:56,653 --> 00:34:00,441
- Can I do anything?
- Just let me be alone.

467
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:52,603
You know, I think I'm a little buzzed
from eating that witch!

468
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:56,447
What a mind she had! Mmm, nummy treat!

469
00:34:56,533 --> 00:35:01,607
- But is Your Grace not concerned about...
- What, about the Slayer? Don't be stupid.

470
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,682
I know I'm closing in.
The Key's as good as mine.

471
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:10,403
A girl like Buffy's got just so many friends.
All I gotta do is rip through 'em one by one,

472
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,643
until I finally...

473
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:26,049
Did anybody order an apocalypse?

474
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,053
Kali, Hera, Cronus, Tonic.

475
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:34,971
Air like nectar, thick as onyx.

476
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:39,365
- Cassiel, by your second star...
- Ah. It's the lover.

477
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:42,650
- That's so cute.
- ...hold mine victim as in tar.

478
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:47,808
I owe you pain!

479
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,122
- It's all my fault.
- No.

480
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:59,011
Sweetheart, it is notyour fault.

481
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,763
How's Willow?

482
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,483
She was looking to go
all payback-y on Glory for a minute.

483
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:11,643
But I cooled her down, a little.

484
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,564
Actually, a lot.

485
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,804
So she's not gonna do anything rash, then?

486
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:21,408
No. I explained there was no point.

487
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:26,649
What?

488
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:34,807
So you're saying that
a powerful and mightily pissed-off witch

489
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:40,013
was plannin' on going and spillin' herself
a few pints of god blood until you... what?

490
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,890
"Explained"?

491
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:45,692
You think she'd...? No.

492
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,571
I told Willow it would be like suicide.

493
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,644
I'd do it.

494
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:55,770
Right person.

495
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:57,889
Person I loved.

496
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:00,325
I'd do it.

497
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,288
Think, Buffy,

498
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,841
if Glory had done that to me.

499
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,691
Shatter.

500
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:18,161
Is that it? Is that the bestyou can do?
You think I care about all this?

501
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,892
The apartment, the clothes?

502
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:26,368
Now, sucking on your girlfriend's mind?

503
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:29,361
That was something to treasure.

504
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,252
What's this? Bag of tricks?

505
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,528
Bag of knives.

506
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:46,049
Spirit of serpents, now appear.

507
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:51,532
Hissing, writhing, striking near.

508
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:00,241
Nowthis is getting weak.

509
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:04,453
And so are you, honey. Aren'tya?

510
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,763
No!

511
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:17,242
You know what they used to do
to witches, lover? Crucify 'em.

512
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,767
They used to bow down to gods.

513
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:27,205
Things change.

514
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,851
That witch really slowed me down.

515
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:52,730
- Thicken.
- This isn't over, you hear me?

516
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,281
It isn't over!

517
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:09,491
- Chicken salad?
- Right here.

518
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:13,122
Eggplant, that's me. Salami with...

519
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,685
peanut butter?

520
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:16,967
Dawn.

521
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:21,365
Yeah, like eggplant is normal.
It's what, half egg, half plant?

522
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,762
Cos that's just a natural.

523
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,684
What's Tara got?

524
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,882
I got her tuna. Does she like...

525
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:34,882
Tara?

526
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:45,407
Plastic and their six sisters.

527
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,961
Six sick sisters.

528
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,328
- Willow?
- It's OK.

529
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:53,007
Let's just start slowtoday.

530
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,129
Buffy, could I have that?

531
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,444
Here you go.

532
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,969
That's my girl.

533
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:13,484
Can I help?

534
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,248
What are you gonna need?

535
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,485
I don't know. They gave me
a lot of stuff to keep her calm.

536
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:38,171
They said I might
have to restrain her at night.

537
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:41,643
But... sometimes she's fine.

538
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:46,001
She looks at me and... she's fine.

539
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:53,684
- I'm sorry I couldn't...
- It's OK.

540
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:55,445
I can do this.

541
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:59,162
I'm gonna take care of her.
Even if she never...

542
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,244
She's my girl.

543
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:12,441
I understand.

544
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,486
I know you do.

545
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:23,841
Hear that, baby?

546
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:26,084
You're my always.

547
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:38,010
- I told you this wasn't over.
- No. The place is cracking!

548
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,812
It's cracking! Cracking! No, no!

549
00:41:40,893 --> 00:41:42,485
No, Tara, it's OK.

550
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:44,570
Look at that. Look at that.

551
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:48,089
Oh, the light! Oh, it's so pure.

552
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,651
Such pure green energy.

553
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:55,045
Oh, it's so beautiful.
