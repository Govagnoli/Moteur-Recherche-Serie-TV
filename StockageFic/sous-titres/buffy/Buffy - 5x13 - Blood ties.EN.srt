1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:05,842
- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":
- We had to hide the Key.

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:09,403
Made it human and sent it to you.

3
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:13,168
Dawn? Did you know your sister took
my Key? And she won't give it back.

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:15,926
- I betyou know where she put it.
- She doesn't know.

5
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,971
OK, let's see who you are.

6
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:23,242
The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order.
And now your enemy.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,803
So long as you protect the Key,
the brotherhood will never stop

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,168
until we destroy it and you.

9
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,892
Look atyou. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.

10
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:34,692
- Because you are.
- Well...

11
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:35,762
yeah.

12
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:39,289
- Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
- Glory isn't a demon.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,523
- What is she?
- She's a god.

14
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:47,651
Mom wants to make with the merry tomorrow
night, but with everything that's going on...

15
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:52,568
This is exactly whatyou need:
a 20th-birthday party with presents,

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,850
and funny hats,
and those candles that don't blow out.

17
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,764
- Those used to scare me.
- Me too.

18
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,765
I don't thinkthis is
the best time for the party piñata.

19
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,128
We need to stay focused to stop Glory.

20
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:07,172
We're goin' up against a god,
an actual mightier-than-thou god.

21
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:11,132
- Well, the bigger they are...
- The faster they stomp you into nothing.

22
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:16,328
She's right. I've thrown everything I've got
at her. She just shrugs it off.

23
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:20,770
- Then find something heavier to throw.
- That might pose some difficulty.

24
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:24,732
From what the Council's discovered
from the Book of Tarnis and other sources,

25
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,963
Glory and two fellow Hell gods

26
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,841
ruled over one of the more seriously
unpleasant demon dimensions.

27
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,528
- There's more than one?
- There are thousands. All different.

28
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:37,446
All pushing at our reality,
trying to find a way in.

29
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,252
I guess Glory found one.
The question is, why?

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:46,329
There's nothing to indicate that here. Just
vague references to chaos and destruction.

31
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:50,167
OK, so we know where Glory's from.
What do we know about her?

32
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:53,563
She's tough,
but no bolts of lightning, no blasts of fire.

33
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:56,406
- Shouldn't a god be able to do that?
- Usually, yes.

34
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,281
But being in human form must
be severely limiting her powers.

35
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:04,651
No, all we have to worry about right now
is she's immortal, invulnerable and insane.

36
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:09,090
A crazy Hell god?
And the fun just keeps on leavin'.

37
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:14,805
From what I can gather, her living in this
world is seriously affecting her mental state.

38
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:19,131
She's only been able to keep her mind
intact by extracting energy from us.

39
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,488
Well, from the human brain.

40
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,529
She's a brain-sucker?

41
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:29,210
She "absorbs the energies that bind
the human mind into a cohesive whole."

42
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:32,126
- Once drained, all that's left is...
- Crazy people.

43
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:37,003
Which is why there's been an increase in the
ranks of the mentally unstable in Sunnydale.

44
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:39,448
At least vampires just kill you.

45
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:41,524
We have to find a way to stop her.

46
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,730
Well, Tara and I can work
on some tactical spells.

47
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:49,364
I can do some research. I know way more
about demon dimensions than Giles does.

48
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:51,926
Well, I do.

49
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:56,848
This is great long-term-planny stuff, but what
about this Key thingy Glory's lookin' for?

50
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,925
Yeah. Shouldn't we try
to find it before she does?

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,129
I don't think we should worry about that.

52
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:06,252
They've got a point. Whatever Glory's
planning on opening with the Key,

53
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,325
I'm guessing it won't be filled
with candy and flowers.

54
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:14,568
So where should we look? Do we know
where it used to be kept? Who saw it last?

55
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,723
We did. Giles and me.

56
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:18,925
We know where it is.

57
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:22,210
- You what?
- You know, and you didn't tell us?

58
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,005
There were reasons.

59
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:28,722
Look, if Glory knewthat
you guys knew where it was...

60
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,088
I didn't wanna putyou in that kind of danger.

61
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:34,290
As opposed to the other kind
we're always in?

62
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:37,046
- You should've said something.
- Will, there...

63
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,684
You're right.

64
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:48,368
- It's time.
- Are you sure?

65
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,406
They'll be risking their lives.
They deserve to know.

66
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,087
Know what?

67
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:01,248
There's something thatyou
need to know... about Dawn.

68
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:06,087
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

69
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:11,201
The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

70
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:15,605
The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

71
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,605
You really think He is going to help you?

72
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,163
I fear your faith is gravely misplaced.

73
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,362
Shall we testyour faith now?

74
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,052
Never send a minion to do a god's work.

75
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:18,844
Hey, nice sword.

76
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,725
Bet it hurts.

77
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,847
- You guys doin' a spell?
- Dawn, hey.

78
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,606
Yeah, we're doing
an early-warning incantation.

79
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,288
If anything Hell-godishly powerful
comes within 100ft of the shop,

80
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,366
then screechy siren things
will, you know, screech.

81
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:41,843
This should give us a heads-up
so we can hide the... Key.

82
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,762
We already put one up around your house.

83
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,924
Cool. Can I help?

84
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:52,772
I don't think Buffy would like the black arts
bumpin' auras with the littlest Summers.

85
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,887
Yeah. Whatever.

86
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:00,289
How can she not be real?

87
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,843
She's real. She's just kinda... new.

88
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:11,128
Hey. We on the case?

89
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,011
Yeah. Right on top, perched, ready for action.

90
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,731
How's my sweet fancy Dawn doin'?

91
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,007
Fine.

92
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,971
What's up with you?
Did you get into the sugar again?

93
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:24,728
You make a very pretty little girl.

94
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:30,331
- Anya, you wanna help me with that thing?
- Xander needs help with his thing!

95
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,482
I'm not sure our regular workout
is challenging you any more.

96
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:42,532
- Perhaps we should make it harder.
- You always think harder is better.

97
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:46,891
Maybe next time I patrol I should carry a load
of bricks and use a stake made of butter.

98
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:51,763
Very amusing. I'm sure Dawn feels
that way about her schoolwork sometimes.

99
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,208
That true? How was school today?

100
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:58,286
The usual: big square building
filled with boredom and despair.

101
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:03,367
Just how I remember it.
So, what's the homework sitch?

102
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:07,526
We imagine what we'll be like in ten years
and write a letter to our future self.

103
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,207
The teacher's so out of ideas. Wanna help?

104
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,330
Maybe later.
I have some stuff I have to do first.

105
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:17,452
- About the weird girl that came to the house?
- Glory. And no, it's not.

106
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,682
Like you'd tell me anyway.
Dawn's too young and too delicate.

107
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:24,241
Right. A young, delicate pain in my butt.

108
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:29,691
I think you're freakin' out cos you have to
fight someone prettier. That's the case, right?

109
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:36,209
Glory is evil and powerful.
And in no way prettier than me.

110
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:40,684
I think you're getting soft in your advanced
age. She didn't lookthat tough to me.

111
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:43,573
OK. One more time.

112
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,690
Just between me and you,

113
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:50,083
our itsy-bitsy little secret.

114
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,764
Where is the Key?

115
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:59,084
Even if I knew, I'd die
a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.

116
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:02,085
Well, you won't need a thousand, sweetie.

117
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:05,210
I'll make the first one last. Long time.

118
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,081
What is it with you religious types?

119
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,004
It's intimacy, isn't it?

120
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:21,126
You're just scared of letting someone in!

121
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:24,611
It's OK.

122
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:27,332
I know how difficult the first time can be.

123
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,009
You don't have to be afraid.

124
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,732
Just relax.

125
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,281
You may not have the info I want...

126
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:41,005
butyou still got somethin' I need.

127
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,051
- Prezzies!
- See? Just whatyou needed.

128
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,125
You are very, very wise.
Now gimme, gimme, gimme.

129
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:01,532
This is extremely suspenseful.

130
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,569
I want the presents.

131
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,964
It's beautiful. Thank you, guys.

132
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:09,692
We thoughtyou'd get
crossbows and killy stuff.

133
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:12,048
So we figured, less killy, more frilly.

134
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:18,966
It's just so lovely!
Oh, I wish it was mine!

135
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,882
Like you weren't all thinking the same thing.

136
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,124
I'm fairly certain I wasn't.
I've got one just like it.

137
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,169
Here. Open mine.

138
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,930
It's not gonna explode, is it?

139
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:37,930
It's when we visited Dad
that summer in San Diego.

140
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,803
I put the shells on it myself.
We picked them off the beach.

141
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,371
I remember.

142
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:55,612
Well, jeez, don't get all movie-of-the-week.

143
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:59,205
I was just too cheap
to buy you a real present.

144
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,764
Thank you.

145
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:14,005
It still seems there's a lotyou don't know
about this. I mean, is she dangerous?

146
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,048
No.

147
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,126
I assume you're talking about her existence
rather than her intentions?

148
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,566
Exactly.

149
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:24,805
Dawn? What are you doing in there?
Party getting slow?

150
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,169
We need plates. It's cake time.

151
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,966
Why does everybody act
all weird when I'm around?

152
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,248
Me? Me not weird.

153
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:48,371
I'm not an idiot.
I know you're talking about me.

154
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:52,412
- No. No, we really weren't.
- We were talking about sex.

155
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:54,961
They were talking about me, like everybody.

156
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,328
Again, not so much. In fact, none.

157
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:01,725
We were talking about sex. You know us -
sometimes we like to pretend stuff.

158
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,805
- Anya...
- Like, there's a fireman, or a shepherd...

159
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,930
You know what? Let's not have
this exchange of images now.

160
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:11,563
Oh, right. Of course.
Can't let Dawn hear anything.

161
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:17,526
Fine. I'm just gonna go to bed. That way,
I won't accidentally get exposed to... words.

162
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:24,647
Cake?

163
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:02,570
- Jeez! Lurk much?
- I wasn't lurkin'.

164
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:05,326
I was standin' about.
It's a whole different vibe.

165
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:07,804
What is...

166
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:12,805
Are you giving Buffy a birthday present?

167
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,488
Oh, my God. Weird.
And chocolates? Lame.

168
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:21,567
And the box is all bent. And, well, you know
she'd never touch anything from you anyway.

169
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:25,286
Shouldn'tyou be tucked away
in your beddy-bye?

170
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:28,729
All warm and safe
where nothing can eatyou?

171
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,605
Is that supposed to scare me?

172
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:35,685
- Little tremble wouldn't hurt.
- Sorry, it's just...

173
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:39,167
Come on, I'm badder than you.

174
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,562
- Are not!
- Am too.

175
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,089
You're in the bushes hugging
a bent box of chocolates, and I'm...

176
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:48,927
What? Sneaking out to braid hair
and watch Teletubbies with your mates?

177
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:50,492
No.

178
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:54,525
I'm breaking into the magic shop.

179
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,683
To steal things.

180
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,004
Magic shop, eh?

181
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:05,050
All number of beasties
between here and there.

182
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:08,330
Bet they'd really go for
a Little Red Riding Hood like you.

183
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,007
That wouldn't sit too well with big sister.

184
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,647
I can take care of myself.

185
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,245
- You wanna come steal some stuff?
- Yeah, all right.

186
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:32,331
- Do you know howto do that or not?
- Give us a sec.

187
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,485
I usually just burst through doors.

188
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:38,721
That's right! Who's bad now?

189
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,288
Girl with a mission, eh? What's the caper?

190
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:47,924
Jewels? Ancient artefacts? Or just
plain hard cash liberated from the till?

191
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,492
A book.

192
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:52,087
All this for a book?

193
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:57,201
I don't want the book, just what's inside.
I think it was Giles's notes.

194
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:02,292
He was standing here,
and when I turned around it was gone.

195
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:14,492
Where did he learn to write
so bloody small? From a fruit fly?

196
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,963
Wait. Here's something.
"Tarnis, 12th century."

197
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,965
"One of the founders
of the Monks of the Order of Dagon."

198
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,523
"Their sole purpose appears
to have been as protectors of the Key."

199
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,922
Brown-robe types always protect something.

200
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:30,005
It's the only way
they can justify giving up girls.

201
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,530
Troll hammer.

202
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,804
Didn't go with my stuff anyway.

203
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:43,045
"The Key is not directly described in
any literature, but all research indicates

204
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:48,048
an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional
frequency beyond human perception."

205
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:52,251
"Only those outside reality
can see the Key's true nature."

206
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,893
"Outside reality." What's that mean?

207
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:58,291
Second-sight blokes, mostly.

208
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,365
Or even justyour run-of-the-mill lunatics.

209
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:04,851
You don't belong here.

210
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,330
- There! There's no one in there.
- I know whatyou are.

211
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:11,052
What else does it say about this Key?

212
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:14,728
Is it made out of gold?
Maybe we can hock it, split the take.

213
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:19,883
"The Key is also susceptible
to necromanced animal detection,

214
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:23,443
particularly those of canine
or serpent construct."

215
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:37,647
"The monks possessed the ability
to transform energy, bend reality."

216
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,126
Blah, blah, blah.

217
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,442
Good Lord, Giles writes
as dull as he talks, doesn't he?

218
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,330
"They started work,

219
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:52,045
but the Council has suggested
to us that they were interrupted."

220
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:56,241
"Presumably by... Glory."

221
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,689
"They obviously did manage
to accomplish the taste..."

222
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:02,048
"accomplish the task."

223
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:07,082
"They had to be certain the Slayer
would protect it with her life,

224
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:11,610
so they sent the Key to her in human form."

225
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,321
"In the form of a sister."

226
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,443
I guess that's you, niblet.

227
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:36,206
- Not even a card, huh?
- I wasn't really expecting one.

228
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:40,645
No contact with civilians.
There's probably a code name for it.

229
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:44,362
You know, like "radio silence".
It's "greeting-card silence".

230
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,650
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's time to start a newtradition:

231
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,328
birthdays without boyfriends.
It could be just as much fun.

232
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:56,247
- Preachin' to the choir here, baby.
- Yeah. Some of my best...

233
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,204
Oh, my God.

234
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,644
Is this blood?

235
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,770
- Dawn!
- Oh, baby.

236
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:14,122
- What did you do?
- This is blood, isn't it?

237
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:17,171
It can't be me. I'm not a key.

238
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:21,843
- I'm not a thing.
- Oh, sweetie, no. What is this all about?

239
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,844
What am I?

240
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:27,005
Am I real? Am I anything?

241
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:35,405
- If you need anything...
- Thanks.

242
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,367
Perhaps I should stay.
You know, just in case.

243
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:48,605
This is a family thing.
We should deal with this.

244
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,206
OK.

245
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,447
Why didn'tyou tell me?

246
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:09,288
We were going to. I just...

247
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:17,685
We thought it would be better
if we waited until you were older.

248
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:21,846
- How old am I now?
- You're 14, sweetheart. You knowthat.

249
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:25,164
No. The monks, when did...

250
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:28,204
When did...

251
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:32,204
Six months ago.

252
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:37,811
I've only been alive for six months, huh?

253
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,283
You've been alive a lot longer than that to us.

254
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:44,171
You don't knowthat.
You don't know anything.

255
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:48,408
I'm just a key, right?
Everything about me is made up.

256
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,165
Dawn...

257
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,849
Mom and I know what we feel.

258
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,689
I know I care aboutyou.
I knowthat I worry aboutyou.

259
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:02,563
You worry about me because you have to.
I'm your job. Protect the Key, right?

260
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,321
I worry because my sister is cutting herself!

261
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,850
Yeah? How do you know? Maybe this is just
another fake memory from my fake family.

262
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,725
Sweetheart.

263
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,281
- Get out.
- Dawn.

264
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,762
Get out, get out, get out!

265
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,132
We need answers, Giles.

266
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:29,047
We need to find out
everything we can about the Key.

267
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:33,809
- What's it for, who created it...
- And why Glory has a girl-god jones for it.

268
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,885
This isn't about her. It's about Dawn.

269
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:42,093
She deserves to know where she came from.
She needs to know, or it will eat away at her.

270
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:46,291
How did she find these?
How did she get in here in the...

271
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,812
Who's been using
the Urn of Ishtar as an ashtray?

272
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,406
Morning, sunshine. If you've come round
for eggs and sausage, I'm fresh out.

273
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:01,762
Hey, careful! These are wet.

274
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:07,087
How could you let her find out like that?
From books and papers?

275
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:09,641
You hate me that much?

276
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:14,329
I was just along for the ride. Not like
I knew she was mystical glowy Key thing.

277
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:17,405
Nobody keeps me in
the bloody loop, do they?

278
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,526
- You could have stopped her.
- Oh, yeah, here it comes.

279
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,844
Something goes wrong in your life,
blame Spike.

280
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,810
News flash, blondie.

281
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:34,969
If kid sis wants to grab a midnight stroll,
she'll find a way sooner or later.

282
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:39,171
I just thought she'd be safer
with Big Bad lookin' over her shoulder.

283
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,124
She shouldn't have found out like that.

284
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:48,364
You didn't think you could
keep the truth from her for ever?

285
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:50,728
Maybe if you had been more honest with her,

286
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:55,933
you wouldn't be trying to make yourself
feel better with a round of Kick The Spike.

287
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,571
Honey?

288
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:10,121
You're gonna be late for school.

289
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:15,810
I'm not going.
Blobs of energy don't need an education.

290
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:21,923
You want me to make some soup?
I thinkthere's some chicken and stars.

291
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:24,083
I'm not sick!

292
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:27,290
- I'm not anything.
- Honey, calm down, OK?

293
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,841
Don't tell me what to do.

294
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:33,932
You're not my mother.

295
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:44,126
I changed my mind. I'd rather be at school.

296
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:59,322
All right, fellas.
Today we've got blues, greens and...

297
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:02,166
Oh, hey, chartreuse. It's a party.

298
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:04,244
It won't stick.

299
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,689
The birds have been pecking too hard.

300
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:12,607
- Byzantium.
- Yes, they've arrived.

301
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:15,253
Unfortunate, but not completely unexpected.

302
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,052
- How many?
- Their numbers are fewfor the moment.

303
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:21,682
But they'll grow.
The Knights of Byzantium are like ants:

304
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:25,766
firstyou see one, then two...
then the picnic's ruined.

305
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:31,528
No matter how many we kill,
they'll keep coming. Wave after wave.

306
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,843
It's time to set old animosities aside.

307
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:38,290
Your fate is directly linked
to Her Magnificently-Scented Glorificus.

308
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:42,161
She's been extremely forgiving of
your considerable foibles up until now,

309
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:45,484
but if you persist in your defiance,
she'll be forced to...

310
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:48,485
To what? What is she going to do?

311
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:53,328
Send a six-pack of minions to bore me
to death? Glory can't lay a finger on me.

312
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:56,086
You know it, I know it, she knows it.

313
00:23:56,173 --> 00:24:00,405
So save the threats, or I'll finish
the job I started on your head.

314
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,290
We can't just let her sit up there all alone.

315
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:33,366
She needs time.
We can't force her to be all right with this.

316
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:39,003
That's your answer? Just leave her alone
and hope that everything works itself out?

317
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:42,290
No. But if I were her,
I'd want a little bit of time right now.

318
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:47,083
I wouldn't want my mother and
my sister coming at me from all sides.

319
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:50,483
Her school called today. She was suspended.

320
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:55,603
She yelled at a teacher. The things she said,
Buffy. She's never used language like that.

321
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:59,447
She probably feels like she can
say or do anything right now.

322
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:04,004
She's not real. We're not her family.
We don't even know what she is.

323
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:52,043
- How can you talk as if she's a thing?
- I'm not!

324
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,852
I'm just saying
that's probably how she feels.

325
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,242
Then we have to show her that it isn't true.

326
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,211
She needs to know
she's still a part of this family.

327
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,124
It's not that simple!

328
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:06,047
We're not gonna be able to fix this
with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup.

329
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:09,887
Dawn needs to know where she came from.
She needs real answers.

330
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:16,086
What she needs is her sister,
Buffy, not the Slayer.

331
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:21,042
The Slayer is the only thing standing between
Dawn and this god from the bitch dimension

332
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:24,330
that wants to shove her in a lock
and give her a good twirl!

333
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,404
Mom, I need to be out there...

334
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:29,728
Oh, my God. Glory. It's Willow's spell.

335
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:31,451
Wait. It's not Glory.

336
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:35,966
Damn it.

337
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,725
Dawn!

338
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,202
- Buffy.
- No! She could've burned the house down!

339
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,523
Buffy, she's gone.

340
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:52,326
She tore up her room.
She burned all of her diaries.

341
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:54,210
The Dawnmeister Chronicles?

342
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,887
She's been keeping those since...

343
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:58,372
I mean...

344
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:01,684
Since she was seven. I remember too, Will.

345
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,002
We have to find her. Fast.

346
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:09,644
Before Glory or the Knights
of Hack and Slash figure out what...

347
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,883
who she really is.

348
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:16,489
Mom will stay at home in case she shows up.
I figure we split up and sweep the city.

349
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:18,928
Anya, stay here in case she shows up.

350
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,164
Xander, Giles, take the centre of town.
Willow, Tara, west side.

351
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,528
Spike, you and I'll get the east side.

352
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,808
Just find her. Please.

353
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:43,165
- Betyou can't push me all the way around!
- Oh, yes, I can!

354
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:45,244
No, you can't!

355
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:58,682
There are so many things I remember.

356
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:01,845
Seeing Dawn. Hangin' with her.

357
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:05,721
Listening to Buffy complain about her.
Mostly that last one.

358
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:10,207
- How could all that never really happen?
- It takes some getting used to,

359
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:15,765
the idea of a bright 14-year-old actually
being living energy thousands of years old.

360
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:20,403
I'm guessing some kind
of super-powerful in her rawform.

361
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:23,087
People have killed, died for it,

362
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:25,641
summoned armies to control the Key.

363
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:30,845
You know,
she kinda has a crush on me.

364
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,924
Your point being?

365
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,929
Oh, nothing, no.

366
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:41,770
Just sayin'. Powerful being,
big-energy gal digging the Xan-man.

367
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:45,161
Some guys are just cooler, you know?

368
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,843
Dawn!

369
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,844
- Dawn!
- That should do it.

370
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:57,369
- Shut up.
- She scampered off to get away from you.

371
00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:02,447
She hears you bellowing, she'll pack it in
the opposite direction. Can't say I blame her.

372
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:06,681
You were right.

373
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:09,606
This is my fault. I should've told her.

374
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,041
She probably would've skipped off
anyway, even if she never found out.

375
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:22,843
She's not just a blob of energy.
She's also a 14-year-old hormone bomb.

376
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:27,245
Which one's screwing her up more
right now, spin the bloody wheel.

377
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:33,167
You'll find her, just in the nick of time.
That's whatyou hero types do.

378
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,365
You'll find her.

379
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,409
And then what?

380
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:21,370
It's here. It's here. It's here.

381
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,125
Can't stop.

382
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,647
It's here. It's here.

383
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,166
It's here. It's here.

384
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:30,211
Make it stop. The skin's too tight.

385
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:35,371
Can't hear it. What's the frequency?

386
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,808
Empty. All spilled out.

387
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:41,448
Please.

388
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:44,252
You see me, right?

389
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,765
- Look at me.
- Can't stop!

390
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:52,571
You know what I am, don'tyou?

391
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,211
You all know.

392
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:57,922
- Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't hear it...
- Tell me!

393
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:00,652
- Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't...
- What am I?

394
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,564
The Key.

395
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:07,243
I found it. Thank you.

396
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:10,532
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

397
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:13,889
You know what the Key is?

398
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,683
Where did I come from?
Who made me? What am I?

399
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:20,729
Thank you. Thank you.

400
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:24,567
- Please!
- Destroyer! Cracked earth and bones.

401
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:27,167
The sun bleeding into the sky!

402
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:31,326
The Key is the link. The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

403
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:34,644
Such is the will of God.
Such is the will of God.

404
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:47,001
Two cups of chocolate goodness, courtesy of
whoever I swiped it from out of the cupboard.

405
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:50,324
Couldn't find marshmallows.
I'll try to steal some for next time.

406
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:54,406
- Don't like 'em anyway.
- What? Is that even possible?

407
00:31:54,493 --> 00:32:00,011
Too squishy. When I was five, Buffy
told me they were monkey brains and I...

408
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:04,362
Dawn, was your mom brought back in?
Is that why you're here?

409
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:07,809
No. My mom's just fine.

410
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:13,611
- Is there anybody I can call? Your sister?
- I don't have a sister.

411
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:17,730
You two have a fight?
It's OK, I know howthat goes.

412
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,692
I got a sister, too.
They can be a real pain sometimes, huh?

413
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:25,766
I tell you, there have been a lot
of nights I wish she didn't exist either.

414
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:30,123
It's not Buffy. It's me.

415
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:32,443
I'm the one that doesn't exist.

416
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:37,603
I know it feels that way sometimes,
but when you're older...

417
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,604
No. You don't understand.

418
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:42,491
- It's not real, none of this. They made it.
- Dawn...

419
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:47,806
I'm nothing! I'm just a thing the monks made
so Glory couldn't find me. I'm not real.

420
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,692
- You're the Key?
- How do you know about the Key?

421
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:56,051
Go! Before she finds you. Don't ask me how
she knows, cos she always knows. Just go.

422
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,806
- Calm down.
- You don't understand, you're a kid.

423
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,771
You stay, she'll find you.
She finds you, she'll hurtyou.

424
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:05,482
- What's wrong with you?
- You're what she's been searching for. Run.

425
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,201
You don't know. You...

426
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:11,126
Oh, no. Oh, God, no. She's coming.

427
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:14,364
I can feel it. You've gotta get out. No...

428
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,523
Oh, no, she's here!

429
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,924
She's here!

430
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,093
Hey, don't I know you?

431
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,171
Cotton!

432
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:36,928
Could a fabric be
more annoyingly pedestrian?

433
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,891
Now, this is what I'm talkin' about.

434
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,087
Makes your skin sing.

435
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:46,687
You're... You're Ben.

436
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:49,651
It's an eensy more complicated than that.

437
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,810
Family always is, isn't it?

438
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:57,772
You'd never make it. I'd rip out
your spine before you got half a step.

439
00:33:57,853 --> 00:34:02,290
And those little legs? They wouldn't
be much good without one of those.

440
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:04,844
Would they, Dawnie?

441
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,846
Now, what I'm trying to noodle,

442
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:12,165
is what in the world was the Slayer's
little sis doin' here with Gentle Ben?

443
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:17,409
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

444
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,961
You were talking to him, not me.

445
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,732
Oh, he wasn't being naughty, was he?

446
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:27,205
Excuse me, ma'am.
This area's for hospital personnel.

447
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,052
Rude. I was talking.

448
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:38,409
What do you say
we find a nice place off the beaten

449
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,008
where you and I can have
a long uninterrupted chat?

450
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:47,452
- We looked, but no Dawn.
- What about the carousel?

451
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,763
- Checked there, too.
- Nothing?

452
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,684
Sorry, Buff.

453
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:54,492
Anything could have happened to her.

454
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:57,007
Not just Glory.

455
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:00,413
I better checkthe hospital.

456
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:06,128
OK. Small talk over. I'm in a bit of a crunch,
so let's cut right to the ooey-gooey centre.

457
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:10,126
Your sister, the Slayer, has my Key.
It's mine, I want it.

458
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,243
Do you know where she squirrelled it away?

459
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:17,042
There's ice cream and puppy dogs
in it for you if you start singin'.

460
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:21,206
I'm not sure. What does it look like?

461
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:27,368
Well, the last time I caught a peep...

462
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:32,042
it was a bright green swirly shimmer.

463
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,121
Really brought out the blue in my eyes.

464
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:41,724
But then those monks pulled an abracadabra,
so it could be anything. See my predicament?

465
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:45,370
Maybe.

466
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:48,564
Yes?

467
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:54,125
Well, maybe if you told me more about it...

468
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,892
I'd know if I've seen it.

469
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:06,728
OK.

470
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:11,843
- She wasn't brought in.
- Which is a happy thing, right?

471
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:14,288
- I don't know, I...
- ...in the break room.

472
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:18,048
You guys gotta see him.
His head's almost twisted clean off.

473
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:20,642
Glory.

474
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:23,247
So this Key thing...

475
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,529
it's been around for a long time?

476
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:30,765
Well, not as long as me,
butyeah, just this side of for ever.

477
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,243
- Is it evil?
- Totally.

478
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:42,888
Well, no, not really.
I guess it depends on your point of view.

479
00:36:45,213 --> 00:36:48,523
What's it for? I mean...

480
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:52,049
if it's a key, there's gotta be a lock, right?

481
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:55,205
Yes. We have a winner.

482
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,049
So what does it open?

483
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:06,121
I smell a fox in my hen house.

484
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:11,371
Is that why you were playing with Uncle Ben,
to get a peek at Glory's unmentionables?

485
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,682
No. I...

486
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,966
I kinda wanna hear me talking right now.

487
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:18,248
Me talking.

488
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,642
You know what I'm starting to think?

489
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:25,047
I'm thinking that maybe you...

490
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:30,690
don't have any idea where my Key is.

491
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:35,449
Very irritating, irrational. You know
what I mean, tiny snapdragon? Like...

492
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,206
Like bugs under my skin.

493
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,763
And say... I'm feeling a little...

494
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:45,762
What's wrong with you?

495
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:51,969
Hey, this doesn't have to be
a complete waste of my precious time.

496
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,692
I've been meaning
to send the Slayer a message.

497
00:37:56,013 --> 00:38:00,848
And I could use a little pick-me-up.
Two birds, one stone, and...

498
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,402
boom!

499
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,730
You have yummy dead birds.

500
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,364
Get away from my sister.

501
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,844
- Hey, we were just talking aboutyou!
- Conversation's over, hell bitch.

502
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:29,251
I thoughtyou said this skank was tough.

503
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:43,966
If he wakes up,
tell your boyfriend to watch his mouth.

504
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,123
He is not my boyfriend.

505
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,331
Hey, those are really nice shoes.

506
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,572
Giles, now!

507
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,489
Oh, please. Like that's gonna...

508
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:06,170
Watch the hair.

509
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,687
Time to start the dying.
Start with the whelp.

510
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,252
Dawn!

511
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:16,922
- Buffy!
- Get back!

512
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:19,971
Nice catch. Is that the best
you crap-gnats can muster?

513
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:23,045
Cos I gotta tell you, so not impressed.

514
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,407
Look whatyou did to my dress, you little...

515
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:28,846
Discede!

516
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:32,806
Willow!

517
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:37,050
Dawn.

518
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,444
- What did you do to her?
- Teleportation spell.

519
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:45,366
- Still working out the kinks.
- Where'd you send her?

520
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:47,808
Don't know. That's one of the kinks.

521
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:54,604
Oh, sh...

522
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:01,532
That was an incredibly dangerous
spell for an adept atyour level.

523
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:04,685
Yep. Won't be trying that one again soon.

524
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:08,332
Are you OK? Did she hurtyou?

525
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,969
Why do you care?

526
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:14,045
Because I love you. You're my sister.

527
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,893
No, I'm not.

528
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,929
Yes, you are.

529
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:23,362
Look, it's blood.

530
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:25,444
It's Summers blood.

531
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:33,649
It's just like mine.

532
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:39,246
It doesn't matter where you came from,
or how you got here.

533
00:40:40,093 --> 00:40:42,482
You are my sister.

534
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:47,883
There's no way you could
annoy me so much if you weren't.

535
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:58,363
I was so scared.

536
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:02,084
Me too.

537
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:07,723
Come on.

538
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:12,491
Wait.

539
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:16,043
Ben. He was here.
He was trying to help me. He...

540
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,004
I...

541
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,971
I think he might have left before Glory came.

542
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:27,044
I can't remember.

543
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:31,402
It's OK. Don't worry about it.
Next time we see him, we'll thank him.

544
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:35,605
I have to getyou back home, though.
Mom's freaking out.

545
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,933
Is she mad about the whole fire thing?

546
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:45,643
I think you sorta have a "Get Out of Jail Free"
card on account of big love and trauma.

547
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:47,241
Really?

548
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,211
OK. Good.

549
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:57,932
- You think she'd raise my allowance?
- Don't push it.
