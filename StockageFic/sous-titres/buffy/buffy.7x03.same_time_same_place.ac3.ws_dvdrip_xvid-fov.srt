00:00:01,522 --> 00:00:03,001
<i>Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer":</i>

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,913
- l killed people.
- l've not forgotten.

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,152
When you brought me here,
l thought it was to kill me.

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,961
lnstead, you go all Dumbledore on me.

5
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:13,079
l don't wanna go back home
just so l can screw up again.

6
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,519
- What exactly are you afraid of?
- What if l go all veiny and homicidal again?

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,558
- What if...
- They won't take you back?

8
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:22,634
Did you turn this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,758
You wish it, l dish it.

10
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,878
- lt's what you wanted.
- What happened?

11
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:28,953
Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her.

12
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:30,839
<i>(whispers)</i> Your soul.

13
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:33,480
You got your soul back.

14
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,439
l'll call you when l get there.

15
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:40,232
OK? They said they'd meet us.

16
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,114
Oh, look, they're there.

17
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,274
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

18
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,239
- How are you doing?
- Good.

19
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,200
- And how's it going with you two?
- <i>(both)</i> Hi, Dad.

20
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:55,193
- Go on!
- Hey!

21
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,671
- See what you did?
- Stop acting up!

22
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,601
- You think she'll get the sign?
- Get the sign?

23
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,879
l don't think she's gonna see the sign.
Why is it so pale?

24
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:18,235
l used yellow crayon. lt was a thing
from when l talked to Willow on the bluff.

25
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:23,232
- l hope she gets it.
- Oh, tell us again what you said.

26
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:27,952
Well, l was talking from my heart and l knew
Evil Willow wasn't really ready to...

27
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,761
- You were kidding.
- A little bit.

28
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,993
We've heard the crayon speech.
But it is great, of course.

29
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:38,473
l saved the world with talking from
my mouth. My mouth saved the world!

30
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:41,401
Uh-huh. l'm getting nervous.

31
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,519
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,914
lt's gonna be weird seeing her. What
do you say to someone in this situation?

33
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,754
l'm gonna say "Hi, Willow."

34
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:55,074
Come on. You're saying
it's not gonna be the least bit strange?

35
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,273
We saw her kill someone.
She was about to kill Dawn.

36
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:03,799
Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she
completed that whatever recovery course.

37
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,600
Right.

38
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,398
- Right?
- She kinda didn't finish.

39
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:14,953
She didn't finish?
She didn't finish being not evil?

40
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:20,674
He said it's important that she come back
early, she's doing well and not to worry.

41
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:23,071
- Guys, l just noticed something.
- What?

42
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,152
Everyone's off the plane, so where's Willow?

43
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,959
l'll call you when l get there.

44
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:35,472
OK? They said they'd meet us.

45
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,514
Oh, look, they're there.

46
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,634
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

47
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,599
- How are you doing?
- Good.

48
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,560
- And how's it going with you two?
- <i>(both)</i> Hi, Dad.

49
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,673
- Go on.
- Hey!

50
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,151
- See what you did?
- Stop acting up!

51
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,233
Welcome home, me.

52
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,751
<i>(voice)</i> All alone.

53
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:32,597
Are you frightened to be all alone?

54
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:34,874
Hey, is somebody there?

55
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:39,198
The wind talks when you're alone.

56
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:43,161
<i>- (maniacal laughter)</i>
- You'd better clear out, whoever you are.

57
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,233
<i>- (shrieking)</i>
- Aargh!

58
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:06,553
Buffy?

59
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,473
Hello?

60
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,993
<i>- (gunshot)</i>
<i>- (Willow) Tara?</i>

61
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,233
<i>(door opens)</i>

62
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,157
Dawn? Did l hear the door?

63
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,550
They absolutely
put her on the plane in London.

64
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,236
So, she got off in Chicago
when they stopped?

65
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,359
She could've caught a flight
anywhere from there.

66
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:32,071
Maybe she doubled back.
Got off the plane in London after Giles left.

67
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:37,441
Well, if she's doing that - ducking Giles -
then, she's evil, right?

68
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:41,276
l've avoided Giles tons of times.
Just meant l was lazy, not evil.

69
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:46,632
l hope you're right, because defeating
Lazy Willow - probably less hard.

70
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,438
We should check the messages.
See if she tried to reach us here.

71
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:51,921
Good idea.

72
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,993
<i>- (door shuts)</i>
<i>- (noise)</i>

73
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,313
- What was that?
- Upstairs.

74
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,153
Willow, is that you?

75
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,557
<i>(Buffy)</i> Definitely not up there.

76
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:13,439
She didn't leave a message?

77
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:16,355
l checked with Giles again.
He hasn't heard from her.

78
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,912
- ls he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?
- Oh, with extra wig.

79
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:25,471
He's blaming himself pretty hard.
Like he should've known she wasn't ready.

80
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,837
l kept telling him it wasn't his fault.

81
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,958
Maybe she couldn't face us.

82
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,034
Like she didn't think we were ready
to forgive her. l get that.

83
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:37,157
So Giles is blaming Giles,
and we're blaming us.

84
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:41,080
ls anyone gonna blame Willow?

85
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:43,630
Oh, don't give me shock face.

86
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:47,158
Will anyone around here
ever start asking for help when they need it?

87
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,312
lf Willow flipped out, it's her bad.

88
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:54,601
We can only be here for her so much
if she won't be, you know, here.

89
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:44,917
Hello. l'm calling for Giles. A Mr Giles?

90
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,995
Right. Council meeting all day.

91
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,154
No, no, l know he can't be reached there.

92
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:54,233
Thanks, bye.

93
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,999
Anya!

94
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,879
Anya, don't! Don't run away.

95
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,320
What are you doing here?

96
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:24,474
l thought you were with Giles
studying how to not kill people.

97
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,679
- l just got back.
- As in you're all better or,

98
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,754
just got back to bring about
a fiery apocalypse of death?

99
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:36,919
Neither, but l have been studying.
Working real hard, and l'm gonna be fine.

100
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,152
Oh. Good.

101
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,756
Cos l remember the last time you said that.

102
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:46,074
l've spent a lot of time since then
cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood.

103
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,595
Stuff like that.

104
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:51,515
Yeah, l wanna help any way l can with that.

105
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,877
l feel really responsible.

106
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,841
You feel really responsible?
You are really responsible!

107
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:01,275
l know l hurt you and... and everyone.

108
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,795
l'm sorry.

109
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,355
You should know vengeance demons
don't ruth with the "sorry."

110
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:11,321
We prefer "Oh, God, please stop
hitting me with my own rib bones."

111
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,155
Go on. Say whatever you want.

112
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,234
Rib bones and so forth. l deserve it.

113
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,553
Then you won't mind?

114
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:23,756
- Well, then, that's no fun.
- Sorry.

115
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,714
So, where is everyone these days?

116
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,997
Well, l'm back in my own apartment.

117
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,074
And, of course,
vengeance takes me all over the world.

118
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:53,632
l was in Brazil yesterday.
They love their soccer.

119
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,832
And the others?

120
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,514
Dawn and...

121
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:01,437
Xander? Buffy?

122
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,719
- You haven't seen them?
- Not so much.

123
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:08,074
Huh. l guess they're still mad at you.

124
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:13,036
They've been a little temperamental lately,
just between you and me.

125
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:17,117
- We had this little mix-up a few days ago...
- That sounds great. So...

126
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,193
Where do you think they'd be?

127
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:24,402
At the new high school, probably.
Everyone's all about the high school.

128
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:27,280
Buffy's got some job there
helping junior deviants,

129
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:31,275
Spike's insane in the basement,
Xander's there doing construction...

130
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:33,592
Wait, Spike's what in the whatment?

131
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,912
lnsane. Base.

132
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,993
Xander does construction.

133
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:41,677
He likes to start early,
so he's probably there by now.

134
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,634
Xander?

135
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,753
Xander, are you down there?

136
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,474
No skin.

137
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,159
Tough to look at.

138
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,632
And yet my eyes refuse to look away.
Stupid eyes.

139
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,681
l found it first thing this morning.

140
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:39,675
l gave my crew the day off,
and l called you right away.

141
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:43,994
l gotta get a job where
l don't get called right away for this stuff.

142
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah, l know exactly what you're thinking.
Maybe Willow <i>is</i> back.

143
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,233
<i>(class bell)</i>

144
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:34,957
Out! This is my place.
You need permission to be here.

145
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,317
You need a special slip with a stamp.

146
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:40,041
Spike. My God...

147
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:44,354
You go off, you try to wall up the bad parts,
put your heart back in where it fell out.

148
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:48,720
You call yourself finished, but you're not.
You're worse than ever, you are.

149
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,159
You went away.

150
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:01,352
You've been gone since...

151
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,754
Yeah, l needed to go. But l'm back now.

152
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,159
And l found...

153
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:11,754
- There's a body.
- Tragedy.

154
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,354
ls there blood?

155
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:19,394
Yeah. And l can't find Buffy
or Xander or Dawn and...

156
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,677
there's this thing killing people.

157
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:27,080
The victim was skinned.
What could do that?

158
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:31,034
You did it once. l heard about it.

159
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:35,911
Anything other... other than me?

160
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,234
Look at you...

161
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,873
glowing.

162
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:47,034
What's a word means "glowing"?
Gotta rhyme.

163
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:49,795
- Spike?
- Oh... no!

164
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,756
l should hide. Hide from you.

165
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:55,515
Hide my face. You know what l did.

166
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:58,400
What you did? You didn't do anything.

167
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:00,994
Did you?

168
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,073
Everyone's talking to me.

169
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,601
No one's talking to each other.

170
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,799
Spike, please try to listen to me.

171
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,601
Someone isn't here.

172
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:16,280
Button, button. Who's got the button?

173
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,752
My money's on the witch.

174
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:27,431
We can't use the blueprints
to find our way around down here.

175
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,990
lt's like the walls move or something.

176
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:34,911
<i>- (Spike)</i> Out! This is my place.
- l think l hear him.

177
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:37,391
You need a special slip with a stamp.

178
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:44,272
..and put your heart back in where it fell out.
You call yourself finished, but you're not.

179
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,353
Worse off than ever, you are.

180
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,600
Spike.

181
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,274
Spike!

182
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,595
You went away.

183
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:03,242
- You've been gone since...
- The church.

184
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:07,278
You scared me a little. l didn't...

185
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:11,239
- l didn't know what to think.
- We're here for a reason.

186
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,280
Tragedy.

187
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,392
ls there blood?

188
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,996
He knows. He must have seen the body.

189
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,792
- You did it once. l heard about it.
- Spike, we need to know who did this.

190
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,441
Look at you...

191
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,921
glowing.

192
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:37,792
What's a word means "glowing"?
lt's gotta rhyme.

193
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,281
Spike, please.

194
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,279
l... l should hide. Hide from you.

195
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:48,160
Hide my face. You know what l did.

196
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:52,795
- Boy, he's extra useful today.
- <i>(whispers)</i> This isn't the time.

197
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,350
Everyone's talking to me.

198
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,593
No one's talking to each other.

199
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,277
Might as well go.

200
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,717
Someone isn't here.

201
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,076
Button, button. Who's got the button?

202
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:10,596
My money's on the witch.

203
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:15,153
Red's a bad girl.

204
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,994
He's talking about Willow.

205
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:21,075
And that means something
because he's chock-full-of-sanity.

206
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,994
- Maybe he saw her.
- They think you did it.

207
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,117
The Slayer and her boy.

208
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,670
They think you took the skin.

209
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,400
ls there something here?
Something that killed?

210
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,474
Her boy? l'm her boy?

211
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:42,521
l have to go.

212
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:46,481
There are things here without permission.
l have to check their slips.

213
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,156
Make sure they have authorisation.

214
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:55,961
- l need help.
- l don't have any money.

215
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,033
l don't want money.

216
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:02,957
Come in. Enjoy my personal space.

217
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:08,273
- l found a dead body near the high school.
- Yes, that can happen.

218
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,752
Something horrible killed a boy.
Took his skin right off.

219
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,673
- <i>(both)</i> Was it you?
- <i>(both)</i> No!

220
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,753
With the skin thing, they're definitely
gonna think it was you. Buffy is, anyway.

221
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:21,993
Yeah. Maybe she already does,
l don't know. l just...

222
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:27,390
l have to find whatever did this.
l just... l need to do something right.

223
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:31,634
Oh, and so they'll think it wasn't you, right?
That has to be part of it.

224
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:35,761
Maybe you're thinking you kill this thing,
they don't have to know about it.

225
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,152
- Won't suspect you, even for a minute.
- No, l don't...

226
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:43,360
- When did you get all insightful?
- l'm surprisingly sensitive.

227
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,114
So, will you help me?

228
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:49,517
ls it difficult or time-consuming?

229
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:58,838
- This isn't gonna get all sexy, is it?
- l'd be shocked.

230
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:02,119
- OK, do you have your powder?
- Oh, l ate that.

231
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,560
l have it.

232
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:09,952
OK, we scatter it over the map, and where
there's a demon, a little light appears.

233
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,998
Oh, pretty!

234
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,277
- Will it hurt the carpet?
- No.

235
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,038
OK, scatter.

236
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,636
<i>(both)</i> Oh!

237
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,277
Hey, look! That's me.

238
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,078
Hello!

239
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:36,277
- What's that huge clump?
- lt's the high school.

240
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:40,833
- lt's all Hellmouthy underneath.
- Things have been stirring there lately.

241
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:46,161
- ls it getting brighter?
- Smoke!

242
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,477
Uh! OK.

243
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:56,360
Remember our talk about the carpet?

244
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,599
Hey, this could be it.

245
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:01,640
lt's strong, it's near the body...

246
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,599
and it's all by itself.

247
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:09,600
Hiding in the woods or maybe a cave.
There are a couple good caves around there.

248
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,435
l don't know. Sounds pretty thin to me.

249
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,832
Well, if you teleport over there
real quick like a bunn...

250
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:20,837
- Real quick and see if l'm right.
- No, sorry. You damaged my carpet.

251
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:24,798
Anya, you're a vengeance demon.
Just teleport.

252
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:30,474
Well, as it turns out,
teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege.

253
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:34,760
l withdrew a vengeance spell last week,
and this is my punishment.

254
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:39,913
l can only teleport for official business.
l have to file a flight plan and everything.

255
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,872
Oh. l'm sorry. That must be hard.

256
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,398
Yeah, it bites a pretty big one.

257
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:49,637
And the vengeance itself, it's...

258
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,800
lt's not as fulfilling as l remember.

259
00:21:54,362 --> 00:22:00,437
Really? Cos l got the impression
that you enjoyed, you know, inflicting.

260
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:04,401
Well, causing pain
sounds really cool, l know, but...

261
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,791
it turns out it's really upsetting.

262
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,760
Didn't use to be, but now it is.

263
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,757
ls it like you're scared
of losing that feeling again?

264
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,754
And then having it be OK to hurt people?

265
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:23,518
And then you're not in charge of the power
any more because it's in charge of you?

266
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,834
Wow, that was...

267
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:30,153
really over-dramatically stated,
but, yeah, that's it.

268
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:32,961
l get it. Believe me.

269
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:35,992
l'm sorry, Willow.

270
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:40,678
- l wish it were better for you.
- You too.

271
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,561
lt did get a little sexy, didn't it?

272
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:49,160
- l have to find this monster.
- Willow?

273
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,517
lsn't there another spell?

274
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:56,720
You're trying to find Buffy and Xander.
Couldn't we use a spell to do that?

275
00:22:56,802 --> 00:23:01,432
l did. l tried, and something went kaflooey,
and it didn't work.

276
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:04,320
- What did it say?
- lt said they don't exist.

277
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,753
OK, l looked up demons
that skin their victims

278
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,800
and demons that flay their victims
cos, same thing.

279
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:18,352
There's a ton of prospects.
Anything else gone?

280
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:24,881
- Eyeballs, toenails or viscera? That's guts.
- She knows about viscera. Makes you proud.

281
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,674
- Just skin.
- OK, l'll work on that.

282
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,834
- What's up?
- l need to do something.

283
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:43,835
- l just... l have this feeling in my gut...
- ln your viscera.

284
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,517
..that we know exactly who did this.
And this work that we're doing

285
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,435
is just a way to convince ourselves
that Willow's OK.

286
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,831
Guys! l got a good one.

287
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:59,360
A demon called "Gnarl." He's a parasite
with these nasty long fingernails.

288
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:02,718
He secretes something through them
which paralyses his victims.

289
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:07,273
He then cuts strips of their skin
while they're still alive. lt takes hours.

290
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,717
We didn't find any strips of skin.

291
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:12,077
Which, by the way, gghh!

292
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,153
You wouldn't. He eats them.

293
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:17,473
That's why he's a parasite.
lt's like his natural food.

294
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:21,157
Dawn, you're new at this,
and l get why you're proud,

295
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:26,077
but l'm not exactly sure why this demon
is any more likely than any of the others.

296
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:28,153
You never said pool of blood.

297
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:31,598
- There was no pool, just splatters.
- Then this is your guy.

298
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:34,958
He laps up the blood.
You could say it's, like, his natural beverage.

299
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:39,957
- You're terrifying.
- Now if we just knew how to find this thing.

300
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:43,432
- We can ask questions at Willy's Place.
- Or, we could be smart.

301
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,598
- Sorry, Xander.
- What?

302
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:51,150
Whoever did this had to get blood on them,
which means they left a trail.

303
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,200
- Minute traces of blood.
- And we have a way to track it.

304
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:55,920
We have a...

305
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:58,391
Oh. l get it.

306
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,273
What? How?

307
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:03,681
What's goin' on?

308
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,153
William's a good boy.
Carries her water, carries her sin.

309
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:10,791
Supposed to get easier.
Supposed to help to help, but it doesn't.

310
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,474
Still so heavy.

311
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:16,833
We should've put a leash on him.

312
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:19,436
Yes, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire.

313
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:22,514
- You really think it's gonna work?
- lt's pretty easy.

314
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:27,676
Spike follows the exciting smell of blood,
and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike.

315
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,992
lt's smell-ementary.

316
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:32,755
Also, l'm sure there's tons of stuff like this.

317
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:37,597
Procedures we can use that don't involve
magic spells. Just good, solid detective work.

318
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:41,914
And we can develop a database of tooth
impressions and demon-skin samples

319
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:46,359
- and l could wear high heels more often.
- That was so close to being empowered.

320
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,512
Everybody loves a slender ankle.

321
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,836
That's it. End of the line. Everyone off.

322
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:54,755
Keep your ticket, you'll need that.

323
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:57,800
- There's a rock cliff.
- Give him a break, Buffy.

324
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,794
Maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.

325
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,797
There's a cave in it. Look.

326
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:08,481
l'm insane. What's his excuse?

327
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:41,030
<i>(scampering)</i>

328
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:44,233
<i>(Gnarl)</i> All alone.

329
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,713
Dark and dank.

330
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:57,270
- l was hoping it'd be dark and dank.
- Shh!

331
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:59,193
<i>- (scampering)</i>
- Do you hear that?

332
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,273
- No, l don't.

But now l do.

334
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:07,879
- Something's moving in here.
- Guess we're in the right place.

335
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:12,076
<i>(Gnarl)</i> Look at the shorn lamb.

336
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,234
See how it trembles.

337
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:17,916
ls it the cold wind?

338
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:25,035
Or is it that the flock is nowhere to be seen?

339
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:30,720
Poor little lamb all alone.

340
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,913
- You guys hear that, right?
- Yep.

341
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,640
lt's echoing. lt sounds close,
but l don't think...

342
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,713
<i>- (shrieking)</i>
- Dawn!

343
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:44,156
- Are you OK?
- l guess so.

344
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:47,352
- Poison paralyses.
- Dawn.

345
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:52,358
OK, we need to get her out of here.
We'll deal with him later. Seal him in.

346
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:57,315
<i>- (rocks being moved)</i>
- What's going on? Who's there?

347
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:00,914
No! Stop!

348
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:04,671
<i>(maniacal laughter)</i>

349
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:10,751
<i>(maniacal laughter continues)</i>

350
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,552
No way out now. No way out.

351
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:24,357
Protect me, Goddess.
ln thy name, l supplicate myself.

352
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:29,357
Take the powers from my enemy,
and lay him lower than the lowest field.

353
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:33,071
Gnarl loves spells.

354
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:35,278
He keeps them as pets.

355
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,956
They love him.

356
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,920
And they leave him alone.

357
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:45,678
You may be immune to magic,
but l've got more than that.

358
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:50,153
- You wanna fight?
- Your friends left you here.

359
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,996
<i>#</i> No one comes to save you

360
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:58,234
They wanted me to have you.

361
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:06,597
The computer. That thing Dawn was reading
might have an antidote for the paralysis.

362
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,479
- <i>(muffled)</i> Buffy?
- What?

363
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:11,030
- l'm really sorry.
- Oh, it's OK.

364
00:29:11,122 --> 00:29:15,877
- lt had paralysing fingernails.
- Just like you said, so good on you.

365
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:23,437
Did they leave you as a gifty for me?
Are you a tasty little gifty?

366
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:27,435
- Stop it.
- Or did they just throw you away?

367
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:31,754
Were they here? Were my friends
really here? l heard something.

<i>(shrieking)</i>

369
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:42,074
They were here. Here they were.
And there they went.

l love a gifty.

373
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,630
Can't wait to unwrap it.

Oh!

375
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:17,760
- OK, watch the head.
- l've got ya.

376
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:20,231
- Watch my head.
- Sofa.

377
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,720
- Face up! Face up!
- She's right. Face up is better.

378
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:31,155
l'm gonna check the computer.
Find that page. See if there's an antidote.

379
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,961
lt'll be all right. We'll get you fixed up.

380
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,398
- You'll be doing limbo in no time.
- Yeah, as a pole.

381
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,475
- No, not as a pole. l promise.
- Oh! Got it.

382
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,601
lt says the paralysis is permanent.

383
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:49,757
<i>- (Dawn squeaks)</i>
- No. Oh, wait. My bad.

384
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,800
"Permanent until the creature dies." Sorry.

385
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:55,954
<i>- (Dawn mumbles)</i>
- l guess we have to go back.

386
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:59,352
We can't leave her here. What if she vomits?

387
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,797
- l won't vomit.
- Do you think she'll vomit?

388
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,478
- Stop talking about vomit.
- l'll call Anya. She can watch her.

389
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:08,281
Right, she'll love
being called for vomit watch.

390
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:11,434
<i>(muffled)</i> Stop talking about vomit!

391
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:15,232
Gnarl makes a pretty picture.

392
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,874
lt's easy when you know how.

393
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:24,560
lt's easy when everyone helps.

394
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,793
They helped me.

395
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:35,550
Too bad there's no one to help you.

396
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:59,436
<i>- (Anya)</i> l bet she's dying.
- She's not dying. She's just paralysed.

397
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,275
- Paralysed how?
- Paralysed how?

398
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:05,957
- ln the not moving way.
- Well, there's lots of different ways.

399
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,839
Did you try this?

400
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,796
- Hey!
- Hey!

401
00:32:10,882 --> 00:32:14,477
- Oh! You're poseable.
- She's poseable?

402
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,197
lt's a common variety. Watch this.

403
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:25,793
Huh! Neat as you please.

404
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:28,521
- Hardly a need to undo her.
<i>- (worried noise)</i>

405
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:31,241
- Mm. Where'd you get the nuts?
- Brazil.

406
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:35,234
No need to thank me, by the way,
for sitting with her.

407
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:39,474
l'm feeling very benevolent today.
Helping Willow. Helping you.

408
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:42,554
Might even call it even
for that worm thing last week.

409
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:46,396
Yeah, l don't think we could call...
Wait, you saw Willow?

410
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:50,521
She's looking for you, by the way.
Decided you might be out in some cave.

411
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,593
- Sounded pretty tenuous.
- Cave?

412
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:56,595
Anya, listen. This is really important.
Did Willow go to that cave?

413
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:59,150
Last time l saw her,
that's where she was headed.

414
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,996
- Shall l make her salute? That'd be cute.
- She could be there right now.

415
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,961
- Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.
- lt's not "the Gnarl", just "Gnarl".

416
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:12,755
lt'd be tragic if you were being silly with your
paralysed sister while Willow was dying.

417
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:18,073
- Anya, you know about this creature?
- Uh-huh. Sure.

418
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,278
You're coming with us.

419
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:22,881

- Cos we haven't <i>seen</i> her.

435
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:47,077
l think whatever's causing this invisible thing
is separate from the skin-eating monster.

Behind you!

437
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,037

That's all l had left in me anyway.

Wow. That's magic, right?

478
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:34,833
When most people meditate,
they don't get extra skin, right?

479

We're on the second floor.

You know, Giles says
everything's part of the earth.

- True.

- No. Please stay.

Dawn's working on what caused
the no-see-ums, but so far...

492
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,677
l did it.

- You did a spell?
- l didn't mean to. l...

494
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:33,077
l just remember thinking
l wasn't ready to see you guys yet.

495
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:36,996
l was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.

496
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,636
So you made it happen just by thinking it?

497
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:46,561
Guess l have a ways to go
before l master my powers, huh?

498
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,679
lt's OK. As long as you're all right.

499
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:56,838
lt's nice to be forgiven.
Too bad l need so much of it.

500
00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:01,593
l have a confession to make.

501
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:08,075
l thought it might be you. With the flaying.

502
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:10,118
l know.

503
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:15,040
l wanna be the kind of person
that wouldn't think that.

504
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,113
Xander never thought it.

505
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:20,990
He did a little. Heck, l did a little.

506
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:24,995
Xander has the luxury of not saying it,
but you're the Slayer.

507
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:28,836
You have to say stuff like that. lt's OK.

508
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:34,474
lt's OK too, if you still don't think
l can recover from this magic stuff,

509
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:39,158
because honestly,
l'm not that sure about it either.

510
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:50,999
l thought you were too tired.

511
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:54,630
lt hurts too much not to try.

512
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,241
l'm sorry.

513
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:02,598
ltjust takes so much strength.
l don't have that much.

514
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,798
l got so much strength, l'm givin' it away.

515
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:12,200
Are you sure?

516
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,239
Will it help?

517
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,360
Much.

518
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:20,354
Good.
