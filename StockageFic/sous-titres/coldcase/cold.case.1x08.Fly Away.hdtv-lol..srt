May 21, 2001

4
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,763
You're gonna sleep 
with mama tonight, okay?

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,593
Mama?

6
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:37,552
Uh-huh?

7
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,085
It's dark.

8
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:40,097
Shh.

9
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,999
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:43,661
Know why?

11
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,171
'Cause Mama says so?

12
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,798
Yeah, 'cause mama says so.

13
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,137
Mama?

14
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,609
Uh-huh?

15
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,682
He's not coming back, right?

16
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:55,331
No, he's not.

17
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:56,454
Now go to sleep.

18
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:57,281
Mama?

19
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,560
What, Toya?

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,059
You don't gotta cry no more.

21
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,946
Kid dies on impact.

22
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,004
Mother survives only to 
lapse into a coma

23
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:22,351
a few hours after the attack.

24
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,769
Going on two years.

25
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,786
Two years in a coma?

26
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,906
Just saw your boy Kite 
at the courthouse.

27
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,303
ADA Kite?

28
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,186
Mm-hmm.

29
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,163
That was Billy Markins' job, right?

30
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:36,396
Yeah, 33 years on, 
then hummer comes in.

31
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,029
Never got the doer.

32
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,641
Dead kid and her mom
thrown out a window.

33
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:41,865
How old's the job?

34
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:43,580
2001?

35
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,630
He asked about you.

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,856
Kite.

37
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:48,891
Yo, pass the ketchup?

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,945
Remember that picture Markins
had on his wall?

39
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:55,401
Yeah. Mom and a kid making a snowman.

40
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:56,881
That's the job?

41
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,364
Yeah.

42
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,852
Only case he left open when he retired.

43
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:03,448
What? So the assigned worked it good,
but got nada for his efforts?

44
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:05,655
His only witness was in a coma.

45
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,207
Mm.

46
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:11,479
What did he ask? Kite.

47
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:13,037
Where you were.

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,517
You getting a social life 
going or something.

49
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,130
No way.

50
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:20,397
Good.

51
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:22,109
This Miles case has new direction.

52
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:22,812
Yeah?

53
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,117
Why're we interested now?

54
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,996
Because the mom just woke up.

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,692
How long has she been awake?

56
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:32,843
18 hours.

57
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:33,679
She talking?

58
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:36,292
She has lucid but minimal 
verbal function.

59
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,601
She hasn't spoken of the incident

60
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,000
with her daughter yet.

61
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,106
Some people here to 
see you, Miss Miles.

62
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,581
Hi, Rosie.

63
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,290
I'm Detective Rush.

64
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,355
Detective Valens.

65
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,499
How you doing?

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,419
Rosie, we're here to talk 
to you about what happened.

67
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,768
To you and Toya.

68
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,394
Your little girl?

69
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,035
Toya...

70
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,271
Toya?

71
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,286
Is that what you're saying?

72
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:09,738
Butterflies.

73
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:14,541
Toya and... and butterflies...

74
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,363
They hurt...

75
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,156
They hurt... they hurt, Mama.

76
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,239
Bruises on her...

77
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,303
Toya had butterfly wings and bruises?

78
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,845
On her arms.

79
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:28,170
And... he bruised her up.

80
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,406
Who did?

81
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,338
The man.

82
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,780
What man, Rosie?

83
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,737
The one in...

84
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,192
one in the bedroom.

85
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,952
He would put bruises on her...

86
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,743
when she wouldn't smile at him.

87
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:44,623
Did you know him before that night?

88
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,042
What night?

89
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,048
The night Toya...

90
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:51,891
The night of the accident, Rosie.

91
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,744
What accident?

92
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,206
Doesn't she know?

93
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,825
I... I'm not sure.

94
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:01,808
Know what?

95
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,712
What am I supposed to know?

96
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,392
Cold Case 1x08
Fly Away

00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,075
So, bruises and butterflies?

106
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,052
That's all Rosie remembers right now.

107
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,758
Long-term memory's intact,

108
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,379
but whatever went on that night...

109
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,156
Gone.

110
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:48,645
She didn't even know Toya was dead.

111
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:49,297
Gone forever?

112
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,130
Yeah. If she gets it back, 
it'll come piecemeal.

113
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,942
Doctor says this type of 
amnesia's emotional,

114
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,965
not physical, so she should remember...

115
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,512
The question is : Does she want to?

116
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,552
Yeah.

117
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,208
Rosie said the man in the bedroom

118
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,246
bruised up Toya when 
she wouldn't smile.

119
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:06,680
Implying they knew him.

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,645
Yeah, but the assigned

121
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,386
thought the doer was a stranger.

122
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,184
You trade thoughts with Markins yet?

123
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:15,203
Caught up with him between 
tee times in Myrtle Beach.

124
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,155
His theory was burglary gone bad.

125
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:20,075
The doer's on crack, 
PCP breaks into the apartment,

126
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,565
not expecting Rosie to wake up.

127
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,066
She does, he panics, 
and kills them both.

128
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,694
911 call came in at 11: 16 p.m.,

129
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,631
few minutes after Rosie 
and Toya hit the ground.

130
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,610
Voice was a black 
male, never I.D.'d.

131
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,730
Plus Rosie's landlady

132
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,040
reported a black male 
running from the scene.

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,303
Black man hauling ass

134
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:39,634
through lily-white Port Richmond?

135
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:42,076
Stands out like Vera in a bikini.

136
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,562
Well, theory's decent.

137
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:47,453
Forced entry, struggle 
in the bedroom, missing VCR.

138
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:48,535
I don't know

139
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,846
what the butterflies mean.

140
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:54,838
And I don't see any bruises on Toya.

141
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,776
Find the man in the bedroom,

142
00:06:57,776 --> 00:07:00,496
I bet you'll get some answers.

143
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:05,175
Case number 3579.

144
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,211
I was Rosie Miles' 
court ordered supervisor

145
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,529
for, uh... for ten months.

146
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,330
Court ordered, Mr. Freely?

147
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,383
Yeah, Rosie got a DUI three years ago.

148
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,474
Judge didn't take the kid away,

149
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,731
but he assigned me 
to be her caseworker.

150
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,439
Rosie have a drinking problem?

151
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,092
Pregnant at 17, dad's MIA 
before her baby's born.

152
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,866
She realizes all she's got 
to look forward to in life

153
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,324
is Pampers and stretch marks,

154
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,255
she finds God at the
bottom of a forty.

155
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,801
She ever hit Toya?

156
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,313
No.

157
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:39,182
Ever notice any bruises?

158
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,210
Never. No, the court would have 
taken her away if she did.

159
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,971
That's what I was there for.

160
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:46,858
You were at Rosie's apartment 
the day of the murder, right?

161
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:49,392
Yeah, we call them 
unannounced home visits.

162
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:52,534
Rosie's snoring, TV's blasting,

163
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,446
kid's eating Ho Hos 
for breakfast, the usual.

164
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:55,393
But you said in your report

165
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,387
that everything was satisfactory.

166
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,885
According to department 
guidelines, it was.

167
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,275
Did she have a boyfriend 
might've hurt Toya?

168
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,658
I don't think Rosie 
liked men all that much.

169
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:06,479
Is that a fact?

170
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,807
I don't mean gay, just, uh...

171
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,318
Most of these girls...

172
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:15,913
will give it up for a 
Big Mac and supersize fries.

173
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,050
But Rosie...

174
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,688
it was like she just 
shut that door forever.

175
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:25,602
Toya loved to draw.

176
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,797
I never had the heart 
to throw them away.

177
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,341
You saw Toya and her mother 
the day of the murder.

178
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:33,538
At a school play?

179
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,859
Yes. We do that play every year

180
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:38,703
"The Flight of the 
Monarch Butterflies."

181
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,666
The play was about butterflies?

182
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,455
It was. Yes.

183
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,650
Can you tell us what 
you remember from that day?

184
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:49,474
Toya remembered all her lines.

185
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:51,488
She was the only one.

186
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:55,610
# Little monarch butterfly #

187
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,942
# Spread your wings and flutter high #

188
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:04,393
# Touch the sun and kiss the sky #

189
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:09,113
# Fly away, my butterfly #

190
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:13,646
# Little monarch butterfly #

191
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:18,896
# Spread your wings and flutter high #

192
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,765
Why was Rosie crying?

193
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
I don't know.

194
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,902
Did you ever see any marks 
on Toya's arms, Mrs. Jablonski?

195
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:34,823
Bruises?

196
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,181
Signs of abuse?

197
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:39,328
No. We're trained to 
look for those things.

198
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:39,779
That's not something

199
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,583
you forget, Detective.

200
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,317
Two years is a long time to remember.

201
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,594
Toya always came to school with a lunch.

202
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:48,772
Clean clothes.

203
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,427
She was a happy child.

204
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:51,846
Loved.

205
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:52,805
That's not something

206
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,958
you forget either... 
not around here.

207
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,088
So this is the bedroom

208
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,522
where the murder took place?

209
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:02,987
Yup. No renter since Rosie.

210
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,943
Except my brother.

211
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,380
Comes from Poland, stays here.

212
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,276
God. Shut up, damn dogs. Be quiet!

213
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,946
Hate those dogs.

214
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,816
That wasn't in the crime scene photos.

215
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,712
Maybe a cable line.

216
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:19,994
Too big.

217
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,345
And too high up.

218
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:26,546
What happened to the bookshelf 
that was against this wall, Tammy?

219
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,864
Oh. My place.

220
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:29,582
Oh, yeah?

221
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:30,322
Yeah.

222
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:33,152
I keep it for Rosie. So what?

223
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,252
Ever see any bruises on Toya?

224
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,605
Bruises? No, no, no.

225
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,152
Rosie never touch that girl.

226
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:42,627
Never. Never. Uh-uh.

227
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,020
Maybe one of her boyfriends did.

228
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,092
Says here you saw someone

229
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,564
running from the building that night.

230
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,610
Yeah. Black.

231
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,236
He run and run and run.

232
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,157
Maybe he was her boyfriend.

233
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:56,856
Right. When pigs fly.

234
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,393
Rosie got a problem with black man?

235
00:10:58,393 --> 00:10:59,852
No, I got a problem.

236
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,438
My building, my rules.

237
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay?

238
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,514
Men at Rosie's that night? Yes.

239
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:09,017
Black in my building? No.

240
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,866
Men at Rosie's? What night?

241
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,366
The night Toya falls.

242
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,441
I hear men voices.

243
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,377
The night she died?

244
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:20,131
Yeah. In and out, climb up, 
down the stairs.

245
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,342
You didn't mention that two years ago.

246
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:24,818
I see black run.

247
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,992
I told about black.

248
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:27,831
Black did it.

249
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,834
You see men come up in 
this place a lot, Tammy?

250
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,014
No.

251
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:36,049
But one bedroom apartment... come on.

252
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:38,607
Toya sleeps on the couch, I think.

253
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,017
Wait. Rosie made her kid

254
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:41,890
sleep in the living room?

255
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:47,324
So Rosie keep the bedroom 
for herself for reason, no?

256
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,294
But I don't make judgement.

257
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,456
Like you are.

258
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,615
Like now.

259
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:01,308
We got a uniform 
posted at the hospital?

260
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,249
Yeah. No visitors for Rosie yet.

261
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:04,179
No family?

262
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,594
Mm-mm. Parents are dead.

263
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,082
This job ain't coming in, boss.

264
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:10,511
We got nothing.

265
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,024
We got a witness.

266
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,679
Whose hard drive's been erased.

267
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,895
"Bruises and butterflies",

268
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:16,784
that's her big contribution.

269
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:18,489
It's more than Markins had.

270
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,115
How do we know we can trust it?

271
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,757
The bruises didn't pan out.

272
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,294
Well, the butterflies meant something.

273
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:25,041
Keep looking at the bruises.

274
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,370
CSU figured out the hole in the wall.

275
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:29,389
Rosie's living room.

276
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,333
The missing VCR went on top of the TV.

277
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:34,709
Okay, living room again.

278
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:37,859
Missing VCR cables must 
have run through this hole

279
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,612
leaving these tiny black streaks.

280
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:43,930
CSU says it's the same rubber 
used in VCR cables.

281
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,477
So the cable from the VCR

282
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,483
in the living room connected to what?

283
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:48,589
Something in the bedroom.

284
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,679
I don't see anything 
it could have been connected to.

285
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,046
Maybe because it was hidden.

286
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:55,492
What do you connect 
a VCR to if not a TV?

287
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,217
A video camera.

288
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,061
Why did Rosie have a video 
camera in her bedroom?

289
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,787
Was she making porn?

290
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,453
Blackmailing someone?

291
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,864
Doer's married, having a fling.

292
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:10,360
Rosie threatens to tell the wife.

293
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,743
Except Rosie's bank account 
totaled a whopping

294
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:16,326
$121.15... that spell 
extortion to you?

295
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:17,405
On public assistence,

296
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,722
you can't have more than 
a few hundred bucks in the bank.

297
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,012
That makes saving easy.

298
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,649
Welcome to welfare.

299
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,439
If Rosie was squirreling away a stash,

300
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,492
she'd have to hide it real good.

301
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,679
Or lose the food stamps.

302
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,877
Check her belongings for video tapes.

303
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,069
You and Vera try pawnshops 
in Port Richmond

304
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,985
for the camera and VCR.

305
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:36,257
If we find the tape,
maybe we find the doer.

306
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,150
Real nice of Tammy to let us in.

307
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,110
Hmm.

308
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,681
Real nice of her to keep 
Rosie's furniture.

309
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:56,122
How come you don't like Rosie?

310
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,744
I like her fine.

311
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:00,962
'Cause she got a DUI?

312
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,500
With Toya in the car.

313
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,535
Well, she shaped up after that.

314
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,104
Paid the price.

315
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:08,680
Only one that paid was her kid, Scotty.

316
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,256
Yeah, well...

317
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:14,198
I think Rosie paid, too.

318
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,753
Look what I found.

319
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:27,709
Blank pages, all of them.

320
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,600
So?

321
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:33,413
Wonder why this page is missing?

322
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,804
As luck would have it,

323
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:38,937
we purchased this 
model six months ago.

324
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:40,194
What's it do?

325
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,745
Clarifies residuum

326
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:45,065
otherwise imperceptible 
to the naked eye.

327
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,205
Talk down to me.

328
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:51,750
It sees the imprint 
from your missing page.

329
00:14:58,643 --> 00:14:59,714
It's the high-tech version

330
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,820
of rubbing a pencil against a pad.

331
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,345
Like that, yeah.

332
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,474
Hope you got gloves. 
It's freezing out there.

333
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:07,310
Hmm.

334
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,814
Any luck in the pawn shops?

335
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,418
Yeah, we tracked a VCR and camera,

336
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:12,055
same make and model as Rosie's.

337
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:14,542
Pete's pawnshop in Port Richmond.

338
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:15,373
Rosie's hood.

339
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,234
Guy dumped it almost a year 
after the murder.

340
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,637
Heat was off by then.

341
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,176
Petey's got a slip for 
a guy named Angel.

342
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,480
No last name.

343
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,724
Angel?

344
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,164
Eh, could be a dead end.

345
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,439
Or not.

346
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,217
Traced a missing page 
from Rosie's address book.

347
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,518
Disconnected page number 
for an Angel Rivera.

348
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:33,498
Janitor at Toya's school.

349
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,664
Angel Rivera?

350
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,554
Detectives Rush, Valens.

351
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,773
Homicide.

352
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,218
You know a Rosie Miles, Angel?

353
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,115
A who?

354
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,181
Wonder why she'd have 
his pager number?

355
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:52,456
He not knowing her and all.

356
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,234
Maybe 'cause he's lying?

357
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,051
Yeah. Whatever.

358
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:58,106
So, who's Jasmine Cordoba?

359
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:00,603
What's she got to do with it?

360
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:01,798
That your girlfriend, Angel?

361
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:04,113
Hear she pays your rent, 
utilities, your car.

362
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:04,775
You make your woman

363
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:05,994
pay the bills?

364
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:07,434
Must be packing some kind of punch

365
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,559
in those baggies, huh, Angel?

366
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,939
You wanna find out?

367
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,165
Make a move.

368
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,787
'Cept Jasmine ain't his girlfriend.

369
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:16,474
No?

370
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,699
Nah.

371
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,488
She's his mama.

372
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:20,320
Ooh...

373
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,397
She do your laundry, too?

374
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,698
Wash your diapers, papi?

375
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,101
Help you make number two on the potty?

376
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,573
I live with my ma; so what?

377
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,174
Your mother's here illegally.

378
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:30,562
We ain't gonna let Immigration know.

379
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,081
You help us out.

380
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,166
Me and Rosie, a few times.

381
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,596
It wasn't nothing.

382
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:40,950
She feel the same way?

383
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,881
She wanted this, wanted that.

384
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,245
"Keep an eye on my kid, Angel.

385
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,054
Make sure she don't fall off 
the Jungle gym, Angel."

386
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:47,691
I was in it for the sumpin' sumpin',

387
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,237
not to be playin' papi.

388
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:49,820
You seeing Rosie

389
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,218
when her kid got killed?

390
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,262
Nah. Kicked her to the curb

391
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,584
way back when.

392
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,069
Hooked up with Gina.

393
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,223
Gave old white girl the boot.

394
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:57,912
Then what were you doing

395
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,534
in white girl's apartment that night?

396
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:00,075
We got your prints

397
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,484
on her video camera, Angel.

398
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:03,730
You know,

399
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,222
the one you pawned?

400
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,271
That day her kid was... whatever,

401
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,342
I see Rosie in the school.

402
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,669
At Toya's butterfly play?

403
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:15,617
Yeah.

404
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,593
Crying and acting stupid.

405
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,279
Rosie was making a phone call?

406
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,628
Yeah. Then she sees me, hangs up,

407
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,040
starts blubbering in my face 
about butterflies

408
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,497
and some guy's gonna hurt her,

409
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:49,647
blase blah.

410
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:50,868
What guy?

411
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:52,397
I don't know; I told her to step off.

412
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:53,875
You know mean, not my problem.

413
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,176
Rosie freaks.

414
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,078
She starts shouting, screaming

415
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,829
how she's got some tape... us in bed.

416
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,766
If I don't help her, she's gonna

417
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,851
tell Gina, blase blah.

418
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:04,774
Pissed you off, huh?

419
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,767
Hell, ye.

420
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:06,928
So, you went over there that night

421
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:08,783
and taught her a lesson, right?

422
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:10,671
Hell, yeah.

423
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,451
Mommy!

424
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,027
Angel. Jesus.

425
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,990
Get out of here!

426
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,633
What are you doing?

427
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:26,618
Mommy.

428
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:28,187
You're scaring Toya.

429
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,423
Angel, got out of here!

430
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:32,635
Mommy!

431
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:35,111
Are you gonna tape me, bitch.

432
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,934
Don't you hurt my mama!

433
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,603
I'm gonna call the cops, Angel.

434
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,855
No, no, not that tape.

435
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,006
Not that.

436
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:44,897
Don't do that.

437
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,322
Mommy.

438
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,220
Not that.

439
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,458
And then I left.

440
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,791
Truth is, I didn't care 
enough to kill them.

441
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,932
Cared enough to hit her.

442
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,488
I didn't hit her; I pushed her.

443
00:18:58,488 --> 00:18:59,680
Out the window?

444
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,651
I didn't do nothing!

445
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,572
I got the tape to prove it.

446
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:03,778
What tape?

447
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,354
Tape from that night

448
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,776
I ain't on it.

449
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,312
So, that's proof I ain't do nothing.

450
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:12,497
Nothing but pawn

451
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,138
her VCR and camera a year later.

452
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:17,209
Where's this tape you got, Angel?

453
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:20,407
This was recorded in 
your apartment, Rosie.

454
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,041
It's a security camera.

455
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,614
Who's that man?

456
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,854
That's what we were 
hoping you'd tell us.

457
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:34,838
I don't know.

458
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,680
You remember this camera, Rosie?

459
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:39,307
You had it in your bedroom.

460
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:39,927
I did?

461
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:44,988
You remember someone named Angel?

462
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:49,894
You told him someone 
was out to hurt you.

463
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,366
You asked Angel for help that day.

464
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:55,231
If I don't remember who he is,

465
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,312
how am I gonna remember 
what I said to him?

466
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,146
We're trying to help, Rosie.

467
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:00,378
What for?

468
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,577
So you can get your memory back.

469
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:08,667
Like I said... what for?

470
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,119
Let's go.

471
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,480
It's not mine.

472
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,587
It's hers.

473
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,147
It's Toya's.

474
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,765
What's Toya's?

475
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:29,343
The bedroom.

476
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,418
It's Toya's bedroom.

477
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,082
I remember that now.

478
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:38,211
Why does Rosie put

479
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,896
a security camera in 
her daughter's bedroom?

480
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,223
Worried something's 
happening to Toya there.

481
00:20:43,223 --> 00:20:44,719
Nothing the autopsy report

482
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:46,225
says any about sexual abuse.

483
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,479
Well, maybe it was just starting.

484
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,724
And that's why the camera.

485
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:49,934
Rosie knew what he was doing.

486
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:51,071
She was trying to stop him.

487
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,142
And maybe he's trying to stop her

488
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,435
from ratting him out.

489
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:57,266
Ten G's buys a lot of 
"don't ask, don't tell."

490
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,891
I found the bank account

491
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,656
under Rosie's social security number

492
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:01,435
and her name.

493
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:02,921
The assigned missed that?

494
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:05,145
Didn't exist till three days ago.

495
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,989
When Rosie woke up.

496
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,258
Who set up the account?

497
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,161
McLean Wykowski.

498
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,517
Foreman, Mills Lightman Construction.

499
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,432
No record.

500
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,233
What's his connection to Rosie?

501
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,119
Wife's maiden name... Miles.

502
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,956
Lorraine Miles.

503
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,260
He's Rosie's dad.

504
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:26,570
So, Rosie tells you

505
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,843
her folks died, and you 
don't check that out?

506
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:31,429
With the number of cases I got, 
it comes down to triage.

507
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:32,782
You keep a roof over their heads,

508
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:33,774
you keep the food stamps coming in.

509
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:34,429
So, where do we look

510
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,875
for suspected physical, 
sexual abuse, huh?

511
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,540
Hospital admissions,

512
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,106
uh, foster care reports.

513
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,688
All miscellaneous stuff 
we didn't get to.

514
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,532
This cabinet, Mr. Freely?

515
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,310
All of this.

516
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,858
There are only so 
many hours in the day.

517
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,242
And so many kids.

518
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,906
How do we find Toya in all of this?

519
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,928
"M" for Miles.

520
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:05,135
Familiar territory?

521
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah.

522
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,385
You knew that food stamp 
drill pretty good.

523
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,733
Case number 4228.

524
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,445
Ellen Rush, two dependents.

525
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,625
Valens.

526
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,871
Uh, McLean? You bringing him in?

527
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:29,446
Good.

528
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,087
Jeffries and Vera just picked up 
Rosie's dad at the shipyard.

529
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,088
What do you got?

530
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:40,703
"M" for Miles.

531
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:50,522
That's why Rosie saw the bruises.

532
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,488
That picture don't look like Toya.

533
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,032
It's not.

534
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,901
It's Rosie.

535
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:05,997
When was the last time

536
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:07,984
you saw your daughter, McLean?

537
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:10,077
Five,

538
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:12,385
six years. Lost track.

539
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:14,414
And you never visited Rosie

540
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:16,728
all the time she was in the hospital?

541
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:20,960
Then why'd you set up 
an account for her...

542
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,539
you not givin' a crap and all?

543
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,281
I'm her pops. I wanted to help her.

544
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:29,639
Or shut her up.

545
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,370
You know how Toya died?

546
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,565
Backbone busted to bits.

547
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,111
Skull, too.

548
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:38,382
Oh, no open casket for her.

549
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:41,293
Violent guy who'd do 
something like that, huh?

550
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,693
I wouldn't know.

551
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,868
Hit me.

552
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,834
Show me what you did to Rosie 
when she was little girl.

553
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,225
Come on. You like hittin' girls.

554
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,358
Hit me.

555
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,123
Gonorrhea when she was eight.

556
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:07,972
Again when she was ten.

557
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:12,860
You did a lot more than 
just hit Rosie, didn't you?

558
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:20,487
Rosie made a call 
at the school that day.

559
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:24,206
We traced it to the shipyard, to you.

560
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,234
What'd she call you about?

561
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:31,693
Talkin' crazy, like she was drunk.

562
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:34,908
Goin' on about butterflies.

563
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,535
And that someone was 
gonna hurt Toya, right?

564
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:40,275
So you went there that night.

565
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,180
No, I-I went home.

566
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:43,312
Tell them

567
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:45,642
you went home, after Rosie called,

568
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,659
begging for help.

569
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:48,255
I did.

570
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,594
Don't look at me.

571
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:51,009
Look at them.

572
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:53,810
You tell Toya.

573
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,449
Tell Rosie.

574
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:57,932
You tell them, not me.

575
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:03,083
I-I-I sat outside 
her place in the dark...

576
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:09,591
and I-I-I didn't go there

577
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,444
'cause I thought she was in trouble.

578
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:12,555
Then why'd you go?

579
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,006
To tell her I was sorry...

580
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,073
for when she was little...

581
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:21,329
for what I done.

582
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,932
I sat outside her place,

583
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,507
but I couldn't go in.

584
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,543
So you saw some pizza delivery guy

585
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,382
go up to Rosie's place.

586
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:44,597
What'd this guy look like?

587
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:47,097
Young guy.

588
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:49,770
Black guy.

589
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:55,804
Did a black man come 
over that night, Rosie,

590
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,300
maybe... delivering a pizza?

591
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,971
Maybe you were seeing him?

592
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:04,961
How about this, uh,

593
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:07,055
ponytail guy?

594
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,556
You starting to recognize him?

595
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:14,700
Maybe you met him at a bar...

596
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,980
a club?

597
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:19,510
That wasn't me.

598
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,192
What you're saying...

599
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,833
that wasn't how it was.

600
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,187
Then tell us, Rosie,

601
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:24,707
how it was.

602
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:33,682
Uh, Toya...

603
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:36,400
loved her... her...

604
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,381
butterfly wind chimes.

605
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:43,508
I put'em up in a window... for her.

606
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:48,266
Then he'd come

607
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:49,559
at night...

608
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,973
late at night.

609
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:52,599
Who would?

610
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:58,197
The man who gave Toya the wind chimes.

611
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,939
They ain't optimistic 
'bout getting prints

612
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:04,586
off of them chimes.

613
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:05,595
I know.

614
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:06,836
Well, maybe we get lucky.

615
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:10,205
If not... well, we'll 
get something else tomorrow.

616
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:14,038
Yeah, well, maybe Rosie's 
better off not knowing.

617
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:15,623
Not knowing what?

618
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,354
How she was with Toya,

619
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:19,389
how they lived.

620
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,073
They were doing okay.

621
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,591
What, on welfare, with a DUI?

622
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:24,995
People make mistakes.

623
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:26,153
They clean up.

624
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:29,283
Your mom ever forget to feed you...

625
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:33,231
'cause she was too drunk... or tired...

626
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:34,858
or out looking for a man?

627
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:35,828
Nah.

628
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,145
Toya's a dime a dozen.

629
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,687
Unwanted kid.

630
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,244
Mom runs out of food 
stamps, makes an excuse

631
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,243
why there's no dinner tonight...

632
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,634
or, uh, no breakfast, either,

633
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,866
so thank God for the free corn flakes

634
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,307
at school, if you get there early,

635
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:53,792
and maybe some kid'll give you 
scraps out of his lunch box

636
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,073
later on.

637
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:58,846
So your mom was going 
through bad times.

638
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,129
Scotty...

639
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:03,358
there was never a good time.

640
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:06,670
Oh, you're telling me not once 
did you have fun with your mom?

641
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,532
I mean, not once did you feel...

642
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:09,988
some kind of love?

643
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,820
Maybe tomorrow we bring 
Rosie home, huh?

644
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:37,989
If you can't do this...

645
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,436
No, I-I want to.

646
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:00,487
Mama?

647
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,034
Mama...

648
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,963
She was drawing.

649
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,013
She was... hiding and drawing...

650
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:14,589
Why was she hiding?

651
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,435
Because he's coming...

652
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:20,038
from there...

653
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:22,105
Rosie.

654
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:23,787
He was standing there.

655
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,649
It's just Scotty.

656
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,532
He's not gonna hurt you, okay?

657
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,650
He's not gonna hurt you.

658
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,099
Lil.

659
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,304
Look at this.

660
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:58,818
Kind of a ponytail guy.

661
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,437
"Frely".

662
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:06,406
Freely.

663
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:08,487
Mr. Freely.

664
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,362
The social worker.

665
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:25,905
Cut your hair.

666
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,426
Big improvement.

667
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,850
Wanna see the rest?

668
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,811
I do. Play it.

669
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:39,731
Okay.

670
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:41,677
There's nothing on the tape.

671
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,731
Rosie tried that bluff on you.

672
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:44,795
Didn't work, though, did it?

673
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,844
I don't know, what you're, uh...

674
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,781
'Cause you hadn't done anything to Toya...

675
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:48,889
not yet.

676
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,316
You were circling, though.

677
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,353
Moven' in.

678
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,427
And Rosie knew it...

679
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,571
'cause she was real familiar

680
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,992
with the danger signs.

681
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,622
Rosie's, uh...

682
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,626
damaged goods,

683
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:05,355
if you haven't noticed that already.

684
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:06,872
You know what bugs me?

685
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,987
This camera's been in 
her place for weeks,

686
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:13,616
but she picks this day 
to go to people for help.

687
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:14,977
Why?

688
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:19,734
What happened on this day 
that was so different?

689
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,090
She caught you.

690
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,528
That morning,

691
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:24,731
starting your act with Toya.

692
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:25,383
That's crap.

693
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,795
And she threatened you.

694
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:29,224
"I have a tape, Freely, 
back the hell off."

695
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:30,429
Oh, and that pissed you off.

696
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,628
Who was she, talking to you like that?

697
00:31:32,628 --> 00:31:34,509
So that night, you went back...

698
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:34,833
No.

699
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,851
You used your position

700
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:38,634
to get in her home and 
check out her little girl.

701
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:39,872
Knowing

702
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,274
the power you had...

703
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,521
and Rosie wasn't the only one.

704
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:47,547
You were like God to these women.

705
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:51,265
You had the power to give, to take...

706
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,393
and you did.

707
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:57,381
Like anyone gives a damn.

708
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:00,908
Trailer park trash.

709
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,574
Welfare queens.

710
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:06,952
Like you care what happens to them.

711
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:11,413
They care.

712
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,952
Anita Jones,

713
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,273
Carmen Torres,

714
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:18,227
Dana Matthews,

715
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,472
Leena Young,

716
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:23,256
all their pretty little girls.

717
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:26,058
They're here.

718
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:35,374
They've come here to tell us all about...

719
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:36,882
Mr. Freely.

720
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:49,304
You wanna talk before they do?

721
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,100
Rosie, uh...

722
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,086
threatened me that morning...

723
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:05,186
but not with any tape.

724
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:15,951
Hello, little girl.

725
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,740
Where's your mommy?

726
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,877
Shower.

727
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,306
Mommy.

728
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,292
That's, uh...

729
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,648
Good little girls don't yell, do they?

730
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,541
Mommy says nobody can come in here.

731
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,265
Mr. Freely can.

732
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:01,159
You look pretty, Toya.

733
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,338
Okay.

734
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,216
Say,

735
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,247
"Thank you, Mr. Freely."

736
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,289
Thank you, Mr. Freely.

737
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:24,052
You're a good, good girl.

738
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:26,159
Don't ya touch her!

739
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,523
I know what you're doing.

740
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,217
I know what you are!

741
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,433
Have you been drinking?

742
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,049
I can smell it on your breath, Rosie.

743
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,746
Get out. Get out of my house.

744
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:39,382
Judge isn't gonna look too 
kindly on that, you know.

745
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:41,142
Not with a DUI and all.

746
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,597
You know I stopped. I told you...

747
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:44,712
I tell you!

748
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:45,996
You don't tell me!

749
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,565
You drunk, dumb bitch!

750
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:56,673
Oh, it's some answer, 
it's a... good thing I'm came here.

751
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:58,497
Oh, this place's  all wreck.

752
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,068
How do you raise a 
child in this field?

753
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,035
Okay.

754
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,792
I was wrong, Mr. Freely.

755
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,187
I was wrong.

756
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:08,761
I've made my decision.

757
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,699
It's time to find a new home for Toya.

758
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:14,435
No.

759
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:16,988
I'm gonna have to take care

760
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:21,381
of that pretty little 
girl all by myself.

761
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:33,709
You just wait for the 
knock on the door, Rosie...

762
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:36,491
when you least expect it.

763
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:44,283
That's all I did.

764
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:46,614
And then I left.

765
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:47,960
Talk about that night, Freely.

766
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,881
When you went back.

767
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:50,518
I-I wasn't there...

768
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:52,760
I hate a liar, man.

769
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:57,298
Something you wanna see.

770
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:04,178
No prints on the chimes,
but look at this.

771
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,059
P. Williams?

772
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:07,177
Who's that?

773
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:08,169
Philip Williams.

774
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:09,618
16 at the time of the murder.

775
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:10,906
He worked at Toya's school.

776
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,827
Doing arts and crafts 
with the first graders.

777
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:14,184
Making wind chimes.

778
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:16,407
Doesn't mean we got the wrong guy.

779
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,499
He worked as a Pizza delivery boy.

780
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:22,404
The guy the father was 
that night, dialing 911...

781
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:24,973
running from the scene.

782
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:39,861
Philip Williams?

783
00:36:40,483 --> 00:36:42,596
Detectives Rush, Valens.

784
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:44,108
Homicide.

785
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:47,749
I was wondering when you'd come.

786
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,159
You gonna arrest me this very minute,

787
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,214
or can I finish this play?

788
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,227
Why do you think we're 
here to arrest you?

789
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:06,197
Murder one, second degree murder,

790
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,896
attempted murder, you pick.

791
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:09,553
Ends up in the same place.

792
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:14,896
Did you kill Toya, Philip?

793
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,223
Looks like it, doesn't it?

794
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:18,846
Then why call 911?

795
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,330
If you didn't do it, 
why not come forward?

796
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,135
A black man running from the bodies

797
00:37:23,135 --> 00:37:25,327
of a white woman and white child.

798
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,945
Would you?

799
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,043
What happend to you, Philip?

800
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:31,916
"A" student, honors society, 
budding artist.

801
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,215
Then Toya Miles died

802
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:35,000
and you end up here.

803
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,164
At the bottom of the world.

804
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:38,111
What happened that night

805
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:40,218
brought you to a place 
you don't belong?

806
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:46,108
Leftovers.

807
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,203
They'd throw them out 
at the pizza place.

808
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:55,155
I'd bring them over to Toya,
from time to time.

809
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,343
That night, when I went over,

810
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,650
Rosie's apartment door was busted open.

811
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:42,000
What happened then?

812
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:47,614
I opened the bedroom door.

813
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:01,902
Who was in the bedroom?

814
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,696
Who was there, Philip?

815
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:18,983
No one.

816
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:22,210
No one.

817
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:35,055
Hospital says I'm okay to go home.

818
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:37,737
I know.

819
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:43,982
But where's home?

820
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:54,037
I know why you were crying 
at the butterfly play.

821
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:01,308
Because you tried to stop Mr. Freely...

822
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,669
but you knew you couldn't...

823
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:09,861
'cause men like him never stop.

824
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:12,663
No, they don't.

825
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,561
No one was there for you.

826
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,736
Not your dad,

827
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:23,872
not Angel.

828
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,623
Just you.

829
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:33,577
So you did the only thing you could.

830
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,531
I did?

831
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:40,091
Is that why you can't remember?

832
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:46,143
The DA won't press charges,

833
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,048
not after what you've gone through.

834
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:58,144
What did I do?

835
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,589
There's a place for you to go,

836
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,937
to heal.

837
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,614
Just for a little while, Rosie...

838
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:17,683
because you didn't mean

839
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,853
what you did.

840
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:25,461
What did I do?

841
00:41:54,857 --> 00:41:56,137
Mama?

842
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,009
You just wait...

843
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:02,414
for the knock at the door, Rosie...

844
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,663
when you least expect it.

845
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:11,022
Mommy...?

846
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:20,342
# Little monarch butterfly...#

847
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:20,935
Mommy?

848
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,606
You sing. Sing, baby.

849
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,808
Sing.

850
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,267
# Spread your wings #

851
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:27,993
# And flutter high #

852
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:32,427
# Touch the sun and kiss the sky #

853
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:37,523
# Fly away, my butterfly #

854
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,418
# DJ Sammy f. Yanou의 "Heaven" #

855
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:17,779
# Oh - thinkin' about 
all our younger years #

856
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:21,913
# There was only you and me #

857
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:27,095
# We were young and wild and free #

858
00:43:27,095 --> 00:43:33,199
# Now nothin' can 
take you away from me #

859
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,281
# We've been down that road before #

860
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,985
# But that's over now #

861
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:46,485
# You keep me comin' back for more #

862
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,784
# Baby you're all that I want #

863
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:56,927
# When you're lyin' here in my arms #

864
00:43:56,927 --> 00:44:00,181
# I'm findin' it hard to believe #

865
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:04,686
# We're in heaven #

866
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:08,025
# And love is all that I need #

867
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:12,134
# And I found it there in your heart #

868
00:44:12,134 --> 00:44:15,453
# It isn't too hard to see #

869
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:20,917
# We're in heaven #

870
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:27,292
# Oh, once in your life you find someone #

871
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:31,116
# Who will turn your world around #

872
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:36,288
# Bring you up 
when you're feelin' down #

873
00:44:36,288 --> 00:44:42,510
# Ya, nothin' could change
what you mean to me #

874
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,418
# Oh there's lots that I could say #

875
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:50,319
# But just hold me now #

876
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:58,310
# Cause our love will light the way #

877
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,839
# Baby you're all that I want #

878
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,082
