00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,420
The following story is fictional and does 
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,390
July 7,1968.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,140
maybe we should start without him.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,200
Five more minutes.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,640
Does coop even remember what a church looks like?

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,360
He'll be here.Relax.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,430
hey, you two.Knock it off.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,810
Talk to your son this morning, sarge?

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,310
Called him an hour ago.
No answer.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,650
Perfect.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,620
*********Brawl or a babe?

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,920
Brawl...then a babe.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,690
Isn't it time he got married?

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,940
Got to go out on a second date for that, sarge.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,980
Okay, what are you going to believe?

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,090
My alarm broke or I got lost?

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,190
Since you were an altar boy here, sean,
 I'll go with the former.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,040
There it is.What father mac says.

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,670
Lookin' beautiful, eileen.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,350
Sorry, really.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,930
Forget it, coop.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,790
Been wondering where my deputy's been hiding.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,230
Sweetheart.

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,000
So...what are we waiting for, partner?

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,010
You have asked to have your child baptized.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,930
In doing so you are accepting the responsibility 
of training him in practice of the faith.

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,680
It will be your duty...

28
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,830
think he'll be a cop?

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,980
No choice.It's in his genes.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,420
Forever blue.

31
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,430
Someone's got to break out.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Live a better kind of life.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,780
Yeah?

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,690
What else could guys like us do for a living?

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,800
- Sales?
- Sales.

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,760
Yeah, that's it.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,000
shh.

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,350
Send your holy spirit to dwell with him.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,980
In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit.

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,180
- Amen.
- Amen.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,310
108, are you there?

42
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,310
108, are you there?

43
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,590
Sev krol.Aging con.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,130
Says he's got a tip about a murdered cop, sean cooper.

45
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,040
- Killed in '68.
- '68.

46
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,310
You work patrol then, boss?

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,950
First year on the street.12th district.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,910
So you knew him.

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
He was ahead of me at the academy.

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,590
Kind of guy you didn't forget.

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,560
How's that?

52
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,370
Real cowboy.

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,790
The kind modern regulations don't allow anymore.

54
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,420
So what made our con see the light?

55
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,760
Pancreatic cancer.

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,440
Short timeline?

57
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,270
Four months to live.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,090
Says he wants to die at home with his daughter.

59
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,670
Hope the tip's good.

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,390
Where's my smokes?

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,050
Later.

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,270
What do you got?

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,620
I found him in the car before 
the cops and everybody got there.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,120
That's it?

65
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,610
Maybe.Maybe not.

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,880
shoe's on the other foot, ain't it?

67
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,160
Passing away in a prison cell says it ain'T.

68
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,690
Brick of heroin on the front seat.

69
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,890
What happened to it?

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,990
What do you think happened to it?

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,580
Finders keepers.

72
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,830
You got no proof.

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,510
I saw him lying there dead, radio in his hand, eyes wide open.

74
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,900
A black harp stamped on the brick.

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Teddy burke's gang.

76
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,390
Owned the north philly heroin trade back then.

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,540
Real heavyweight.

78
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,270
You saying cooper was dirty?

79
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,280
Parked under a bridge with a whole lotta dope in the car?

80
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,860
Don't look like a hero, now, does he?

84
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,900
Boxes been up here long as I can remember.

85
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,680
Cop killing.Doesn't go to storage.

86
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,990
Until it's solved.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,620
Valens: Well, original theory, cooper was killed 
on patrol in a bad neighborhood.

88
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,310
They worked this thing to death.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,270
Revenge theory, gang hit, jealous boyfriend.

90
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,230
Apparently cooper was quite the ladies' man.

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
Went nowhere.

92
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,300
Beat up drug dealers too.

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,110
The "old ways.

94
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,660
" Knocking heads, taking money...
was different back then.

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,720
His partner?

96
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,680
Jimmy bruno.

97
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,170
Off training a rookie.

98
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,030
Force was really short-staffed then.

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,660
That's why there were incentives for returning vets to go to the academy.

100
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,910
Like yours truly.

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,110
And cooper.

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,260
First on the scene was owen murphy.

103
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,840
Could have known cooper was on the take.

104
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,890
Covered it up.

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,090
Start there.

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,610
Coop's father.Gave him the heads-up.

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,810
You're accusing my son of being involved in drugs?

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,680
Why don't we step into my office?

109
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,890
The investigation's just started, sarge.

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,360
Investigation?It's a disgrace.

111
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,040
You want me to solve the job or just let it keep collecting dust?

112
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,890
My son had a reputation.

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,140
That's all a cop has.

114
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,000
Do not dishonor his good name.

115
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,770
That's not my intention.

116
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,020
Cops didn't do that in the old days, not when you came on the force.

117
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,800
The department has changed a lot.

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,430
Have you changed, lieutenant?

119
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,070
So you were the first car on the scene.

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
Found sean cooper's body.

121
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,090
Is she your girlfriend?

122
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,630
What do you know about teddy burke?

123
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,540
Everybody knew burke was a big-time dealer.

124
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,310
Your point?

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,920
Was cooper shaking him down?

126
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,410
Cooper?

127
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,610
You're kiddin', right?

128
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,000
Taking burke's heroin, selling it?

129
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,620
Cooper hated burke.

130
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,200
He came down on him real hard.

131
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,930
Busting him with a lot of noise?

132
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,890
Best cover ever.

133
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,710
Oh, no.Not coop.

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,100
You should have seen this guy.

135
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,300
He played by his own rules?

136
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,570
Well, let's just say that he didn't shy away from confrontation.

137
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,490
How's that?

138
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,160
Coop was all about the law.

139
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,790
There's no way he got corrupted.

140
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,780
now what is a fine-lookin' lady like you doin' in a dump like this?

141
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,420
They always run away from me.

142
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,520
Well, maybe it's your shiny personality.

143
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,100
What are you doing?

144
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,200
Selling ice cream.

145
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

146
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,580
What are you doin'?

147
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,590
Hah.Let me see.

148
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,470
Oh.You son of a bitch!

149
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
Don't you know who I am?

150
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,870
A drug dealer in an ugly leather jacket?

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,070
Am I getting close?

152
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,170
You're making a big mistake.

153
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,920
Shut up.

154
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
Whoa.

155
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,990
There's ways to get a piece, officer.

156
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,100
That ain't one.

157
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,540
Cuff him, jimmy.

158
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,830
This won't stick.

159
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,940
Why you bringing me in?

160
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,310
It's your jacket.

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,840
Clashes with the neighborhood.

162
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,230
Urban blight, burke.

163
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,480
It's in all the papers.

164
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,150
Mark my words.

165
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,940
I'm going to last a lot longer on these streets than you.

166
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Watch your head.

167
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,850
And this run-in just slipped your mind 
when coop ends up dead a few months later?

168
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,480
I had my own reasons for keeping mum.

169
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,730
So you were dirty, too.

170
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,890
You a lesbian?

171
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,210
You a jackass?

172
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,610
Well, two girls-- now that'S...that's hot.

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,800
Watch your tone, murphy.

174
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.Whatever.

175
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,960
Get out of here.

176
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,500
Guy must get laid all the time.

177
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,230
He's old-school.
Not used to females on the job.

178
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,900
Uh-huh.

179
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,200
Anyway, jimmy was there when it hit the fan with burke.

180
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,630
So why didn't he report it?

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,270
I didn't know you played.

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,420
I don'T.

183
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,760
Belongs to a kid in my building.

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,310
Stole it from him.

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,220
You've lost it.

186
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,220
No, I've gained it.

187
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,090
Gained what?

188
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
The upper hand.

189
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,100
Over a kid?

190
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,490
He's out to get me.

191
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,500
Plays morning, noon and night right outside my window.

192
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,380
I can't sleep.I can't think.

193
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,530
It's like all he has is this ball.

194
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,260
And you took it away from him.

195
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
Quit lookin' at me like that.

196
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,530
You know the police shrink's two floors down, right?

197
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,630
I lost it.Haven't I?

198
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,970
You're close.

199
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, at least I won this round.

200
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,790
Why'd you think your partner was killed?

201
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,750
He was fearless.

202
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,140
Used to go looking for bad guys in north philly.

203
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,960
I always figured one of them finally got revenge.

204
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,820
Tell us about teddy burke, jimmy.

205
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,170
Well, he sure hated coop, I can tell ya that.

206
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,220
Never made it into the box.

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,370
Were you protecting burke?

208
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,550
No.Guy was in atlantic city that night.

209
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,410
I checked it personally.

210
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,040
Still no mention in the box.

211
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,200
'Cause mentioning burke would've cost me my job.

212
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
Why's that, jimmy?

213
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,120
Burke had a lot of money.
Connections.

214
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,080
Didn't make sense to get his name involved.

215
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,520
Well, what did he spend his money on?

216
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,670
Making sure he stayed out of jail.

217
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,680
He pay off cops?

218
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,130
It was '68.Money was around.

219
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,180
How'd it run?

220
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,880
All the way to the top.

221
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,390
eileen home tonight?

222
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,590
You in love with my wife, coop?

223
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,420
Just her cooking.

224
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,840
She's taking the kids to chitty chitty bang bang.

225
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,800
Oh, too bad.

226
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,580
Means we gotta drink and watch tv 
all night with no one naggin' us.

227
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,330
Damn shame.

228
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,920
No, you many not use the ladies' room.

229
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,310
We're allowed to beat up queers for information, right, jimmy?

230
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,800
Your bust, your call.

231
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,810
inside.

232
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,160
Am I on lsd or is that teddy burke out there?

233
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,450
Oh, you take lsd, boss?

234
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,030
Damn it, cooper, save the wise-ass remarks.

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,820
Why'd you guys bring him in?

236
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,450
He was selling smack on a corner.

237
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,310
And which one of you came to me for the okay?

238
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,510
We gotta get permission?

239
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,090
Oh, don't play dumb.

240
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,120
Lieutenant, correct me if I'm wrong,

241
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,990
but doesn't the crimes code say 
"the possession of drugs is illegal"?

242
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,140
Are you gonna get this jackass under control?

243
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,920
I'll make sure we get proper clearance 
on all politically sensitive suspects.

244
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,400
Screw that.

245
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,690
Jimmy and I been together a year.

246
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,510
We've had more busts, seen more convictions than any other team.

247
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,300
Your point?

248
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,780
Point is, captain appreciates our work.

249
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,510
You think he knows you're such good pals with teddy burke?

250
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,900
Do not try and go over my head, cooper.

251
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,290
You'll regret it.

252
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,670
Now scram.

253
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,010
What about burke?

254
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,970
Oh, teddy burke?

255
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,080
Was he busted today?

256
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,090
Mccree was taking protection money 
from burke and spreading it around.

257
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,660
Except for coop.

258
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,580
Were you on the payroll?

259
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,490
You know how it was back then, john.

260
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,020
How 'bout you?

261
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,220
You take a little money in those days?

262
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,230
12th district had its own rules.

263
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,770
What was coop doing under that bridge, jimmy?

264
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,970
Night he was killed?

265
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,880
Responding to a dispatch.

266
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,320
No record of that dispatch on his patrol log.

267
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,420
Who sent him out there?

268
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,520
Radio room sent all the dispatches.

269
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,440
Manned by cops.

270
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,760
A lot of cops owed mccree.

271
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,580
Mccree needed to get coop under control, so maybe he was set up?

272
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,920
By his own lieutenant.

273
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,600
I got kat and nick looking for the dispatch card.

274
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,430
Could be in the old radio room...or city records.

275
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Good to see you, tom.

276
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,680
Anything for the troops.

277
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,790
What's up?

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,600
 You remember teddy burke?

279
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,710
Yeah, vaguely.

280
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,310
Ever arrest him?

281
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,510
Old age.

282
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,330
Handicap and your memory,
 they go right in the crapper.

283
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,100
He ran the heroin trade out of 
your district and never got locked up.

284
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,760
That's a lot of luck.

285
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,340
I mean, you get rid of one scumbag like burke, 
and another pops up to take his place.

286
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,210
I mean, might as well tax 'em, huh?

287
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,410
You take care of your men.

288
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,510
Damn right I did.

289
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,090
That's how we did it back in the day.
You remember.

290
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,280
How'd you take care of coop?

291
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,010
And your meaning, hotshot?

292
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,700
Cooper was responding to a dispatch the night he was shot.

293
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,660
Says who?

294
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,140
We're asking the questions, tom.

295
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,020
You heard a lie.

296
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,690
And you know the truth?

297
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,800
He was a real playboy type, cooper.

298
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,080
So, between us...
I ain't surprised he got shot.

299
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,720
- Jealous boyfriend?
- Husband.

300
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,240
'Cause that is the one woman you cannot touch...ever.

301
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,830
I know it's wrong.

302
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,170
How could you do this to me, coop?

303
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,090
To us?

304
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,570
What do you want from me?

305
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,500
looky what we got here.

306
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,270
Give it a rest.

307
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,420
How long has it been going on?

308
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,410
Jimmy know?

309
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,990
No.

310
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,710
What would your old man say?

311
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,580
His own son banging another cop's wife.

312
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,540
You leave sarge out of this.

313
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,210
Oh, you don't tell me what to do.

314
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,840
Not ever again.

315
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,510
I don't give a rat's ass about you.

316
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,610
But jimmy's a good man.

317
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,670
He doesn't deserve this.

318
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,120
You end it, understand?

319
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,750
Yeah.I understand.

320
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:52,110
This is a cop's wife.
You crossed a line.

321
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,970
I know that.

322
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,410
You better.

323
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,980
Cooper was having an affair with his partner's wife?

324
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,940
Self-righteous jackass.

325
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,620
Eileen couldn't have been too happy about him breaking it off.

326
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,580
Well, married woman cast off by the young womanizer.

327
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,640
Had to leave a bitter taste.

328
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,220
Payback's a bitch, huh?

329
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,240
Maybe she told jimmy?

330
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,930
This nurse...says she's looking for you.

331
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,940
For me?

332
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,520
You know her?

333
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,300
No.

334
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,260
How do I look?

335
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,090
Like crap.

336
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,340
Can't keep 'em off me.

337
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,210
Why, hello.

338
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,840
You stole my son's basketball and I want it back.

339
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,450
Lady, I'm getting sleep deprivation 
'cause of your kid and that ball.

340
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,840
So you're admitting you took it?

341
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,890
Didn't say that.

342
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,000
I just got off a double shift, you hear me?

343
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,150
I do not have time for your brand of bs.

344
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,780
Officer, I want to report a robbery.

345
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,410
Well, we're, uh, homicide.

346
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,420
Take this down.

347
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,740
Suspect is a white man wearing 
an ugly-assed tie and a bad attitude.

348
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,180
Well, maybe if you were home more, 
he wouldn't be clanging that ball all night.

349
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,590
Excuse me?

350
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,410
Did I ask your opinion about my mothering skills?

351
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,510
Don't have to.

352
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,870
Proof is in the pudding, lady.

353
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,510
If my child needed a father, you would be the last man on earth.

354
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,570
Yeah, well, if i wanted a child, 
your son would be the last kid on earth.

355
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,870
Stay away from my boy, you hear?

356
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,710
And while you're at it...grow up.

357
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,870
You really do have a way with the nurses.

358
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,410
Coop was handsome.

359
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,850
Brave...back from the war.

360
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,150
By all accounts, an exciting guy.

361
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,370
I suppose he was, yes.

362
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,330
Now you were married with kids.

363
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,490
Maybe looking for some excitement yourself?

364
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,320
You think I was having an affair with coop?

365
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,180
It seems like he was around the house a lot.

366
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,970
Maybe he stopped by once when jimmy wasn't there.

367
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,500
You don't know what you're talking about.

368
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,030
Were you angry when coop broke it off?

369
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,610
Last bit of romance goes out of your life.

370
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,570
Breaks your heart.

371
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,910
It wasn't like that.

372
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,310
What was it like...eileen?

373
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,400
You two, you're both so young.
So certain.

374
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,720
My heart got broke, yes.

375
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,540
But not how you think.

376
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,740
Why you gotta piss off teddy burke like that?

377
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,750
Are you afraid of that scumbag?

378
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,550
It ain't about fear.

379
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,510
You know what it's about.

380
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,870
What's it about, jimmy?

381
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,360
Keeping my job.

382
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,610
I ain't going against mccree.

383
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,830
So that makes it all right to be on the take?
Hmm?

384
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,410
Everything's always black and white with you.

385
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
You don't know anything.

386
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,190
We're cops.

387
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,620
That's all i need to know.

388
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I got three kids.

389
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,260
Don't talk to me about taking 50 bucks 
a week from a piece of crap.

390
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,940
Then you are just like mccree.

391
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,900
Get off your soapbox, coop.

392
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,100
You go out there and you bust shins 
'cause it's another good time for you.

393
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,060
I bust shins because I am enforcing the law.

394
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,160
You and your john wayne act.

395
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,500
We're the law.

396
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,510
We're here to put the scumbags away.

397
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,480
It ain't fun and games.

398
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,480
Sure it is.

399
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,920
Just like the fun you had slaughtering vietcong.

400
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,930
You miss that free pass to kill, don't you?

401
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,270
You're right.That was fun.

402
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,230
Go to hell.

403
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,570
I see what you mean.

404
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,580
Thanks for your time, eileen.

405
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,070
Two guys on the force having a love affair?

406
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,410
Serious trouble back then.

407
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,700
How about today?

408
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,670
Two male cops hitting it.

409
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,290
Recipe for disaster.

410
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,280
Remember ray walsh, worked narcotics?

411
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,450
Yeah, big sixers fan, retired to vegas.

412
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,120
What about him?

413
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,750
I heard he's living with a guy.

414
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,420
So what?

415
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,720
Ray walsh took me to a couple sixers games.

416
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,540
Took you?

417
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,350
Tickets were free.

418
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,690
That doesn't mean anything.

419
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,510
Live and let live.

420
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,040
"Don't ask, don't tell" works just fine today, too.

421
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,870
Jimmy, we all want to find out 
what happened to coop that night, right?

422
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,590
Course.

423
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,790
You know how it is.

424
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,870
We investigate the victim, find out everything about him.

425
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,640
Guys, I was on the force for 25 years.

426
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,390
What, you giving me a rookie test here?

427
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,450
Well, we had a long talk with eileen.

428
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:35,270
Said your marriage finally broke up 'cause, 
uh, the way you and coop were.

429
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,660
She saw you in the backyard, jimmy.

430
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,870
Eileen's still bitter about the divorce.

431
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,640
Jimmy, I just want to find out who killed your partner.

432
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,500
Well, you got the wrong info on us.

433
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,800
Maybe someone else got the wrong impression, too.

434
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,140
I wouldn't know.

435
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,200
Jimmy, coop was your partner.

436
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,640
You owe him.

437
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,070
So I'm pulling this little queer out of 
hat bathhouse on monroe street.

438
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,470
He's crying, "don't tell my wife.

439
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,550
You must have took a little in the backdoor in nam, huh, coop?

440
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,890
All those lonely jungle nights.

441
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,710
Right.

442
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,810
See, he agrees.

443
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,340
Didn't know you played on their team.

444
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,540
Shut up, murph.

445
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,360
Oh, you, too, jimmy?

446
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,650
You a fairy queen or what?

447
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,090
Give it a rest, man.

448
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,670
Oh, I get it.

449
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,300
Jimmy and coop.
The dynamic duo.

450
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,230
You know, they say batman and robin are homos.

451
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,810
what if I was?

452
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,820
Was what?

453
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,170
A homo.A queer.

454
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,240
Coop, easy.

455
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,590
You one, too, murphy?
Huh?

456
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,310
That your problem, fairy boy?

457
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,460
Get off of me!

458
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,290
I ain't no queer.

459
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,970
You get that straight.

460
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,460
To a guy like murphy, those were fighting words.

461
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,290
And he was first on the scene.

462
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,770
Thanks for your time, jimmy.

463
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,140
Coop wasn'T...like that.

464
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,340
Whatever you want to call it.

465
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
Sure, jimmy.

466
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,750
Neither was I.

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,770
Heard you got a problem with pansies on the force, owen.

468
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,010
What's she babbling about?

469
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,260
When I ask you a question, you answer it.

470
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,360
Understand?

471
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,470
 Or you can spend some time down in lock-up.

472
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,600
Your choice.

473
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,420
We know coop humiliated you in front of your boys.

474
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,140
Maybe you got even under that bridge.

475
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,490
Guy was a freak, okay?

476
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,690
But kill another cop?
No way.

477
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,460
We're not gonna just take your word.

478
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,040
Doesn't work like that.

479
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,530
Coop should've just let it go.

480
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,660
Let what go?

481
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,380
What he and jimmy were doing.

482
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,400
Thing like that can kill you.

483
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,840
I can't go on like this, jimmy.

484
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,030
Like what?

485
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,470
You know what I mean.

486
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,960
Making plans day-to-day, not knowing when I'm gonna see you.

487
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,210
You see me every day.

488
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,310
That's not what I mean.

489
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,030
Then say what you mean.

490
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,000
We got something here.

491
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,780
And it ain't going away.

492
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,550
I got a family.

493
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,450
You think eileen wants to be married to a stranger?

494
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,560
You think if she knew, she'd want to keep living a lie?

495
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,600
I ain't leaving my kids, coop.

496
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,560
Not asking for that.

497
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,850
What then?

498
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,620
'Member what you were talking about, living a different kind of life?

499
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,920
This is our shot.

500
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,640
That was just talk.

501
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,410
We're cursed with this thing.

502
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,290
My folks, been married forever, right?

503
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,200
But whatever they had died years ago.

504
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,450
And I look around and I see everyone like that.

505
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,570
Staying together 'cause of the church

506
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,560
or 'cause it's expected or 'cause they got nowhere else to go.

507
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,950
Cursed?

508
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,290
We're the lucky ones, jimmy.

509
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,740
I don't know.

510
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,320
Sure about that?

511
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,790
Guess I don't got a choice.

512
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,370
You think to share this with anyone else?

513
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,830
Well, I told his dad-- sarge.

514
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,510
He's the only person that coop would ever listen to.

515
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,370
When was this?

516
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,620
After the christening.

517
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,910
I figured sarge would sort him out.

518
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,990
I don't believe this.

519
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,570
Peace offering.

520
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,480
I don't want it.

521
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,020
Looked like you were having a bad day.

522
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,260
I wasn't helping.

523
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,940
Serious understatement.

524
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't think I can fit this through.

525
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,010
You know we're on the same team, right?

526
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,160
What team is that?

527
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,790
Cops, nurses-- making the world a better place.

528
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,180
While getting paid nothing.

529
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,010
That's deep.Really.

530
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,070
Andre.

531
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,460
What do you say, andre?

532
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,090
He didn't have to buy you a new ball.

533
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,960
Thank you, kind sir.

534
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,260
Have a pleasant day.

535
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,310
Sorry.Teenage boys.

536
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,560
He's a martian to me.

537
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,710
Wasn't any different when I was his age, and look how I turned out.

538
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah.I see.

539
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,370
Mccree lied about no dispatch card.

540
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,110
Found in the radio room files.

541
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,540
So a dispatch definitely went out.

542
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,460
Yep.And written on every card?

543
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,710
Badge number of who sent out the call.

544
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,050
I id'd the number.

545
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,020
- And?
- Belonged to coop's father.

546
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,790
Sarge?

547
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
None other.

548
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,110
So he sent his own son to his death.

549
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,240
They come to me digging upold skeletons, telling lies.

550
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,630
We know about coop and jimmy, sarge.

551
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,830
You knew, too.

552
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,220
Tough thing to abide.

553
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,520
My boy was a ladies' man.

554
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,050
Picked 'em like cherries.

555
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,540
You working the radio room the night your son was killed?

556
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,450
Nah.

557
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,370
That your badge number?

558
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,720
You sent coop to the bridge.
Didn't you?

559
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,590
I didn't kill my boy.

560
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,270
I loved him from the day he was born.

561
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,330
He came out with his fists clenched, like this.

562
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,870
He was a man, not...not that...

563
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,360
course not.Never that.

564
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,990
We had a reputation, him and me.

565
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,270
Cop's reputation is all he has.

566
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,730
Coop was going to destroy all that.

567
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,610
Won't believe the load of crap that owen murphy just told me.

568
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,660
Yeah?

569
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,430
Yeah, he...

570
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,250
he said that, uh, that you and jimmy are, uh...

571
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,750
ah, forget about it.
It ain't worth discussing.

572
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,580
- sure.
- He's crazy.

573
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,780
Right, son?

574
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,040
You really want to talk about this, pop?

575
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,960
You need to find a new partner.

576
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,950
Jimmy's good.

577
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,960
Jimmy bruno is a sick, disgusting son of a bitch.

578
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
No, he's not.

579
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,180
You were led astray.

580
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,880
No one leads me.

581
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,030
You of all people know that, pop.

582
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,280
You're my son.

583
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:22,080
You can'T...you can't be.

584
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,670
We raised you right.

585
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,970
It has nothing to do with you.

586
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,410
You're not going to disgrace our family, the force.

587
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,250
Quit looking at me like that, pop.
Please.

588
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,880
I thought you were a man.

589
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,930
I am.

590
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,320
No, you're not.

591
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,520
And you're not my son, neither.

592
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,300
I didn't know what I was saying.

593
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,510
Talk about the dispatch, sarge.

594
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,380
Mccree told me to send them to the bridge.

595
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,300
Mccree knew?

596
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,920
I told him.

597
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,680
I thought they were going to send some guys to rough 'em up.

598
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,260
Then I heard coop was dead.

599
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,580
You want to tell us the real reason jimmy wasn't with him?

600
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,400
The two had never separated, not on the job.

601
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:36,400
It didn'T...never added up.

602
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,800
I don't care what coop was.

603
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,410
Not anymore.

604
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,420
I just want my boy back.

605
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,490
I don't know what I would have done in your shoes, tommy.

606
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,970
I mean you can't have those types around the precinct.

607
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,410
Time was we had standards.

608
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,190
We did.And they were upheld.

609
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,980
See, you understand, john.
By the lieutenant.

610
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,230
Not a job for the weak.

611
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,720
No, you see weak lieutenants all the time.

612
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,300
They can't handle problems by themselves.

613
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,030
They're afraid of, uh...discipline.

614
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,620
So what about the guys you sent to do coop and jimmy?

615
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,290
What'd you mean?

616
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,640
All due respect, tommy.
Wasn't discipline.

617
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,460
Guys went to scare them, they end up shooting coop.

618
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,990
That's the definition of a mess.

619
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,860
I was training a rookie cop.

620
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,250
That's why I wasn't with him that night.

621
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
That the real reason, jimmy?

622
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,050
I told you a million times.

623
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,920
Look, sarge knew about you and coop.

624
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,160
He told your lieutenant.

625
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,360
That's why coop was sent out to the bridge that night.

626
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,750
Truth time, jimmy.

627
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,140
You owe him that.

628
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,180
If I'd been with him in the car that night, 
he would have had a chance.

629
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,150
But you let him go out on his own.

630
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,010
Why?

631
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:21,980
Because if I got in that car, 
the whole world was going to know.

632
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,490
Know what?

633
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,690
Know what, jimmy?

634
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,230
Who I was.

635
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,120
In a strong precinct that never would have happened, tommy.

636
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,610
Undisciplined cops not following the lieutenant's orders...

637
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,950
I didn't have undisciplined cops.

638
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,140
My men followed orders.

639
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,390
Not on the night that coop was killed.

640
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,540
Coop...

641
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,130
there's no word for what he was, and why do you care?

642
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,860
He was a cop.

643
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,810
He was a joke!

644
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,970
His type wasn't natural.

645
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,830
He wasn't right...

646
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,600
you had to clean house.

647
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,620
You damn right I did!

648
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,150
So what'd you do?

649
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,540
I shot that queer and I'd do it again!

650
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,250
The world back then didn't understand.

651
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,070
You believed it was wrong.

652
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,820
But that kind of thing...

653
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,450
comes around once in a lifetime 
and you got to hold on or you'll lose it.

654
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,220
Coop was right.

655
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,180
You were the lucky ones, jimmy.

656
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,860
I miss him.

657
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,660
I know.

658
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,120
You two stick close in north philly tonight.

659
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,030
Been getting armed robbery calls from under the bridge.

660
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,560
Send the bad guys.

661
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll try and scare some up for you.

662
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,210
Keep an eye on those bathhouses, jimmy.

663
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,330
You gettin' in or what?

664
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,390
I think I'm going to take out a rookie.

665
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,550
- Serious?
- Yeah.

666
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,370
I'll pick up some beer.
I'll meet you after.

667
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,190
I can't make it tonight.

668
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,490
Why not?

669
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,860
Maybe it's time for a change.

670
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,490
What kinda change?

671
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,500
I wasn't thinking right when we talked.

672
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,130
I haven't been right for a long time.

673
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,330
What's goin' on, jimmy?

674
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,010
I'm not going to be making it over to your place no more.

675
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,160
You should get a new partner.

676
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,920
You afraid?

677
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,710
Nah.That's got nothin' to do with that.

678
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm afraid, too.

679
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,240
Look, I gotta get goin'.

680
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,400
Jimmy.Don't go.Please.

681
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,030
We're the lucky ones.
Remember?

682
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,760
I think you got it wrong there.

683
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,840
I ain't a queer.

684
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,300
Coop!

685
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,380
Need a unit at the east end, the bridge and diamond.

686
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,290
Report of a robbery.

687
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,300
Suspect last seen on foot.

688
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,650
108, car in.I'm a block away.

689
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,090
Officer down!

690
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,140
East end of the bridge at diamond.

691
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,820
I been hit...

692
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,590
two shots outta nowhere.

693
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,460
That's coop.Floor it!

694
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,010
jimmy...you out there?

695
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,590
I'm here, man.

696
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,060
Hang on.Coop?

697
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,640
jimmy...

698
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,080
keep talking!

699
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,480
We're almost there.

700
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,590
You hear me?

701
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,830
Coop?

702
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,990
We were the lucky ones...

703
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,570
don't forget that.

704
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,530
coop!Coop!

705
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,090
108, are you there?

706
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,650
108, are you there?
