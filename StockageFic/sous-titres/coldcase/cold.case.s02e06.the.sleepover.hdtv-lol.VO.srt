4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,996
What are everyone's plans
for the weekend?

5
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,280
Ariel?

6
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:17,235
Um, I'm going to the mall with 
Brandi and Tiffany,

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:20,419
and then they're having dinner at my house.

8
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:22,750
We're going shopping for 
an outfit for the dance.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,830
They're gonna be like the same,

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,856
but we each get a different color.

11
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,340
Mine's gonna be strapless.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,365
Great.

13
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:31,438
Rita, what are you doing 
this weekend?

14
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,081
Me and my mum are probably
getting an iguana.

15
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,499
But they're like really big 
when they're fully matured,

16
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:40,186
so we'll maybe build
their own habitat.

17
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,473
That's terrific, Rita.

18
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:08,785
Caitlin Gater, white female, 19.

19
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,952
Park ranger found her 
a few hours ago.

20
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:12,062
In the water?

21
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:14,449
Yeah, took us a spell to get her up.

22
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,963
People notice this ain't the 
best place to swim in laps?

23
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:19,870
Name like Devil's Pool 
kinda says it all.

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,263
Chestnut Hill kids come here 
and dive.

25
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,717
Local tradition.

26
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:26,173
The trick is you gotta jump far 
into the left to miss the rocks.

27
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:27,685
That's how rich kids get a thrill, huh?

28
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:31,656
Well, our girl went straight down 
to the rocks, never got back up.

29
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:32,596
Drowned?

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,434
With a little help.

31
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:41,327
Bruises go around the back.

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,273
He held her head in the water?

33
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:46,457
That's not the only reason 
I dragged you out in the cold though.

34
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,028
It's all right, our pleasure.

35
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,201
What's with the marks?

36
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,911
Magic marker, it looks like.

37
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:58,449
In 1990, a little girl was found
under water here.

38
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,268
Broken neck,

39
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:03,688
same marks all over her body.

40
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:06,707
And 14 years later to the day 
this girl's killed.

41
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:09,810
Big deal case, we worked it to death,
but nothing stuck and it went cold.

42
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,361
Think this is a copy cat?

43
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:14,214
Detail about the marks were 
never released to the press.

44
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:16,262
So, we're looking at the same doer.

45
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,365
Good chance.

46
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,364
Guy lays low 14 years.

47
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,138
Why come back now?

48
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:26,457
He got something to say.

49
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:35,453

59
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,023
Can I get that for you?

60
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,137
No, Scotty.

61
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,832
You sit.

62
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:12,333
They did their due diligence 
first time around, eh?

63
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,567
They had any ideas
on these marks?

64
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,087
First detectives wondered 
whether they're ritualistic

65
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,235
but they couldn't
find any pattern to them.

66
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,555
It didn't match anything
FBI had on file.

67
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:23,738
Seventh grader 
at Chestnut Collegiate.

68
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,189
Pricey prep school.

69
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,721
Yeah, but Rita was 
a scholarship kid.

70
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,991
Well, she and her mum and 
the other half was in Chestnut Hill.

71
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,815
Mother's an art teacher
at community college,

72
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,791
tucks her daughter in at 10 pm.

73
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,820
Next morning, she's two miles
from her house.

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,938
Blunt force trauma from
hitting the rocks.

75
00:04:38,938 --> 00:04:40,464
Could've snuck out out
to meet someone.

76
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,798
Or someone snatched her,
brought her there.

77
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:45,103
We got any leads on who 
killed this new victim?

78
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:46,250
We do now.

79
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,166
Gil Sherman's bringing in a guy,

80
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,049
caught speeding toward New Jersey

81
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:53,418
with a car full of 
Caitlin Gater's clothes.

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,370
He gave himself up when we
flashed the lights.

83
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,391
He confessed?

84
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,643
For an hour straight.

85
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:01,182
Guy's parents are here.
I hear they want to see him.

86
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:02,267
That's them.

87
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,372
Detective Rush and Valens.

88
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,883
Jason Beaudry.

89
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,455
My wife Holly.

90
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:09,931
This is a mistake.

91
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:13,299
Neil is a schizophrenic and 
he's very confused right now.

92
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,818
We know this is a bad time
but I need to ask.

93
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:19,565
Did you or your son know 
a girl named Rita Baxter?

94
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:23,899
She was the girl who died
at Devil's Pool years ago.

95
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,215
No, we didn't know her.

96
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,386
Are you trying to pin something 
else on him now?

97
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,172
She went to school in your
neck of the woods.

98
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,607
We remember the story.

99
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:31,594
It was tragic,

100
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:33,361
but that's the only time I'd
ever heard her name.

101
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:34,694
This is wrong.

102
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,238
You're taking advantage
of a sick person.

103
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:39,033
What's he on?

104
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,331
Clozaril.

105
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,303
If you bring it in,
we can get that to him.

106
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:44,965
He might be here a while.

107
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,453
Neil, it's Detective Rush.
She's got some questions for you.

108
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:53,445
He ain't in a good way.
He's seeing things.

109
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,337
Neil, why did you go to 
Devil's Pool yesterday?

110
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:57,475
Um, I, uh,

111
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:01,451
I go every year on 16th of November.

112
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:03,212
Why that day?

113
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,600
- You know a girl named Rita Baxter?
- Everything's the same there.

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,134
It's always dead.

115
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,065
So you go there every year?

116
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,621
This year, you killed the girl.

117
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:15,846
Why?

118
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:19,554
If I touch things, they'll die.

119
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,791
Did you put the marks on 
this girl's body?

120
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,187
It was my first time.

121
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:26,259
You killed this girl just 
like you killed Rita, Neil?

122
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,845
No, no.

123
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,349
Rita has the same marks on her body.

124
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,718
No, I killed this girl, but not Rita.

125
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:34,532
Sit down.

126
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,636
He's got a pace.
They do that.

127
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:41,614
Why did you go to the Devil's Pool 
every year the same day Rita died?

128
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,287
You're going away anyway, Neil.

129
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:48,444
- You got nothing to lose.
- No, I'm sorry.

130
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,243
If we give him his meds,
it'll be easier.

131
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:56,483
Rita had a thing for cats, huh?

132
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,149
Muse of choice and she was prolific.

133
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,359
I could paper the walls 
in felines and costumes.

134
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:07,269
I said, you're 12,
what about boys?

135
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,097
So../ We came across someone.

136
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,995
Neil Beaudry.

137
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,524
Big shot Chestnut Hill family,
father's an importer.

138
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,577
Oh, I know that name.

139
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,107
Brandi Beaudry.

140
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,549
She was in Rita's year,
Chestnut Collegiate.

141
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,683
That's Neil's kid sister.

142
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:30,978
- What'd the boy do?
- He's a murder suspect.

143
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:34,958
A girl died at Devil's Pool,
have the same marks on her.

144
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,895
Rita went to school with 
his sister since she was 5.

145
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,173
I'm sure he knows who she was.

146
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:42,244
Parents said he didn't.

147
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,512
All those people weren't around
enough to have any idea

148
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:45,841
who your kids knew.

149
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:50,018
And while they are busy jetting
off spending their bags of money,

150
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,792
their daughter was tormenting Rita.

151
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:57,626
She goes off to the water

152
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:00,252
and with her mind,
she calls the dolphins.

153
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:04,924
They swim and they have 
a friendship even without like words.

154
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,409
That sounds great.

155
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,340
It's by the same writer 
as a wrinkle in time.

156
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,826
Um, I don't know feel so well.

157
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:15,900
All of a sudden?

158
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,508
- What's wrong?
- Please, mom.

159
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:19,189
Could we go home?

160
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,249
Hey, there's Ariel.

161
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,666
- Mom, we're not friends anymore.
- Why not?

162
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,678
She's friends with Brandi now.

163
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,692
- Brandi doesn't like me.
- Well, then Brandi's an idiot.

164
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:29,766
Brandi's mean.

165
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,091
She always says, what are
you looking at?

166
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,543
At one time, she took my jacket and

167
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,532
said it was from the Sears 
and gave it to the janitor,

168
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:40,106
but I took it back.

169
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,945
Rita, listen to me.

170
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,599
Everyone who's ever been anything

171
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,789
in the history of time has been 
a loser in junior high.

172
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:47,997
In 6 years from now,

173
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,250
you're gonna be in college

174
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,625
and you are gonna be the coolest
girl around.

175
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:56,746
Because you're smart and you're
different and you're wacky.

176
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,754
And that's what's important in 
this world.

177
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:01,720
Not what those idiot girls think of you.

178
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,299
Girls that age, it's...

179
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,224
It's like the Serengeti.

180
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,261
Kill or be killed.

181
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,125
I fought with my sister

182
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,672
everytime I tried to change 
the channel from the Hardy Boys,

183
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,477
she'd shriek like a banshee.

184
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,317
Why Rita?
Why'd he pick her?

185
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,217
It's not for sure yet.

186
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:30,012
That family, they just couldn't
let Rita be.

187
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,370
How you feeling?

188
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,417
The medication makes me,

189
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,983
um, under water.

190
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,274
But a little clearer, right?

191
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,343
Okay.

192
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,704
Rita Baxter.

193
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:03,861
Your sister had a thing for 
picking on her.

194
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,631
You remember?

195
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,919
Yeah.

196
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,876
Do you ever see her?

197
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,513
Sometimes.

198
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,865
When you do,

199
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,728
see these markings?

200
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,795
On her skin all over.

201
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,608
Black pen.

202
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,135
You put those on her?

203
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,248
No.

204
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,133
But you put a mark on Caitlin.

205
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,698
Why?

206
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:44,462
To make her like Rita.

207
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:46,194
And you wanted to hurt her
like you hurt Rita?

208
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:47,931
No,

209
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:52,084
I wasn't poisoned back then.

210
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,208
- Maybe without meaning it.
- No.

211
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,591
Okay, Neil.

212
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,326
You don't understand.

213
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:58,646
Go ahead.

214
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,955
It was my first time.

215
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,479
Okay, Neil.

216
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,177
You, it's over.

217
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:15,487
So, now you've gone to first base.

218
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,097
You can go.
We're done with you.

219
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,757
Neil, come back and visit later.

220
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,153
Not.

221
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,506
So how was it specifically?

222
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:31,108
Warm.

223
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,169
Now, Rita's getting hot.

224
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:41,941
When was that?

225
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,790
The night she died.

226
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,722
You're sure?

227
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:49,770
My sister had her over
for a sleepover.

228
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,701
So, did you do something to Rita 
later that night?

229
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,375
It wasn't me.

230
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,649
I killed that other girl, but not Rita.

231
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,819
Well, who did?

232
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,494
It was the house.

233
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,079
It's an evil house.

234
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,383
Neil, the wack job can
say what he wants.

235
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,780
I know he's our guy.

236
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,767
Parents were out that night,
he was in charge.

237
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,370
- That's opportunity.
- And motive?

238
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,053
He's a wack job.

239
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,469
Whether Neil's telling the truth or not,

240
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:26,662
we still got the three girls

241
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,075
who never spoke up about being
with Rita that night.

242
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:32,485
14 years, biggest case in 
Chestnut Hill and they clam up?

243
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,564
That's shady.

244
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:36,012
Brandi Beaudry, Ariel Shuman,
Tiffany O'Connell.

245
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,198
Those were the girls the mother
remembers hassling Rita.

246
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,024
Kill her over a game of Barbie,

247
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,898
hit her with a dream Corvette?

248
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:44,085
We went to the school the
first time around.

249
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,586
How'd the girls get overlooked?

250
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,521
Three most popular girls in school

251
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,796
having a sleepover with Rita?

252
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,482
Violates a social order.

253
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,567
Especially Buffy, Muffy, and 
the Trixie ain't talking.

254
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,144
Sounds like it's time 
to introduce yourselves

255
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:57,998
to the divas of the Chestnut Collegiate.

256
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,590
Those are wrinkles.

257
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,313
Do you see what I'm saying?
I said creases.

258
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:10,206
Brandi Beaudry?

259
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,922
Yeah, I'm Brandi.

260
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:16,572
Detective Valens and Rush.
Homicide.

261
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,073
If this is about my brother,

262
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:21,129
I'd be by his side right now
if I didn't have this party to plan.

263
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:22,357
So, no.

264
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,848
I'm not gonna help you put
him away.

265
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:27,953
We ain't here about Caitlin Gater.

266
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:29,050
What then?

267
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,542
Why didn't you ever tell anyone

268
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:34,560
Rita Baxter was at your house 
the night she died?

269
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,845
I don't know what 
you're talking about.

270
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:38,813
Brandi, a girl was murdered.

271
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,225
14 years go by and 
you never say anything?

272
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:44,487
You realize how that makes you look.

273
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,044
She came by, okay?

274
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:50,059
But she left in the middle of the night.

275
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,724
I don't know anything 
about how she died.

276
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,948
So, why keep the sleepover a secret?

277
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,388
We were afraid.

278
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:58,245
We thought we'd be blamed 
just because we'd been with her.

279
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,970
I'm sorry.
Seriously.

280
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,429
But we were 12.

281
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,508
So, what's your excuse now?
Seriously.

282
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,632
- Girls club code of silence?
- Not at all.

283
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:10,287
I haven't talked to Ariel orTiffany
in like a million years.

284
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:11,782
Is that an exact figure?

285
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,410
High school, maybe.

286
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,982
Let's start with this, Brandi.

287
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:19,585
How's a girl like Rita wind up 
at a sleepover at your house?

288
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:24,381
We invited her because we thought
it would be funny to mess with her.

289
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,694
We're brats.

290
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:28,317
Who came up with this great plan?

291
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:30,397
It was Ariel's idea.

292
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:39,402
Hi, Rita.

293
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:44,045
You could say hi back.

294
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:45,945
Hi.

295
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:52,244
Brandi thinks you're cool and
she wants to hang out with you.

296
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,949
I have to go home.

297
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:57,025
Rita, this is a chance of a lifetime.

298
00:14:57,025 --> 00:15:02,435
It is way better being with them
than being a nerd and gifted.

299
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:05,684
Hey, Rita.

300
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,577
Cute snickers.

301
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,375
So, my parents are in the Bahamas

302
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,373
and we're having 
a sleepover tonight.

303
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:14,543
I want you to come but you can't
tell your mom because well,

304
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,130
I don't really have permission.

305
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,903
Ariel, is this a trick?

306
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:22,580
No, she for real wants you there.

307
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,186
I do, too.

308
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:32,105
I could sneak out 
after my mom goes to bed.

309
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:42,261
She came over at like 10
and like two hours later,

310
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,263
we hid her glasses from her.

311
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:45,974
She freaked out and left.

312
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,823
Who knows what happened 
after that.

313
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,586
I mean, she died, obviously.

314
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:52,075
But you don't know 
anything about that?

315
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,090
If I did, I would tell you.

316
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,234
I'm glad you know.

317
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:07,431
I was wrong not to speak up.

318
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,823
It was your idea though.

319
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,445
To invite Rita to party and razz her.

320
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:13,615
At the time, I thought I was giving her
the keys to the kingdom,

321
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,713
getting her to Brandi 
Beaudry's house.

322
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,907
How's that?

323
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,155
She was the most popular 
girl in school.

324
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:21,228
Rita and I, not so popular.

325
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,943
But when Rita got to the sleepover,
you laid in to her like you planned.

326
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,957
Not like I planned.

327
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,934
I mean, I had no idea.

328
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:32,961
I was JV. 
Those two are varsity bitches.

329
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,853
Boys don't think you're anthing  
if you're fat.

330
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,317
Here. See?

331
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,178
Gross.

332
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,492
Yeah.

333
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,084
Look at her butt.

334
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,187
Ariel, it's your turn

335
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,016
to pick a spot on Rita.

336
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,364
Right here.

337
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,314
Back fat.

338
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:20,465
You have a fat back like your mom.

339
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,824
She's really ugly, no offense.

340
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,816
I don't wanna do this anymore.

341
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,319
Tiffany, way to go.
Now she's pissed.

342
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,640
So?

343
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,832
Did you know there's a rumor 
that  your mom's a slut?

344
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,151
Everybody's saying it.

345
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,120
Explains the marks.

346
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,860
Sick, right?

347
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,395
So what happened after the fat fest?

348
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,671
Rita ran out, didn't come back.

349
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,028
Anyone go after her?

350
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:57,481
- None of us.
- How about Neil?

351
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,293
I didn't see that.
I guess it's possible.

352
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:03,275
I thought Brandi was the ringleader.
Why was Tiffany so nasty?

353
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:06,395
Tiffany's dad and Rita's mom 
had a thing going.

354
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,088
And Tiffany knew about it?

355
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,679
But Rita didn't and 
Tiffany didn't let on.

356
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,908
Maybe she was just waiting 
for the right moment.

357
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:16,903
Why would she sneak out?

358
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,703
And to be with those awful girls.

359
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:21,729
Popularity stuff?

360
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,972
I did have an affair with him.

361
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,979
We thought we were discrete.

362
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,489
I didn't think that Tiffany knew.

363
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,574
Think Tiffany was capable of violence?

364
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,595
I never really got to know her.

365
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:34,203
After Rita, well,

366
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:38,878
married men lose interest in a woman
who can't get out of bed in the morning.

367
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,628
You hear what Tiffany's
doing these days?

368
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:44,441
I only know she was kicked out
of Collegiate in 8th grade.

369
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:46,013
Drinking problem.

370
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:48,208
She was the apple of her dad's eye
before then.

371
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,617
Drinking, that young?

372
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:53,465
Sounds like something threw 
Trixie for a loop.

373
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,158
Detective Valens, Philadelphia PD.

374
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:08,486
Crap.

375
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,752
Well, we know you had it in for Rita.

376
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:17,856
Her mom having that affair 
with your dad.

377
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,928
You ride her hard enough,
she leaves the sleepover.

378
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,205
Then what?

379
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,066
Then nothing.

380
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,580
Follow her into the woods.
Get rid of her at Devil's Pool.

381
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,677
You're way off, sorry.

382
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,438
Now, here's a rich girl from
Chestnut Hill

383
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:36,509
wind up on house arrest 
on Mount Airy after multiple DUI's?

384
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,928
How?

385
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,150
Tequila.

386
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,724
Something went wrong, Tiffany.

387
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,218
- Real wrong.
- That's your opinion.

388
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:48,274
To me, I'm glad I got out 
of Chestnut Hill. / Yeah?

389
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,350
Do me one favor.

390
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,756
Is that bitch Brandi still a bitch?

391
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:57,937
I knew it.

392
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,515
What a bitch.

393
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:08,290
I hated Rita

394
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,281
and her slut mom about
as much as I hated my jackass dad.

395
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,570
But I didn't have it in me to kill her.

396
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,409
No?

397
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,101
Not like they did.

398
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:26,155
Why does Sporto
like the ugly girl?

399
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,227
Claire's much prettier.

400
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,442
It would suck to have red hair.

401
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,163
Rita thinks the nerd is cute.

402
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:38,588
No, I don't.

403
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,426
Give me your glasses.

404
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:44,706
Why? / Cuz I wanna see them.

405
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:55,683
Eww, you're blind.

406
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,207
You have weird eyes 
in real life, no offense.

407
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:02,962
Can I have them back, please.

408
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,429
No.

409
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,335
My parents.
Hide.

410
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,417
Hide!

411
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,460
Hi, there.

412
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,580
What's your name, hun?

413
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,922
Rita Baxter.

414
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,089
Where's your brother?

415
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:35,155
- Asleep.
- Will you get him up?

416
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:37,542
Why?

417
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,422
Holly.

418
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,918
Will you run the bath upstairs?

419
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,042
Sure.

420
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,701
How many people did my daughter 
have over tonight, Rita?

421
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,872
Wall.

422
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,389
How many girls were here?

423
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,841
Um.. just one.

424
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:04,394
Just me.

425
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:06,802
So you're a liar too, Rita.

426
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:13,826
Brandi, you wanna tell your friend
what we do to liars in this house?

427
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,384
The Beaudry's said that they were
out of town that night.

428
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,394
And you believed them,

429
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:25,858
cuz they didn't look the type.

430
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:26,851
What type's that?

431
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:30,078
The lying and beating their kids type.

432
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:31,359
Think they woulda hurt Rita?

433
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,848
I got out of there after that.

434
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,504
But you know things are bad

435
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,082
when the biggest bitch in school

436
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:40,377
looks like she's gonna 
piss in her Calvin's.

437
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,371
Someone's been telling you lies.

438
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:47,825
Yeah, you.

439
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,789
Rita was at your house 
the night she died.

440
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,784
Didn't you think that was 
worth mentioning to the cops?

441
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:55,987
It's my daughter, isn't it?

442
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,940
You talked to her.

443
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:00,411
Well, keep in mind.

444
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:03,475
She's a drug addict and a liar.

445
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,144
Brandi wasn't supposed to have 
friends over unsupervised.

446
00:23:07,144 --> 00:23:09,586
So who got in trouble, 
Brandi or the friend?

447
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,699
I'm sorry if we scared the Baxter girl.

448
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,018
But we didn't touch her.

449
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,481
Our children needed special attention.

450
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,058
Sometimes, yes.

451
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:18,480
We were physical with them.

452
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,570
And other times, 
you were on vacation.

453
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,042
We were afraid of her.

454
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:24,464
When they're really little,

455
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:26,145
you can't tell the difference.

456
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:28,874
Biting, kicking.

457
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,604
And she's older?

458
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:33,522
And it's nothing normal kids stuff.

459
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,223
What's that?

460
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,188
We had a cat.

461
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,409
The nanny came in

462
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,011
and found her wrapping it up in a towel.

463
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:45,290
Brandi said it drowned but

464
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,372
what's the cat doing in a full bath tub.

465
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,622
Right.

466
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,800
She was capable of things

467
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,940
no parent wants to think about.

468
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,123
Like killing Rita?

469
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,330
I have a meeting in 40 minutes 
and this takes 20.

470
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,219
A wash-and-go is gonna 
have to do it today.

471
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,673
I can't have my whole life 
thrown over this.

472
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:16,385
Your parents think you killed Rita.

473
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:22,526
My parents are freaks.

474
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,192
- You gotta stop lying, Brandi.
- What?

475
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:28,452
Your mom and dad came home 
that night, discovered the sleepover.

476
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:30,311
You said they were in the Bahamas.

477
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:33,265
They were always somewhere.
Maybe I got confused.

478
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,682
We know they were violent with you
and Neil when you were kids.

479
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,244
But they said they had to be 
because you

480
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:42,485
were disturbed, hurt things.

481
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:47,977
If they're talking about
that stupid cat..

482
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:51,412
Hurting animals means 
something, Brandi.

483
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,968
I was an angry kid.

484
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,370
Guess why?

485
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:05,939
Tell me about them coming home 
that night.

486
00:25:10,498 --> 00:25:15,707
They didn't like when
I had friends over.

487
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:23,220
Mom.
I told them all to go home.

488
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,320
It's too late, Brandi.
You lied.

489
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,837
Dad, it's not her fault.
I was in charge.

490
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,309
Dad, no.

491
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,272
No, no.

492
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,359
Neil, honey, please.

493
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,316
This is important.

494
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,157
Dad!

495
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:16,754
Dad!

496
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,758
Hold.

497
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,851
Done.

498
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:00,925
She was supposed to go home.

499
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:05,220
I don't know why she came back.

500
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,987
And then my mom saw her.

501
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:11,691
Neil and I were sent to our rooms.

502
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:20,138
And in the morning, she was dead.

503
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:22,417
Thank you.

504
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,213
I know that was hard.

505
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:28,533
No,

506
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,184
I said it a million times in my head.

507
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:40,965
Parents were right about the drugs.

508
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:44,860
Brandi was picked up for forging up
prescription back in July.

509
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,437
Charges were dropped.

510
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:47,769
Dilaudid.

511
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,344
Synthetic morphine.

512
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:51,000
That's heavy self medicating.

513
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,362
And she's the healthy kid.

514
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:53,724
Not the way her parents tell it.

515
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:56,995
Brandi thinks her parents killed Rita
to keep the abuse secret.

516
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:59,729
And they're saying 
she's the violent one.

517
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:01,030
Happy home.

518
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,940
Maybe I'll go talk to Neil.

519
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,827
They moved him to 
Western Psychiatric.

520
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,932
You'll go see Elisa 
while you're there?

521
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:20,656
Nah, it's not the right time.

522
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:26,890
I know what your parents made you
to do to your sister.

523
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,554
The dunkin'.

524
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:29,903
Yeah.

525
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:32,670
That's what you did to Caitlin, right?
You held her down.

526
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,130
I didn't want to hurt her.

527
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:38,584
Then what happened? / I uh...

528
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:43,172
I go every year cuz I miss Rita.

529
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:48,373
And this time I thought I saw her.

530
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,512
But it was Caitlin Gater.

531
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:53,923
I thought she was Rita.
I don't know why.

532
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,574
And you put those marks on this girl

533
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:59,235
like Rita's to kinda recreate her?

534
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:03,859
But this girl didn't care about me.

535
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,116
She was afraid and screamed.

536
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:10,102
I guess I needed her to be quiet and
we were at the water,

537
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:12,902
so I held her down

538
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,319
for too long.

539
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,429
Well, Rita was pushed not held down.

540
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,584
I didn't do that to Rita.

541
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:26,362
She was kind.
I wouldn't hurt her.

542
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:32,788
What about your parents that night?

543
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:36,312
They never left their room 
after we were punished.

544
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:38,193
And Brandi?

545
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,660
She was violent, right?

546
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,330
It was not her fault.

547
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:59,231
What happened after Rita saw you 
in the bathroom?

548
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,421
She tried to save us.

549
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,956
I saw what your parents were doing.

550
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,946
It's wrong.

551
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,426
You should tell another adult.

552
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:28,852
We could go right now 
and tell my mom.

553
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:31,026
She could help us.

554
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:33,144
It's not right.

555
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:35,085
You're not bad.

556
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:39,488
- We could go.
- What are you talking about?

557
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,278
Get out of my room.

558
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,700
You don't have to be embarrassed.

559
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,702
It happens to other kids too.

560
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,463
Brandi.

561
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:52,004
Nothing is happening.

562
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:54,551
Get out of my room, loser.
Get out.

563
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,841
I can help you.

564
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:56,927
We can go to my mom.

565
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:58,300
I don't need your help.

566
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,042
You're a loser.

567
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:02,417
You are dead.

568
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,938
Close the door.

569
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:07,377
Why are you guys still here?

570
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,499
We can't go home.

571
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,998
It's two in the morning.

572
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:13,354
Your parents didn't see us.
We snuck up.

573
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,425
Are you guys in a fight?

574
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:19,722
I hate her and I want her to die.

575
00:31:20,943 --> 00:31:23,363
She needs to die.

576
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,610
Right?

577
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:30,290
Right.

578
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:34,734
Right.

579
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,142
What then, Neil?

580
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,495
They kicked me out

581
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:52,864
and I left her in there

582
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,092
with all of them.

583
00:32:17,063 --> 00:32:18,844
We know one of you killed Rita.

584
00:32:18,844 --> 00:32:21,349
The two of you who didn't
should save yourselves.

585
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,917
You got something to tell.

586
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:30,218
I'm getting a cup of coffee 
and I'll be back.

587
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:33,952
It's better than a reunion, right.

588
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,726
Yeah, I bet they're wishing 
we had an open bar.

589
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,973
You've sure changed.

590
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:47,610
Are they serious?

591
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,820
This doesn't even seem real.

592
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,103
Well, it's not me, clearly.

593
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,942
Oh, clearly?

594
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:58,587
- One of you said something.
- There's nothing to tell.

595
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,217
Ariel's pretty insistent.

596
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:03,346
It was you, wasn't it?

597
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,761
You'd love to see me go down.

598
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,394
I think they can hear us.

599
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:08,715
Middle school's over.

600
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:10,491
I'm not hung up about you anymore.

601
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,866
Tiffany's got something.

602
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,863
- Are you threatening her?
- It's okay.

603
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:16,240
I mean, look at her.

604
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,421
She's just sad.

605
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:20,740
Guess what, bitch.

606
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,314
Time to buy a diary. Cuz I'm not
keeping your secrets anymore.

607
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:25,657
Shut up.

608
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:29,929
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Tiffany, sit down.

609
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,720
Ah, they're good and ready now.

610
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,345
I'll pull Tiffany.

611
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,628
Those two your best pals, huh?

612
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:41,867
Brandi and Ariel.

613
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,610
Friggin' time warp in there.

614
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,256
Haven't changed much?

615
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,774
Shows you what crap taste you have
in friends when you're 12.

616
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:50,531
You're different though.

617
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,937
Ain't buying in to the games.

618
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:57,288
I'm the only sane one of the three,

619
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,321
not perfect though.

620
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:02,881
Whatever you did, 
bet it wasn't as bad as them.

621
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:07,871
They get their perfect lives. Me,

622
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:12,286
I'm innocent and I get wrecked.

623
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,375
That's cause I'm the one 
who saw her face.

624
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:25,919
Well?
We could poison her.

625
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:30,030
Or hang her. I learned knots
at sailing.

626
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:32,062
I think I better go home.

627
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:34,095
Guard the door.
She'll get out.

628
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,519
This is lame.

629
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,189
When can we do ouija board?

630
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:39,103
After we kill her.

631
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,062
Blood sisters.

632
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:46,220
Right.

633
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:48,648
Eww.

634
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,135
You have to.

635
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:52,077
It's a pact.

636
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:55,005
Ok, you're crazy.

637
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:59,470
This is seriously the worst sleepover
I've ever been to in my entire life.

638
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,441
You can't leave.

639
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:05,670
- Brandi wants to make a pact.
- Ariel, get over it.

640
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,548
Rita, come on. / No.

641
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:10,430
She's ours.

642
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,560
Whatever.

643
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:26,714
I wasn't gonna go home.

644
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:27,813
But?

645
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,744
I went downstairs

646
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:36,331
and I met the love of my young life

647
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:38,344
on adult's liquor cabinet.

648
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,271
I drank whatever was open.

649
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:45,363
And right before I passed out,
I thought,

650
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:48,864
I gotta start hanging out 
with boys instead.

651
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,986
This is killing me.

652
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:05,094
Brandi's jonesing.

653
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:06,727
Time for her afternoon dose.

654
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:10,051
Why's she looking for it 
in Ariel's purse?

655
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:16,015
You need a doctor to get Dilaudid.

656
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:17,781
Ariel's a doctor.

657
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:18,848
Yeah.

658
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:22,143
She could lose her license 
for prescribing to addicts.

659
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:23,710
Why is she doing it?

660
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,959
Old time's sake.

661
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:28,995
Think Brandi may have 
a specific old time in mind.

662
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,970
You look like you could 
use some fresh air.

663
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,985
Yeah.

664
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,277
Junkies generally don't like 
these windowless rooms.

665
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:45,237
What do you want?

666
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,114
- Ariel's your supplier, isn't she?
- What?

667
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:50,336
Well, that connection dries up
right here and now.

668
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,544
You tell me what you got on her,

669
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:54,385
you can go home and gobble up
the rest of what she gave you.

670
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,804
That's crazy.

671
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:58,139
What are you Brandi, loyal?

672
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,684
You're a survivor.

673
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,645
You take what you need from people

674
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:03,652
then lose them when 
they're not useful anymore.

675
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:09,573
And I'm telling you, 
Ariel's tabbed out.

676
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,536
What do you wanna know?

677
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:17,644
What happened to Rita after Tiffany
left her with you two?

678
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:20,342
I got bored, said good night.

679
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,876
Tiffany can't say anything.

680
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:31,349
She'll be in a bigger trouble as us.

681
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,743
I don't care.

682
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:34,664
It's over. / What?

683
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,658
I think you should go home 
with that loser.

684
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,556
Me?
No, why?

685
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,101
I wanna stay.

686
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:41,724
Because we're not friends anymore.

687
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:43,703
No offense but I thought you were cool.

688
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:45,259
You're not.

689
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:46,913
You two are better off as friends.

690
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,578
I don't wanna be her friend.

691
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:50,691
I wanna be your friend.

692
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,312
You're the one who brought her here
and she ruined the sleepover.

693
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:56,707
I want you two losers to leave 
my house. / But..

694
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,177
Get out.

695
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,063
Don't sit with us at lunch anymore.

696
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,625
A minute later when 
I looked out the window,

697
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:20,215
they were cutting through
the back yard heading to the woods.

698
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:25,443
I could hear Ariel crying from 
all the way up from my room.

699
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:27,160
It's just a lunch table.

700
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,912
Talk about crazy.

701
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:35,184
What are you looking at?

702
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:37,651
Nothing.

703
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,767
What'd you think would happen 
when you got caught?

704
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:48,530
Sorry?

705
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,219
You tell the hospital's a mistake?

706
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:56,157
You had no idea 
Brandi Beaudry was an addict.

707
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:58,069
She just told you she was in pain.

708
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,403
She is in pain.

709
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,613
Her life...

710
00:39:04,913 --> 00:39:07,397
You can't imagine.

711
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,754
How long she been making 
you do things for her?

712
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:13,521
It's just a favor that got mixed up.

713
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,577
It was blackmail, Ariel.

714
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,109
Always has been.

715
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:19,219
Because she knows what you did.

716
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,601
No.

717
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:41,198
Do you hate me?

718
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:46,073
It doesn't matter what I think of you.

719
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,965
She was just a little kid.

720
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:54,304
But I was just a little kid too.

721
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:57,473
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

722
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:02,579
I didn't know you'd live through it.

723
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,377
My life is over.

724
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,240
We'll be home soon.

725
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,630
I don't want to go home.

726
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,643
So what if she thinks we're losers?

727
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,714
We'll be losers through Junior High.

728
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:21,052
I don't care.

729
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,240
My mom says

730
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,423
everybody who's ever been 
anything in the world was a loser.

731
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,657
I care.

732
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:30,321
Just because you don't 
why do I have to suffer?

733
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:34,944
In 6 years, we'll be in college
and my mom said we'll be cool.

734
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,709
I can't wait for college.

735
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,348
6 years?

736
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:39,736
My god.

737
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:43,232
Brandi's gonna hate me for 6 years.

738
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,212
So what if those idiot girls
don't like you?

739
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:48,685
That's not what matters in this world.

740
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:51,420
It's better to be smart 
and different like us.

741
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,629
No.

742
00:40:52,629 --> 00:40:54,841
I don't want to be like us.

743
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:59,090
But Ariel, in college 
we'll be considered cool.

744
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,238
And...

745
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:06,140
maybe before that we could
be best friends to each other,

746
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,423
if you want.

747
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,790
No.
