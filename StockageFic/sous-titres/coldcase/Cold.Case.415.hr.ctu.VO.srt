1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,317
* Come gather 'round, people,
wherever you roam *

2
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:13,450
* And admit that the waters
around you have grown *

3
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:18,484
* And accept it that soon
you'll be drenched to the bone *

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,851
* If your time to you
is worth saving *

5
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,283
* Then you better start swimming
or you'll sink like a stone *

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,951
* For the times
they are a-changing... *

7
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,984
Honestly, Z, was there a party
where you didn't drop trou ?

8
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,484
Question is why ?
It's elfin.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,917
Can't even see it.

10
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,884
Exactly.

11
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:46,617
Bobby Kennedy,
eat your heart out.

12
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,884
I will pay you $100 to
destroy that. I'm not kidding.

13
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,584
Uh-uh.

14
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:02,217
Ow ! Looking sexy, sweetie.

15
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:04,118
Just what
the doctor likes.

16
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:06,084
Uh... sweetie,
that's Sara.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,851
Oops.

18
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:08,984
Really ?

19
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:12,784
We looked alike
once upon a time.

20
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,018
We still do.
You're just prettier.

21
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,384
First six months

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,051
I knew these two,
thought they were sisters.

23
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:19,784
'Cause you were on acid
your entire freshman year.

24
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:24,917
Come on, guys.
Z wasn't always on acid.

25
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,717
Yeah. I switched to mushrooms
sophomore year.

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,517
How much longer you going
to torture us, Jack ?

27
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,617
Oh, I love
these pictures.

28
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:34,118
Reminds me of the freedom
of our college days.

29
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,717
How we all met.

30
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:36,917
I'd go back in a heartbeat.

31
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,183
Yeah ?

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,584
Uh-huh. Back then,
I had so much time.

33
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,250
Spent it with you guys.
And now...

34
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:44,417
Work people.

35
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,118
Bills people. Commute people.

36
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:47,283
Voted-for-Reagan people.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,584
Hey.

38
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,550
McBride.

39
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,150
Sorry.

40
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,150
I don't know how
that one got in there.

41
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:05,118
* Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command... *

42
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:08,851
I guess the
show is over.

43
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:14,584
* Please get out of the new one
if you can't lend your hand *

44
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,851
* Oh, they times
they are a-changing. *

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,018
Johanna ? Everything all right ?

46
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:28,717
Morning, boss.

47
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:30,550
Louie.

48
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:33,084
Hey, Rush, long time.

49
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,384
Looking good.

50
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,217
Back at ya, Louie.

51
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:42,550
Couple named Jack and Johanna
Kimball died here in 1981.

52
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,450
It looked like
an accidental
gas leak explosion.

53
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,884
Yeah, "looked" being
the operative word.

54
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,217
Blast from the stove

55
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,317
ripped through a portion
of the kitchen floor.

56
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:54,650
Debris fell behind
the basement drywall.

57
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,251
Did the owner
find something ?

58
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:59,583
Construction foreman did
while doing renovations.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,784
Fragments of a pipe cap...

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,518
and melted battery.

61
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,750
Talking bomb ?

62
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:07,950
A bomb specifically designed

63
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,950
to mimic a gas explosion.

64
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,418
That's why they didn't find
anything back in '81 ?

65
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,317
Yep.

66
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:14,951
Can't find what you're
not looking for, right ?

67
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,951
Battery was used for
a triggering device ? Bingo.

68
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:21,384
What kind of couple were these two ?

69
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,751
Clean-cut. Upwardly mobile.

70
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,617
And blown to bits.

71
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,300
One-page report.

72
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,133
Bodies blasted to smithereens.

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,467
Nothing we don't know.

74
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:12,567
The Kimballs met at Penn,
got married in 1973.

75
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:13,968
Jack was an ad copywriter.

76
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,234
Johanna was a corporate lawyer.

77
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,901
No kids.

78
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:18,834
All work and no play.

79
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,400
Young couple

80
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,100
making a lot of money,
settled into the Main Line.

81
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,133
1981.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,501
First wave of yuppies.

83
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,033
College friend named Sara Lowell
paid for their funerals.

84
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Lil and Scotty
are starting there.

85
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:34,267
Excuse me.

86
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:36,667
Hey, Janie.

87
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:37,834
Hey, Dad.

88
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:40,484
Hey, Sean, how ya doing ?

89
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,484
Okay.

90
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,718
What do you got there ?

91
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:43,950
Avatar Aang.

92
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,384
He can bend air.

93
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:46,818
Is that right ?

94
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,050
Go wait in
Grampa's office, sweetie.

95
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,617
I'll be right there.

96
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,400
You okay, Janie ?

97
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,200
Yeah.

98
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,767
No.

99
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,500
I was wondering if you could
take Sean for a couple of days.

100
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,500
Mom's in Florida.

101
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,600
Sure, sure.

102
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,168
Carl and I need a night
together to talk.

103
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,834
Something happen ?

104
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,200
No. We've just become strangers
who live in the same house.

105
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,534
Janie, I know I'm the last
person to give advice on this...

106
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,534
Good, bad, whatever it is.

107
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,068
Don't leave anything left unsaid.

108
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:24,734
I won't.

109
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,701
You sure you can handle Sean ?

110
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:30,567
I could handle you, right ?

111
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,084
These flowers
are beautiful, Sara.

112
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,250
What are they ?

113
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,917
Cattleya orchids.

114
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,018
Rely on other shoots to bloom.

115
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:04,851
My mom always said they symbolized

116
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,450
the strength of family.

117
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:08,118
Hmm, pretty.
Thank you.

118
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:10,417
Any thoughts on who'd want
to hurt Jack or Johanna ?

119
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:11,784
None.

120
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:15,350
They were a young,
happy couple, no enemies.

121
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,584
So when'd you last see them ?

122
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:17,617
They hosted a...

123
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,118
a college reunion weekend.

124
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,317
We left on Saturday.

125
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:23,217
Next night they were dead.

126
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:25,450
Reunion ?

127
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,018
Fun times ?

128
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,183
Well, there was lots of partying
and talking into the night.

129
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,617
Like the old days.

130
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,751
You didn't have

131
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:32,751
such a wonderful time ?

132
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:37,751
I was... still kind of stuck
in my old hippie ways.

133
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,217
Didn't fit very well
into the decade of greed.

134
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,717
Jack and Johanna,
they hippies, too,

135
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,250
back in the day ?

136
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,651
No, I was the hippie.

137
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:47,250
They were the true activists.

138
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,183
The height of the Vietnam War.

139
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,217
They were protesting against

140
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,250
an America that had become

141
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,484
an imperialist bully.

142
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,917
Sounds vaguely familiar.

143
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:56,984
Capitalism

144
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,450
was a dirty word for us in '71.

145
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:00,350
And in '81 ?

146
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,384
For some of us

147
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,217
not so dirty anymore.

148
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:08,751
(Bob Dylan's "All Along
the Watchtower" playing)

149
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,250
300 watts a channel.

150
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,283
Nice.

151
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,784
How much ?

152
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:17,450
I try not to dwell on that.

153
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,317
Why ? Don't feel guilty.
You earned it.

154
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:21,484
By writing candy bar slogans.

155
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,717
Remember when we wanted our
talents to serve a purpose ?

156
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,183
Purpose is for Cub Scouts.

157
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,984
Hey, I just turned that down.

158
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:31,984
It's still too loud.

159
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,051
Neighbors ?

160
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,084
It's Friday night.

161
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,984
You're not ready for bed.

162
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,984
I didn't say that.

163
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,450
Refill ?

164
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,484
At your service.

165
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,817
Sara ? You want something ?

166
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:45,018
I think I'll join you.

167
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,784
Remember that summer
freshman year ?

168
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:58,384
You visited me.
My parents were gone.

169
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,150
Feels like yesterday.

170
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,183
Yesterday being 12 years ago.

171
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,651
I know. I think about
those days too much.

172
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,051
What are you doing ?

173
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,617
Fixing your hair. Relax.

174
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:20,283
Well, fix it in front
of Jack next time.

175
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,951
All right, don't
put on airs with me.

176
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,250
Excuse me ?

177
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:24,817
You're a long way

178
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:27,183
from that one-bedroom
apartment in Newark.

179
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,517
Grow up, Porter.

180
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,884
Stop acting like you just
stepped off the Mayflower.

181
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,684
Your dad was a plumber.

182
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:35,851
You know, isn't it ironic

183
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,018
that you work for
a military contractor ?

184
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:41,183
What's that supposed to mean ?

185
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,350
I wonder
what your boss would say

186
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,018
if he knew
what you did in college.

187
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,584
I take it back.

188
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,817
You haven't changed a bit.

189
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:48,884
You're still
a manipulative bitch.

190
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,784
I drive by your office
all the time.

191
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,517
Maybe I'll stop in
and say hi.

192
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,784
You ever go
near my workplace,

193
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:59,250
it'll be the
last thing you do.

194
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,617
* ...A wildcat did growl *

195
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:08,717
* Two riders were approaching *

196
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:13,350
* The wind began to howl *

197
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,550
What was Johanna talking about ?

198
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,684
I'm not sure.

199
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,118
It was...
it was very complicated

200
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,517
between those two.

201
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:21,517
Complicated how ?

202
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,051
Well, they used to date

203
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:24,884
before Johanna
broke it off for Jack.

204
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,283
I don't think Porter

205
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,651
ever got over her.

206
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,217
He show up at the funeral ?

207
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:32,484
I paid for it, but I didn't go.

208
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,317
I wanted to remember
Jack and Johanna

209
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,651
as they were.

210
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,051
I never saw any of them

211
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:40,517
again after that weekend.

212
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,267
First Johanna dumps
you and disses you.

213
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,834
Pissed you off pretty bad.

214
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,100
She had some dirt on you.

215
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,767
Maybe you stopped her
from talking.

216
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,634
I'd never hurt Johanna, never.

217
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:54,067
Funny.

218
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,801
You're still not telling us
what she had on you.

219
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,834
Fine.

220
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,300
We were caught

221
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,634
by campus security
one drunken night our freshman year.

222
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,767
For doing what ?

223
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,834
Breaking into Penn's
ROTC headquarters,

224
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,000
smashing it up
with a baseball bat.

225
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,601
Ten years later

226
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,000
you're working for a company
with huge military contracts.

227
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,934
Let me guess.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,467
This little ROTC incident
wasn't on your resume ?

229
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,133
What do you think, Einstein ?

230
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,968
I think you should
answer "yes" or "no."

231
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:20,767
That all she had on you ?

232
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,434
Yes.

233
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:24,501
Why do I know you're lying ?

234
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:25,868
Porter.

235
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,801
You're a suspect
in a double homicide.

236
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,133
We'll dig deep

237
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
into your background,
leave no stone unturned.

238
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,133
We're much more sympathetic

239
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,667
to suspects that do
the digging for us.

240
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,601
Look, we were
wanna-be Che Guevaras

241
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,000
out to change the world.

242
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,467
So ?

243
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,267
It's not what
Johanna had on me.

244
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:46,033
It's what Z
had on all of us.

245
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,400
(Bob Dylan's
"Ballad of a Thin Man" playing)

246
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,634
Hide the children !

247
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,834
You're gonna wash
that seat off,

248
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:00,501
right, Z ?

249
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,734
It ain't any bigger
in real life, pal.

250
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,334
* You say "Who is that man ?" *

251
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,567
Enough, Z.

252
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:11,868
I got neighbors.

253
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,334
Now we care about what
the neighbors think, Jack ?

254
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,367
Yeah.
Yeah, 'cause I'm the schmuck

255
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,734
with a nude houseguest
riding a bike.

256
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:26,701
* Something is happening here *

257
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,901
* But you don't know
what it is *

258
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:32,267
* Do you *

259
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,968
* Mr. Jones ? *

260
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,767
Knock it off, Z.

261
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:40,467
* You don't know what it is *

262
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:44,434
* Do you, Mr. Jones ? *

263
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,133
You want to say something to me ?

264
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,701
Used to be my hero, Jack.

265
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,434
Your words inspired me.

266
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,868
All of us.

267
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,767
What about the plans we had, man ?

268
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,701
Was it ever about the cause, Jack ?

269
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,033
Or was it just about

270
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,601
you hearing yourself talk ?

271
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,801
Go to hell.

272
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:12,601
I'll see you there.

273
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,601
Mr. Jones.

274
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,334
* You hand in your ticket *

275
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,234
* And you go watch the geek *

276
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,334
* Who immediately
walks up to you *

277
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,701
Mr. Jones ? Jones Family.

278
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,400
Radical underground student group

279
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,801
in the '70s.

280
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:38,467
Espoused violence for a change.

281
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,334
I heard of them
when I was on patrol.

282
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,501
Like the Weathermen.

283
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,934
Used to plant bombs
in public places

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,300
to protest the Vietnam War.

285
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,834
Violence to end wars.
Makes sense.

286
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,501
Jack was a member ?

287
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,167
We all kind of were.
Went to a few meetings, but...

288
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:54,067
I thought they were all nuts.

289
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,067
Bombing for peace was like
humping for virginity.

290
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,200
Just a few meetings ?

291
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,400
That's it.

292
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:08,467
FBI sent over photos
of the Jones Family Philly headquarters.

293
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,000
See what Porter's
definition of a few is.

294
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,601
Miller. In here. Now.

295
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,901
What's up ?

296
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,400
How in the hell do you open
this thing ?

297
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,567
There's this new device
called a straw.

298
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,501
Straw ?

299
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,901
I didn't see that.

300
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:42,467
Why don't you let the
four-year-old show you ?

301
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,334
Hey, Sean, how about
some juice, buddy ?

302
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Sure.

303
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:55,501
You wanna go interview a murder
suspect or something, boss ?

304
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,467
Calm yourself down ?

305
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:03,100
FBI surveillance photos.
The Jones Family.

306
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,367
Porter's full of it.

307
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:07,167
They were at a lot of meetings.

308
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,367
Not Sara, though.

309
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,334
No FBI files on any
of them specifically.

310
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,167
Either they really only
attended meetings...

311
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,234
Or they were never caught
blowing something up.

312
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, one of them
was handy with bombs.

313
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,501
What do you got ?
College files.

314
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,334
Z took out
a lot of student loans.

315
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,767
Paid them off
working summers

316
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,234
at Helm Drilling & Blasting,
big construction company.

317
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,133
Blasting ?

318
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,801
Z worked demolition.

319
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,300
Peace-loving hippie
was an expert

320
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,367
with explosive devices.

321
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:40,101
where were you in '71 ?

322
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,500
Year out of the Air Force.
Worked a foot beat.

323
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,034
Any run-ins with these
Jones Family punks ?

324
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:48,001
Nah, worked crowd control
at some protest marches.

325
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,767
Thousands gathered right here.

326
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:52,434
These kids ever go to class ?

327
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,101
Who has time for class
when there's a
revolution going on ?

328
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,068
Revolution, my ass.

329
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,600
Takes a silver spoon to
have so much time to protest.

330
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,767
Most college kids' hearts
were in the right place.

331
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:05,767
My uncle served
two tours in Vietnam.

332
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,267
Yeah ?
Yeah.

333
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,934
Got home, walked
through the airport,

334
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,867
and two of those good-hearted
college students

335
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,901
threw eggs in his face.

336
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,801
Complicated times, Nick.

337
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,901
Just like today.

338
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,934
(Bob Dylan's "Thunder on the
Mountain" playing on radio)

339
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:25,434
Professor Zimmerman ?

340
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,634
* Today is the day,
gonna grab my trombone... *

341
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,967
To what do I owe the honor,
detectives ?

342
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,300
How'd you know who we are ?

343
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,834
Oh, it's a talent I've long had.

344
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,233
For spotting guys that
are gonna ruin your day ?

345
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,034
Philly Homicide.

346
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,667
Got a few questions about
Jack and Johanna Kimball.

347
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,300
Jack and Johanna ?

348
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,500
Turns out they were
murdered back in '81.

349
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,267
Accidental explosion
was really a bomb

350
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,834
planted behind
their kitchen stove.

351
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,634
Reminiscent of what
you and your pals

352
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,101
in the Jones Family used to do.

353
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:58,333
I... I can't believe this.

354
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,901
Understand you
knew a thing

355
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,734
or two about explosives.

356
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,367
And you were in a fight
with Jack at your little

357
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,434
reunion party ?

358
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,367
Jack and I... we worked it out.

359
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,534
Yeah ? Where were you
the night he died ?

360
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
I was already home.

361
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,834
Alone ?
Yeah.

362
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:14,867
Great alibi, Z.

363
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:15,967
Did the butler do it, too ?

364
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,034
Look, um...

365
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:21,534
if anyone had a problem
with Jack that weekend...

366
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,233
it was Sara.

367
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,333
(Bob Dylan's "Positively
4th Street" playing)

368
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,367
* You got a lotta nerve *

369
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,034
* To say you are... *

370
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:37,168
I'm sorry I rode
your bicycle naked

371
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,834
in a Ronald
Reagan mask, Jack.

372
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,734
Forget it.

373
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,867
Wouldn't be a party
without seeing your ass.

374
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,467
I miss you, man.
That's all.

375
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,400
I miss how it used
to be with all of us.

376
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,168
So do I.

377
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,967
You know what
I'm gonna do ?

378
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:57,001
What are you gonna do ?

379
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,068
When I go home tomorrow...

380
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:02,333
I'm gonna propose
to my girlfriend.

381
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,068
Well, I thought you didn't
believe in the archaic,

382
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:07,901
oppressive bonds of marriage.

383
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,567
Oh, you and Johanna
make it so cool.

384
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:13,767
With Jo, it's kind of easy.

385
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,801
You learn to love
the little things.

386
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,300
Need some help, Sara ?

387
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,567
Sara !
What did you...

388
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,333
I should have it, too.
What you and Johanna have.

389
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,200
What are you talking about ?

390
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:37,901
McBride was the only person
who ever loved me.

391
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,101
And you killed him.

392
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,934
Sara... I...
I am sorry.

393
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,934
I thought I could move on.

394
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,434
I tried so hard.

395
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,034
You guys have made something
of your lives.

396
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,567
If I died,

397
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,434
if I vanished off the face
of the earth tomorrow,

398
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,467
no one would even notice.

399
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You're the one who should be
dead, Jack, not McBride.

400
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:11,434
* ...don't know to begin with *

401
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:17,901
* You see me on the street... *

402
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,101
Who's McBride ?
Miss Sara's boyfriend.

403
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,567
He was a gung-ho radical

404
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,734
who was inspired
by Jack's political writings.

405
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,333
Anything specific ?

406
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,967
Jack had a catchphrase
that caught on:

407
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,300
"Peace at any cost."

408
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,034
Meaning violence was okay ?
Yep.

409
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,801
At the time,
Penn's Science Center

410
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:38,400
had a defense contract
with the government.

411
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:41,400
McBride got a little
carried away.

412
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,734
How so ?

413
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:46,767
Well, he blew himself up
planting a bomb there.

414
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,600
Your boyfriend died,
and you blamed Jack.

415
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,567
Ten years later
you finally made him pay.

416
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,767
Ten years later
I was a mess.

417
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,034
I didn't have

418
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,034
the strength to get out of bed.

419
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,600
Maybe you called an old friend

420
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,200
in the Jones Family
to do it for you.

421
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:09,101
The Jones Family ? I was a pacifist.

422
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,001
Didn't believe in that.

423
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,434
But your boyfriend did.

424
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,867
McBride was a gentle soul.

425
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,701
He was the kindest guy
I ever met. Doesn't sound like

426
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,134
the kind of guy who could blow
up a building on his own.

427
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,001
McBride had help, didn't he ?

428
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,233
The bombing was Jack's idea.

429
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,434
He recruited McBride.

430
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,701
They were all in on it.

431
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:38,701
Who was ?

432
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,333
Jack... Porter...

433
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,134
Johanna, Z.

434
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,134
They were all in the Science
Center when it went off.

435
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,734
What about you ?

436
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,367
They kept me in the dark.
I didn't know until later.

437
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,867
That's some secret.

438
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:58,367
We were all dying inside.

439
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,767
Jack was the only one...

440
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,101
who couldn't live with it anymore.

441
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:07,267
(Bob Dylan's "Knockin
on Heaven's Door" playing)

442
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,634
* Ooh *

443
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,567
* Ooh *

444
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:20,934
What happened ?

445
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,333
What happened is that ten years
ago, we killed someone.

446
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,701
Jack.
What happened...

447
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,734
...is that none of us
can live with it.

448
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,233
Look at Sara.

449
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,333
Can't get up in the morning
without a pill.

450
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,467
Z dulling the pain with booze.

451
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,034
Me ?

452
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:39,967
Trying to buy peace of mind
with BMWs and trips to Aspen.

453
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,101
That's brilliant, Dr. Freud.

454
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,534
It's the truth.

455
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,734
Fact is, that's really why

456
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,567
I brought us all together.

457
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:50,867
You put McBride's slide
in there on purpose ?

458
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,901
Maybe I did.

459
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,300
We promised never, ever
to talk about this again.

460
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,200
Guess I'm breaking that promise.

461
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,134
Two weeks ago I got a call
from McBride's dad.

462
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,267
Uh... hello, Jack.

463
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,467
Roger McBride again.

464
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,867
I can't seem to reach you.

465
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:15,333
Anyway, it's ten years
since we lost my boy,

466
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,901
and I've been thinking about you.

467
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,600
He really looked up to you, Jack.

468
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:24,068
I think a part of his spirit
lives in you,

469
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,134
and that comforts me.

470
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,834
I'll never understand
why he did it.

471
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:34,500
He was my only son.

472
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,367
Time doesn't heal a damn thing.

473
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:40,634
It only makes it worse.

474
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,500
I haven't called him back.

475
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,667
I'm not sure what I'd say.

476
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,667
Maybe, um...

477
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,267
"Hey, Mr. McBride,

478
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,734
"your son's death
was actually my fault.

479
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,001
"I took a clean-cut kid
and made a killer

480
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,001
out of him."

481
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,434
Please stop this.
He died

482
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,168
in my arms, and then I
ran away like a coward.

483
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:04,200
Washed his blood
off my jeans

484
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:05,767
like it was dirt.

485
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:09,034
Can you ever forgive me ?

486
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,134
I'm sorry,

487
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,034
but McBride knew the risks.
He never

488
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,134
would've been there if I hadn't
planned the whole thing.

489
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,467
We can't change

490
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:19,467
the past.

491
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,333
But we can change the future.

492
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,667
The only way we're gonna heal

493
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,567
is if the truth comes out.

494
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,967
The truth means we go to jail.

495
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,467
* Ooh, ooh, ooh... *

496
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,300
Monday morning...

497
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,168
I'm going to the cops.

498
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:36,300
* Ma, take this badge
off of me *

499
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:45,400
* I can't use it anymore... *

500
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,801
That was Saturday.

501
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,267
We all left that night.
And Sunday

502
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,267
he was dead ?

503
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,333
It looks like one

504
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,767
of you went back to shut him up.

505
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,400
Well, I was proud of him.

506
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,734
Well, you had nothing to lose.

507
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,233
You weren't directly involved

508
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,801
in McBride's death.

509
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,967
Leaves Porter and Z.

510
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,267
The boy closed the window.

511
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,734
"Then the boy
closed his eyes.

512
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,134
And outside..."

513
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,068
"The barn and all
the animals slept."

514
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,434
That's right.

515
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,200
Now, time for some shut-eye.

516
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,233
I don't wanna sleep.

517
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
I want to go home.

518
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,467
Oh, you gotta

519
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:31,867
stay here tonight, pal.

520
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,168
Why ?

521
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,467
Because your mom and dad

522
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:35,467
are having a date.

523
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:36,701
Why ?

524
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,400
It's grown-up stuff.

525
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,467
Time to hit the hay.

526
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
How come Gramma Rita

527
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,667
doesn't live here ?

528
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,267
Gramma Rita's happy
where she is.

529
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,200
Why ?

530
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:59,701
Well...

531
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:03,934
Gramma Rita always used
to wonder when I'd be home,

532
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,600
where I was.

533
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,267
It made her sad.

534
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,967
And now it's easier

535
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,467
for Gramma Rita.

536
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:16,034
She doesn't have to worry
and be sad because...

537
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:19,667
because she doesn't have to wait
for me anymore.

538
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,034
Now,

539
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,534
how 'bout

540
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,667
we both get some sleep ?

541
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,534
Can you read it to me again ?

542
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,500
I just read it to you twice, pal.

543
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,901
One more time.
Please.

544
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,500
All right.

545
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,200
"The sun came up

546
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,034
and the rooster crowed..."

547
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,434
We got Z and Porter
in separate rooms.

548
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:57,967
Oh, play them
against each other,

549
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,834
then pick the right time
to shine the light.

550
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,501
What, talk a deal ?

551
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,701
ADA Thomas said she's willing
to take Involuntary on McBride

552
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:06,167
if one of them confesses
to the Kimball job.

553
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,834
Got it.

554
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,067
Well, legally the DA
can't lie to a suspect.

555
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:11,933
Ah, but we can.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,334
I love this job.

557
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,067
Janie.
Hey, Dad.

558
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:22,734
Sean get off to school okay ?

559
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,167
Ah, piece of cake.

560
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,667
How many times did he get you
to read The Barnyard ?

561
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:27,667
Twice.

562
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:28,834
Then he knew it was bedtime.

563
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,067
So, uh...

564
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,100
How'd things go ?

565
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
After you and Mom,
I promised myself

566
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,434
I would never do this to Sean.

567
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,634
You were so young...

568
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,667
You remember that, Janie ?

569
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,367
I never forgot.

570
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,367
Well, sometimes
it's not so simple.

571
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,434
It's not your fault.

572
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,434
I know.

573
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,933
So, how many times did you
really read him the book ?

574
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:08,200
Fell asleep on the fifth.

575
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:15,334
Tell us more about
your pal, McBride.

576
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,801
I already told you
everything I know.

577
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:21,134
Porter says you and McBride
planted that bomb together.

578
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,467
Understand you were friends
with Paul McBride.

579
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:24,967
Sara's boyfriend ?

580
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:28,234
Your pal Z says you and McBride
planted a bomb together.

581
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
You're going down for McBride
right now.

582
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,933
Unless...

583
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,933
Unless you come clean
about the Kimballs' murder.

584
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,134
Talk now or you'll be trading in
your six-bedroom house

585
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,667
for a six-by-nine cell.

586
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,534
Jack was going to the cops
about McBride.

587
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,501
I wanted to stop him.

588
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,701
We all did.

589
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:49,067
So you killed him.
No.

590
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,134
I tried to reason with him.

591
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:54,634
You're gonna shove us

592
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,434
under a bus
to end your real guilt.

593
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:57,567
My "real guilt ?

594
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,933
The fact that you peddle
Yummy Bars

595
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,134
to pay the mortgage.

596
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,900
It's felony murder, Jack.

597
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,000
We could go away for a long time.

598
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,401
Yeah, prison
with hard-core murderers.

599
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,567
You wanna repent ?

600
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:07,801
Do it on your own time.

601
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:09,134
It's 1981.

602
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
No one has sympathy
for what we were trying

603
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,167
to accomplish in '71.

604
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:13,334
We ?

605
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,567
The whole plan was Jack's idea.

606
00:28:14,634 --> 00:28:15,868
Let's not forget that.

607
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,200
Well,

608
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,000
I think Jack's right.
Well, how brave

609
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,634
of you, seeing as you've got
nothing at stake here.

610
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,701
We owe it to McBride
to tell the truth.

611
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:23,900
Guess what, Sara ?

612
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,167
When you weren't around,
your precious love

613
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,967
was bagging every hot art major
on campus,

614
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,868
so spare me his sainthood.

615
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,134
That's not necessary, Porter.

616
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,067
She wanted truth; she can suck on it.

617
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:41,801
Johanna, what do you think ?

618
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:46,033
Remember how we used
to solve our disputes ?

619
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,200
Simple vote.

620
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,634
True democracy.

621
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:51,434
Don't you still believe
in that, Jack ?

622
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,000
Fine.

623
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,367
"Yes,"

624
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,467
we turn ourselves in;

625
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:06,634
"No," we never discuss this again.

626
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,634
Sounds good.

627
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:11,834
Jack, I assume
you're a still a "yes" ?

628
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Yes.

629
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,868
Yes. We turn ourselves in.

630
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,100
No way, Jose.

631
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,467
I second that.

632
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:29,933
That's two "no"s, two "yes."

633
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,634
Jo, you're the deciding vote.

634
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:40,768
No.

635
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,367
What ?

636
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:45,334
I'm saying we don't go to the cops.

637
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,933
I say we bury this forever,

638
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,300
once and for all.

639
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:01,634
And with that, it was over.

640
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:05,033
And you all went
on your merry way ?

641
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,967
Well, it wasn't merry.

642
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,367
I'll tell you that.

643
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,868
We were just glad it was over.

644
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:14,033
And Jack was gonna abide
by the vote ?

645
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,401
No way. No, not that guy.

646
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,134
What are you hiding, Z ?

647
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,234
I got nothing to hide.

648
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,933
The fact is...

649
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,933
Jack still couldn't let it go.

650
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,267
(Bob Dylan's "Simple Twist
of Fate" playing)

651
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:35,768
What we did, Jo,

652
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,367
it's killing us all.

653
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,667
Can't you see that ?

654
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,401
And this is how
we help each other ?

655
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:44,167
I told Sara she can stay
with us for a while.

656
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,534
She needs us.

657
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,434
And we need to face what we did.

658
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,033
McBride is dead.

659
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
And it's awful

660
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,033
and I'm sorry for his father,

661
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,401
but there's nothing we can
do to bring him back.

662
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:56,401
But we can bring ourselves back.

663
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:59,501
Jack, you might be
right about the others.

664
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,067
But I'm happy...

665
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:03,367
with all that we have,
with who we are.

666
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:05,434
Jo, Jo...
I've fought so hard to get here, Jack.

667
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,467
I can't start again.

668
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,967
I can't go back to being
the poor kid with nothing.

669
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:14,501
* And wished
that he'd gone straight *

670
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,334
* And watched out... *

671
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:19,300
Remember what my mom used to say
about the cattleyas ?

672
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:23,768
I know. Family.

673
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah.

674
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:29,267
What about the family
that we wanted to start ?

675
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,933
Jack, we're finally ready.

676
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200
I can't start
anything right now.

677
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,701
That is the problem.

678
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,134
You saying you don't love me ?

679
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,134
No, I'm saying that I
have to make this right.

680
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,868
Even if that means going to jail ?

681
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,900
Never seeing each other again.

682
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:54,300
* A saxophone someplace
far off played *

683
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,567
* And she was walking on
by the arcade *

684
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,033
* As the light bust through... *

685
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
But you're sure...

686
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:01,634
Johanna said that
about the orchids ?

687
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:02,734
Symbol of family ?

688
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,167
Yeah.

689
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,834
The exact same thing Sara told us.

690
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,434
According to Z,

691
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,467
Sara was staying at the house
a few more days.

692
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:16,734
Sara forgot to mention
that little detail to us.

693
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,900
I ran her 1970 fingerprints

694
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,100
against her current prints.

695
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,434
Thing is,

696
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:23,401
they don't match.

697
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,167
But these do.

698
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,868
Whose are they ?

699
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:28,667
Johanna's.

700
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,567
Sara Lowell is really

701
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,434
Johanna Kimball.

702
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,501
The real Sara must've died

703
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:36,667
in the blast.

704
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,167
Johanna stole her identity.

705
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:47,701
Still no whereabouts

706
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,034
on Johanna. Mm.

707
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,401
Running again.

708
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,768
Miller's talking
to the family. Hey,

709
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,401
Louie traced the serial number
on the pipe cap

710
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,267
to a batch that was purchased
by Marshall Corp.

711
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:59,234
Oh, where Porter
worked in '81.

712
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,234
Looks like
we got our bomb-maker.

713
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,634
You stay in touch with Sara
after that weekend ?

714
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:08,267
Sara ?

715
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,501
We weren't exactly exchanging
Christmas cards.

716
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,900
I never saw her again.

717
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,367
We know you made the bomb, Einstein.

718
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:19,401
And you had the hots
for Johanna.

719
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,967
I guess it doesn't matter.

720
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,100
She's been dead for so long.

721
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,134
It was Johanna's idea...

722
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,401
but something went wrong.

723
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,601
She wasn't supposed to be
in the house.

724
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,234
Just Jack.

725
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,833
Your best friend.

726
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,134
You gotta understand...

727
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,234
I did it for the woman I loved.

728
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,234
When did Johanna come to you ?

729
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:45,301
I was packing to leave...

730
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,967
Jack's still going to the cops.

731
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,467
What ?

732
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,000
I thought we all decided.

733
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,668
He doesn't care.

734
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:06,134
Well, you got to stop him, Jo.

735
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,034
He won't listen to me.

736
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,501
He's throwing everything
away, including me.

737
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,768
I'm scared, Porter.

738
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,933
I'm so scared.

739
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,967
Maybe I was wrong
about everything.

740
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:22,567
What do you mean ?

741
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:26,833
The decisions I made back
then about you and Jack.

742
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,734
I have thought
about it, you know.

743
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,634
That summer.

744
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:35,668
We were together.

745
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,734
Maybe this is a chance
to start over.

746
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,100
Yeah, but in jail, on the run ?

747
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:49,467
There's another way.

748
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:53,668
I keep thinking about
Jack's writings, his words.

749
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,334
"Peace at any cost."

750
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,434
Yes.

751
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:10,701
What are we talking about, Jo ?

752
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:13,000
You and me not giving
up what we've got.

753
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,634
You and me ?

754
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,401
Yes.

755
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:35,267
It was a simple plan.

756
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,334
The stove knob
triggered the bomb.

757
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,067
Jo should have been long gone,
meeting me.

758
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:43,900
But she didn't show.

759
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,100
Hmm-mm.

760
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:51,100
All I wanted was her,
and I... I killed her.

761
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,301
Sara was staying
in the house, Porter.

762
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:01,833
You killed her, not Johanna.

763
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,967
Forgot to loop you in, huh ?

764
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,567
Maybe that summer wasn't
so special after all.

765
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:14,000
Whoo !

766
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:18,668
Your daughter's good.

767
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:20,534
Thank you.

768
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,434
You've carved quite
a life for yourself,

769
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:24,634
haven't you ?

770
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:29,067
Beautiful house, beautiful family.

771
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:30,768
I wonder what Johanna
would think of this.

772
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,401
Where was Johanna from ?

773
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,967
Uh, New Jersey.
Right.

774
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:40,800
In a tiny apartment in Newark,
out-of-work father.

775
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,833
Grew up poor.

776
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:46,601
You do your homework.

777
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, all of you came from
money except for Johanna.

778
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,967
She worked her way
through school.

779
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,734
Struggled.

780
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:01,034
I bet she would have given
anything to have this,

781
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,234
done anything.

782
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,467
Please.

783
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,200
I know who you are, Johanna.

784
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,933
Does it haunt you ?

785
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,567
When you steal a
life, do you leave

786
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,634
your soul behind ?

787
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:29,234
Don't do this here, please.

788
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:31,067
Tell me what happened, Johanna.

789
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,668
All I ever wanted was a family.

790
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:46,000
A garden... peace.

791
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,367
And you killed for it.

792
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,234
I loved Jack.

793
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,933
Strange way to show it.

794
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,367
I'm not a monster.

795
00:37:57,434 --> 00:37:59,401
What are you then ?

796
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:04,467
A coward.

797
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,800
Sara's taking a walk.

798
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,301
It's just you and me.

799
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,234
Let's go to bed, sweetie.

800
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:19,867
Tomorrow morning we
should get on a plane

801
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,833
and go somewhere, anywhere.

802
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,301
Jo, there's no running away.

803
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,134
We've been under a lot of stress

804
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,734
with work, with this reunion.

805
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,734
Let's take a break, you and me.

806
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,567
I can't.

807
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,634
Remember that day ?

808
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:49,034
We got a flat tire.

809
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,967
Pulled into a park.

810
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:55,467
Walked down to that lake.

811
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,734
Best flat tire I ever had.

812
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:07,467
I thought it was you and
me against the world.

813
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:09,434
It still is.

814
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:12,367
Let's do this together.
Be strong with me, Jo.

815
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:16,334
You always were the strong one.

816
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:21,301
It isn't strength.

817
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,833
It's like I don't have a choice.

818
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:29,100
No choice.

819
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:33,301
I think I understand now.

820
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,167
Good.

821
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:53,467
Let's go to bed.

822
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:55,734
I'll be up in a second.

823
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:49,601
(Bob Dylan's
"Like A Rolling Stone" playing)

824
00:41:56,634 --> 00:41:59,567
* Once upon a time,
you dressed so fine *

825
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:03,267
* Threw the bums a dime
in your prime *

826
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:07,267
* Didn't you ? *

827
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:10,334
* People called, said "Beware,
doll, you're bound to fall" *

828
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:14,768
* You thought
they were all kidding you *

829
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:21,867
* You used to laugh about *

830
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:27,301
* Everybody
that was hanging out *

831
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:32,200
* Now you don't talk so loud *

832
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:36,301
* Now you don't seem so proud *

833
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,501
* About having
to be scrounging *

834
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:45,367
* For your next meal *

835
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:47,734
* How does it feel ? *

836
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:55,134
* How does it feel *

837
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,034
* To be without a home *

838
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,933
* Like a complete unknown *

839
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:07,967
* Like a rolling stone ? *

840
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,833
* Oh, you've gone
to the finest school all right *

841
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,734
* Miss Lonely, but you know
you only used to get *

842
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,634
* Juiced in it *

843
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,768
* Nobody's ever taught you
how to live out on the street *

844
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:37,601
* And now you're gonna have
to get used to it *

845
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:45,100
* You said
you'd never compromise *

846
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:49,567
* With the mystery tramp,
but now you realize *

847
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:54,567
* He's not selling any alibis *

848
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:59,601
* As you stare into the vacuum
of his eyes *

849
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:08,234
* And say,
"Do you want to make a deal ?" *

850
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:11,067
* How does it feel ? *

851
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,301
* How does it feel *

852
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:21,601
* To be on your own *

853
00:44:22,668 --> 00:44:26,534
* With no direction home ? *
