August 2, 1977

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,618
- You are here.
- I'm sure am.

5
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:15,057
- Does this mean?
- I did it.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,391
- We are going to New York?
- Tomorrow.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,976
- Finally gonna see Broadway.
- No, you're gonna be on Broadway.

8
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:22,120
- Kelly Witkowski, up in lights.
- And you're gonna open your coffee shop.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,358
Coffee bar.

10
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,719
Am I crazy, Kel? Thinking people paying
buck for a capuccino or an espresso?

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,893
The only crazy thing is 
you doubting yourself.

12
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,983
- There's no looking back.
- Onward and upwards.

13
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,331
Now, come on.

14
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:56,098
it's just a jump to the left

15
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,395
and a step to the right

16
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,873
- Come on.
- I can't dance.

17
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,118
You can do anything.

18
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,289
Caramel Macchiato.

19
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,555
Pay you back?

20
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,932
Yeah, right.

21
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:49,681
Triple americano.

22
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:51,512
Rocket fuel. Thanks.

23
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,679
Latte with nutmeg?

24
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,697
Yeah, you got a swirly?

25
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:58,118
No, your highness, 
shall I fetch you one?

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,003
That'd be good. 
And a napkin.

27
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,897
Just got off the phone 
with the Trenton D.A.

28
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:04,990
What about?

29
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,574
Serial killer named Roy Brigham 
Anthony is about to get paroled.

30
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,114
Serial killer, didn't get life?

31
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,835
He made a deal in '80.

32
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:15,734
He confessed to homicides they 
suspected him for but couldn't prove.

33
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,942
And he got..?

34
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:19,909
25 to life with mandatory time 
off for good behavior.

35
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,547
And he's behaved.

36
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:23,053
And served his 25 years.

37
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,343
Now Jersey's deals 
come back to haunt them.

38
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,978
Yeah? So why are they calling us?

39
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,569
Well, they're hoping 
that we can find a murder

40
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,435
Anthony did in Philly, then we can
extradite and lock him up here.

41
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,630
- He spent time here?
- Summer of '77 when he was 21.

42
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,147
So we look at all the 
cold jobs from that summer?

43
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,344
Getting the feeling 
we're off to the Garden State.

44
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:42,463
Yeah, the warden 
at Rahson's expecting you.

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,392
Listen.

46
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,007
If this guy walks, 
he's gonna kill more people.

47
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,879
Jersey D.A. say that?

48
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,729
No, Roy Brigham Anthony did.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2005/05/01

59
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,196
We got a pattern 
on this Roy Anthony.

60
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:32,300
He killed men and women at night
with his bare hands.

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,295
But no sexual abuse right?

62
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,951
Rules out Maggie here.

63
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,198
Ditto for Victor. 
He was killed in the morning.

64
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,040
No robbery, just took 
a trinket from each victim.

65
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,251
Trophies.

66
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,420
Yeah, they found a trunk full in his basement,
matched all of them to the victims except one.

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,852
This gold charm.

68
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,885
That a goat?

69
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:55,007
One other thing, all his victims were 
wearing uniforms of some kind.

70
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,139
- Uniforms?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,111
Eliminates all these jobs, 
except Mike Cahill.

72
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,380
What's his story?

73
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,590
Night doorman 
at the Caryle Building,

74
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,672
found at the Tasker-Morris 
subway station in the wee hours.

75
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,688
That's a rough part of town.
He have a record?

76
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:12,581
No, but he was wearing 
his doorman's uniform.

77
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,027
Let's see if Mike carried 
a goat charm around.

78
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,913
Guy's our best shot.

79
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:19,263
He's out only shot.

80
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,094
Hi, I'm Roy.

81
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,456
Detectives Valens and Rush.

82
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,582
Trenton?

83
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,268
- Atlantic City?
- Philadelphia.

84
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,215
I spent a few months there.

85
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:41,038
That's why we're here.

86
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:44,427
Wondering if you met up with 
this man during your time there.

87
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:46,358
Mike Cahill.

88
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,339
No, sorry, ma'am, 
I've never seen him before.

89
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,105
Well, maybe you 
remember him better like this.

90
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,839
Oh, dear.

91
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,567
You've gotta admit.

92
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:59,278
Looks a lot like your handiwork, Roy.

93
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,196
God's work can be brutal.

94
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:07,335
That's what you call it, huh?

95
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,094
Just obeying orders.

96
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:11,019
From God?

97
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,657
He shines a light 
on someone's face and

98
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,155
I don't have a choice.

99
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:17,805
Well, he shine a light 
on Mike, summer '77?

100
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:19,324
I don't know that man.

101
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,074
Seen this goat 
charm before, Roy?

102
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,217
Not that I recall.

103
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:25,041
Sure it didn't come 
from one of your victims.

104
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,187
Cuz it was in the trunk 
with all your other trophies.

105
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,103
- Was it?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:32,412
And we think that you took it off of this 
kid after you made him your first kill.

107
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,236
No, sir.

108
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,666
Let's hear about 
your stay in Philly, Roy.

109
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,325
From the beginning.

110
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:42,709
Well, my father took me 
there when I was 21.

111
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,001
Fresh from Provo.

112
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,438
It must've been a shock.

113
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,653
Big city and all.

114
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,235
It was indeed, ma'am.

115
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,878
I stayed with my aunt Louise.

116
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,419
I don't want to hear back from aunt Louise
about any misbehavior, Roy.

117
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,257
- No, sir.
- He'll be fine, Edward.

118
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:02,072
Aunt was good 
enough to find you a job.

119
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:04,045
- You turn your wages over to her.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,496
- And wear the garments.
- Yes, always.

121
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,105
- Or what?
- Hellfire and brimstone, sir, gnashing of teeth.

122
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,356
He's a good boy, I can tell.

123
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,470
You heard about the girl, in Provo?

124
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,884
Yes. That's why he's here.

125
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:18,290
For a clean slate. To reform.

126
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,391
I'll wear my garmies.
I'll have only clean thoughts.

127
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,859
And?

128
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:29,987
Never ever disrepect the Lord.

129
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,552
Roy?

130
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:34,821
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,102
Do not disrespect 
the Lord, I won't, sir.

132
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,857
When are you 
coming back for me?

133
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,796
It depends, on how 
well you obey the rules.

134
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:51,036
Oh, I'll obey, sir. I promise.

135
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:03,729
So, what did you 
do to this Provo girl?

136
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:07,551
I lusted for her.

137
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,771
And that got you 
shipped out of town?

138
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,913
It's against our beliefs.

139
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:13,751
Outside of marriage of course.

140
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,395
So you were pretty 
scared of your dad.

141
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:19,664
- He was a powerful man.
- He was military.

142
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:22,211
That's why you 
killed people in uniform.

143
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,922
They reminded you of him?

144
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,055
I loved him.

145
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:29,158
But you couldn't obey his rules and
that made you lash out.

146
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,088
I followed the rules.

147
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:35,147
You still get orders?

148
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,305
And the light still shines.

149
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,958
That's why I'm glad I'm getting out.

150
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,329
I have a lot of work to catch up on.

151
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,651
Sure I remember Mike.

152
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:58,117
He worked the door at the building.

153
00:07:58,117 --> 00:07:59,371
For two years.

154
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,039
We're trying to connect him 
to this guy. Ever seen him?

155
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,976
Sorry. Who is he?

156
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,919
Serial killer. 
Roy Brigham Anthony.

157
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,643
He the guy murdered Mike?

158
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,445
- Could be.
- Oh, that poor kid.

159
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:13,430
In 30 years, he was probably 
my favorite employee.

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,419
- Good guy?
- Charmer. Always had a smile.

161
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,824
And he would go
the extra mile for the tenants.

162
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,362
Do you remember anything 
unusual about the day he died?

163
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:24,492
- I remember he quit.
- That day?

164
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:27,169
He gave his notice and 
said he headed to the Big Apple.

165
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,484
To do what?

166
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,148
He had a business idea.

167
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:33,187
Thought there was 
a future in gourmet coffee.

168
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:37,250
Which there was. / Kid would've had 
the Starbucks folks beat by a decade.

169
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,026
Anyone unhappy about him leaving?

170
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:42,165
Everyone. Like I said, 
he was a favorite.

171
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,349
But anyone in particular?

172
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:47,883
Helen Hargrove. 
Her husband owned the building.

173
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,442
She and Mike were close?

174
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,942
Well, you'd see 
those two chatting 24/7,

175
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,252
and he would tell 
her his business plan, etc.

176
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,812
She a big fan of his idea?

177
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,421
Big fan of Mike's.

178
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:05,193
I'm sorry, Denny, 
I've changed my mind.

179
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,851
I'm not feeling up to going out.

180
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,800
This is Beverly Sill's last tour.

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,585
I can't make it tonight.

182
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,165
Tonight? 
Don't you mean every night?

183
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:15,748
I don't know what's wrong. 
Really, I don't.

184
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:20,256
This is getting tiresome, Helen.

185
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,749
Have a good evening, Mr. Hargrove.

186
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,041
- He's angry.
- I don't blame him.

187
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,032
- Will I see you tonight?
- No.

188
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,404
No? Mike?

189
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:35,078
We have to stop, Helen.

190
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,536
No, we don't.

191
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,041
You need help. 
Which I can't give you.

192
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,205
You help me every night.

193
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,138
If you don't put 
an end to this, then I will.

194
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:48,713
- What do you mean by that?
- I'll tell your husband, everything.

195
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,207
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

196
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,110
Some hanky panky?

197
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,567
Well, like I said, she was a fan.

198
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,450
And I did see him in her apartment.

199
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,258
Quite a few times, late night.

200
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:13,014
Maybe him going the extra mile 
for her got him some trouble?

201
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,443
Mr. Hargrove did have a temper.

202
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:19,459
And his wife entertaining 
the doorman might have set him off.

203
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,159
No "might" about it.

204
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:27,408
Looks like Mike Cahill was running 
around with a lady tenant.

205
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,400
Married lady tenant.

206
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,510
Kid's caught in a love triangle.
That gives revenge motive to the husband.

207
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,125
Which means 
maybe Roy ain't our guy.

208
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,559
And Jersey's out of luck.

209
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:41,461
Doorman in Rittenhouse Square 
and a Mormon kid in East falls.

210
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,526
Now how did they meet up 
at the Tasker-Morris stop?

211
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:47,066
Maybe Roy's aunt 
could shed some light.

212
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,358
One of you's Scotty Valens?

213
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:54,696
- Who's asking?
- Mark Phillips, NYPD.

214
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,410
Yeah, I'm Valens.

215
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,400
Excuse us, boss.

216
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,189
I understand 
you're Christina's guy.

217
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,734
That's right.

218
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:12,750
Dating your partner's sister, 
that's gotta be tricky.

219
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,649
What do you want, Phillips?

220
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:19,651
This is a courtesy call. Cop to cop.

221
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:22,685
I got a warrant for your girl's arrest.

222
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,810
Based on?

223
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,010
I'll talk to her about that.

224
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,558
Yeah, well, whatever it is, it's crap.

225
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,313
Okay. You don't want to get involved,

226
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:35,846
I'll treat her like a skell.

227
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,579
I'll pick her up tonight and 
haul her ass back to NY.

228
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,378
Or? / Or you could 
arrange a conversation.

229
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:45,029
This could go easy or hard.

230
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,870
Don't cop talk me. Okay?

231
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,942
Your call, pal.

232
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:56,193
I need some time,

233
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:59,196
to talk to her.

234
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,916
I gotta see someone tomorrow.

235
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,104
Day after?

236
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,034
That should be good.

237
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,559
It's gotta be.

238
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,387
Cuz I ain't leaving Philly without her.

239
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:31,832
Hey, Scotty, 
Roy's aunt is here.

240
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,624
Yeah, okay.

241
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,786
What did this 
NY detective want?

242
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,069
This girl I been with,

243
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,283
he's saying she did
credit card fraud.

244
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,813
Which is crazy.

245
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:57,318
Does Lil know this guy's 
looking for her sister?

246
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,935
Yeah.

247
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:07,972
But she washed her hands.

248
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:11,279
Anyway Chris just needs 
to talk to him, sort it out.

249
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,928
He's got it wrong.

250
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,993
Long way to come 
for getting it wrong, Scotty.

251
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,885
Roy stayed with you 
for 3 months in '77.

252
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:38,820
Yes, before the difficulties 
in New Jersey.

253
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,901
The murders, you mean.

254
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,368
We're looking into 
a Philadelphia murder now.

255
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:44,786
He didn't do that here.

256
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,756
How do you know?

257
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,090
I don't I guess.

258
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,650
We think Roy may have come 
in contact with this man, Mike Cahill.

259
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:59,719
Roy didn't mix 
with people very much.

260
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,789
Outside of his co-workers.

261
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,565
Where'd he work?

262
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:07,228
At the Franklin Grill, 
he was a busboy.

263
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,936
Ever bring any friends home?

264
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,916
He didn't make friends here.

265
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:16,897
Did Roy ever mention anything 
to you about God's light?

266
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,913
No.

267
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:24,279
I wonder if he's 
the one who hurt Roy.

268
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,506
Hurt him?

269
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:31,833
He'd come home late 
at night with injuries.

270
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,427
From what?

271
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:36,024
He'd never say.

272
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:40,194
Roy, are you hurt again?

273
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,030
Where do you go? 
Who does this to you?

274
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,265
Please let me in.

275
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:51,283
- It hurts.
- Poor thing.

276
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:58,993
Roy, do you remember how Mary Magdalene
poured oil on Jesus's blistered feet?

277
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:03,270
Yes. / Well, that's what 
I'm gonna do for you now.

278
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,001
It feels good.

279
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:10,348
One day, roy, maybe 
not so far from now,

280
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:15,451
you'll meet a nice wholesome girl and 
she'll touch you not just on your hands,

281
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:19,810
but here where it really counts.

282
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,170
And it'll be all right because 
she'll be good and pure.

283
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,885
Yes, Roy. Only good and pure thoughts 
come from a good and pure girl.

284
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:31,265
I think I'm going crazy, aunt Louise.

285
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,886
Why do you say that?

286
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,868
- I hear things.
- What kind of things?

287
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,950
Voices.

288
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,010
That's when I knew he was lost.

289
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,520
You ever find out who hurt him?

290
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,143
No.

291
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:53,869
I probably should 
have done more for him.

292
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,961
But late that summer, he ran away.

293
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,797
I hate to admit it but,

294
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,738
I was relieved.

295
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:05,157
Serial killer in the making.

296
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,713
That'd be a tough house guest.

297
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,800
And lucky he didn't hurt you.

298
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,066
Broke my heart. That hurt.

299
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,514
Thank you for coming to me.

300
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:28,566
I don't leave the apartment.

301
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,175
I wouldn't either,
I lived like this.

302
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,319
It's psychological, I'm afraid.

303
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,937
Phobias.

304
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:38,977
I got that. About snakes.

305
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:41,457
We're looking into 
the murder of Mike Cahill.

306
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,299
He was your doorman back in '77.

307
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,400
Oh, that dear boy. It was awful.

308
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,643
What do you know about it?

309
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,393
Just what I read.

310
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:52,658
Cuz we kinda heard Mike was 
more than just your doorman.

311
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:56,439
He was a friend.

312
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,819
Keep going.

313
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,267
He was 15 years younger than me.

314
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,658
It's been done.

315
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,926
I'll be honest, 
I wouldn't have said no.

316
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,622
But it wasn't like that.

317
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:10,207
Then why was he always coming 
to see you late at night?

318
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,901
He was helping me.

319
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,099
This was when 
my agoraphobia started.

320
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,183
- What's that?
- Fear of the outside.

321
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,671
- So Mike would run errands for me.
- Like?

322
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,456
Pharmacy runs, 
cheese cakes to go.

323
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,589
And that's it?

324
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,735
He would stay and keep me 
company some nights.

325
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,991
We'd play gin rummy.

326
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,309
Your late husband didn't 
know about you problem?

327
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:36,849
I tried to keep that from him.

328
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,880
I was hoping it was temporary.

329
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,425
So did you see 
Mike the day he died?

330
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,906
He came to tell me 
he was leaving.

331
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,278
Don't cry, Helen.

332
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:55,328
I never thought 
that you'd actually go.

333
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,868
I gotta take that leap.

334
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,625
Why does it have to be New York?

335
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,892
You know why.

336
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:04,791
- Kelly.
- She belongs on Broadway.

337
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,960
Lucky girl.

338
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:11,361
I want you to promise you'll 
see a doctor, get some help.

339
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,038
How can I make you 
change your mind?

340
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,895
You can't.

341
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:17,049
Then...

342
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:21,017
I have something for you.

343
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:31,439
A Yemenese herder came across 
a dancing goat eating red berries.

344
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:35,688
He tried one and realized 
why the goat was dancing.

345
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:38,189
That's how coffee was discovered.

346
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,413
So the legend goes.

347
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:45,104
It's for your coffee bar.

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,859
Thank you, Helen.

349
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:51,929
I'll be rooting for you.

350
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,472
You gave him the goat.

351
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,922
Last night of his life.

352
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,036
This Kelly was his girlfriend?

353
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:06,470
A waitress at the diner 
where he'd get my cheese cake.

354
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,858
What diner?

355
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,179
The Franklin Grill.

356
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,177
It's where Roy worked.

357
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,487
All I did was call in 
some credit card numbers.

358
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,321
- Meaning you used them.
- No, he did, my boss.

359
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,369
Yeah, who was 
also your boyfriend.

360
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:28,584
Greg, yeah.

361
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,282
So he was ripping off his customers using
their accounts but you didn't know that?

362
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:34,789
No, I didn't.

363
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,033
I didn't, Scotty.

364
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,829
How is he telling this 
Phillips it was your idea?

365
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,694
Because he's a liar.
He's pissed that I broke up with him.

366
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:42,948
They got phone calls 
with your voice on them, Chris.

367
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,100
I just said I called in the numbers.

368
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:50,553
I'd been working there for 2 weeks,
he gives me these account numbers,

369
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,651
says, call them into Bendel's.

370
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,266
- The department store.
- Said they had a standing deal.

371
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:58,165
They got flower arrangements from us,
we got stuff from them.

372
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:02,135
- And that sounded legal to you?
- I don't know, Scotty.

373
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,105
I was just trying to keep a job.

374
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,656
If that's the truth, 
all you gotta do is tell this guy.

375
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,746
- It's the truth.
- Then meet with him,

376
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,173
straighten it up. / I hope 
he believes me as much as you do.

377
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,236
I'll call him, set it up.

378
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,227
- You'll be with me?
- Yeah, of course.

379
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,104
Then I'll be okay?

380
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,071
Chris.

381
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:40,161
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:45,417
I do believe you.

383
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:49,274
Okay.

384
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,804
Larry Papas, manager 
of Franklin Grill in '77,

385
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:03,892
this is Lilly Rush.

386
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:05,481
Roy Anthony worked for you?

387
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:08,877
Gonna be on my tombstone.
"He hired a serial killer."

388
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:11,341
Mr. Papas also knew our victim.

389
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:15,260
Mikey, always gave me 
grief about my bad coffee.

390
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,646
So did Roy and 
Mike meet at your diner?

391
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:20,783
Not that I remember.
If those two met, it was through Kelly.

392
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:21,970
Mike's girlfriend?

393
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,907
Waitress, actress. 
I called her a wactress.

394
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:27,740
And your boy Roy, 
he had a real thing for her.

395
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,423
Really? / Oh, mooned over her 
like she was a madonna.

396
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,252
So maybe he was jealous of Mike?

397
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:37,098
I can't say for sure what was 
going on in that kid's head. He was off.

398
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,822
- Off how?
- He was distracted, uptight.

399
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:41,902
He had rules, real rigid.

400
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:43,327
You remember what they were?

401
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:46,549
Religious stuff, 
like don't disrespect the Lord.

402
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,437
His father told him that.

403
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,968
That was big with him.

404
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:53,142
Even if you crossed the line, 
he'd have a cow.

405
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,978
Gonna be busy tomorrow. 
That Sunday school crowd.

406
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:59,108
Always is.

407
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:00,433
They come here after church?

408
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,759
No, they come here 
instead of church.

409
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,459
What? / Sure, parents give them 
a buck for the collection plate,

410
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,650
they sneak over here 
and buy breakfast instead.

411
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,906
- But that's disrespectful.
- Of their parents?

412
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:14,012
- The Lord.
- Yeah, it's good for business though.

413
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,690
It's good to cheat God?

414
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,891
Come on, God's a rube.

415
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,958
Roy, what are you doing?

416
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:28,017
He shouldn't disrespect the Lord.

417
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:30,200
Okay, but you don't 
gotta hurt yourself.

418
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,349
Really, relax kid.

419
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:33,889
Why'd you do that?

420
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:36,362
It was either hurt him or me.

421
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:40,197
That feels good.

422
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:42,250
You're so sensitive.

423
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,015
I can't help it, 
I have these feelings.

424
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,665
- Pent up, right?
- Right.

425
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,213
And you need an outlet?

426
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:51,768
You're so pure and good.

427
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,639
I'm just like anyone else.

428
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,615
No, you understand me.

429
00:22:57,748 --> 00:22:59,928
Roy, you know what you need?

430
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:02,371
A late night double 
feature picture show.

431
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:05,618
- Okay.
- Maybe we'll go this Saturday.

432
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:13,800
So Roy gave himself those injuries?

433
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,347
He turned from hurting himself
to hurting others.

434
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:19,617
Are you saying he killed 8 people 
cuz they cursed to big man?

435
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:22,421
Well, maybe a combination of things.

436
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:25,327
Were you wearing 
a uniform that day?

437
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,386
My kitchen whites.

438
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,447
Uniform plus disrespecting God.

439
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:31,638
Equals burned hands.

440
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:35,573
So what else gets thrown 
in that turns it into murder?

441
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:42,651
I never did make it to New York.

442
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,535
I was still pretty broken up over Mike.

443
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:47,665
You remember a busboy 
you worked with, Kelly?

444
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:48,849
Guy named Roy?

445
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:51,862
Sure. From Utah.

446
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,377
Kind of an oddball.

447
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:56,546
An oddball that killed a bunch of people,
we think starting with Mike.

448
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:59,056
No kidding.

449
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,938
Oh, god.

450
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:04,830
I introduced them that night.

451
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,922
How did that go down?

452
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:09,692
I took Roy to see the 
Rocky Horror Picture Show.

453
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,438
Roy Brigham Anthony 
and Rocky Horror?

454
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:15,440
It's midnight, avenue theatre,

455
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,116
I thought it'd 
broaden his horizons, you know.

456
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,575
And a movie could do that for him?

457
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,844
Oh, it's not just a movie, 
it's an experience.

458
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:27,896
It was time of my life. 
I played Janet.

459
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,486
I can see that.

460
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:35,807
So Mike was at this experience too?

461
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,036
Yeah, he always came to watch.

462
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:43,043
Except that night, 
things went wrong.

463
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,056
- Roy, meet Mike.
- Hi.

464
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,981
Why's he wearing those clothes?

465
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:05,810
Cuz he's a tranvestite from 
transsexual, transylvania.

466
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,695
And an alien.

467
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:14,228
Our god's from another 
planet, near the star Kola.

468
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,957
Roy's a Mormon.

469
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:18,022
Are you sure we 
should be here, Kelly?

470
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:20,412
Sure, I come every week.

471
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:27,792
- Another admirer, huh?
- He's just a lonely guy form work.

472
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,798
Wait till he sees you in your big number.

473
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:32,016
- Come on, Mike.
- Who am I kidding, Kel.

474
00:25:32,016 --> 00:25:34,042
You're so beautiful and talented.

475
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:37,172
Don't do this. / And I'm just 
a doorman with a high school diploma.

476
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:39,882
But you're gonna be 
a businessman, a coffee tycoon.

477
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:44,321
I'm gonna lose you in New York.
You'll gonna get famous while I flop.

478
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:01,149
I gotta do my number.

479
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:07,008
I can't go, Kel. I'm sorry.

480
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:08,513
Well, I'm going, Mike.

481
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:11,557
With you or without you, you choose.

482
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:14,595
Come on, Roy.
Be my Rocky.

483
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,792
I thought there's no use getting

484
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:25,159
into heavy petting

485
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,138
it only leads to trouble
and seat wetting

486
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:35,510
now all I want to know

487
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,399
is how to go

488
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:44,160
I've tasted blood
and I want more

489
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,059
I'll put up no resistance

490
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,993
I want to stay the distance

491
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:52,929
I've got an itch to scratch

492
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,619
I need assistance

493
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,431
touch-a, toucha-a,
touch-a, touch me

494
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:01,391
I wanna be dirty

495
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,741
thrill me, chill me, fulfill me...

496
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,796
Roy Brigham Anthony.

497
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,609
Aunt Louise.

498
00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,744
Aunt Louise at Rocky Horror?

499
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:17,840
Ruined the whole number.

500
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,420
What'd you do when 
she dragged away your costar?

501
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,109
I left the stage, left the 
theatre and took the train home.

502
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,336
Without Mike?

503
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,361
He was still sitting 
in the front row,

504
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:30,364
doubting himself as usual.

505
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,207
What train did you take, Kelly?

506
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:37,841
The 14, from the 
Tasker-Morris station.

507
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:39,551
Where Mike was found.

508
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,627
I always wondered 
he followed me there.

509
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:47,058
Maybe to say 
he was coming after all.

510
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:49,751
It's possible.

511
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,570
I like to think so anyway.

512
00:27:57,685 --> 00:28:00,202
Mike gets an ultimatum from Kelly.

513
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:02,190
Maybe makes a decision, 
goes after her.

514
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,394
Which puts him at 
the Tasker-Morris stop.

515
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:06,179
Yeah, but Roy's 
with his aunt Louise.

516
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,658
And probably getting 
a hell of an earful.

517
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:10,753
So how does he end up 
at the train platform 2?

518
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:15,613
And what happened there 
makes him kill for the first time?

519
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:18,370
How late is she?

520
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,977
Over an hour.

521
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,924
- You told her 7, right?
- I told her.

522
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,983
Cuz I got 8:30.

523
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:45,108
What time you got?

524
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,340
Something must've happened.

525
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,269
- Like maybe she split.
- No, she said she'd be here.

526
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,181
Did you clown me? 
Help her out?

527
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,767
Careful what you ask me.

528
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,149
Yes, screw cop to cop courtesy.

529
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:02,551
I'm so whipped 
I'll do anything for this bread.

530
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,937
But keep going, please, anything.

531
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:10,971
You've been having rough times?

532
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:13,194
What does that matter?

533
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:15,049
Trying to figure out why 
you're off your game with this girl.

534
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,550
Why you acting like you know me?

535
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,769
You're a cop.

536
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,573
Skels lie to you everyday.

537
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,972
You should be wise to a con.

538
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,012
Well, she ain't that.

539
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,875
I'd been in that situation. 
Power of the pretty girl.

540
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,401
You ain't hearing me, Phillips.

541
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,975
I'll go get her, bring her back.

542
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:33,538
I'll wait till 9.

543
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,494
Then she becomes a fugitive.

544
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:47,580
Chris.

545
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,132
Christina.

546
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:07,896
"Scotty"

547
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:28,361
"Sorry. C."

548
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:55,682
Ever seen the Rocky 
Horror Picture Show, Louise?

549
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:57,740
Certainly not.

550
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,387
No?

551
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:01,069
That's for heathens.

552
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:05,292
Well, the night Mike Cahill died, 
one of those heathens saw you at the theatre,

553
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,783
spitting fire and brimstone.

554
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:10,483
Is that a fact?

555
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,590
Why not tell us that?

556
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:16,983
- I couldn't.
- Because?

557
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:21,987
Because I made 
a mistake that night.

558
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:23,800
That I'll never forgive myself for.

559
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,783
What mistake was that?

560
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:31,144
Louise, you're protecting 
a serial killer.

561
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:33,537
Don't you think I know that?

562
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:36,057
I made him who he is.

563
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:38,146
How?

564
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:42,106
Roy called me and

565
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:45,439
asked if he could go to
that so-called entertainment.

566
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,197
And you agreed?

567
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,176
No, I said to come home.

568
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:51,325
But he went anyway.

569
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,534
He disobeyed.

570
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:55,423
Because of that girl.

571
00:31:55,423 --> 00:32:01,144
- Kelly Witkowski.
- He went astray, lusting for her.

572
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:04,864
So you went to 
the theatre to get him?

573
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,109
And entered this den of sin and..

574
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:14,165
All these people dancing 
in their underwear.

575
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,239
Including Roy.

576
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:20,211
Especially Roy.

577
00:32:21,713 --> 00:32:24,150
You've committed 
the ultimate sin, Roy.

578
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,087
- You've turned away from god.
- No, I haven't, aunt Louise.

579
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:29,549
Dancing up there in your garmies,
cavorting with a harlot.

580
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,678
She's not a harlot, 
she's my Mary Magdalene.

581
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:33,963
Roy Brigham Anthony.

582
00:32:33,963 --> 00:32:36,834
Do not compare that 
low woman to god's disciple.

583
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,578
No, Kelly's pure, nice.

584
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:42,896
A nice girl wouldn't do what 
she was doing outside the marriage bed.

585
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:45,074
Then I should marry her.

586
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:47,676
That's the sinner talking.
That's what got you in trouble in Provo.

587
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,332
But I want someone, aunt Louise, 
I'm so alone.

588
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:54,723
You've got to listen to god, Roy, 
or you will be lost.

589
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,561
Is that who talks to me?

590
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,374
Who else?

591
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,386
I thought that voice 
meant I was crazy.

592
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,676
Joseph Smith heard 
an avenging voice.

593
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:05,052
So did Beigham Young, 
your name's sake.

594
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:06,411
And they weren't crazy.

595
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:10,030
They were the Fathers 
of the latter day saints.

596
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,477
Then I'll listen.

597
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:16,335
It would be a sin not to.

598
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,734
I have to go find Kelly.

599
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:21,086
Creature of the night

600
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,796
Creature of the night

601
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,549
Creature of the night

602
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,246
Creature of the night

603
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:31,594
Creature of the night

604
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,606
Creature of the night

605
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:40,072
Creature of the night.

606
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:43,746
Now do you see 
why I'm responsible?

607
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:47,411
Cuz you told Roy to listen.

608
00:33:47,804 --> 00:33:51,066
I thought it was 
god speaking to him,

609
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,167
but it was satan.

610
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,080
God shines a light, huh, Roy?

611
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,472
Speaks to you?

612
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,515
That's right.

613
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:13,182
That sounds real holy 
and righteous and all,

614
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:15,625
but I ain't biting.

615
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,144
What?

616
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:20,552
I don't buy this prophet act, 
god talking.

617
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,246
It's bogus.

618
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:26,281
Watch out, Roy doesn't like 
you disrespecting the Lord.

619
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:29,757
You like thinking you some 
special messenger of god,

620
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:34,973
but you're just a regular 
frustrated guy who wanted a girl.

621
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,888
You obviously don't understand.

622
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:39,209
You went after Kelly that night.

623
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,543
Followed her to the subway.

624
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:43,091
Because you liked her little show 
in the theatre, wanted some more.

625
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,307
But instead of Kelly, you found Mike.

626
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:47,935
- That's where it came all together.
- The perfect storm.

627
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,379
I don't know what you mean.

628
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,009
I mean there was 
Mike in his uniform and

629
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,884
maybe he broke one of your rules 
and disrespected the god.

630
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,144
We know what that makes you do.

631
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:59,391
Makes you wanna do harm and all 
the while, there's that little voice talking.

632
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,848
The one aunt Louise said to listen to.

633
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:05,029
God's voice is not little.

634
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:08,059
- And now things are really brewing.
- I do his work.

635
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:10,534
You just needed one more 
thing to push it over the edge.

636
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,507
What was the last ingredient, Roy?

637
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:15,762
- Turned you into a killer.
- I've already told you that.

638
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:17,959
What, that god's light crap?

639
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,414
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

640
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:23,085
God's light is not..

641
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:25,521
God's light is real.

642
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,911
It's real.

643
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,837
Kelly.

644
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:42,992
Roy, what are you doing here?

645
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,409
- Where's Kelly?
- Gone.

646
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,227
- I have to speak to her.
- Yeah, me, too.

647
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,177
- Now.
- What's the big emergency?

648
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:50,001
I have to marry her.

649
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:51,578
Get in the line, pal. I'm first.

650
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:53,505
No, really, she's my Mary.

651
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,562
She's going to New York, Roy.
I'm going with her.

652
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:59,111
- You don't understand.
- Hey, watch the uniform.

653
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:02,235
- She's my Mary Magdalene.
- Who's that?

654
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,708
Don't you read the Bible, 
go to church?

655
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,929
Look, Roy, I know 
you're a Jesus freak.

656
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:13,315
What? / Personally, I don't give 
a rat's ass about god. I'm sorry.
