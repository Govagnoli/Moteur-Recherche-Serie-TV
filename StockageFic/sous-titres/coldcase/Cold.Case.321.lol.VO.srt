00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,156
If old FDR could have squeezed out another  
couple of weeks, he'd seen a this war end.

3
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:38,546
My stint's gonna end here 
if McDuff gets a gander at this...

4
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,331
I can't make heads  
or tails out of this story.

5
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,788
Birdie, let me see it.

6
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,257
It's all right there, Lo.

7
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:46,139
Highlight these good details: 
Allied troops celebrating,

8
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,620
dancing polkas...  
and use active verbs.

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,475
This is breaking news,  
not your grandma's knitting circle.

10
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,211
I see him, Birdie. 
Almost done.

11
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,239
Birdsong!

12
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,639
- Our boys are finally coming home. 
- Looks like it, sir.

13
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,524
Well, this war's bound to have made  
some heroes.

14
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:02,301
- Philadelphia needs to read about hers. 
- Features, Mr. McDuff?

15
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,369
- Fast as you can write them. 
- The first one's on its way.

16
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,745
Well, if it's as good as your last few,  
we'll need to save room above the fold.

17
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:11,121
- How about me, Mr. McDuff? 
- Oh, uh...

18
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:12,807
- Crumb cakes! 
- Excuse me?

19
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,262
I want to hear what kind of victory vittles

20
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:17,671
the ladies are baking for the soldiers  
coming home from the war.

21
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,212
Red, white and blue Jell-O gelatin!

22
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:24,980
That's a story gals will go dizzy for!

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,235
I like your spirit.

24
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,991
So, what do you say, Miss Kinney,  
you think you can manage that?

25
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,388
Sure, I can write that.

26
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,647
And then maybe something 
on this Unite Nations idea?

27
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,835
You know, Mrs. R. was saying 
it might put an end to these big wars,

28
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,283
- and I was thinking...  
- Pipe down, sugar,

29
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:36,984
you hardly have time as it is... 
you know the rule.

30
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:39,902
6:00! 
Ladies out!

31
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,685
Is it true?

32
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,003
Jeffries got demoted?

33
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,151
Disciplined... the bosses put him  
on desk duty.

34
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,345
- For how long? 
- Undetermined.

35
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:48,883
Well, that's going to make him nuts.

36
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:50,679
Doesn't help that his birthday's this week.

37
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,111
Oh, right.

38
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,680
Double whammy. / No, whatever you do,  
don't mention it to him.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,456
He was very clear... 
no cake, no presents. / I got it.

40
00:02:57,456 --> 00:03:00,278
Lieutenant? 
Detective.

41
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,989
- Looking for you. 
- Hey, Tommy.

42
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,648
Will Jeffries has some right hook, huh?

43
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:06,028
Well, off the record, that guy had it coming.

44
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,916
Rumor is your paper's going out of business.

45
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,250
Yeah, I guess everyone's getting  
their news online now.

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,575
Me? I'm still terrified of e-mail.

47
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,052
Newsroom's clearing out, huh?

48
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,395
Yeah, place is clear like a tomb.

49
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,133
I was going through the archives,  
before they trash everything.

50
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,892
- I found something that might interest you. 
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

51
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,340
You guys know about the Sentinel's ghost? 
Lo Kinney?

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,452
Yeah, I've heard tell.

53
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,763
Yeah, old time reporter  
that got killed, right?

54
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:31,407
While most lady reporters 
were writing about casseroles,

55
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,613
she traveled the world 
with Eleanor Roosevelt.

56
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,263
A gal ahead of her time.

57
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:38,977
Her death's on the books as a purse  
snatching gone bad, but, uh,

58
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:40,700
lore is it was more than that.

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,360
Something in the archives 
back that up?

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,913
In a box of her old files, 
I found a note, dated the day she died.

61
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,214
Saying what?

62
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,802
"Lawndale Station. 10:00 p.m.

63
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:51,836
This will not stand."

64
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,841
Lawndale Station significant?

65
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:55,962
It's where she was killed.

66
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,832
Hit by the 10:00 p.m. train.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/04/30

80
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,683
Hey... 
It's the birthday boy.

81
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,851
Just stepped right in it, didn't you.

82
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,430
- It's a bummer about the desk duty. 
- Uh-huh.

83
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,051
But, uh, this'll get your mind off it.

84
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,021
I hooked you up.

85
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,226
Hooked me up for what?

86
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:50,552
Tickets to Lena's show. 
Wednesday night.

87
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,513
Did I not tell you to ignore my birthday?

88
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:55,415
- I read between the lines. 
- Morning.

89
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:56,972
What do we got?

90
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:01,856
Lorena Kinney, hit by train at 
Lawndale Station, 1945.

91
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,028
"Agony Aunt"?

92
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,117
Yeah, what they used to call 
advice columnists.

93
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:08,121
Lorena was the "Dear Abby" of the Sentinel.

94
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,470
Purse strap was found 
with the body, but no purse?

95
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,966
Looked like she resisted a robbery,  
things got violent.

96
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:17,665
But this note found in her files suggests  
Lo was meeting someone there.

97
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:21,066
"Lawndale Station, 10:oo p.m. 
This will not stand."

98
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,431
Someone was threatening Lo, 
she goes to meet them...

99
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,674
Things get heated, she gets 
pitched under the train.

100
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,509
Makes the author of the note the doer.

101
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,925
Well, three more boxes of her files  
at the Sentinel. I'll start digging.

102
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:35,594
And I'll visit the last to see...  
fellow reporter, Davis Birdsong.

103
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,107
And I'll be at my desk.

104
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,827
Lo Kinney.

105
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,834
She was a crackerjack news gal.

106
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:52,527
Our girl on the scene, 
during the FDR years.

107
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,619
I thought she was a gossip columnist.

108
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,825
- Advice.  
- Yeah, well, that was later.

109
00:05:56,825 --> 00:06:00,819
You see, Eleanor Roosevelt 
championed lady reporters.

110
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,289
But when FDR died, gals got 
sent back to the minors.

111
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,640
So Lo's demoted, now  
she's an Agony Aunt.

112
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,460
Ten-cent reporter in a five-cent job.

113
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,551
We're looking back into her death, thinking 
maybe it wasn't just a purse snatching.

114
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,547
No kidding?

115
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:18,389
Yeah, we think she might have been meeting  
someone at the station that night.

116
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,097
Any ideas who?

117
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,987
Ladies were kicked out of 
the newsroom at 6 o'clock.

118
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,955
I don't know what she 
did with her evenings.

119
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,183
She didn't have a guy?

120
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,928
A firecracker like Lo wasn't dating  
material in the 40s.

121
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,749
She have any enemies at the Sentinel?

122
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,709
Someone who hated her enough 
to shove her onto the tracks?

123
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,655
You kind of knew it would 
all end in tears with Lo.

124
00:06:38,655 --> 00:06:43,873
It was just too dangerous to stick  
a wild bird like her in the hen house.

125
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:49,338
 ♪ You got the acc-cen-tu-ate

126
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:53,056

00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,502
 ♪ And latch on... ♪

128
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,932
So what's the breaking news 
in the hen house?

129
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:59,989
"Dear Lo, in a real pickle here.

130
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:04,494
Will a polka-dot frock, or a flower-print  
dress turn my Jack's head?"

131
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:07,605
"Dear In A Pickle:  
You want to turn your Jack's head,

132
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:11,354
say 'boo' to the frock  
and show him the birthday suit."

133
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:14,742
That gal's asking you  
a serious question, Lo.

134
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:18,497
Serious? What Truman's going 
to do about the Japanese, that serious.

135
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,916
Women don't want to be  
bothered with war talk.

136
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:25,269
Cause meat pies and nylons are 
so much more interesting.

137
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,913
Hi, Miss Russell.

138
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,834
Got that newlywed survey going to, uh... 
Martha Body on Spruce?

139
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:34,360
Think that last paragraph's too much, Lo?

140
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,027
Hmm. Kind of a laugh.

141
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:39,057
You giving romantic advice.

142
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,416
Oh, really? Why's that?

143
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,999
What do you know about it?

144
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,940
- You're a childless old maid. 
- Take a powder, Helen.

145
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,693
Women all over this city live 
by the advice in "Dear Lo."

146
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,199
Well, they shouldn't.

147
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,152
Women's page is good for  
wrapping fish, and nothing more.

148
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:58,278
You blow in, steal my job,

149
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,546
then act like you've got 
something better to do?

150
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,133
- Your job?  
- I should have gotten that column!

151
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,455
I know what women care about.

152
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:13,503
Soon as McDuff gives me a real 
beat the "Dear Lo" column is all yours.

153
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:15,354
All fixed up, Birdie.

154
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:22,039
 ♪ ... to the affirmative

155
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,147
Those two fought like alley cats.

156
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:28,087
And Helen had some toys in the attic?

157
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,567
Had some crack-ups over the years.

158
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,481
She spent time in mental hospitals.

159
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,915
Was she loopy enough to try and hurt Lo?

160
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:38,036
- She did benefit from her dying. 
- Yeah? How?

161
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:41,295
With Lo gone, Helen got that column.

162
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,169
She's still writing it.

163
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,294
So you took over Lo's column.

164
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,572
Changed "Dear Lo" to "Hey, Helen,"  
and the rest is history.

165
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:59,826
We hear you had a few 
bumps along the way.

166
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,861
- An altercation on a city bus... 
- Misunderstanding.

167
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:04,947
Hospital stay after disrupting a wedding.

168
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:08,034
Locked the bride in the choir room,  
and walked down the aisle yourself?

169
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,016
She wasn't really right for him.

170
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,698
We were wondering if, in one of these  
colorful periods, you did something to Lo.

171
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:17,845
- Like shove her in front of a train? 
- Like that, yeah.

172
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,424
We know you wanted  
that column pretty bad.

173
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,387
You girls are lucky.

174
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,619
You have no idea what it's like  
with a ceiling

175
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:27,780
above you, 
blocking how far you can rise.

176
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,787
Not much room for women at the paper?

177
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,956
Hardly room for one, much less two.

178
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:35,099
So far you to succeed,  
Lo had to go.

179
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,864
Look, I'm a crazy old broad, I admit it,

180
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:42,436
but Lo was making enemies more  
dangerous than me. / How's that?

181
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:45,930
She was offering some pretty 
progressive advice in that column.

182
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,802
- And that got her in trouble? 
- Sure did.

183
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:53,816
The hen house became a hornets' nest  
after some of her ideas hit the street.

184
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:59,166
Lo Kinney?

185
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,942
That's me.

186
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:03,326
Hey, where do you get off telling my wife to,

187
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,746
"Beat feet if your dogface  
came home from the war

188
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:09,239
more interested in his buddies  
than his bride."

189
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,286
I gave that advice to a girl

190
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:15,857
who wrote in saying her husband  
stopped coming home nights...

191
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:18,428
and when he did, he was always stinking'. 
That's where.

192
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:20,942
Man can't come home from the front  
and blow off a little steam...is that it?

193
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:22,726
Now when he's got a family to think of.

194
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:26,438
Carousing, blowing your service benefits,  
liquoring up?

195
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:30,627
The 52-20 Club is for layabouts, mister, 
and it's making your wife nutso with worry.

196
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:34,395
You got no idea about my life,  
what I been through.

197
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:35,936
I know what your wife wrote.

198
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,896
And you think that's worth 
throwing away what we got?

199
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:40,235
For crying out loud, lady!

200
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:42,610
You married?

201
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,579
Haven't had time, haven't missed it.

202
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,571
So you don't really know 
what you're talking about,

203
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,488
having been left on the shelf 
past expiration yourself.

204
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:53,328
- She is over 30. 
- Shut your pie hole, Helen.

205
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,888
And you sure as heck 
ain't never been to war.

206
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,224
Wives and soldiers don't have 
any lock on common sense.

207
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,384
I ought to put a crimp in you.

208
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,972
- You're not the first one to threaten it. 
- Yeah, well...

209
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,973
maybe I'll be the last.

210
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,593
I enjoyed it. I did.

211
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:22,509
Especially that "left on the shelf" business.

212
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,911
Did Lo get a lot of angry visitors?

213
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:29,342
And she usually mouthed 
right back, but this one rattled her.

214
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,575
Seemed to scare her.

215
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,099
Any chance you remember his name?

216
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,469
Save us trying to match 
that story to the sender?

217
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:36,983
Lo got a lot of letters.

218
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:41,694
No. It's the stories that stick,  
not their names.

219
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,069
Sorry.

220
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:57,124
"Dear Lo, my husband says frosted foods  
are for single gals and stumblebums.

221
00:11:57,124 --> 00:12:00,587
Who's right?  
Signed, a Busy Bee."

222
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,912
I guess that makes me a stumblebum.

223
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,737
Single gal.

224
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:08,998
Hey, man, you're making me nervous. 
Why don't you sit down?

225
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:11,504
Cause my ass has been planted all day.

226
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:14,496
Growing roots in that seat.

227
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,807
Maybe box number three is  
the lucky one. / Hey.

228
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,522
- Think I got it. 
- Yeah?

229
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,126
"June 1, 1945.

230
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,879
My soldier's been home three months, 
but something's wrong.

231
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,807
He's out till all hours, always soused,  
and doesn't want word on with me."

232
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,065
Sounds right. 
Who signed it?

233
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,563
- "Should I Scream?" 
- That ain't helpful.

234
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:40,820
Return address on the envelope:  
Mrs. Arthur Pool, Gildar Street.

235
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,529
Gildar's in Fox Chase.

236
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,536
Train station out there... 
Lawndale.

237
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:49,363
So maybe this Arthur lures  
our girl out to his local train stop...

238
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:53,300
Just in time to meet 
the 10:00 p.m. express.

239
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,367
Arthur Pool was my father.

240
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,669
He just passed away.

241
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,414
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,149
We're sitting shave for him.

243
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,215
We're here about a homicide.

244
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,170
Your dad knew our victim.

245
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,369
Well, he obviously can't help you.

246
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,304
Her name was Lorena Kinney.

247
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:17,027
Your mom wrote to her 
for advice, back in '45.

248
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,016
Which ticked your dad off pretty good.

249
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,067
My dad did not kill Lo.

250
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,289
- So you knew her? 
- I met her in this house.

251
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:27,067
Really? Cause we heard she and your dad  
went toe-to-toe in the newsroom.

252
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,570
She came here the next day, 
and that's when she met Noah.

253
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,467
- Who's that? 
- My uncle.

254
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,210
He live with you?

255
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,785
Lucky for me.

256
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,587
He was my real father figure.

257
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:42,084
Cause your dad came home 
from the war in rough shape? / Right.

258
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,639
Noah taught me how to be a kid,

259
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,016
shoot marbles, ask out a girl,  
drive. / Nice.

260
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:53,614
What was Lo's relationship with Noah?

261
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:58,262
Love... at first sight.

262
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,184
I'm here to apologize,  
I guess.

263
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:06,255
A good reporter's got to hear 
both sides of a story.

264
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:07,738
You willing to tell it?

265
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:12,374
Look, uh... I love my wife,

266
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:16,627
but the things I seen and... 
and done in this war...

267
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,115
those memories got to stay 
out of this house.

268
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:23,835
Daddy, me and Uncle Noah 
saw Pinocchio and get marbles!

269
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,746
That's nice, David.

270
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:29,218
Now, don't go interrupting  
the grownups, you hear?

271
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:36,552
Oh, we play later, David. 
What do you say?

272
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:41,181
It'll be our secret.

273
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,436
Noah, this is, uh, Lo Kinney,

274
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,934
the advice lady  
I was moaning about.

275
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:48,257
- Pleased to meet you. 
- Likewise.

276
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:50,877
I am fan of your column, 
"Dear Lo."

277
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:53,440
- Now, that's bunk. 
- No, it's true.

278
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,374
A month ago, a woman asks 
what type of curtains you use,

279
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:01,539
and you tell her "none, so you 
can see the sky."

280
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,303
Quite a memory you got...

281
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,920
especially since I was shoveling it  
pretty hard, quite frankly.

282
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, you strike me as the type  
of woman to whom the truth...

283
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,924
is everything.

284
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,238
Haven't lived long in Philadelphia?

285
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:17,491
Uh, Noah's from, uh Holland.

286
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,328
- Swal... 
- Swalmen.

287
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,261
And she doesn't care to hear about me.

288
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,792
Sure. Sure, I do.

289
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,894
I mean... that... that's what I do.

290
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,491
I listen to people.

291
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:33,318
Uh, turns out,  
uh, Noah and I are third cousins.

292
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,599
He made it out of Europe 
right when it was getting real bad.

293
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,104
How'd you swing that?

294
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,501
During the war, um, things are confusing.

295
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:45,355
Um, I escaped and made it to Switzerland.

296
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:48,892
He got out of that camp: 
Auschwitz.

297
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,053
Is that right?

298
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,086
- I hear it was horrible. 
- Yes.

299
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,528
Now, that's a story people should hear.

300
00:15:57,528 --> 00:16:00,331
What if I tell you other stories?

301
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:04,331
What if you tell me all your stories?

302
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,159
Maybe I will.

303
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,459
So Lo was your uncle's girl.

304
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,021
Um, "lady friend" was his term.

305
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,617
So much for Helen's old maid theory.

306
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,259
Is Noah here now?

307
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,644
He was, but this time of day,  
he's home...

308
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,289
painting up a storm.

309
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,423
Noah Pool?

310
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:36,121
Detectives Miller and Vera.

311
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:40,407
Come on in. 
I don't get many visitors here.

312
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:43,766
- Dark stuff. 
- Maybe that's why no visitors.

313
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:46,053
Mr. Pool, we're here about Lorena Kinney.

314
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:49,396
Yeah, David said 
you were looking into her death.

315
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,333
You think it wasn't an accident?

316
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,941
Maybe not.

317
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,870
That's awful.

318
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,442
We heard you two were an item.

319
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,836
From the moment we met.

320
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:02,185
There's no mention of you in 
the police report when she died.

321
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,905
- I didn't come forward. 
- That's kind of strange.

322
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,742
I will illegal. 
I wasn't even supposed to exist.

323
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,800
And you were worried the cops 
were going to send you back?

324
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,624
They would have. 
I had nothing to go back to.

325
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:16,894
Family, friends... all dead.

326
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:19,607
Right before her death,  
Lo received a note saying,

327
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:23,528
"This will not stand," 
and setting up a meet at the train station.

328
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:25,075
Where she was killed.

329
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,511
You didn't write it, did you?

330
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:33,250
No. Lo was my second chance 
after so much darkness.

331
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,445
I came here to start over, 
and there she was. Light.

332
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,493
When she died, though, 
that... light went out for good.

333
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:48,243
Can you think of anyone who 
could have written that to her?

334
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:52,764
Yes. 
One person.

335
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,381
- Cotton candy. 
- Oh.

336
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:02,595
It's pretty good, huh?

337
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,658
That is so sweet.

338
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:08,263
The war's almost over. 
We're starting to get sugar again.

339
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:12,142
It's nice, this place. 
Seeing the sky.

340
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:15,339
For a long time, I see it 
only through barbed wire.

341
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:17,634
Must've felt like the world was ending.

342
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,747
Huh. It was ending.

343
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,793
- Will you ever go back to Holland? 
- Why would I?

344
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,078
Family, your childhood home.

345
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:30,243
No, there's nothing there. 
Not even me.

346
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:34,500
Whoever I thought I was, 
I left that person behind.

347
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,211
I think I know the feeling.

348
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:42,968
Noah. 
You're here now.

349
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:46,220
When they came for us...

350
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,637
they put us on trains.

351
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:52,727
That is the last time 
I saw my mother, my sisters...

352
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,312
and I got separated from  
my father at the camp.

353
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:57,169
I never saw them again.

354
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,468
- How long were you there? 
- Three years.

355
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:03,503
I lived because I could paint.

356
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:05,461
The guards liked that.

357
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,881
What'd they like about it?

358
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,603
I painted their portraits.

359
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:15,375
For hours... 
I'd look at their faces...

360
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,086
these men who kill my family...

361
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:23,781
- and painted them. 
- Oh, Noah.

362
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:28,775
It's nice to see the sky.

363
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,529
What do you say we take a picture?

364
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:37,101
What? 
Uh, wait..

365
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:41,441
To remember today, forever. 
Come on...

366
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:02,030
You're, uh... 
You're hard to pin down.

367
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,428
What?

368
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,755
You are like a wild bird.

369
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:10,023
You want to flit. Fly.

370
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:13,585
- I'm just an everyday gal. 
- No.

371
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:16,608
That's what's good.

372
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,902
You're good.

373
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:31,821
- What's going on here? 
- Birdie! Were you following me?

374
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:34,979
You're just throwing 
it all away. Is that it?

375
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,660
It's not what you think, Birdie.

376
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,967
Well, the hell with you then, Lo!

377
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:42,451
The hell with you!

378
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,617
- I have to go to him. 
- No, Lo, wait.

379
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:47,359
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,849
I have to go.

381
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,888
Lo and Birdie had some history?

382
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:57,484
She always said they were 
just pals from work.

383
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:59,932
What he told us, too.

384
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:04,828
I don't know any "pals" that act like that.

385
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,863
Firecracker like Lo wasn't dating material?

386
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:14,985
- Isn't that what you said, Birdie? 
- Yes.

387
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,682
So what's with you following her  
to Victory Park,

388
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:19,274
throwing a jealous fit when  
you find her with Noah?

389
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:21,265
That wasn't what it seemed.

390
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,973
Seems like you were 
sick in love with her.

391
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:26,568
- That's not what I was after. 
- Then what?

392
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:30,203
I needed her help, right then.

393
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:32,283
With?

394
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:37,729
I had a story due.

395
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,811
And Lo had been writing them for me.

396
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:44,976
- Lo wrote your articles? 
- It started out, she just edited me.

397
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:48,254
Down the line,  
I'd go to her under pressure.

398
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,742
She could whip up a story in no time.

399
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,878
And you couldn't?

400
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,853
I was a five-cent reporter  
in a ten-cent job.

401
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,436
And Lo was covering for you.

402
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,288
I had a byline, no stories.

403
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,252
- But Lo had a million stories. 
- But no byline.

404
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:12,685
I'd promised McDuff a feature on a man  
who survived the worst in Europe,

405
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:15,592
- was rebuilding his life here. 
- A story on Noah.

406
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:18,834
Problem was, Lo was 
supposed to be reporting,

407
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:23,290
not mooning around, falling in love.

408
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,734
 ♪ You always hurt? ♪

409
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,784
 ♪ The one you love... ♪

410
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,111
You had no right acting  
the way you did in the park... no right!

411
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,986
You promised me that  
front-page story this morning!

412
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,998
McDuff has been breathing 
down my neck all day!

413
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:39,222
Birdie, you've got a brain and ten fingers.

414
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:40,667
And even if you only use  
two of them to type,

415
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,290
nothing's stopping you 
from doing your own reporting.

416
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,251
So you backing out 
of the story, is that it?

417
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:48,485
No. I just... I... 
I need more time.

418
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:50,562
You need more time cause 
you're falling for this fella.

419
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:53,064
I certainly am not.

420
00:22:53,064 --> 00:22:56,966
Well, I hope you know what 
you're getting yourself into.

421
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,656
What do you mean by that?

422
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,936
Well, you're the one who said 
his story doesn't add up.

423
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:04,458
Him escaping through 
Switzerland, for starters.

424
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,967
People got out however they could.

425
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,954
The Swiss borders were tight, especially  
for Jews... you told me that.

426
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,952
And what about being in that camp?

427
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:14,110
All the prisoners got tattoos on their arms. 
You said you were gonna check if he had one.

428
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,169
- I never looked. 
- Why not?

429
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:23,128
Look who's talking, buster.

430
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,180
Back when you cared about this story,

431
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,920
you asked me to track someone 
down from his hometown.

432
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,011
Remember? 
Well, I did.

433
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,764
Her name is Johanna Hoffman,  
from Swalmen, Holland.

434
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,287
Birdie! I need that story, on the double!

435
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:43,577
You want the truth about Noah? 
The real truth?

436
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:46,517
Ask her.

437
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,153
Did Lo ever follow up with this woman?

438
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:56,317
Never said.

439
00:23:56,317 --> 00:24:01,197
But the kind of reporter she was,  
I can't imagine she didn't.

440
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:04,326
And then she was dead.

441
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:13,130
Found this mystery woman, 
Johanna Hoffman.

442
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,474
- She still around? 
- Lives up in New York.

443
00:24:15,474 --> 00:24:18,720
And get this... 
relocated in July of '45.

444
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,952
- About the same time Lo died. 
- Well, not about, exactly.

445
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,454
Closed her bank account July 17th.

446
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:26,643
Paper trail in Philly goes cold after that.

447
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:30,759
So Johanna disappears and 
Lo winds up dead, same day.

448
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,299
Lo must've gone to find her. 
Something went bad.

449
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:37,649
Looks like someone's  
heading to New York. / Uh...

450
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:41,669
There's a big poker game 
at my brother's tonight, so...

451
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,573
It's Wednesday. 
Veronica's ballet class.

452
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:47,718
Don't look at me; I'm planted.

453
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,705
Guess that leaves me.

454
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:54,059
I'm away, boss

455
00:24:56,774 --> 00:25:00,279
You're covering those 
phones like a champ, Will.

456
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,929
Yeah. 61 years old, getting punished 
like a schoolboy. / Yeah.

457
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,141
Yeah. Maybe time to go out.

458
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:14,992
- Maybe. 
- No reason to keep it up.

459
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:18,126
Deal with crummy people 
who lie to you all day.

460
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,762
Dog's life.

461
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:23,990
- Most guys are out by 50. 
- Yeah.

462
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,668
- I tried taking a vacation once. 
- Yeah?

463
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:30,722
Drove to Myrtle Beach, ten hours.

464
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:34,070
Beautiful golf courses, shoreline...

465
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,883
and I didn't know 
what to do with myself.

466
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:40,107
So I drove back.

467
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:43,214
I can't retire. 
I'd go nuts.

468
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:46,749
I don't know how to not work.

469
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:49,639
I used to think I only did this job  
because I was good at it.

470
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:53,236
But I keep doing it.

471
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:56,772
I think it's what we  
actually like doing, Will,

472
00:25:56,772 --> 00:26:00,172
crummy people and all.

473
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,583
Come on in.

474
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,202
I got to watch the phones.

475
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,170
You can hear them from here.

476
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,512
Happy birthday, Will.

477
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,544
Thank you for seeing me, Johanna.

478
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:43,484
Coming all the way from Philadelphia.

479
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:47,456
- It must be important. 
- It is.

480
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:51,494
It's about a murder in 1945.

481
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,797
- Who was killed? 
- A reporter. Lorena Kinney.

482
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:58,147
Lo Kinney was murdered?

483
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:02,212
Pushed in front of a train. 
The same night you left Philly.

484
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,652
- I never knew. 
- But you knew Lo?

485
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:10,013
I met her... once.

486
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:14,081
- I wish I never had. 
- Why is that?

487
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:19,606
Because... 
What she told me...

488
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:25,783
haunted me... 
the rest of my life.

489
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:34,457
I'm writing a story about 
someone from your hometown.

490
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:36,934
From Swalmen?? Who?

491
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:39,002
Noah Pool.

492
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:42,893
- Noah. 
- You know him?

493
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:45,945
We lived on same street since childhood.

494
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,495
Is that right?

495
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:51,238
His sisters and I, we played  
every day. Noah, too.

496
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:56,872
So strong.  
But also so gentle.

497
00:27:56,872 --> 00:28:00,869
Yes. He is very gentle.

498
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,448
- Is?  
- I know him.

499
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,667
- He lives here in Philadelphia. 
- That is impossible.

500
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,931
He'll be so pleased to know someone  
from Swalmen is also here.

501
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,584
Noah is dead.

502
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,369
What?

503
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,622
He was killed in Auschwitz.

504
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:21,125
You must be mistaken.

505
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:25,308
He survived longer than the others,  
painting portraits.

506
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:29,407
But when there are no more to paint...

507
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,188
I, uh... I have a photo of him.

508
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:37,005
This is Noah Pool.

509
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:43,146
No.

510
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:47,622
Then who?

511
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:54,344
- That is Anton. 
- Anton?

512
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,261
A guard.

513
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,925
Are you sure?

514
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:06,294
He gave me this.

515
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:28,678
I left Philadelphia that day.

516
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:33,614
Knowing he was there, 
I've never been back.

517
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:38,127
So Lo was in love with a Nazi.

518
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:45,525
Sit down.

519
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:49,744
So we're looking for your uncle.

520
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:52,213
- Must be at his studio. 
- No.

521
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,739
- He cleared out. 
- Where would he go?

522
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:57,470
That's what I need to know.

523
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:04,560
The man you thought 
was your Uncle Noah,

524
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,088
- he's someone else. 
- What do you mean?

525
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,064
His real name's Anton Bikker.

526
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:12,936
And he collaborated 
with the Germans.

527
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,799
What do you think 
you're saying to me?

528
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,141
I know how you feel about him, 
and how he helped bring you up.

529
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:21,705
- That's right! 
- But people can lie, David.

530
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:23,777
Trick you. 
And be real good at it.

531
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:26,332
- I've known him my whole life. 
- He's been lying that long.

532
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,029
Now he's running,  
and we got to find him.

533
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:30,321
It can't be true.

534
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:32,981
Noah played with me, 
taught me things.

535
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,864
Took me to the movies.

536
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:45,424
The real Noah died in a camp 
where Anton was a guard.

537
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:49,846
We, uh...

538
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:56,277
We found a woman  
who knew them both.

539
00:30:56,545 --> 00:31:03,265
60 years later... 
maybe a mistake.

540
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:06,205
Can't see making a mistake about that.

541
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:08,838
Can you?

542
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,217
Johanna Hoffman told Lo the truth.

543
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:17,391
Johanna Hoffman?

544
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:20,093
You know the name?

545
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:23,559
From the last time I saw Lo.

546
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:31,502
You were going to meet us in the park.

547
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:34,153
Ah... Oh, my, you're absolutely right.

548
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:37,310
Where's my head? 
I... I lost track of time...silly me.

549
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,276
Uncle Noah said cotton candy 
is your favorite. / It is.

550
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,729
Thank you.

551
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:52,209
What are you working on 
that you forget us?

552
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,607
- Ah. Just my column. 
- Ah.

553
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:56,746
More questions about recipes?

554
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:59,695
No. No, not today.

555
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:04,736
Lo.

556
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,753
What is wrong?

557
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,071
This one's hard.

558
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:12,625
Why? What is it about?

559
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,632
A woman... 
who thought she was in love.

560
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:18,151
But the man she fell for 
wasn't who she thought he was.

561
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:20,905
If she loves him...

562
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:24,993
maybe who he is is okay.

563
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:29,131
No, this fella is smart 
and handsome and kind.

564
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:31,375
And for a while, 
she thought he hung the moon.

565
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,547
- Did he hurt her? 
- Not her.

566
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:36,390
Then what is the problem?

567
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,457
If there is love between two people,

568
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:42,480
nothing else matters.

569
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,969
The problem is things  
he's done in the past.

570
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:47,692
How can she believe them

571
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:53,439
if for her, he hangs the moon?

572
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,641
Miss Kinney, you have that letter?

573
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,603
Oh, yes, yes.

574
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:05,495
Here.

575
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:13,420
Going to a Miss Johanna Hoffman on pine?

576
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,968
Yes.

577
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:33,311
So Lo didn't receive that note,  
she wrote it to Johanna.

578
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,986
Sent it the day she died.

579
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:39,764
But Johanna had left Philly for good,  
so it went back to Lo.

580
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:45,785
Did your, um... 
uncle see this letter?

581
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,082
No.

582
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:55,293
But I told him what is said.

583
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,103
Anton stood by while 
your real uncle was killed,

584
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:05,056
and when Lo Kinney found out 
about his lies,

585
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,787
he killed her, too.

586
00:34:07,787 --> 00:34:12,069
I always wondered why he 
stopped talking about her.

587
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:14,988
Where is he?

588
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:21,625
Tell us, for Noah.

589
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,307
Anton.

590
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,554
Anton Bikker.

591
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,709
Where you going, Anton?

592
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,766
Why do you call me that?

593
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:42,030
Where do you think 
you can run to now?

594
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,454
My name is Noah Pool.

595
00:34:43,454 --> 00:34:45,095
Noah Pool is dead.

596
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:48,066
Talk to David, my nephew. 
He'll tell you.

597
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,478
We did talk to him.

598
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:53,668
Told him how you took his uncle's name  
to hide what you did during the war.

599
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:56,865
- Oh, he wouldn't believe that. 
- How do you think we found you?

600
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:00,590
He was disgusted by you, 
just like Lo.

601
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:05,515
- Lo saw who I was and loved me. 
- No.

602
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:08,531
When she knew the truth, 
she gave up on you.

603
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:13,165
- No, she was confused! 
- Heartbroken.

604
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,139
But she was going to do the right thing.

605
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:17,798
Expose you.

606
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:21,944
"This will not stand."

607
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:27,597
I am better than the worst thing I ever did.

608
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:34,647
I have to be able to go on now, to live. I...

609
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,085
That's asking too much.

610
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:46,778
She knew me! 
She should have been able to understand.

611
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,808
What you did, no one can understand.

612
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:57,523
If she had let herself love me...

613
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:02,605
it all would have been okay.

614
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:34,325
You were expecting Johanna. 
Why?

615
00:36:34,783 --> 00:36:37,314
I wanted to show her a story I wrote.

616
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:40,421
A story? 
A story about what?

617
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:45,558
A Nazi... who pretended to be a Jew.

618
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:48,324
Did you know that when the camps  
were finally liberated,

619
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:52,644
soldiers pushed empty baby carriages  
out the front gate... five at a time?

620
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,199
Why are you telling me this?

621
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,382
People watching said it took 
an hour for them all to pass by.

622
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,962
And you believe this woman 
more than you believe me?

623
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,999
Tell me your name.

624
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,868
Don't play games, Lo.

625
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:08,868
Tell me your name.

626
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:13,665
Johanna saw the photo,

627
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,580
the one we took together in the park.  
How could you?

628
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,922
I am not a monster.

629
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:22,050
Did you kill Noah Pool or  
just watch him die?

630
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,236
I watched him paint. 
Hour upon hour,

631
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:28,314
just the two of us,

632
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:32,453
talking about his family in America,

633
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:35,482
about a nephew David...

634
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:38,001
how he wanted to meet them on day,

635
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:41,786
and poetry and music and art.

636
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:45,169
And in those hours, I saw.

637
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:48,081
Saw?

638
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,338
He was a man.

639
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:57,744
Better than I. 
Forgive me.

640
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,536
- No one can forgive you. 
- You can.

641
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:05,082
Because you loved me. 
With you, I was free.

642
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,216
- You're wrong. 
- That day in the park, you understood

643
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,795
No, I didn't. 
Now let me go.

644
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,309
You know me! 
Better than anyone!

645
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:15,040
Noah Pool is dead, and  
everything I know is a lie!

646
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,250
How we feel about each other... 
that is not a lie!

647
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,313
I love you! 
And I know you love me!

648
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:25,418
No, Anton, no! 
I loved Noah.
