00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,890
The floolwing story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,510
March24,1947

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,450
All right,open up,son.
I can't do it by myself.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,090
Come on,no half-steppin',ladies.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,240
push it up.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,090
six feet,girls.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,730
First shift burrowed under the river five feet.
That means that we go six.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,990
That's a nice shiny new helmet there,nate.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,840
Couldn't get one with a little flashlight?

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,650
Wife wouldn't let me back down
in the hole without a hard hat.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
At least your old lady cares
if you get cracked in the dome.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,620
Oh,my sister treating you that bad these days?

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,230
What do you mean "these days"?

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,590
Tell you what alice cooked up last night,
but I don't want to rub it in.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,390
You're lucky you got a woman like that.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,990
Woman who don't give a man no quarter,you mean.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,230
cave-in or blowout don't get your father-in-law,
that cough will.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,850
He ought to retire.
Let someone carry the weight of foreman.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,040
- That'll be you,donny.
- You think?

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,810
Like I said,my wife's counting on you
to bring all of us up out of here.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,570
All them stories you tell...

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,930
it'd be nice to finally meet old alice.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,920
Not in this here world.

24
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,860
Down here every joe's blood runs brown--
same as the muck.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,740
But not up there.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,350
- Get back to work.
- Hey,nate!

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,890
Watch it there,nate.

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,460
Eight million ways to die every day.

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,120
Not today.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,590
Not today.

32
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,970
Figure on stretching that shirt out another day?

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,960
You want to check my shorts there too,hoss?

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,030
Transit workers found the body expanding the subway.

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,080
Five stories under the river.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,640
I ain't going down there.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,800
What's the matter,don't like tunnels?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,060
They got rats the size of badgers.

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,220
No,man,even the rats hate it down there.

40
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,730
Bulldozer broke through an old service tunnel.
Found the bones.

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,740
Still Adult male.
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Found behind a tunnel that got sealed in 1948.

43
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,580
Guy needs a paleontologist,not a detective.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,720
Could be one of those mole people?

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,430
Wasn't a mole,this was a sandhog.

46
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,680
- Sandhog?
- Urban miner.

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,660
Died with his boots on.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,150
S "compressed air worker,number 505.
"If found sick or unconscious,

49
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,450
"return to medical decompression lock
at bertleman construction site."

50
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,740
Sandhogs were required to carry those badges at all times,
in case of an attack of the bends.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,290
How's a miner get the bends?

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,460
Working deep underground in compressed air.

53
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,860
Tunnels,subways,sewers...
you name it.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,350
Say if it's deeper than a grave,a sandhog dug it.

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,350
Looks like this poor schmuck might have dug his own.

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,550
You see those miners trapped on the news,
they move heaven and earth to get a guy out.

57
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,790
At least,recover a body.

58
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,930
This guy didn't get left behind.

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,780
He got buried on purpose.

63
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,130
donuts...
is that some kind of cop joke?

64
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,460
What,cops are the only ones allowed
to eat fried dough?

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,550
- I never eat donuts.
- Never?

66
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,160
- oh,you have sugar on your cheek.
- Come on and get it.

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,280
- Get over here.
- Got to eat a donut first.

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,190
- I don't want a stupid donut.
- No,first.

69
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,830
Come on.

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,240
Fine.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
Give me the bag.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,180
Attagirl.

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,830
Pretty damn good.

74
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,350
I love you.

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,860
Yeah?

76
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,700
Yeah,definitely.

77
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,580
I,uh...

78
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,750
I don't know what to say.

79
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,110
Aw,you're a detective,you'll figure it out.

80
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,800
Look,okay,I gotta run.

81
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,810
- I'll call you later?
- Sure,right.

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,310
I had osha check the state archives
on this one...

83
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,940
compressed air 505 was registered
as a john donovan.

84
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,570
John "boomer" donovan.

85
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,890
You familiar?

86
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,030
Down-in-the-muck sandhog became head
of the local 37 back in the '40s.

87
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,850
He was reported missing in 1948.

88
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,420
Donovan turned hero after he took on
management then mysteriously disappeared.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,760
Know your sandhog history,boss.

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,170
Neighborhood I grew up in,lil,you either
became a cop,a fireman or a sandhog.

91
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,150
And I got this thing about being
burned or buried alive.

92
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,490
So how do we know oui@guy wasn't
just crushed in a cave-in?

93
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,130
disappeared on a sunday back in '48.

94
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,840
He wasn't down there working.

95
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,370
Theory at the time was donovan took on
management in a labor dispute.

96
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,300
Thought he bought himself a pair of cement shoes
and a one-way ticket to the bottom of the river.

97
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,520
Couldn't prove it without a body.

98
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,720
Only surviving next-of-k's a brother-in-law.
Robert mccallister.

99
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,930
An old sandhog?

100
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,260
Former head of the union.

101
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,950
If he's not at home,check down at
mulrooney's in devil's pocket.

102
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,010
What's that,a sandhog bar?

103
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,720
We got jones tavern,they got mulrooney'S.

104
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,340
Keep donovan's photo up there with
the top-shelf whiskey.

105
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,540
They're still buying him shots.

106
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,250
Donovan was married to your sister?

107
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,080
Yeah,I introduced 'em.

108
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,440
A lot of sandhogs in your family?

109
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,200
Third generation.

110
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,030
My old man spent 30 years in the hole.

111
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,440
Big mac.

112
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,780
Nice lighter.

113
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,280
Thanks.

114
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,800
A gift from big mac on my wedding day.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,920
Only thing that could hold a
flame in the tunnels.

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,560
We hear management had it out
for your brother-in-law.

117
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,210
Sam bertleman did.
Everyone knew it.

118
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,110
Head of bertleman construction?

119
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,550
None other.

120
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,010
The guys were going deaf down in the hole,
getting killed,maimed.

121
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,260
Didn't stop that greedy bastard.

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,510
But donovan tried to.

123
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,580
Donny became foreman,he was the only one
that had the stones to take the boss man on.

124
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,280
When did he start organizing the men?

125
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,880
Just after his pal nate died in the hole?

126
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,730
There was no stopping him.

127
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,610
Bobby

128
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,740
bobby!
- bobby!
- I'm here,pop.

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,610
Where's donny?

130
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,640
donny!

131
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,660
donny,you're ok?

132
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,010
you son of a bitch!

133
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,140
There was no masks in there,nothing!
You knew that!

134
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,040
- Leave it be!
- We didn't have a chance!

135
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,050
Nate?

136
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,040
nate?!

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,060
You're his wife?
You're alice?

138
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,120
Where is he?
Where is my husband?

139
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,760
You left him down there?

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,530
It happened so fast.

141
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,840
We could barely see.
The smoke was everywhere.

142
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,910
Nate?!

143
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,180
Nate!
Nate!

144
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,880
No!
Nate!

145
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,930
No....

146
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,720
wake up,nathan!
Wake up.

147
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,710
You promised me!

148
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,970
You promised me you'd come home to me!

149
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,990
Alice...

150
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm so sorry,alice.
I really am.

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,760
you were supposed to watch over him!
You were his friend!

152
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,540
Couldn't blame her.
But it was misdirected.

153
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,410
Bertleman didn't give a rat's ass about
the safety of any of his workers.

154
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,070
And that's when donovan started
organizing the men?

155
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,990
Few months later,he disappears.

156
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,840
Mary said he went off to the pub,
never came home.

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,410
You figure bertleman had your
brother-in-law killed?

158
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,800
Donovan was about to lead a walkout.

159
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,990
You tell me.

160
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,820
Sam bertlemen?

161
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,600
Somewhere we can talk?

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah.
I'm kind of busy right now.

163
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,780
So are we.

164
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,900
Just found john donovan's body in
a tunnel under the schuylkill.

165
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,370
Not to slow you down or anything.

166
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,240
It's got nothing to do with me.

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,960
Might have with your old man.

168
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,150
My father built this city,every damn tunnel.

169
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,190
You think that's the first body that's
turned up underground?

170
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,210
This is one of his workers.
A union leader,too.

171
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,630
Look,the last thing my old man wanted was
to make john donovan some kind of martyr.

172
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,600
Funny how he turned up dead,then.

173
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,140
They blamed my pops 'cause it was easier
than looking at one of their own.

174
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,340
You saying another sandhog did it?

175
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,070
All that band of brothers union stuff?
Bunch of B.S.

176
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,030
There's this one guy zaccardo,
always causing trouble.

177
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,530
It ain't right what happened to nate.

178
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,950
But not a damn thing's gonna change
till we make it change.

179
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,620
Wrong tree,donny boy.
Go bark somewheres else.

180
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,780
Nate was one of us,zaccardo.
One of our brothers. We owe him.

181
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,780
You wanna walk off the job over some dead spade?
Go ahead.

182
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,770
What'd you call him?

183
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,200
You crossed the line,making a fool of yourself
with that bugaboo widow in front of everyone.

184
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,380
Shut your mouth!

185
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,760
- Enough!
- Not your concern,old man.

186
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,940
You don't talk about her like that!

187
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,670
Shut up,donny.
It's over.

188
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,390
Oh,it ain't over.

189
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,450
I can promise you that.

190
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,740
scaling bar,huh?

191
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,910
Bash a man's skull in with that.

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,850
Donovan had stones,but mateo zaccardo
was a mean son of a bitch.

193
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,990
Didn't appreciate being humiliated.

194
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,300
You think he killed donovan?

195
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,000
He was a sandhog,and down in that hole,
anything can happen.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,220
Any idea where zaccardo ended up?

197
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,280
Last I heard,prison.

198
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Caved some poor bastard's head
in during a bar fight.

199
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,650
Life for second degree murder.

200
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,720
Killed a man with a crowbar outside a bar.

201
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,610
guy had it coming.

202
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,610
Did john donovan?

203
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,830
You had motive,opportunity,a serious beef.

204
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,550
He work for you?

205
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,650
It's time to set the record straight...

206
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,360
clear your conscience.

207
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
Your age,the D.A. Might work out a deal.
Time served.

208
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,050
I'll talk to you.

209
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,530
Or you can rot in prison for all I care.

210
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,750
It's always something with them.

211
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,760
What about you and donovan?

212
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,110
We had a difference of opinion.
We worked it out.

213
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,040
I'll bet.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,220
Just because I wasn't gonna strike
don't mean I killed the guy.

215
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,330
No?

216
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,440
Then who did?

217
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,280
It was the coloreds.

218
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,950
They blamed him for stallworth's death.

219
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,760
You mean the west indian sandhogs?

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,590
West indians,afro-americans.

221
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,700
They can call themselves whatever they want.

222
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,090
They had it in for donovan in the worst way.

223
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,460
And how would you know?

224
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,310
Only place near the dig to get refills pwas
a coffee shop served coloreds.

225
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,570
So long as as you didn't touch
the silverware,it was fine.

226
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,970
coffee,please.

227
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,730
be ready in a minute.

228
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,830
It's good,you found something.

229
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,650
- Cream or sugar?
- Just black.

230
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,140
Like this place used to be?

231
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,770
the boys at the hoghouse passed the hat.

232
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,290
It ain't much.
It's the best we can do.

233
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,530
nate was right.

234
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,030
You give a man no quarter.

235
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,200
nate told you that?

236
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,350
He told me a lot of things.

237
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,510
Did he now.

238
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,880
- I miss him,too,alice.
- Not like I do.

239
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,210
What about getting her what's due?

240
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,980
The union is working on getting
some kind of settlement.

241
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,770
Me and nate,we paid our dues regular.

242
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,850
Bad enough we get shut out for the best jobs.

243
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,720
- I hear you,bishop.
- Do you?

244
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,880
Maybe a white man gotta die down in that hole
for the union sit up and take notice.

245
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
That it?

246
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,130
I'm gonna go.

247
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,740
Take care now.

248
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,550
I will.

249
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,740
you think bishop made good on that threat?

250
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,300
Well,put it this way.

251
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,430
I wasn't the only sandhog who ever served time.

252
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,300
Bishop had a record.

253
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,200
And a bad attitude.

254
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,730
You were never paid a settlement?

255
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,300
Bertlemen wouldn't give a dime for
a black man's life.

256
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,840
Bishop was pretty upset about it.

257
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,350
He was all bark,no bite.

258
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,950
You two keep in touch?

259
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,650
He passed...

260
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,690
20 years ago.

261
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,340
And,no,we didn'T.

262
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,180
What about you,alice?

263
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,300
You were pretty upset with donovan,too.

264
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,310
I was upset that my husband died
and I can't make the rent.

265
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,700
Donovan helped me in a time of need.

266
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Donovan come by regular to give you money?

267
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,290
To check on me.
To see how I was getting by.

268
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,290
He ever talk about work,anybody
who might've had in for him?

269
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,950
No.

270
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,210
Mostly,we...
just talk about nate.

271
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,140
Now,you like talking to him,hmm--

272
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,800
donovan?

273
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,420
He was the first man to make me laugh again.

274
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,040
Got to be I looked forward to seeing
him on his way home from a shift.

275
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,420
Sounds like donovan was there quite a bit.

276
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,460
Well,he didn't have much to go home to.

277
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,850
Meaning his wife?

278
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,050
Couldn't get pregnant,
so she crawled up inside a bottle.

279
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,000
He didn't talk about it much,and...
and I didn't ask.

280
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,750
Back then,people stuck it out...

281
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,260
even if it didn't make sense.

282
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,520
Just the times.

283
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,660
He was still married and white,
and I was neither.

284
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,270
Did that stop you?

285
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,160
One night,we were talking longer than usual...

286
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,740
and finally we just run out of things to say.

287
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,370
listen to that.

288
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,520
Ah,nothing in the world quite like it.

289
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,130
Like what?

290
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,430
The blues.

291
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,490
Nate always said you liked your music.

292
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,930
It ain't just music.

293
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,080
No?
Then what?

294
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,270
Makes me feel like I'm not alone
listening to that.

295
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,820
it's good to see you smile again.

296
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,180
Nate--
he always used to say a smile like that,

297
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
light up every tunnel in the city.

298
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,440
Come on now.

299
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,480
I always wondered what he meant.
Now I know.

300
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,280
ought to be getting home now.

301
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,230
All right.

302
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,810
- night.
- Good night.

303
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,510
what'd you say this song was called again?

304
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,680
I never said it.

305
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,410
- You like it?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,130
Yeah,I like it.

307
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,870
I like everything about it.

308
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,210
who is it?

309
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,340
Satchmo.

310
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,150
Hey.

311
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,930
Hey what?

312
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
You're not alone.

313
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,670
White,married man,black woman.

314
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,180
That could get you in trouble today.

315
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,500
I knew it couldn't last and it didn'T.

316
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,160
Must have been tough to let that go.

317
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,870
Anybody else know?

318
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,970
Just the brother-in-law.

319
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,250
Bobby mccallister?

320
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,630
Hey,lil.

321
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,880
Want to go for a ride?

322
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,570
What are you doing here?

323
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,270
Oh,gee,ray,it's nice to see you too,you know.
Hey.

324
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,400
I'd love to go for a spin.

325
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,140
Sorry.

326
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,180
At least I got a smile.

327
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,620
Nice to see you,ray.

328
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,890
You know,the way,uh...

329
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,380
we left it last time,that was...
nice.

330
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,560
Look,I,uh...

331
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,930
I gotta go.

332
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,960
Something I did wrong?

333
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,930
Something he did right.

334
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,180
You didn't take the call.

335
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,420
I'm not taking a ride with you either.

336
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,970
Come on.
I just want to talk.

337
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,090
So talk.

338
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,950
Okay.

339
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,590
I,uh,I got hooked into this deal with a bunch
of street bikes up in bayonne,with my shop.

340
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,930
Turned out to be hot.

341
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,030
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

342
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,170
Call in a favor with the jersey state police?

343
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,370
I'm serious,lil.

344
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,600
These guys are,too.

345
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,190
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,820
Not this time.

347
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,290
Okay.

348
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,550
So,uh...

349
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,130
so...

350
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,030
See you around,ray.

351
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,160
Come on,bobby

352
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,330
You knew that donovan was stepping
out on your sister.

353
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,980
- With the widow of a sandhog.
- A black woman,no less.

354
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,810
Why open that up?

355
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,160
Bring shame to my family?

356
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,440
Dishonor my sister like that?

357
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,260
Oh,so this was a family matter?
That how you dealt with it,bobby?

358
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,990
I know mary had her problems,
but donovan was out of control.

359
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,690
Still Out of control how?

360
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,670
You gotta realize,donny had a lot
bigger problems on his plate.

361
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,750
Like what,bobby?

362
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,150
He was going ahead with the walkout,

363
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,520
but he had no idea what he was walking into.

364
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,020
chan of plans.
Things are getting stepped up.

365
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,950
Stepped up?

366
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,460
We need to know who's with us now.
Can't wait.

367
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,480
Why all of a sudden?

368
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,580
I think bertleman found out about the walkout.

369
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,500
What is it,bobby?

370
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,260
Heard bertleman hired goons.
Pinkertons.

371
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,130
- Who told you that?
- Guys are talking,donny.

372
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,380
Those pinkerton thugs are good for only one thing--
cracking skulls.

373
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,300
Guys don't need to hear that now.

374
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,160
Means the boss is brining in scabs,
and I got a family to feed.

375
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,770
What are you saying?
You're out?

376
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,900
Look,bobby,things get rough,
I need to know i can count on you.

377
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,360
Don't you see?

378
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,760
Bertleman knows what you're planning,
he knows everything.

379
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,120
What?
How's he know?

380
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,940
Aw,no.

381
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,730
- I'm sorry.
- Bobby.

382
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,080
He threatened my job.

383
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,850
Big mac,too.

384
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,390
I had kids.
A family.

385
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,940
So you told.

386
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,080
I'm sorry,donny.

387
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,930
I never forgot the look in donny's eyes.

388
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,820
You never mentioned it.

389
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,990
Couldn't have help your big union career.

390
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,020
You being a stooge and all.

391
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,710
It's something I'm not proud of,believe me.

392
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,970
He was like a brother to me.

393
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,880
You got any idea what that's like?

394
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,690
What,bobby?

395
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,500
Wondering if I was the one that got him killed.

396
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,880
Hey,you.

397
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,520
Hey.

398
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,770
- Hey.
- Hi.

399
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,140
What's going on?

400
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,670
I got a meeting over in family court this afternoon,
and so I figured I'd stop by,see if you ate lunch.

401
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,190
Oh,uh,yeah.
I kinda ate on the run. This case.

402
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,980
Yeah.
No,I figured as much.

403
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,160
I know you called last night.
I,um,just got...

404
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,900
caught up on the job.

405
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,160
No,forget it. I was just seeing
if you wanted to gb dinner. That's all.

406
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,510
It turned into a long night.

407
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,940
Don't worry about it.
Some other time.

408
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,460
Great. Uh.
Maybe tonight?

409
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,860
Uh...
we'll see.

410
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,590
look,I better run.

411
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,900
- Wait.
- What?

412
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,640
Just a second.

413
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,990
I love you,too.

414
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,880
You don't have to say it just 'cause I did.

415
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,070
No,I want to say it.

416
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Okay.

417
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,990
Hey,kids!

418
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,950
- Hey,guys.
- Nick vera.

419
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,460
Joseph shaw.

420
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,620
- I remember.
- Yeah.

421
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,700
Will jeffries.

422
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,270
So you're still in town?

423
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah,I'm working with the dhs,court
and community services.

424
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,650
Yeah,that's right,delinquent youth.

425
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,940
At-risk juveniles,yeah.

426
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,270
-It's good work.
- Yeah. I-I think so.

427
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,920
We better go.

428
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,410
Why can't I meet a nice girl at a halfway house?

429
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,310
Save it.

430
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,500
I didn't know the guy stuck around philly.

431
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,220
Well,now you do.
Anything new on bertleman?

432
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,070
Mccallister's story checks out.

433
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,500
Turns out bertleman was going to squash
the strike by hiring pinkertons.

434
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,010
Goons for hire.

435
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,900
Specialize in bashing skulls.

436
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,160
Might explain the blunt-force trauma.

437
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,030
Real interesting guy,your old man.

438
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,110
Not the most ethical,but...
interesting.

439
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,950
He was a businessman.
Sometimes you gotta play hardball.

440
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,890
Yeah,the pinkertons were pretty handy with a bat.

441
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,120
He ever tell you about them?

442
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,440
Heard about that,but he didn't need
them to deal with donovan.

443
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,850
That rig?

444
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,030
already had him over a barrel.

445
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,830
What do you mean?
Donovan was for sale?

446
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,450
No.Let's just say donovan put himself
in an untenable position.

447
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,360
yeah.

448
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,020
That's something,ain't it?

449
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,760
You wanted to see me?

450
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,320
I know what you're planning,son.
I'm here to tell you it ain't gonna happen.

451
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,650
Ain't up to you,mr.Bertleman.

452
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,310
Either you drop this whole strike nonsense,

453
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,350
or your life's about to get a whole lot bumpier.
Got me?

454
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,410
The only way you're gonna stop this strike,
is across the table hearing our demands.

455
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,080
I don't think you're hearing me.

456
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,180
We lost a good man down in the hole--

457
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,790
nate stallworth,you might recall the name.

458
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,470
I can't be threatened,and I ain't for sale.

459
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,790
No.

460
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,130
Kinda figured that already,son.

461
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,580
And if I get hurt,that's just gonna put
more of a fire in the boys' bellies.

462
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,160
You're right.
But...

463
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,960
if another poor colored woman disappears on
her way home from work,

464
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,440
well,ain't nobody really miss her but you.

465
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,000
You son of a bitch.

466
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,230
It's my job to know what's going on.

467
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,090
What'd you say your friend's name was again?

468
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,440
You think about that real hard.

469
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,940
You leave her alone.

470
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,960
Now get your shovel and get back to work.

471
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,160
One thing I learned from my daddy
about being the boss--

472
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,900
most times it ain't what you do,
it's what people think you're capable of.

473
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,380
But alice lived.

474
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,880
He never laid a hand on her.
Heard she left town.

475
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,580
That right?
When?

476
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,190
Around the time donovan disappeared.

477
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,360
Alice stallworth left philadelphia
on april 28 of 1948.

478
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,150
The same day donovan went missing.

479
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,610
Right.
Move to chester,pa.

480
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,660
What's in chester?

481
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,760
I thought maybe a relative,
but we couldn't locate anyone.

482
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,470
Found this instead.

483
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,530
Hospital record from november,1948.

484
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,100
- Alice was sick?
- Not sick--

485
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,880
pregnant.
She gave birth to a nine-pound baby boy.

486
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,640
Nate had been dead 11 months.
No way he could have been the father.

487
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,050
So alice was pregnant when she left town.

488
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,970
With donovan's baby.

489
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,150
We know you left philadelphia,alE.

490
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,340
The same day donovan disappeared.

491
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,090
Like I said before,things got complicated.

492
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,070
Well,they were already complicated.
Him married,you a widow.

493
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,950
Black,white.

494
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,780
I know all the reasons
why it was wrong back then,thank you.

495
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,150
But then you found yourself pregnant.

496
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,860
It was foolishness from the jump.

497
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,500
I shoulda known better.

498
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,450
Donovan.

499
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,420
You gave your son his name.

500
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,470
I wanted to remember him...

501
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,520
to remember his words.

502
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,780
You're not alone.

503
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,040
Tell me what happened the night
he disappeared,alice.

504
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,540
I should have known it wouldn't last.

505
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,390
Something that special never does.

506
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,200
will you relax,baby?
You're gonna wear out the floor.

507
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,300
that the one big mac gave you?

508
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,330
When I made foreman.

509
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,470
Oh,that means something.
He chose you to lead those man.

510
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,800
Sometimes you gotta make touch choices,
choices you don't want to make.

511
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,670
Come close.
Got something special to tell you.

512
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,180
What's wrong,baby?
You here,but you ain't here.

513
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,610
This has to end,you and me.

514
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,170
What?

515
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,380
You knew this was going to happen.

516
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,820
What's really going on,donny?

517
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,340
You know what the boys would say
if they found out?

518
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,770
- Since when do you care about that?
- I'm a married man,alice.

519
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,770
Do you love her?

520
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,410
Even if I left my wife,which I can't,
you know it could never work.

521
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,800
That's not what I asked you.

522
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,490
Oh,come on,alice.
Us?

523
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,580
Out there?

524
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,920
Forget it.

525
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,420
do you love me?

526
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,170
no,I don'T.

527
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,760
go to new york,
someplace you can start over.

528
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,540
- I can send you money.
- Get out.

529
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,950
Alice...

530
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,690
I'm so sorry.

531
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,870
Not like I am.

532
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,320
I never listened to that song again.

533
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,180
You ever tell your son about him?

534
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,680
It was just me.

535
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,640
I was all he ever knew.

536
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,830
Donovan's lighter,the one with the cross...

537
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,720
big mac gave it to him?

538
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,090
Alice...

539
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,650
donovan was trying to protect you.

540
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,810
Protect me?

541
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,640
He was about to take on some guys
that played rough.

542
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,580
Didn't want you to get hurt.

543
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,790
He broke it off so you'd leave.

544
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,310
Maybe he was just a man afraid of the times.

545
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,930
Or maybe he just loved you.

546
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,440
Built to last forever,those things.

547
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,220
You know,once they even found
one inside the belly of a fish.

548
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,390
They pulled it out,and it lit right up...

549
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,390
very first time.

550
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,770
It still works for me.

551
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,740
Nothing lasts forever,right?

552
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,970
Except the statute of limitations on murder.

553
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,980
This wasn't a wedding present from your father,
was it,bobby?

554
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,600
Big mac gave it to donovan when
he made him foreman.

555
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,150
Not you.

556
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,750
Belongs to me.

557
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,290
The only way you could have that lighter is
if you saw donovan the night he disappeared.

558
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,620
I was a sandhog,too,you know?
20 in the hole.

559
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,380
But you got passed over by your own father.

560
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,620
He made donovan foreman.

561
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,430
I was his son.

562
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,850
His blood.

563
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,530
The good one.

564
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,890
You'd think he'd respect you more.

565
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,700
He treated me like a mope with a muck stick.

566
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,260
Like I couldn't do anything more.

567
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,920
And donovan could do no wrong.

568
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,280
Donovan the natural.

569
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,480
Donovan the leader.

570
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,740
Nothing you did was ever good enough.

571
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,000
Damned if I was gonna sit back and watch
him become the big hero.

572
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,720
Instead it was you,bobby.

573
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,620
With donovan gone,
you became president of local 37.

574
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,790
Achieved what he never got a chance to do.

575
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,910
I did what I had to do.

576
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,280
You got rid of him.

577
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,310
Finally.

578
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,210
Hmbut you know the worst part?

579
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,460
They went and turned him into a damned saint.

580
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,220
Heard there were scabs down here.

581
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,190
**********

582
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,800
Aw,look at this.

583
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,390
Idiots were in the dynamite.

584
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,850
Lucky they didn't blow a head off.

585
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,120
Better check the rest of the supplies.

586
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,750
- I'll check over at the shaft.
- All right.

587
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,740
Watch your step.

588
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,130
They probably left the misfires in the muck.

589
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,810
Bobby,I'm glad you're with us.
Rough as it's gonna get.

590
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,050
Couldn't live with myself,
letting you go it alone.

591
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,770
In the long run,
it's gonna be better for all of us.

592
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,770
All because of you.

593
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,760
What is it?

594
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,090
- Donovan?
- Yeah?

595
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,560
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,330
Here.

597
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,540
Thanks.

598
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,900
Bobby?

599
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,240
Always gotta be the hero.

600
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,260
What are you talking about?

601
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,610
Bobby?
What are you doing?

602
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,840
Not this time.

603
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,910
Bobby...

604
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,760
bobby... help me,

605
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,390
bobby...

606
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,700
Bobby...

607
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,120
alice...

608
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,960
you're not alone.

609
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,830
I wonder,my little darling

610
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,080
where can you be this moonlit night?

611
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,370
Are you holding someone tight,baby?

612
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,810
I wonder

613
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,360
my heart is aching,

614
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,000
but I'm a fool

615
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,730
to let it go on breaking

616
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,250
maybe I'll awake to find that I'm mistaken

617
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,090
mm,I wonder

618
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,320
baby,since we're through,
I've been through lovers' lane

619
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,440
but in my heart,there's only pain

620
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:51,270
you went traveling,but will it last?

621
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,160
Well,I'm traveling nowhere fast

622
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,930
mm,sweetheart,mm,sweetheart

623
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,260
I wonder where,where,where,little baby

624
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,450
if this new love dies where will you be?

625
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,680
Will your heart come running back to me?

626
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,420
Mm,baby,I just wonder.
