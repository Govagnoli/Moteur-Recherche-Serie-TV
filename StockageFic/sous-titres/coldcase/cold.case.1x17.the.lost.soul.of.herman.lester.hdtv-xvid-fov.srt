(http://club.nate.com/tsm)

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:17,690
Come on, guys! 
Over here, now!

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,241
Listen up, listen up.

6
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,067
We're down one and we need a score.

7
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,789
You boys do what I tell you, 
you'll be state champinos!

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,653
I want the ball in Herman's hand.

9
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:28,724
The rest of you guys just clear 
out of his way, you understand?

10
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,439
All right, bring it in. 
Saints on three.

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,933
- One, two, three... 
- Saints!

12
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,585
Herman...

13
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:38,484
Put us your back and get us a win.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,615
Let's go, Herman, baby!

15
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:42,212
Herman, Herman, 
do your uncle right, baby.

16
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:43,306
Do your uncle right!

17
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,443
Please, Lord, give young Herman 
the strength to do me right.

18
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,669
Please! Come on, Herman. 
Come on, baby.

19
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:51,489
Let's do it, baby. 
Come on.

20
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:26,813
You figure 6:00 a.m.'s the right 
time to start the day, boss?

21
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,239
These guys have been 
here for an hour, Lil.

22
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:32,198
You ever hear of Herman Lester?

23
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,372
No.

24
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:35,807
Ah, he's only the best basketball 
player who ever lived.

25
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,855
Yeah? / And died.

26
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:42,206
He was murdered on a playground 
court in 1987. Never sloved.

27
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,844
So what are we doing here?

28
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,863
You see the kid with the ball?

29
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,937
That's Herman's son.

30
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,379
Ball never touches the floor.

31
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,206
And make the layup now.
Let's go!

32
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,053
John. / Coach.

33
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,810
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,675
This is Detective Rush.

35
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,681
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

36
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,824
Look, look, watch this.

37
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:18,885
Doesn't have Herman's 
size, but ... more range.

38
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,095
And the same confidence.

39
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:23,445
I tell you, John, it's like 
coaching Herman all over again.

40
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,032
Hey, Ray! Come here!

41
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,429
Let's have him walk us
through this phone call he got.

42
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,152
Some kind of threat?

43
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,898
Ray, these are Philadelphia police.

44
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:31,668
Gonna help us out.

45
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:33,908
Hey. / Hey.

46
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,992
Hi, Ray.

47
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:38,103
Want to tell us about 
the phone call you got?

48
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,292
Not much to it.

49
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,460
I'm home, pick up the phone and hear.

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,699
If I play Friday night,

51
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,267
I'm gonna get the screwdriver, 
just like my dad.

52
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,515
Screwdriver?

53
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:49,032
It was the murder weapon.

54
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,794
So... what's Friday night?

55
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,941
State championship.

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,683
Uh, no idea who it was 
male, female, young, old?

57
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:05,595
Male. Can't say about the rest.

58
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,026
Ray, you having any problem in school?

59
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,106
Any issues on or off the court?

60
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,164
Nah. Things are cool.

61
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,077
Okay, Ray. Thanks.

62
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,837
Back out there.

63
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:19,547
I need him in the lineup Friday.

64
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,036
Do really think this threat is 
connected to Herman's murder?

65
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,716
Well, the kid's a phenom like his dad.

66
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,798
They both lead their teams 
to the state championship.

67
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,302
Herman gets murdered,

68
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:32,960
now Ray gets this death threat.

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,689
Enough connection for me.

70
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,764
We'll check with the phone company,

71
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:38,547
see if we can trace where 
the call came from.

72
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,385
And pull Herman Lester's case.

73

I wish you'd have eaten more.

83
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,425
- I ate all the melon.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:24,775
Yeah, and you made sure the 
home fries didn't go to waste.

85
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,855
I like being out here.

86
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:31,486
In the cold.

87
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:38,712
I'll get you a cab. / Yeah?

88
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,065
What? What is it?

89
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,941
There's a giant behind you.

90
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:46,822
What?

91
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:48,735
Well, look for yourself.

92
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,788
Yeah, look for yourself.

93
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:53,688
Oh, man.

94
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,830
What... what are you doing here?

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,735
Just getting my coffee.

96
00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,440
What are you doing here?

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,037
Uh, uh, just, uh, coffee.

98
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,652
- Will Jeffries.
- Elisa.

99
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,973
Sorry. Bonehead.
We work together.

100
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,474
Pleasure to meet you.

101
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:13,063
See you at work, Scotty.

102
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,699
Yeah.

103
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:22,423
So, uh, a cab, right?

104
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:33,643
Guess, uh, Jeffries is 
kind of a giant, ain't he?

105
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,834
Probably should've said "big".

106
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,279
If Herman Lester had lived,

107
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,044
folks around here would think 
of Dr.J as just another player.

108
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:45,433
Come on, boss.

109
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,013
The good doctor would jump so high,

110
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:49,118
he could pick a dollar off 
the top of the backboards.

111
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,988
Scotty, Herman Lester 
would leave change.

112
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,019
Whatever Herman did, 
he returned to earth

113
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,278
and caught the wrong end 
of a Phillips screwdriver.

114
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:00,348
Yeah. Pierced once through the heart.

115
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:03,350
And bled out like a mere mortal
on the court at Player's Park.

116
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,346
Suspects?

117
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,681
One. Billy Berkenpass, a teammate.

118
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,790
Good player in his own right, 
but no Herman.

119
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,716
Says here that was the problem.

120
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,880
Berknepass hated playing 
second fiddle to Herman.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,315
Attitude got him booted off the team.

122
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,732
He missed the state championship 
same night Herman dead.

123
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,455
Yeah, he lost out in love, too.

124
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:22,017
Tanya Williams dumped Berkenpass 
for Herman a few months earlier.

125
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,384
Double motive.

126
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:28,018
Footnote says maybe Herman was iced
by a bagman from a top 20 school?

127
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,350
Sounds like urban legend.

128
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,033
Yeah, smart money was on Berkenpass. 
On top of everything else.

129
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:35,115
20 kids saw him confront Herman
at an after-game party that night.

130
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:36,180
So why didn't he go down?

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,065
No hard evidence,
and he had an alibi.

132
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,395
Time of the murder, he claimed 
he was home with his dad.

133
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:43,868
Aw, Dad vouching for 
you ain't exactly airtight.

134
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:46,654
Are we sure this job is 
connected to Ray's death threat?

135
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:47,428
Well, seems like it.

136
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:51,612
Especially since the threat was made 
from a pay phone at the City Center Rec.

137
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:54,916
Yeah, and guess who hoops it up 
there, every day over lunch hour.

138
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,889
Berkenpass.

139
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,946
Your son says he was with you
the night Herman Lester was killed.

140
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,552
Yeah, we sat in front of 
the tube till 3:00 a.m.

141
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:05,582
You always watch TV that late?

142
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:06,924
No, just that night.

143
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,981
Good, Bad and the Ugly was on.

144
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:12,157
Got a pretty specific memory there.

145
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,665
I've only been asked the 
question about 90 times.

146
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,244
Hey, hey, hey!

147
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,599
No reason for you to touch that.

148
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:25,935
So, that night...

149
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,598
Billy must've been pretty steamed,
after what happened to him.

150
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:29,378
What do you mean?

151
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:32,452
Him getting kicked off the team, 
missing the big game.

152
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,671
My kid got screwed.

153
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:36,643
Plus, Herman taking up with 
his ex-girlfriend, Tanya, right?

154
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,220
Got screwed twice.

155
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,499
He was better off losing the girl.

156
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,489
You didn't like her?

157
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,452
I don't like any girls in the picture.

158
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:47,636
Women weaking legs. 
That's no good for basketball.

159
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,296
Look, it's admirable,

160
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,144
- you defending your boy all the time...
- Yeah, somebody had to.

161
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:57,107
Within 24 hours, you cops were all 
over that boy for the murder of Lester.

162
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:59,518
The kid was 17 years old.

163
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,091
I guess you didn't get enough,

164
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,226
'cause now you're at it again.

165
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,909
Why are you asking about Herman?

166
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,963
We're reopening his murder case.

167
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:19,177
No, leave it alone. Leave it.

168
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:22,281
Tanya, we think looking at Herman's 
case will help your son's situation.

169
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:22,784
How?

170
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:25,317
Tanya, let Uncle Freddie handle this.

171
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,256
I'm the man who raised Herman,

172
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,040
and I been like a father to Ray, too.

173
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,164
So tell me.
How will it help?

174
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,960
We think Billy Berkenpass may 
have made the call to Ray.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,879
- That's the dude who killed dad?
- We don't know that.

176
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,510
Oh, that white boy was 
so jealous of your pop!

177
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,634
Freddie, don't start.

178
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,203
Ray, you recognize this guy?

179
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:48,308
Oh, man... that's The Ghost.

180
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:49,738
"The Ghost"?

181
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:52,491
When I'm out playing pickup, 
he's there watching.

182
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,305
White dude looks at me funny.

183
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:56,991
How long's this been going on?

184
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,247
Ever since I started making 
a name for myself.

185
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,559
Maybe about two years ago.

186
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,126
- The Ghost ever approach you?
- Nah.

187
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,337
That's it!
Uncle Freddie's stepping in.

188
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:06,996
Ray ain't playing Friday.

189
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,836
You said there'd be security, 
right? / Right.

190
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:10,224
No, no, no! No risk!

191
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:12,531
The boy is going League, understand?

192
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:13,725
League?

193
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:18,581
NBA pro scouts already got Ray marked 
down as a first-round draft choice.

194
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:21,128
Ray hasn't decided where he's 
going next year, Freddie, so shut it.

195
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,601
Hopefully, we clear this whole 
thing before the game.

196
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,635
Are you sure Billy called my son?

197
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,652
Not a hundred percent.

198
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:31,164
I never believed he killed Herman.

199
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,953
No?

200
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:36,893
Me and Billy dated.
I knew him.

201
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:41,217
It'd really help if you'd tell us what 
you remember about that night, Tanya.

202
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,810
We won the state championship...

203
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:46,839
then there was a party.

204
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:01,552
Philly Tech says he's their guy.

205
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:05,738
But off the court, this man is mine.

206
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:08,255
Where the hell's Herman?

207
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,307
Billy... what are you doing here?

208
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:14,646
Being friends.

209
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,431
Isn't that what you said, Tanya? 
We'd be friends?

210
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,385
Yo, don't be mad at her, man.

211
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,550
Okay, I'll be mad at you.

212
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,269
You take my girl, I'm 
supposed to be cool with it?

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,471
- Oh, man, you're drunk.
- Don't you walk away from me...

214
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:34,884
Let him up, let him up, let him up!
Come on. Get off him!

215
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,686
Get off him.

216
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:41,592
You want to talk, Billy?

217
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,564
No.

218
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:47,496
I'm on your home court here.

219
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,370
I'll catch you later.

220
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,384
How did Herman end up 
in Player's Park that night?

221
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,261
He'd go there to clear his head.

222
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,161
What's Player's Park?

223
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,347
It's across town.
It's where your dad died.

224
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:16,862
Back in Herman's day that's where 
a player would go to prove himself.

225
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:20,220
We'll let you know what 
we find out, Tanya.

226
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:34,537
- Billy Berkenpass?
- Yes?

227
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:38,551
Detectives Valens and Rush.
Can we have a minute?

228
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,759
Doing real good, Michael.

229
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,144
Can we...?

230
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,513
Should have known you 
people would show up.

231
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,309
Why is that?

232
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,180
Everyone knows Ray Lester 
got a death threat.
I'm sure you think I made it.

233
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,360
The call was made from 
the City Center Rec.

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,549
Where you play ball every day.

235
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,496
Guess someone's trying 
to make me look bad.

236
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,575
We got some prints off the phone.

237
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,118
One of them gonna be yours, Billy.

238
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,418
I'll let you find that out for yourself.

239
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,667
Let's talk about 1987, when your 
teammate Herman died...

240
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,558
Knew this was coming.

241
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,440
... not long after Tanya 
broke up with you for him.

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,548
That pretty hard on you?

243
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,442
Yeah. First heartbreak.

244
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:23,049
What happened?

245
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:26,777
Black girl. White guy.
The world wasn't rooting for us.

246
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:30,592
Hey, sports question: 
think much of Ray's game?

247
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,297
Paper says he's the second 
coming of Herman.

248
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,317
- What do you say?
- I've seen him a lot.

249
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:37,661
He's as good as advertised.

250
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:42,513
I didn't call that kid, 
I didn't kill Herman.

251
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:45,630
Right. "Home with your dad."

252
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,884
So, if it wasn't you, Billy,
who was it?

253
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:52,769
Recuriting was out of 
control over Herman.

254
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,320
One coach handed him a motel key,
said he had a super model waiting for him.

255
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,483
Saying Herman took that room key?

256
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:04,337
Not that one, but I saw 
him take another key.

257
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:34,958
I mean, who knows how many 
programs Herman took gifts from.

258
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,596
But a player can only 
make one school happy.

259
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:41,431
Herman was about to piss off 
a university, so they kill him?

260
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,145
Pretty far out theory, Billy.

261
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:46,165
Maybe not a president, 
or a dean, but...

262
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:50,169
you'd be suprised what the round 
ball's made grown men do.

263
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,924
Yeah, there was a car... for a day.

264
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,717
I got right in Herman's face, told him 
the car goes back where it came from.

265
00:14:58,717 --> 00:14:59,660
Which was where?

266
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
Well, that I didn't need to know.

267
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,494
Bottom line, Herman was 
on the bus the next day.

268
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:07,975
Billy Berkenpass thinks Herman 
received other under-the-table gifts.

269
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,872
Billy Berkenpass has been 
trying to muddy Herman's name

270
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,660
since the day I kicked him off the team.

271
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,184
What happened there?

272
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,641
I guess enough time has passed.

273
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,466
I'll tell you.

274
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,979
That's right. I'm talking about 
you and Big Ed Brown.

275
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:28,771
- You better watch your mouth, man!
- Hey, what the hell's problem?

276
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,894
- Herman don't want to win tonight.
- That's crap!

277
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:33,801
'Cause his bookie, Big Ed Brown, 
he owns Herman.

278
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:35,185
That's not true, coach. Come on.

279
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,538
Then why'd he offer me 500 bucks
to join you in messing the game?

280
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,456
- Don't you lie, Billy.
- It's the truth. He's on the take.

281
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,625
You gonna talk about Herman 
like that you're off this team!

282
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,358
Coach! / You're off this team!

283
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,252
He'd saying anything 
to take down to Herman.

284
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:03,993
Attitude problem three years running.

285
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,610
Nothing to his allegations?

286
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,881
Herman won the game for us.

287
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,995
Shook four guys and 
dunked on a seven-footer.

288
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:14,415
End of story, okay?

289
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,282
End of story.

290
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:25,096
- Oh! Boy, he missed a bunny.
- That's like three in a row.

291
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,382
- '87 State Championship?
- Yeah.

292
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,785
Herman's last night on earth.

293
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,949
He turned the ball over again.

294
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,363
Okay, and now here's the end.

295
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:45,808
Okay. Freeze it, Scotty.

296
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,652
Now, he just won the championship,

297
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:56,149
and everyone else is going 
wild, but look at Herman.

298
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,448
Nothing.

299
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:02,009
Maybe he agreed to throw the game,
but in the end couldn't do it.

300
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,094
That would explain why he's not smiling.

301
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:06,705
And maybe why he got killed.

302
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,827
So, was that the lady keeps calling you?

303
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:18,885
Don't do that.

304
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:21,103
- Do what?
- Sneak up on me.

305
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:23,162
- I'm not sneaking up on you.
- I meant just like on the street with Elisa.

306
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:27,931
Look, don't shadow me, okay?
Especially if you see me with her.

307
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:34,548
What was that about?

308
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:37,920
I don't know.
Guy's losing it?

309
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:39,520
Hey, boss.

310
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,059
For you. Big Ed Brown, the guy 
Berkenpass said approached him.

311
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,159
Longtime bookie.

312
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,071
Illegal lottery, bookmaking; spanked 
with a bunch of probation, no jail time.

313
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,710
Maybe Vice has something on him.

314
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,619
See if I can get a hammer on him.

315
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:51,671
Hey, where's Lil?

316
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,740
Went to check with Ray to see

317
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,011
if he's been approached about 
throwing this Friday's game.

318
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,915
Mm. See if history's repeating itself.

319
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,900
Ray, can I steal you for a minutes?

320
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:16,467
You catch that guy who 
called me? / Not yet.

321
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,583
I gotta ask you, Ray,

322
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,610
did anyone offer you money 
to fix the game this Friday?

323
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,077
No way.

324
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,209
How about other games 
during the season?

325
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:28,260
College boosters putting 
pressure on you, or...?

326
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,999
Coach keeps all the shady dudes away.

327
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:33,537
But coach can't be everywhere 
at once, you know?

328
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:34,769
Why you asking this stuff?

329
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,551
Recuriting was crazy for your dad.

330
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:38,683
People were trying to get to 
him in all sorts of ways.

331
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,101
And I figure it's like that for you, too.

332
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,427
Yeah, it can be crazy.

333
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,887
So maybe you're up against some 
of the same things your dad was.

334
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,853
Now you're saying my dad 
made a shady deal?

335
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:48,542
I'm not saying that.

336
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,087
Or if he didn't make it, 
that got him killed?

337
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,635
Ray, I don't know what happened yet,

338
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,814
but I want to find out for you.

339
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,616
I thought that Berkenpass dude killed him.

340
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:00,767
Right, he was the primary suspect.

341
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,748
But maybe my dad got iced 
over someone fixing a game,

342
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:06,935
over what school he was 
gonna play for? Over ball?

343
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,935
Try not to guess too much, Ray.

344
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:14,497
Remember, we just need to 
look at all the possibilities.

345
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,097
Never met no Billy Berkenpass.

346
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:21,043
Well, he says he met you, 
Big Ed, 17 years back.

347
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:24,135
Nah. / How 'bout Herman Lester?

348
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:31,897
Hey, you like fedora hats, Big Ed?

349
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:33,375
They look good on me.

350
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,694
Great.

351
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:37,553
You can wear one for your 
mug shot, like Al Capone.

352
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,921
Capone?

353
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,785
You don't get chatty real quick here,

354
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:43,932
I got my pal at the IRS comb 
over your income taxes,

355
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,704
blow your betting operation open,
Big Ed's out of business.

356
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:52,841
Maybe I do remember young Herman.

357
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,345
I was hoping.

358
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:58,791
But I was better acquainted 
with his Uncle Freddie.

359
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,044
Oh, man, ay...

360
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:05,320
Oh... Big Ed, thank you for coming.

361
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,932
Only reason I'm here is 
'cause you owe me five grand.

362
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,217
Now, where is it?

363
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:11,182
There's been some complications.

364
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,325
Brother man, that is the wrong answer.

365
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,267
Yo, but, I got the right answer.

366
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,665
But I need one more day.

367
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,244
See, I got a plan.
You know, it's fool proof, too.

368
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,804
Check it out.

369
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,077
Yeah, let it rain, Herman, 
let it rain!

370
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:30,213
Yo, man, you best pull out your umbrella,
cause you is getting soaked, dog.

371
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,841
You got to give me one more day.

372
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,056
See, Herman Lester's my nephew,
and the boy's got a lot of love for me,

373
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,973
so, see, with tomorrow night's game

374
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:39,090
I'm gonna get him 
to do me a little favor.

375
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,625
You telling me you can get that boy
to turn the state championship out?

376
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,385
I can make it happen.

377
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:46,347
Yo, Herman!

378
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:49,829
- Who loves you, baby?
- You do, Uncle Fred.

379
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:52,499
That's what I'm talking about.

380
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,512
Freddie had that kind of 
influence over Herman?

381
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:59,484
I wasn't sold.

382
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:03,173
So, I paid a visit to the Berkenpass kid.

383
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:04,482
How'd that go down?

384
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:09,103
It didn't. And with no insurance,
I decided to sit that game out.

385
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:12,493
But the way Herman played, it seemed 
like Freddie did have him on a string.

386
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:17,441
All I know is when it was over, 
Freddie still owed me money.

387
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,121
That must have had him running scared.

388
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:23,098
Sure, but he slowed down.

389
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:29,193
Maybe you've noticed Freddie
don't walk so good no more.

390
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,529
You got some riding on 
this Friday's game, Freddie?

391
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,081
What do you mean?

392
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:35,485
Trying to keep Ray out of playing,
so you can score some bets?

393
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:38,103
Just like you tried to score off 
his dad in '87. / What now?

394
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:40,346
We know you asked Herman to 
throw the game the night he died.

395
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,771
Come on, now, if I did that, 
why did they win, huh?

396
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:46,965
Logic, Freddie. Just 'cause they won
don't mean you didn't ask him.

397
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:49,195
I was in full support of
Herman's career.

398
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:51,192
But you owed the money to
Big Ed Brown.

399
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,857
I paid Big Ed. / Late. That's 
why you got your knees broke.

400
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:56,915
But first you tried to fix the 
Tech game to cash in on it,

401
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,105
'cause you didn't want your knees broke.

402
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:01,196
- Who does?
- I talked to Big Ed.

403
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:05,793
He told me you promised 
Herman would lose that game.

404
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:09,537
Why didn't you say so at the top, huh?

405
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:12,020
The truth, Freddie.

406
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,141
It wasn't my proudest moment.

407
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,960
Herman, this is a one-time, 
and one-time only thing now.

408
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,805
- I can't believe you're asking me this!
- You think I wanna be asking?

409
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:27,437
I'm embarrassed, man.

410
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,596
I can hardly look you in the eye.

411
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:29,731
Can't you work this out with Big Ed?

412
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,990
This is working it out.
Don't you get that.

413
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,487
He's gonna hurt me, 
for keeps, man, understand?

414
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,651
- Freddie...listen,
- Herman,

415
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,418
you're gonna have everything 
in this life, man.

416
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,690
The good Lord didn't give 
me the talent he gave you.

417
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,794
That's okay, I make do...

418
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:52,437
but I'm asking you, this once, 
toss this dog a bone.

419
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,461
No, I can't do it.

420
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,362
I'm sorry, no.

421
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:11,837
But when Herman played so bad that night,

422
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,918
it looked he might come 
through for you after all.

423
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:16,795
Gave you hope during the whole 
game right up to the buzzer.

424
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,360
- That must have pissed you off.
- No, no, no!

425
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,323
Ungrateful kid won't step up for the 
man who was a father figure to him.

426
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:24,453
So maybe you're the one who 
lowered the boom on Herman.

427
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,098
That's an outrage, you saying that!

428
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:36,718
What's wrong?

429
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,529
Ray's missing.

430
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:49,144
Could Ray have skipped out 
on practice? / No, no, no.

431
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:52,455
Ray doesn't miss practice. He 
comes early, leaves late always.

432
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,762
Maybe he just went 
somewhere to clear his head.

433
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:57,563
- You think Billy has him?
- I'm gonna go see Billy right now.

434
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,324
Can I come?

435
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:01,895
Yeah.

436
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,551
Hey, Freddie.

437
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,778
Stay close.

438
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,965
Could the timing be worse?

439
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:14,475
Did Ray have somewhere he had to be?

440
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:17,546
Yeah. He had visit from two 
Big Ten schools tonight.

441
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:19,975
What's more important here, coach?

442
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,845
I don't expect you to 
understand. / Blake.

443
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:25,168
I understand a 17-year-old's missing.

444
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,843
That's important.

445
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,555
Out on the street, boss.

446
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,082
This is craziness.

447
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,727
My baby's all over the place 
and I can't find him.

448
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:51,095
- He can't be far.
- I can't lose him, too.

449
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,738
Look...

450
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:55,480
Where is he? 
Where's my baby?

451
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,358
- Tanya, what are you...?
- What'd you do with him?

452
00:24:57,358 --> 00:24:59,096
- I don't know what you mean.
- Ray's been missing all afternoon.

453
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,066
They say you watch him!

454
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,281
Come on, Tanya.
That ain't gonna help.

455
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:04,161
- T, I wouldn't hurt your kid.
- How about her kid's father?

456
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,193
I believed you, Billy.

457
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:08,082
I was the one person who 
didn't think you killed Herman.

458
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:10,288
So keep believing.

459
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:13,378
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

460
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:20,765
Not then, not now.

461
00:25:30,252 --> 00:25:32,578
How'd you find this place?

462
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,160
Asked some old timers.

463
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,256
I've put up 'bout a hundred jumpers,

464
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:42,973
but didn't know where the right spot was.

465
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,319
What spot?

466
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:50,273
Where he died.

467
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:54,070
Do you know?

468
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,357
The write-up said on that free throw line.

469
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:16,216
For Herman Lester.

470
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,395
You make it look easy.

471
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:32,012
I'm glad you're doing this.
Finding out 'bout my dad.

472
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:33,030
Yeah?

473
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,773
'Cause I never could.

474
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:38,476
Asking her anything 'bout 
him brings her to her knees.

475
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:40,140
Your mom.

476
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:42,617
I never knew him,

477
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:44,948
but that don't mean I don't 
wanna hear about him

478
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:48,100
or find out how come he got killed.

479
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,614
You gonna play tomorrow?

480
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,811
Starting to think that 
call I got was no joke.

481
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:04,530
No one'll blame you 
if you sit the game out.

482
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,488
Coach will.

483
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:10,593
'Course, player's the last thing
Freddie wants me to do.

484
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,844
What's in it for him?

485
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:16,461
Freddie got me connected 
with all the shoe companies.

486
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:20,227
I go league, he gets taken care of.

487
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,101
And you think you owe Freddie.

488
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,889
I owe coach, too.

489
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:30,031
What does he want 
you to do? / College.

490
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,396
See there's two 
or three schools that want me.

491
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:34,453
I thought every school wanted you.

492
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:38,041
Yeah, but there's two or three
that want both me and coach.

493
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,632
See, so if I sign that letter of intent,

494
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:43,546
coach comes along, 
part of a package deal.

495
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:51,286
Turns out if Ray decides to go to a 
certain college, Coach Lein benefits big.

496
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:54,561
So, is coach aiming to take the same 
ride on Herman's back 17 years ago?

497
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,272
And how badly did he want it?

498
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:59,137
Maybe the gambling angle 
isn't the answer.

499
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,470
Did Herman ever say where 
he was going to school?

500
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,271
No one knew.

501
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:06,243
There was a new rumor 
every day: Kansas, Iowa, Duke...

502
00:28:06,243 --> 00:28:08,969
She'd probably know.

503
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,770
Sorry, boss.

504
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:24,534
Don't let this change the investigation.

505
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:32,098
Thank you for finding him. / Sure.

506
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:36,007
Tanya, had Herman made a decision 
about where he was going to college?

507
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:39,732
Temple. He was gonna 
announce it the next day.

508
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,842
The Owls head coach is John Chaney.

509
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:44,860
He's always run a clean program.
He does not to do "favors".

510
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,998
So maybe Coach wanted
Herman to go somewhere else...

511
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:50,536
where they did do "favors".

512
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:54,047
Coach wanted him down in Florida.

513
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,474
Temple's not the place.

514
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,189
I've already made up my mind, coach.

515
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,684
You'll end up at the wrong program,
you get lost in the shuffle.

516
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:06,319
Doesn't matter how talented you are.

517
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,383
Down in Florida, I can look out for you.

518
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:10,501
- I got responsibilities here.
- What do you mean?

519
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,593
Tanya's pregnant.

520
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,949
- Okay, so Tanya comes, too.
- No, it's no good.

521
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:19,237
What? / No!

522
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:22,503
Damn it, Herman, 
we need to stay together.

523
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:26,381
This is my shot, too!
Haven't I always been there for you?

524
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:39,824
So, Coach finds out things aren't 
going the way he wants them to.

525
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:43,058
Six hours before Herman dies.

526
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:48,955
John.

527
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,230
- You saved the day, finding Ray.
- Talk to her.

528
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,240
You get those college meetings 
rescheduled, coach?

529
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:02,578
It's plan "B", if Ray doesn't play tonight.

530
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,459
But I know he will.

531
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,820
You're counting on it, aren't you?

532
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,258
Whatever you say, Missy.

533
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:14,128
I think this room's got the 
wrong population, boss.

534
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,264
Lots of opinions from that one.

535
00:30:22,213 --> 00:30:27,808
Blake, the last 24 hours we've been 
looking at you for Herman's murder.

536
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:30,087
You kiddin' me?

537
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,990
When Herman broke the news 
that he was going to Temple,

538
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,803
I know you had a lot on the line.

539
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,299
He was hurting your future.

540
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,634
John, we're friends.

541
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:44,356
We're going to hear you out
one way or another, Blake.

542
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:47,620
It's better if you and I do it here and now.

543
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:53,874
Now, I know you got a deep drive.

544
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:57,354
All of us got one somewhere,

545
00:30:57,354 --> 00:31:01,192
and it will either make you 
a winner, or take you down.

546
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:05,350
I need you to make a gut check here, pal.

547
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:13,007
Me and Herman...

548
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,157
we had a moment of truth.

549
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:25,810
You been in here the
whole time? / Yeah.

550
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,984
Trying to wait me out like
I'd just go home?

551
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,621
Don't you walk away from me.

552
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:34,342
Hey!

553
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,082
Coach!

554
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,335
You think you can just go,
after all I've done for you?

555
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:52,226
You won us a state 
championship tonight,

556
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,243
I'm standing here crying the blues.

557
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:01,238
That's pretty piss poor.

558
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,122
Good luck at Temple, son.

559
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:20,977
I never saw Herman again.

560
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:33,570
Okay, thanks.

561
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:37,373
Prints from the City Center Rec 
pay phone came in.

562
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,978
Guess who we got a match on?

563
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:40,548
Berkenpass?

564
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:42,677
His father.

565
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,394
What's the big deal?

566
00:32:50,622 --> 00:32:52,712
So, I made a call.

567
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,276
Get off my property.

568
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:59,481
Not just a call,
a "terrorist threat".

569
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:00,282
Come on.

570
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:03,832
No joke. So I were you, 
I'd put that wood down.

571
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,117
Why use the phone at the Rec?

572
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,153
You and your son dream that up together?

573
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:15,252
- My son didn't know I was there.
- Noontime he was in the gym.

574
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:17,772
You telling me you two didn't cross paths?

575
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:21,018
We never do.
We got no relationship.

576
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,954
Why's that?

577
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:26,887
Billy wasn't athletic,

578
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:29,686
he had no foot speed to talk about,

579
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:31,567
so we made him a shooter.

580
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,291
Developed the purest stroke 
you'd ever want to see.

581
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,046
It didn't happen overnight. I'd feed 
them and feed them and feed them

582
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,978
and there wasn't a night that we left 
that gym without him hitting 15 in a row.

583
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:43,438
What's that have to do with 
you not having a realtionship?

584
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:46,267
He quit on me.

585
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,052
What, you don't tell me what happened?

586
00:33:50,052 --> 00:33:52,543
You just let me show up at the game!

587
00:33:52,543 --> 00:33:55,070
I was embarrassed.

588
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,110
Son, if you would've told me, 
I would've helped.

589
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,252
But now it doesn't matter if it's not true
because the word's out, you're a bad seed.

590
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:03,028
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:03,654 --> 00:34:05,793
Up, up, up. Chin up.

592
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:11,267
Listen, we may not get more 
than a junior college offer,

593
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,482
but two years, 
we're right back on track.

594
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:17,993
Dad, it's over! I'm done!

595
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,086
Don't let this break your spirit.

596
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:25,443
I'm not, dad. I don't care 
about being on track!

597
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:29,325
I just want playing ball 
to be fun again.

598
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,814
Fun?

599
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:37,243
Billy, you go home
and you get your suitcase

600
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:42,277
and when you're done having fun
and you come back and you see me!

601
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:56,863
Billy never plays organized ball again,
you draw a line through his name?

602
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,569
We do what we do.

603
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,431
Now and then I'll go back and 
watch him shoot at the Rec.

604
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,272
Those are old wounds.

605
00:35:04,272 --> 00:35:07,227
So why all of a sudden 
make this call to Ray?

606
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:10,921
Now, leaving the Rec that day,
seeing Ray Lester's face splattered all over

607
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:13,452
like these people are the First Family 
of Basketball or something

608
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:16,434
that nonsense had to stop once and for all.

609
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:18,718
We got to arrest you for making that threat.

610
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:21,084
- Hey, for crying out loud.
- Come on.

611
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,383
You got to come with us.

612
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,816
Prints were in the system 'cause 
of a bar brawl three years back.

613
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,869
I talked to the guy that 
got beat down by him.

614
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:36,308
Said it all started 'cause the barflies were 
talking about the late great Herman Lester.

615
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:38,583
14 years later and he's 
still smarting over that?

616
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,304
This guy's got deep feelings 
about his son not playing ball.

617
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:44,896
- Disowned him over it.
- Maybe killed over it.

618
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:47,675
Problem is, the Berkenpass 
alibi goes both ways.

619
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:51,986
- Covers Billy but also covers the dad.
- Ah, Senior won't give it up.

620
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:54,346
So work on Junior.

621
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,073
We just need some last questions 
answered, then we'll leave you alone.

622
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,059
We got a new suspect, Billy.

623
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:02,320
Good for you.

624
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,176
Need the straight story on 
your alibi. / Straight story?

625
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,627
You were in your car?
Shooting hoops?

626
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:11,336
Doesn't matter we just got to 
hear where you really were.

627
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,675
Watching TV with my dad.

628
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:20,290
Maybe we got to level with Billy.

629
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,955
He's gonna find out anyway.

630
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,480
Pops put the death threat on Ray.

631
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,618
My dad?

632
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:30,325
You surprised?

633
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,247
'Cause you look surprised.

634
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:36,337
But the funny thing is, 
you look it and you don't.

635
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:40,185
My guess is, you never knew 
your dad killed Herman either.

636
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:44,185
But, right now in this moment...

637
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,760
you do.

638
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,030
'Cause you and dad never 
watched TV that night.

639
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,965
Can I just go now?

640
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:57,449
Sure. We'll walk you out.

641
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,933
Ray's just taking care of some paperwork.

642
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:07,994
Hey, you want to meet him, 
Billy? / No, thanks.

643
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:11,584
Yeah, we keep arguing over 
whether he looks like his pops or not.

644
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:13,631
He does... a little.

645
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,731
Yeah, but the difference is,
Ray's walking away from the game.

646
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:20,833
W-Walking away? / He's mixed 
up about how his dad died.

647
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,457
Figures Herman made a wrong decision
and maybe that's what killed him.

648
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:26,291
Why's he think that?

649
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,377
He didn't know anything about his dad.

650
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:31,842
Looks like another Lester 
won't reach his potential.

651
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,527
Maybe I-I will say hi to him.

652
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:39,867
Sure.

653
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,632
Hey, kid.

654
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,248
I want to tell you something about him.

655
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:13,614
And that night.

656
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:19,191
I wasn't at home with my dad.

657
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:23,307
I-I was with Herman.

658
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:28,511
Got to hand it to you.

659
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:33,346
Only Herman Lester can play ball that bad
and still get carried off the court like a king.

660
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,131
Final score's all that counts.

661
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:36,425
Keep telling yourself that.

662
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:37,859
You think I tried to 
throw the game tonight?

663
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,882
- Yeah, I do.  
- You're wrong.

664
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:42,625
Then why did you play like a buster?

665
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:47,543
You.

666
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:50,479
What?

667
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:54,508
Everybody thinks I'm this one-man show.

668
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,215
But it's you that gets me 
the ball in the paint.

669
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:02,207
When I'm double-teamed,
you always hit the J.

670
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:05,784
But you weren't there tonight.

671
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:08,653
Billy...

672
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:11,001
we haven't been friends...

673
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,746
but we've been a team, right?

674
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,477
Your dad was stand-up.

675
00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:29,952
There was all this junk around us, 
everyone trying to make us enemies.

676
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:33,627
But he-he jsut followed his instincts...

677
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:36,387
and they were good.

678
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:41,457
The man was good.

679
00:40:05,576 --> 00:40:07,805
We talked to your boy Billy, 
Mr. Berkenpass.

680
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,831
He burned your alibi.

681
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,683
Why would he do that?

682
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:15,394
'Cause he didn't kill Herman Lester.

683
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:17,824
You did.

684
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,501
Billy said that?

685
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:26,311
Want us to bring him in here?

686
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,288
No.

687
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:39,046
It was always awkward 
for Billy and me.

688
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:44,424
Basketball was the way 
that I could be his dad, see?

689
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:48,178
That was our whole relationship.

690
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:52,641
That night when I told Billy 
to pack his bags, I...

691
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,833
I wanted to take it back.

692
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,771
Why didn't you?

693
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:01,660
I followed after him.

694
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,256
Wound up at Player's Park...

695
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,223
and I watched Herman and Billy.

696
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,526
I watched them shaking hands.

697
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,706
That wasn't a good thing?

698
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,353
That was him giving up.

699
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:27,732
I knew that he wasn't gonna play again.

700
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:32,300
That was the end of one thing 
that we had in common.

701
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,232
Oh, hey, Mr.B.

702
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,737
You're looking for Billy, 
you just missed him.

703
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:07,423
Yeah.

704
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:10,561
Think he said he was headed home.

705
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,274
Then I guess I'll see him there, then.

706
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:19,222
Are you okay, sir?
You, uh... look a little off.

707
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,240
Good game tonight.

708
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:53,957
# Bruce Springsteen의 
"Walk Like a Man" #

709
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:59,044
# I remember how rough 
your hand felt on mine #

710
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:03,341
# On my wedding day #

711
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:09,187
# And the tears cried on my shoulder #

712
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:12,635
# I couldn't turn away #

713
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:17,477
# Well so much has happened to me #

714
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:20,573
# That I don't understand #

715
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:24,145
# All I can think of is
being five years old #

716
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:26,417
# following behind you at the beach #

717
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:30,391
# Tracing your footprints in the sand #

718
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:35,123
# Trying to walk like a man #

719
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:44,629
# Good bye Our Lady of the Roses #

720
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:49,263
# We lived in the shadow of the elms #

721
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:51,048
# I remember ma draggin' me and #

722
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:54,692
# my sister up the street to the church #

723
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:59,295
# Whenever she heard 
those wedding bells #

724
00:43:59,295 --> 00:44:04,139
# Well would they ever 
look so happy again #

725
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:08,793
# The handsome groom and his bride #

726
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:14,367
# As they stepped into that 
long black limousine #

727
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:18,669
# For their mystery ride #

728
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:23,150
# Well tonight you step away from me #

729
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,147
# And alone at the altar I stand #

730
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:32,598
# And as I watch my bride 
coming down the aisle I pray #

731
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:38,653
# For the strength to walk like a man #

732
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:49,388
# Well now the years have 
gone and I've grown #

733
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:53,938
# From that seed you've sown #

734
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:58,740
# But I didn't think there'd 
be so many steps #

735
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,940
# I'd have to learn on my own #

736
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,525
# Well I was young and 
I didn't know what to do #

737
00:45:07,525 --> 00:45:11,656
# When I saw your best steps 
stolen away from you #

738
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:14,876
# Now I'll do what I can #

739
