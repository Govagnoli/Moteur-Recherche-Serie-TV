1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,820
the dynamic woman has it all.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,270
She's a career woman,
a with-it mom February 16,1982

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,210
a vital partner for her husband.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,200
If you want to bring your brand into the
future,you want to be worn by today's woman.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,330
today's woman,the dynamic woman,

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,580
needs a perfume that goes from
morning to night and doesn't quit.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,610
Today's woman...

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,810
please excuse me one second.S
tella?

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,100
sitter's sick again.
I've got to be in court.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,090
Should be right back.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,690
roger,you can't be serious.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,120
Think your secretary can keep an
eye on 'em for a minute or two?

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,970
You know how fussy the baby
gets with other people.

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,770
I'm in the middle of a presentation here.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,970
And my clients gets 20 years
to life if I don't show up.

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,220
Okay.Who can be quiet the longest?

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,250
Not her.That's for sure.

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,850
Maybe you can help out your little sister.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,350
-What do you say,buddy?
-Okay.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,980
Okay,okay,get out of here
before I change my mind.

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,650
-Okay.
-Hi.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,250
What would we do without you?

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,410
Fall utterly to pieces?Knock 'em dead.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,430
-You,too.
-Okay.Piece of cake.

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,570
Excuse me.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,660
what are you doing?

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,240
What does it look like,einstein?

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,840
Sit right there,devon.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,130
This is my son.Say hi,devon.

30
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,960
-Hi.
-Hi,devon.

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,290
I didn't know what else to do.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,960
make roger screw up his career,
not yours?

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,170
-working mother
-But always a dedicated professional.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,280
like the dynamic woman.

35
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,960
-I am...
-she is the dynamic woman.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,310
Which is why our company is so
suited to create your ad campaign.

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,060
We know her hopes and dreams,
her fears and purchasing patterns.

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,310
Today's woman wants it all,
and she'll get it.

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,470
let's show you the numbers we worked up.

40
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,390
hey,mom,can I color this?

41
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,500
yes.

42
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,880
lil,frannie.

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,180
-frannie's got something for us,boss.
-Yeah?What's that?

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,420
Infant death.'82.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,150
Iris felice.

46
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,600
She was six months old.

47
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,940
Sudden infant death syndrome.
You got thoughts otherwise?

48
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,740
Well,some of the old-time coroners--

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,070
they used outdated information
to determine sids.

50
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,750
Which is why the me has frannie and the other
assistants reviewing all the sids cases.

51
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,620
From 1980 to '85.

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,170
And with iris,I found something.

53
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,810
These photos are from the scene
before they moved the body.

54
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,580
Tricky thing about sids is it forensically
looks like other causes of death.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,750
Heart stops.Fluid in the lungs.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,530
But that doesn't explain this.

57
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,070
The baby's hair--it's wet.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,150
Fluid in the lungs,plus wet hair?

59
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,910
Could have been a drowning?

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,610
Hair could've dried by the time
it got to the coroner'S.

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,310
-He wouldn't have seen it.
-Yeah,in '82 especially.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,670
They weren't as suspicious of
infant death as we are now.

63
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,540
You work a few of these baby jobs,
you get suspicious.

64
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,570
What looks like sids could be anything but.

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,470
You certain about that?

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,130
Well,some people say sids
doesn't really exist.

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,830
Babies don't die for no reason.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,420
-But...
-but you can't say for sure.

69
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,520
Med school taught me we know less
about life and death than we think.

70
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,680
We're gonna turn these parents' lives
upside down again,we got to have a good reason.

71
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,650
Well,if there's a chance a kid's
murder slipped through the cracks,

72
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,770
maybe that's reason enough.

73
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,360
Iris felice.

74
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,840
Found dead in her crib at 6:30 A.M.
On april 19,1982.

75
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,490
Mother called 911.

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,570
-Well,the cops at the scene thought sids.
-Coroner backed it up.

77
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,010
There was no reason to suspect foul play,
no signs of prior abuse.

78
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,590
Baby was premature,but had a clean
bill of health,otherwise.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,690
We sure the hair wasn't wet from sweat?
Maybe the weather.

80
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,310
Nah,looked it up.

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,470
-A freak snowstorm that night.
-Spring in philly.

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,300
Another reason we're america's
vacation destination.

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,710
there was a baby-sitter with iris and
her brother until 8:00 P.M. That night.

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,440
The parents checked on the baby when
they got home.Said she was fine.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,360
Well,it leaves whoever's in
the house after that.

86
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,970
-Mom,dad.Always comes back to them.
-Oldest story in the book.

87
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,460
Well,they split up in '83,
few months after iris died.

88
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,900
Let's have a talk.Close this job pronto.

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,120
Please have a seat.

90
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,420
We're reinvestigating your daughter's death.

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,220
I don't understand.

92
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,590
Well,certain forensics don't add up.

93
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,280
We think iris was drowned.

94
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,370
my god.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,310
-Did anyone have access to your daughter?
-Just her father and me.

96
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,180
-Anybody have keys to the house?
-No.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,760
I mean,the nanny and the housekeeper,but
I always dead-bolted the doors at night.

98
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,990
Why do that?

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,190
Iris was premature.We thought
we'd lose her from the get-go.

100
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,150
She pulled through,tough little cookie.

101
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,170
-Anyway,I was very protective of her.
-Must have been rough.

102
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,650
no one tells you how hard it is
with kids,do they?

103
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,860
How'd your ex-husband handle the stress?

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,800
Iris was fragile.We had to be so
careful all the time.

105
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,520
His patience ran out pretty quickly.

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,790
-you look beautiful.
-I look 80.

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,960
It's a hot 80.

108
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,700
I'm beat,babe.I'm bone-tired.

109
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,900
then stop talking.

110
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,370
baby did you hear about that
rapist guy in mount airy?

111
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,400
yeah,babe,let's talk about that.

112
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm sorry.My timing.

113
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,480
You locked the garage,right?

114
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,650
-Let's go upstairs.
-Okay.

115
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,900
-but did you?
-It's locked.

116
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,920
You're beautiful.Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

117
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,590
where are you going?

118
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,530
Locking these,and then I just
want to check on the baby.

119
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,480
No,no,no.No checking.She's fine.

120
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,720
-I'm just gonna peek.
-but you're not gonna peek.

121
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,830
You're gonna nudge her,you're gonna wake her,
and it's 40 minutes to get her back to bed.

122
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,310
The hospital said we should check on her...

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,240
but that was months ago.She's fine now.

124
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,870
-What if they're wrong?
-Honey,please.

125
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,980
we haven't been together
since I don't know when.

126
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,110
So let's be together.

127
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,090
great.

128
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
mommy!Mommy!Iris is crying!

129
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,780
-Devon,go back to sleep!
-You don't have to yell at him.

130
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,240
Well,this is what I told you I didn't want.

131
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,640
What,another kid?

132
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,410
I just wish we could go back
to the way things were.

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,600
We can'T.We have iris now.

134
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,330
they said we could have it all:
Family,husband,career.

135
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,280
They just didn't say how.

136
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,380
-When did this incident happen?
-A few months before iris passed.

137
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,390
Things get any better?

138
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,670
A baby's always a challenge,
even to the happiest marriages.

139
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,110
I kept hoping they would,but...

140
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,930
then iris died,and...what we
had kind of died with her.

141
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,220
You cut ties with your family pretty
fast after your daughter died.

142
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,550
Every time I looked at my wife,
I saw iris.

143
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,580
-Sure it wasn't guilt you were seein'?
-Guilt for what?

144
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,690
It seems like you got over the whole
thing pretty fast is all we're sayin'.

145
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,660
You didn't want a second child,roger.

146
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
Molly was busy with her company,so I
was the first one hke most nights.

147
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,360
I fed the kids,I bathed them.

148
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,780
Must have been hard on you.

149
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,170
It was.Iris wasn't an easy baby.

150
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,230
She'd wake up seven,eight,
nine times a night.

151
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,880
Co all I wanted was sleep.

152
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,600
maybe you were tired one night,
accidentally drop her in the tub.

153
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,090
Never ends?The looks,questions.

154
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,480
There's no statute of limitations on murder,roger.

155
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,410
Believe me,when your child stops breathing,

156
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,120
here's no one you blame more than yourself.

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,110
where...where are you taking her?

158
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,390
She needs her mobile.Don't forget to
pack her mobile for the hospital.

159
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,480
hey,buddy,why don't you go to bed?

160
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,740
You close the door to your room.

161
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,870
I have to get her things packed.

162
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,490
-she's not going to the hospital.
-She's not?

163
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,610
-We didn't check on her enough,roger.
-Molly,please.

164
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,530
I told you we should have checked on her more.

165
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,010
I remember how cold it was
in her room that night.

166
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,570
Because of the snowstorm.

167
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,450
No.Her window was open.

168
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,990
A window was open in the nursery?

169
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,060
Molly was a fanatic about locking them
because iris slept on the ground floor.

170
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,990
Did you tell the cops about this?

171
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,330
Thought it wouldn't help any.
Window doesn't explain sids.

172
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,240
We'll look into it.T
hanks for your time,mr.Felice.

173
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,770
Iris'd be 24 now.

174
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,020
She had molly's eyes.I bet she'd
be as beautiful as her mother.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,740
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

176
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,820
So...when my sister died,my parents
put all her things into storage,

177
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,450
stopped talking about her.
Like she never even existed.

178
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,430
So I stole that.

179
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,810
Iris is my daughter's middle name.

180
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,460
That's nice.

181
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,570
Your bedroom was right above
the nursery,wasn't it?

182
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,890
yeah.Why?

183
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,100
Did you hear anything that night?

184
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,420
I don't remember.
That was a long time ago.

185
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,640
Your parents have any trouble with the baby?

186
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,420
After iris died,my mother
couldn't get out of bed.

187
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,160
My father wouldn't eat.

188
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,180
They wouldn't have brought this upon
themselves if that's what you're thinking.

189
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,350
Dad took off pretty fast after.

190
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,670
Being a father myself,if I couldn't
protect my little girl,I'd run,too.

191
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,340
-Except he still had you.
-Guess he forgot.

192
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,610
Anyone else in the house at this time?

193
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,190
My parents worked a lot,so...
there was a lot of hired help.

194
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,180
-At least one of them was...
-homicidal?

195
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,630
The nanny marta.Didn't take
her long to traumatize us.

196
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,460
Marta!I can't reach the mobile!

197
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,200
Marta?!

198
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,600
I want to play with the music mobile.

199
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,600
Are you pretending like you're in church?

200
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,370
Close the door,devon.Come here.

201
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,840
On your knees.

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,060
-We're not allowed to...
-like this.

203
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,080
We're not allowed to put the baby
in the bathtub.Only daddy can.

204
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,850
We're going to make baptism.
You want one?

205
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,130
But if you die with no baptism,
you go to hell.

206
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,260
-You do?
-mmm.

207
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,530
We have to save your little sister.
We have to save all the little babies.

208
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,210
-let's make her an angel,yes?
-Daddy says that's too much water.

209
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,310
it's time to pray.

210
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,440
That gave me nightmares for a while.

211
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,220
-You tell your parents?
-No.

212
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,270
I was scared of marta,but I
guess I didn't want to lose her.

213
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,860
She was pretty intent on that baptism.

214
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,750
It seemed like it.Why?

215
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,150
We think your sister may have been drowned.

216
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,890
I don't know if I could do it.

217
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,640
Get myself together again
if I lost veronica.

218
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,470
I don't know if I'd call the
felice family together.

219
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,970
They seemed pretty normal
till their kid died.

220
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,990
Well,you say potato,I say po-tah-to.

221
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,750
Hey,ozzie and harriet,
you done with your squabble?

222
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,440
-I found something here.
-What?

223
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,070
-Well,I googled.
-the future is now.

224
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,450
Found marta chavez,the felices'
housekeeper,on a webbete here.

225
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,910
Cb sids support group.

226
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,050
-She lost somody to sids
-Her son...in 1981.

227
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,290
One baby,maybe,
but two dying mysteriously?

228
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,510
Disturbing coincidence,at best.

229
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,570
At worst,we got our murderer.

230
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,430
every year on her birthday,
I think about iris.

231
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,560
How old she would be.
What kind of things she would like.

232
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,920
The felice family know you
lost a kid of your own?

233
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,520
No.

234
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,860
You didn't feel like you should tell 'em,
since you'd be around their baby?

235
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,190
My son died of sids.It was not my fault.

236
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,830
That's what they said about iris.

237
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,290
My son died in his sleep and I don't
know why,and I have to live with that.

238
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,530
I know that being nice is not
a big part of your job...

239
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,420
but you could at least have the facts:
Sids is real.

240
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,080
You were trying to baptize iris in the bathtub.

241
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,130
I was crazy with grief for my son.
I wanted to keep her safe.

242
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,450
We think she was drowned.

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,030
Maybe you gave the baptism another shot.
Held her down too long.

244
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,660
I love children.I don't hurt them.

245
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,860
And I was in el salvador the week she died.

246
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,700
-We'll check on that.
-Go ahead.

247
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,910
And while you're at it,
look up this girl:Brie romeo.

248
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,800
-Who's that?
-She was the nighttime babysitter.

249
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,350
Someone to watch the kids so they could go out.

250
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,810
And...?

251
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,410
Well,first it seemed like a good idea,
but one night i stopped by the house.

252
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:19,340
Saw with my own eyes that girl
was not a good idea.

253
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,280
brie,it's me!I forgot my purse.

254
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,070
brie,get up.

255
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,450
Marta.I fell.

256
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,530
What are you doing?

257
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,430
nothing.

258
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,250
these are supposed to stay locked
like molly says.

259
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,480
Well,molly wants it like
a frickin' crypt in here.

260
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,300
You can't have your boyfriend here.

261
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,600
take a chill pill.
He's not my boyfriend.Yet.

262
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,000
my water tastes funny.

263
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,410
what is this green stuff?

264
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,950
Iris's bottle is green,too.

265
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,380
Okay,back to bed.Now.

266
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,210
I gave him some cough syrup,spaz.

267
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,900
It helps the babies sleep better
so we can have adult time.

268
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,060
I am calling mrs.Felice.

269
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,270
You breathe a word of this,

270
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,070
I'll have my father,
who is a super-lawyer,

271
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,680
call immigration faster than
you can say "daddy's girl.

272
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,500
Got it,bible-thumper?Now get.

273
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,710
and you never told the felices about this?

274
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,270
I wanted to.

275
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,210
I thought it'd be worse for the kids

276
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,550
if brie had my ass kicked out
of the country,far from them.

277
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,400
But now,I'm a citizen so she can kiss it.

278
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,780
-Thanks,marta.
-Yeah,sure.

279
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,510
So this babysitter's drugging the kids.

280
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Could have done it again the night the
baby died.Only she gave iris too much.

281
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,270
If the baby od'D...she would sweat.

282
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,150
My mom used to give me whiskey
to make me sleep.

283
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,550
I give it to my kids.
What's the big deal?

284
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Bet it didn't hurt you at all.

285
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,090
I didn't even give her cough syrup that night.

286
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,890
And why should we believe you,brie?

287
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,670
Because,'cause tad broke up with me,okay?

288
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,820
He wasn't even coming over.
I had no reason to do it.

289
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,680
You know how we can get in touch with tad?

290
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,480
You guys are,like,out there.

291
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,630
Do you even know what was going on a
t the felice house back then?

292
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,190
How about you fill us in?

293
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,830
Molly may have been beautiful and smart
whatever,but she was not there for her man.

294
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,470
That your professional opinion?

295
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,080
Believe me.The babysitter knows
all your dirty secrets.

296
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,490
The felices had some big ones.

297
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,670
********************8

298
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,240
****************************8

299
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,180
It was a mistake.I was lonely.

300
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,610
You're a liar.You still want it.

301
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,150
-you should go.
-I can't accept that.

302
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,620
I have a family,stella.

303
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,830
Molly's changed.
You know it and I know it.

304
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,140
She's been having a hard time
the last few months.We both have.

305
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,640
All she talks about,all she
cares about are the kids.

306
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,270
Iris was premature.It scared her to death.

307
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,520
She won't even sleep with you
anymore and you're defending her?

308
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,890
She's my wife.

309
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,710
And I'm not.That's the point.

310
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,930
This is over.

311
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,710
you have to go.

312
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,580
You don't throw me away like a
used tissue.No one does that to me.

313
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,270
hey,stella.I just...

314
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,050
...Got here.

315
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,430
Gorgeous wife.Two kids.But...

316
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,680
roger was banging the best friend.

317
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,120
Told you the family wasn't super-perfect.

318
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,510
-When did you see this?
-A few nights before the baby died.

319
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,240
yeah.That's right. Ray is calling.

320
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,350
-thanks,brie.
-Yep.

321
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,140
Stella sounds like the kind of
woman that wouldn't take no for an answer.

322
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,560
Yeah,made roger pay for kicking her to the curb.

323
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,470
what,your boyfriend can't leave a message?

324
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,170
It's not joseph.

325
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,210
ray,I told you not to call...

326
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,190
lot of trouble to get me to see you.

327
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,190
-Hi.
-Hi.

328
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,240
I called you.A lot of times.

329
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,710
I know.I'm sorry.

330
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,840
-I should've picked up.I should've...
-I know....

331
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,980
-Believed you.
-It's all right,lil

332
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,280
How did it happen?

333
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,750
Just came at me from behind.
Never saw 'em till the last minute.

334
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,090
Well,give me their names.
I'll bring them in.

335
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,460
-No
-No,seriously,I mean it.

336
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,070
-That's not why I called you.
-Okay.

337
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
Not a lot of people...

338
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,730
...nobody really,I'd want seeing me like this.

339
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,050
You've seen me like this.

340
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,530
remember when you made me a milkshake?

341
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,370
That was all you could eat.

342
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,680
It was a busted jaw.

343
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,200
You made a mess of my mom's kitchen.

344
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,090
-It was a mess already.
-Yeah.

345
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,360
-Couple of kids?
-Yeah.

346
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,400
Well,I owe you,ray.

347
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,230
I'm gonna make this right,ray.

348
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,760
I don't want that.

349
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,460
I just want you here.

350
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,830
I'm here.

351
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,950
Bunch of bull,roger,first time around.

352
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,200
You pretend to be all broken
up about iris.Your marriage.

353
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,880
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-We're talking about stella.

354
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,190
About you banging your wife's
business partner.

355
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,790
And best friend.Class act there.

356
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,850
-It was a mistake.
-That cost your daughter her life.

357
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,220
We were so in love.Molly and I.

358
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,420
With each other and with devon.

359
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,610
-And then everything changed.
-When iris was born.

360
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,800
Molly became so distant.
It was like I lost her.

361
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,050
I-I just wanted what we had.

362
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,150
Tell yourself whatever you want.

363
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,300
Your daughter's dead 'cause of you.

364
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,780
You ever lose a child?

365
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,790
What?

366
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,310
There is nothing you can do to me
at I haven't already done to myself.

367
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,280
We heard a dirty thing about you,stella.

368
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,890
You wouldn't be the first.

369
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,040
Something about you knocking heels
with your best friend's husband?

370
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,150
Don't mince words,do you?

371
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,590
Pretty pissed off when roger broke it off.

372
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,620
Chose his family over you.

373
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,300
Yeah,woman scorned.But I got over it.

374
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,900
It was wrong to begin with.

375
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,680
Thing that's eang us is a few
days later,the baby's dead.

376
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,710
Felice family falls apart.

377
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,900
I was devastated,too.Roger and
molly were my best friends.

378
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,970
I know how that sounds.

379
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,840
I was mad at her,okay?

380
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,810
She bailed out on me.
She was never around.

381
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,220
The company we dreamed having was dying.

382
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,290
So you slept with her husband?

383
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,580
And that wasn't the only mistake I made.

384
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,060
-What do you mean?
-I had a chance to stop it.

385
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,430
Stop what?

386
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,690
Molly tried to tell me about iris.

387
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,500
And I was so caught up in that stupid
dance with roger,I couldn't even see it.

388
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,140
go.The tv spot.

389
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,720
The dynamic woman steps out of
a taxicab.She's wearing a suit.

390
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,970
she's jogging.She's wearing heels...

391
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,590
and?Come on,molly.You're the genius.
I'm the looks.

392
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
Do we have to go over this every time?

393
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,870
-molly,what's wrong?
-it's nothing.

394
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,610
I mean...I think roger's
hiding something from me.

395
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,990
-He's just busy with work.
-I'm never there for him.

396
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,040
You know,maybe i pushed him away.

397
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,100
I'm just--I'm just so tired all the time.
And the kids always need me.

398
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,960
Don't make a mountain out of a
molehill,molly.He loves you.

399
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,890
-Hey,stel,can I tell you something?
-Sure.

400
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,620
I'M...so alone.

401
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,820
you're not alone,mol.I'm here.

402
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,630
Something's wrong with roger.

403
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,190
At night,he's in the baby's room.

404
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,300
I hear him through the monitor
talking to himself.

405
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,800
What do you mean "talking to himself"?

406
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,820
Stop that.Don't hurt her.
Don't hurt the baby.

407
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,850
What I gonna do,stel?

408
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,680
Roger loves iris.You know that.

409
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,750
He'd never lay a hand on her.

410
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,980
-Yeah,I-I know.
-You must be imagining things.

411
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,130
You're right.

412
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:26,890
I haven't had much sleep.
I must have just made it all up.

413
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,690
stop that.You'll hurt her"?

414
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,860
Sounds like roger was losing it.

415
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,150
I should've believed her,but
I was so into roger I didn't want to.

416
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,790
Molly didn't mention this to us.

417
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,800
She never wanted to see
ugliness in other people,

418
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,400
least of all the father of her children.

419
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,120
-When did this incident happen?
-The day before.

420
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,710
The day before iris died?

421
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,410
I know you were having problems.

422
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,490
I don't know what you're talking about...

423
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,690
wandering around the nursery in the
middle of the night,talking to yourself.

424
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,760
Don't hurt her.

425
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,830
How could you know that?

426
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,350
Your ex-wife...
heard you on the baby monitor.

427
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,030
-Why can't you let this rest?
-'Cause a little kid died.

428
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,010
And that was bad enough.

429
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,420
Let us be.Please.

430
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,610
I can'T.

431
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,020
It was an accident.

432
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,580
Go on.

433
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,340
If I'd been around more,

434
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,700
spent time with my kids,maybe
none of this would've happened.

435
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,520
What do you mean if you'd have
spent more time with your kids?

436
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,750
He was just a little boy.He
didn't know what he was doing.

437
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,260
Don't put him in jail,please.

438
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,010
Devon?What did he do?

439
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,830
He went to the nursery at night.
He was just worrd about her.

440
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,890
Hly what happened the night she died?

441
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,230
hey,dev.What did I tell you?

442
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,580
To leave the baby alone at night.

443
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,090
that's right,pal.

444
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,730
'Cause when you come in here
and poke her,it hurts her.

445
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,090
what if she needs baptism?

446
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,940
she's okay,buddy.

447
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,400
but...daddy...she's not breathing.

448
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,920
iris?sweetie?

449
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,100
devon,why is she wet?

450
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,160
Iris?Iris,wake up.

451
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,860
Iris?iris,wake up.

452
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,790
Wake up.

453
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,840
come on.Wake up.

454
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,350
Wake up.

455
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,760
Iris.come on,baby.Come on.Wake up.

456
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,020
Wake up,baby.

457
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,850
Daddy,did I hurt the baby?

458
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,270
No,no,no.No,she'S...

459
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,520
she's fine.She's gonna be just fine.

460
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,670
devon was a high-strung kid.

461
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,860
I should've gotten him help.

462
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,020
He was scared because of what marta said.

463
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,140
-What're you going to do to him?
-I don't know.

464
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,840
Arrest me.

465
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,010
He's got a life.
You can't take that away from him.

466
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,900
I can't do that,mr.Felice.
You know that.

467
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,660
He didn't mean it.

468
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,400
Did you tell molly what happened that night?

469
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,480
I lied.And I had devon lie.

470
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,930
I thought it would save us.
But it destroyed us.

471
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,780
Go ahead.I'll be up in a minute.

472
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,800
-We need you to come in with us.
-Why?

473
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,110
We talked to your father,devon.

474
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,660
What did he tell you?

475
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,830
Why don't you come with us?

476
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,090
He told you about me.

477
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,470
That's okay.It's okay.It's good.

478
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,510
'Cause it's out.'Cause I can't
live like this anymore.

479
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,620
I can't hold my baby.
I've never picked her up,not once.

480
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,740
My hands...

481
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,110
I'm responsible for what happened to iris.

482
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,610
Tell us what happened that night.

483
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,070
I wanted to baptize her,but I...
I must have let her drown.

484
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,940
You don't remember?

485
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,270
Not really.But I must have,right?

486
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,880
What do you remember?

487
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,320
Being in the nursery.
The mobile's playing.It's cold.

488
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,640
But you couldn't reach the mobile.

489
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,550
So who turned it on?

490
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,460
Someone was in the room before you.

491
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,050
No,I don't remember that.

492
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,350
Some memories are too painful to remember.

493
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,660
Especially for children.

494
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,690
But I remember putting her in the bath.

495
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,050
You just said you didn'T.

496
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,900
-What do you want from me?
-The truth.

497
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,640
I'm telling you the truth.

498
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,260
Maybe what you think is the truth is
less painful than what really happened.

499
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,090
I didn'T...I didn't give her the bath.

500
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,120
Why not?

501
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,300
Because my mom was there.

502
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,320
I'm so sorry,baby.I'm so sorry
I can't protect you.

503
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,960
Mommy?

504
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,800
The world's such a dangerous place
for a baby.And I'm not a good mother.

505
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,160
It's me.I'm what's wrong.

506
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,260
Mommy?

507
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,300
Give us a kiss good-bye,dev.

508
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,970
Where are you going,mommy?

509
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,360
Don't cry,okay,sweetheart?
Be mommy' strong little man.

510
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,830
Okay.

511
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,250
-I love you so much,dev.
-Me,too,mommy.

512
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,290
Good-bye.

513
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,550
I thought I was never gonna see her again.

514
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,810
Because she wanted to die,too.

515
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,330
Thank you,devon.

516
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,720
This is crazy,but the worst part is
that she didn't want me with her.

517
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,530
She wanted to leave me behind.

518
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,490
She was in pain,devon.

519
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,460
She wanted better for you.

520
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,630
I come in here sometimes.

521
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,690
To think about iris,time to time?

522
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,180
More like every moment of every day.

523
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,420
Do you really?Think about it,I mean?

524
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,240
When my mom was 25,
she already had two kids.

525
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,130
No money,tiny,dirty place we called home.

526
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,640
She was on her own?

527
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,500
You know,one time,i remember she brought
out all this food from the cabinets,

528
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,500
put it out like we were having a party,

529
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,220
then she left us,

530
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:48,430
locked the doors for...two days.

531
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,200
that's A...that's a terrible
thing to do to a child.

532
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,460
Well,it was better than the alternative.

533
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,410
What she mightave done,
if she hadn't left.

534
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,050
It's hard having kids,
and nobody tells you that.

535
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,700
No,they don'T.

536
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,380
Or all the terrible things that
can happen to a baby.

537
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,630
-You know,as a cop,I've seen things...
-please,stop.

538
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,090
you saw them,too,didn't you?
Those terrible things.

539
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,720
I don't know what you mean.

540
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,030
Locking the windows,the doors.
You tried to shut out the danger.

541
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,360
I was prective because iris was premature.

542
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,810
You imagined all the things that
could happen to iris so often,

543
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,790
you started to believe you
wanted them to happen.

544
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,490
-That's the sickness.
-No!

545
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,890
That's the sickness.
It's postpartum psychosis.

546
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,980
No.

547
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,600
It must be unbearable,
he fear of yourself,especially.

548
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,480
I don't know what happened to iris.

549
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,160
You have spent the last 24 years
trying to forget,but you know.

550
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,320
The snow.It snowed that night,
remember?

551
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,860
I thought it was a sign.The snow.

552
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,980
A sign of what?

553
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,900
It snowed the night that she was born.

554
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,570
And I thought she'd go back
to where she came from.

555
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,810
A better place than with me.

556
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,470
mommy's right here,baby.
Right here with you.

557
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,160
Go to sleep now.

558
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,750
Mommy!Mommy!

559
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,590
Iris?Iris?

560
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,320
My little girl.Iris?

561
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,760
baby.Iris?

562
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,580
Baby,come on.I'm sorry.

563
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,110
Iris?my baby!

564
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,660
Iris?
