3
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:22,111
Violet, you're an absolute killjoy.

4
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,097
I'm sorry.
I don't know anyone here.

5
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:26,431
That's what a party's for,
make a new friend.

6
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,872
You never know, it could be 
a Hollywood star, or a bank man.

7
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:31,998
The Bartlebys have a beautiful home.

8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,552
Of course, they have a beautiful home.

9
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:36,515
They built the railroad
from here to Timbuktu.

10
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:38,783
Do you think if you're this rich
you wake up in the morning

11
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,694
feeling very different from how we feel?

12
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:43,486
Sure.
You wake up warm.

13
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:47,374
There's Bartleby.
Oh! He makes valentino look like a slob.

14
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:51,623
I bet these Bartlebys feel 
well-rested and clear every day.

15
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:54,313
Because they don't have
to dream at night. Why would they?

16
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:57,913
You're an odd duck, Violet.
But I like you.

17
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:02,445
I swear, 1929 is gonna be the most splendid 
year of my life. I'm gonna see the world.

18
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,843
And I swear to meet a wealthy man,
who's also handsome.

19
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:06,918
Two!

20
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:08,161
One!

21
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,959
Happy new year!

22
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,369
- Hi.
- Hi.

23
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,367
I got a cup for you, too.

24
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,321
I don't think it's too cold,
but you could stick a finger in and see.

25
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,758
Had some at home.

26
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,631
I'm so relieved to see you.

27
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:28,974
I mean, I read about what happened 
to you last year with that maniac.

28
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,334
But you're doing well?

29
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:36,541
I thought maybe you would call.

30
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,208
I wanted to give you your space.

31
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,489
You look fine.

32
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,405
- So do you.
- It's 'cause I'm happy.

33
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,550
It's 'cause I'm getting married.

34
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,744
That's why you wanted to see me?

35
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,973
Lilly, when you know
someone's right for you,

36
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,038
you just feel it undeniably in your bones.

37
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,142
You ever had that feeling?

38
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,104
- What's his name?
- Jackie.

39
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:03,897
So will you let me buy you
a beautiful dress and shoes

40
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,569
and will you be my maid of honor?

41
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,073
- What about Chris?
- You're my firstborn. Chris will understand.

42
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,883
- You can't find her, can you?
- Your sister's not like you and me.

43
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:15,914
- She doesn't need a home base.
- She's running from the law, mom.

44
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:18,720
Lilly, watch what you say about 
your sister. / Yeah, I'm really busy. So...

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,516
Yeah, I know, your job's important 
to you. / Well, yeah, we're overloaded.

46
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:24,307
Sorry. / Right.
Well, don't have to make a decision now.

47
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,159
Have dinner with me and Jackie.

48
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,433
I'll see. Okay.

49
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,247
My great-grandmother was murdered in 1929.

50
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,007
1929.

51
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,398
All right.

52
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,962
I know it was a long time ago,

53
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:48,694
but I felt like I had to
come in here for myself.

54
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,780
I've been preparing,
doing the family history,

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,324
and I found this online.

56
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:58,852
- A death certificate.
- All I've got.

57
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,359
There's no relatives listed,
just the boarding house where she lived.

58
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,259
She gave up my grandmother for adoption,
so all we've ever known is her name.

59
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,633
Violet Polley.

60
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,855
That's not a lot for us to go on.

61
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,565
Detective Rush?
Aimee Goodman. / Hi.

62
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:19,352
Aimee's great-grandmother
was murdered in '29.

63
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:20,978
'29, huh?

64
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,796
Do you ever feel like
you want to change your life,

65
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,773
but you can't outrun
your screwed-up family?

66
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,419
Yeah.

67
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:32,833
Well, the women in my family
have not had the greatest lives.

68
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:37,832
I think it goes back to Violet.
Like a curse hanging over us.

69
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,974
The thing is...

70
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,127
look, we're swamped right now, Aimee.

71
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:45,262
Just not a lot of spare time.

72
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:48,152
We'll make the time.

73
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,968
I'll give it every second I have.

74
00:04:56,018 --> 00:05:02,607

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/04/09

87
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:30,587
Violet Polley, found dead
on Christmas day, 1929.

88
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,270
Cause of death, fractured skull
from a blow to the head.

89
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,474
Photo doesn't show a lot of blood
at the crime scene.

90
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,992
So she didn't die there.
Body was dumped.

91
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:42,545
Looks like she didn't have family
to spend the holidays with. None listed.

92
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:45,072
Home address is Darlington
boarding house in old city.

93
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:47,699
- I know that place.
- It's on the historical register.

94
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,668
Susan B. Anthony lived there for a time.

95
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:52,002
Made us go there in junior high.

96
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,920
Can't remember a thing
except the gift shop.

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,971
Guys in evidence whined at me like
a bunch of pre-teens.

98
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,286
Guess they hate dust.

99
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:05,059
All the belongings Violet had with her
when the body was found.

100
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,899
What's that?

101
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,067
A rattle. / For her baby.
Aimee's grandmother.

102
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,135
- We know who the father was?
- No one knows.

103
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,612
Don't even know specifically 
when the baby was born.

104
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:19,111
Just that she was brought up at
st. Mary's orphanage in Germantown.

105
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,626
Start with the Darlington boarding house,

106
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:24,726
maybe they can fill in the
gaps on Violet staying there. / Okay.

107
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,353
How'd it go with your mom this morning?

108
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,701
She's getting married.

109
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,789
For the fourth time.

110
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,590
That quilt was made from hand.

111
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,591
Amazing, right?

112
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:45,604
That's a girl with time on her hands.

113
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,260
Better than snacking.

114
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,992
Single girls lived in this place
from 1860 to 1934,

115
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:54,025
and left a lot behind.

116
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,902
Quilt included.

117
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:58,069
Plus, this.

118
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,788
- Girl's journal.
- Covers the years '28 and '29.

119
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:05,056
Ever seen the name
Violet Polley in there?

120
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,580
She's one of your main characters.

121
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Uh, starting on this page.

122
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:19,155
"Ginger Swensen made it her business to turn 
Violet from a rag-a-muffin to a real Sheba."

123
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,079
No kidding.
What's the date?

124
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,039
December 31, 1928.
New year's eve.

125
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,111
"First order of business, the hair."

126
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:36,050
I won't even recognize myself.

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,402
That's the idea.
Out with the old, in with the swanky.

128
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,533
Where'd you say you're from, Violet?

129
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,263
Oley valley, near Reading.

130
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:47,431
I don't drink.

131
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:50,819
I keep my mind sharp
because I'm a writer.

132
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,627
Well, that's funny, 
'cause every writer I've ever met

133
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:57,175
is fried to the hat or passed out on
Nick Bartleby's couch.

134
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,286
Violet, you got a daddy?

135
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,489
He's dead.
And my mother, too.

136
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,949
I mean, fella.

137
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,536
I did, but that's all over.

138
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:11,640
The male persuasion are saps,
all of them.

139
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,429
I moved to Philadelphia because that's 
what the bus ticket I stole said on it.

140
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,777
What about you?

141
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:20,202
I heard a song on the radio
one day, back at home.

142
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:23,052
It was the most on-the-level
song I'd ever heard,

143
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:27,571
and when it was over,
I felt utterly different.

144
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:28,644
What song?

145
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,631
"Poor man's blues" by Bessie Smith.

146
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:36,113
That's why I'm here,
to sell my songs to wonderful singers.

147
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:38,453
But Bessie Smith's a negro.

148
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,003
A writer needs to see the world.

149
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,412
Well, it ain't the world,
it's Philadelphia.

150
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,950
We'll see it tonight
at the Bartleby mansion.

151
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,975
It's gonna be the berries.

152
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,585
Bartleby mansion.

153
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,526
You seen that place?

154
00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:00,671
I could fit 25 of my apartments in there.

155
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,467
Those people were American royalty.

156
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,635
Their parties were known
all over the East coast.

157
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:07,824
Pretty good invitation for
a boarding-house girl.

158
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:12,041
The girls who stayed here would've 
been single and on the younger side.

159
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,811
Ain't a party without cute girls.

160
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,005
Any Bartlebys left in Philly?

161
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,959
Nick Bartleby died in a hunting
accident, I know that,

162
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,340
and the only one that's 
left here is Muriel.

163
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,321
And they say the old girl hasn't
left the house in years.

164
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,851
Can we borrow this journal?

165
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:34,222
Well, it's bad enough I'm letting 
you touch it with your bare hands.

166
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,305
Fine. But no direct sunlight,
and no moisture.

167
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,644
I was plotting my escape,

168
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,838
but then I found something helpful.

169
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:06,478
WPA transcripts.
Interviewee, Ginger Swensen.

170
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,789
Name from the boarding house journal.

171
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,598
Girl who cut Violet's hair.

172
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,999
WPA, during the new deal,

173
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,427
paid people to do interviews
with everyday Joes.

174
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,922
This Ginger was one of them,
talking about her roaring 20s.

175
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:20,574
"Before the big crash,
we whooped it up."

176
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:24,473
According to this, biggest whoop 
of all was that new year's eve party.

177
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:28,430
"Where a friend of mine, an inexperienced 
farm girl from Oley valley,"

178
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,268
"had a bit too much to drink."

179
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,767
Mine, it's my house.

180
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,980
Your brother says to bed
right now, Muriel.

181
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:46,487
You were right about liquor,
it is an artist's best friend.

182
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,958
I'm full of a certain Joie de vivre.

183
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,874
I'd like to sing a song for everyone.

184
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:57,072
Betty's The Cat's Pajamas.
Hit it, Violet.

185
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,580
Violet?

186
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,984
Hello!

187
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,446
This is a lovely party.

188
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:31,167
This song is about
poor farmers where I'm from.

189
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,165
Enjoy!

190
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:40,382
 ¢Ü Woke up this morning ¢Ü

191
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:45,858
 ¢Ü I got one dress left ¢Ü

192
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:49,173
 ¢Ü woke up this morning ¢Ü

193
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:54,268
 ¢Ü I got one dress left ¢Ü

194
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:57,828
 ¢Ü bank man say I ain't never ¢Ü

195
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:03,039
 ¢Ü gonna get the rest ¢Ü

196
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,967
 ¢Ü I prayed for water ¢Ü

197
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:10,823
 ¢Ü I prayed to save our land ¢Ü

198
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:14,912
 ¢Ü lord, I prayed for water ¢Ü

199
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:19,960
 ¢Ü I prayed to save our land ¢Ü

200
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,081
 ¢Ü the dust done come ¢Ü

201
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:29,035
 ¢Ü and I can't find a helping hand ¢Ü

202
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:33,455
 ¢Ü daddy gone and left us ¢Ü

203
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:37,659
 ¢Ü mama up and died ¢Ü

204
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,988
 ¢Ü if I weren't so thirsty ¢Ü

205
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:46,544
 ¢Ü I'd be likely to cry ¢Ü

206
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:50,488
 ¢Ü woke up this morning ¢Ü

207
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:55,339
 ¢Ü got this old dress left ¢Ü

208
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,849
 ¢Ü woke up this morning ¢Ü

209
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:03,584
 ¢Ü this old rag is all

210
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:07,754
 ¢Ü gonna cut it into curtains ¢Ü

211
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:15,177
 ¢Ü and show the world how I look best ¢Ü

212
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,021
Thank you.

213
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,691
- What's your name?
- I am Felix Spyczyk.

214
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,868
Happy new year, Mr. Spyczyk.

215
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,342
Hey, what do you mean to do here?

216
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:38,200
Come with me, someplace private.

217
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,703
What kind of girl do you think I am?

218
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:43,418
Kind of girl who
drinks too much champagne.

219
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,974
Get your filthy hands off me, mister!

220
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,427
"We were only young girls
with the most vague idea"

221
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,928
"of what catching a man's eye
could really mean."

222
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,274
So this Spyczyk takes advantage 
of the girls at his boss's party.

223
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,398
Maybe what he did to
her had consequences.

224
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:02,073
Those consequences wound up at 
st. Mary's orphanage without a mother.

225
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,127
Felix Spyczyk was Bartleby's driver.

226
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,693
That's what he told the
arresting officer in 1922.

227
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,662
When he's picked up for
illegal possession of liquor.

228
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:19,454
Don't forget frequenting a bawdy house 
in '28 and possession of opium, '25.

229
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,965
Not the man you'd want around 
the young girls at your party.

230
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,601
Be great to ask the Bartlebys about it.

231
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:26,043
Kat and Scotty went to 
the mansion this morning. No answer.

232
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:28,419
Family lawyer hasn't returned any calls.

233
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,862
- Hey.
- Heard about your Bartleby visit.

234
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,859
Could've sworn I saw Muriel
through the curtains.

235
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,714
She must leave the house sometimes.

236
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:37,304
Lie in wait while she gets
the morning paper?

237
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,986
Your mom called, a few times.

238
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:42,945
Wanted to make sure you had 
the address for the restaurant.

239
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:46,408
She wants me to be her maid of honor.

240
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,465
Buttering you up with a free meal.

241
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:52,777
I guess, if I go,
at least she'll stop calling.

242
00:14:55,636 --> 00:15:00,782
We're investigating the murder of a girl seen
at the Bartleby new year's eve party, 1928,

243
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:03,918
being manhandled by Felix Spyczyk.

244
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,801
My grandfather did many things during 
that period that he was not proud of.

245
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:10,154
Includes everything on his criminal record

246
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,740
and whatever young girls
he was seen manhandling.

247
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,576
- He told you about that?
- It was part of his job.

248
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,262
- He was a procurer.
- For Bartleby.

249
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:21,606
Whatever the great man wanted,
that's what my grandfather had to get him.

250
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:25,609
- Booze and girls.
- Serves the guy for seven years,

251
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:29,275
then one day, Nick Bartleby fires him.

252
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:33,373
Plucks a clock off the mantle,
and says, "take this and hit the road."

253
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:34,500
He made good, though.

254
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,741
Sold the clock for $75 
and started Spyczyk shipping.

255
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:42,490
Took me years,
but I tracked it down,

256
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,876
bought it at auction.

257
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,752
Your grandfather tell you a lot
about his days with Bartleby?

258
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:50,390
At the end of his life,
he wanted to tell his stories.

259
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,408
So I listened and made tapes of them.

260
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:59,160
How about the night he procured 
Violet Polley at the new year's party?

261
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,155
The one girl who said no to Nick Bartleby.

262
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:09,855
She said, "my name is
Violet Polley from Oley valley,"

263
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:13,022
"and I am a songwriter,
not a boozy floozy."

264
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,955
That's her, our girl.

265
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:19,123
Mr. Bartleby had said to me,
"get the singing dame."

266
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,415
So I did.

267
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,128
- Let me out!
- Aw! You call it a night.

268
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:30,423
Okay, Spyczyk, old boy,
let her out.

269
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,305
You told me bring this one.

270
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:35,316
Not if she's violently opposed to being
in the same room with me,

271
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,836
which she clearly is.

272
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,236
That is, unless I'm growing on you 
and you'd like a drink. / No, thank you.

273
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,292
Wait! Spyczyk, bar the door
until the lady answers one question.

274
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,345
What on earth was that song?

275
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:51,091
"One last dress" is an original 
by Violet Polley. / Oh, I know her.

276
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:54,499
She's known to get a little soused at soirees 
and show her knickers to strangers.

277
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,525
I do not!

278
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,734
Well, darn it.

279
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,448
Do you ever miss being part of 
the human race with the rest of us,

280
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:09,886
or do you like life up on your mountain?

281
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,663
I don't think I'm any better
than the average Joe,

282
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,122
if that's what you're implying.

283
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:15,292
I just wonder if it gets old,

284
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,756
waking up each morning with
nothing to work for.

285
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:23,178
If I had a talent like yours,
I would work, Violet Polley.

286
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,573
Thank you, Mr. Bartleby.

287
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,553
But as god made me,
I can only offer you charm,

288
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:29,102
- which does nothing for you.
- True.

289
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,705
And my loyal driver Spyczyk,

290
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:33,078
half as handsome but twice
the man that I am.

291
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:35,270
He and I can see you safely
home in my packard.

292
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,884
I don't think so.

293
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:41,799
I'm a songwriter, Mr. Bartleby,
not a boozy floozy.

294
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,768
So Violet rejected Nick Bartleby.
That's a bold move.

295
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:57,179
Here's the punch line.
Bartleby loved it.

296
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,669
The one girl who says no
turns his head?

297
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,551
Sent 300 flowers to her 
boarding house the next day.

298
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,346
Told my grandfather to lay them
thick as oriental carpet.

299
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,847
How many of those tapes you got?

300
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:12,307
Days worth. How much would you like 
to know about Poland?

301
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:15,133
We'll get back to you.

302
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:20,566
"300 flowers" is the name
of an old blues standard. / Yeah?

303
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,970
The lyrics go "like an oriental
carpet, thick and sweet."

304
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,840
Violet was a songwriter.
Where'd you hear that?

305
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,723
Singer I know covers it, Lena.

306
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,702
Lena, huh?

307
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,418
Let me get a look at the threads.
That's all right.

308
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:37,478
What are you doing?

309
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:41,131
Just making sure you look good enough to
see the woman you talk about in your sleep.

310
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,703
- We're going to see her.
- Not we.

311
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:51,228
"300 flowers" by V. Polley.

312
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,279
So she got a song published.

313
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,606
Few dollars in her pocket.

314
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,536
Pretty upbeat song,

315
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,322
but it is about a love triangle.

316
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:00,835
Woman choosing between two men.

317
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:06,358
"When I gave up what was ours
I met a man so kind."

318
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:08,153
Nick Bartleby could be the kind one.

319
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:12,891
Leaving a woman 300 flowers is kind.

320
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,603
Why don't you bring it to live?

321
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,518
 ¢Ü You and I ¢Ü

322
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,163
 ¢Ü said good-bye ¢Ü

323
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:39,695
 ¢Ü I thought I'd die ¢Ü

324
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:44,363
 ¢Ü 300 flowers... ¢Ü

325
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:50,754
 ¢Ü I've been sitting here for hours ¢Ü

326
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,500
Came here to take you back,

327
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,177
but it seems like you've plumb forgotten
what you and me made together.

328
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:03,459
Hate to think of what you been 
doing to earn these flowers.

329
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,933
Been working on my songs.

330
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,222
Get your head on straight, Violet.
You're acting bigger than you are.

331
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:10,933
I won't come home with you
to tend to pigs all my life.

332
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:15,348
That's who you are, woman.
I don't want to tell you again.

333
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:19,742
You have three guesses to guess 
which gorgeous man is downstairs

334
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:24,585
asking for you personally.
Oh...

335
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,405
I'm...

336
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:42,015
- You been acting loose?
- Be careful, she kicks.

337
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:45,291
I've seen it. / She's spoken for.
You scram, cake-eater.

338
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,093
She speaks for herself.

339
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:51,469
You tell people back in Oley valley
they'll be hearing about me.

340
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:55,968
But they will never
see me back there again.

341
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:59,100
I'll take a ride in that fancy car.

342
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,531
I'd like to see the world, please.

343
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:08,567
 ¢Ü Don't be blue, find someone new ¢Ü

344
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,394
 ¢Ü 300 flowers... ¢Ü

345
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:17,088
Sounds like your Violet chose Bartleby.

346
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,994
Song says "I left behind what was ours."

347
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:22,896
- You think that could mean a baby?
- Could be.

348
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:27,303
Songs from this era are coded
when referring to something scandalous.

349
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:31,467
Hometown guy thinks he's gonna get 
a second chance with the mother of his baby,

350
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,944
but he gets thrown over for someone new.

351
00:21:34,944 --> 00:21:38,497
Many sad songs written about
being thrown over.

352
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,580
Many lives ended over it, too.

353
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:49,484
We got the hometown boyfriend's full name
from the boarding house journal.

354
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:52,723
Jeb Shiner. / Anything on him 
being the father of Violet's kid?

355
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:56,142
- Not yet, but...
- We know he didn't kill Violet.

356
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:58,981
He was too busy with his pig.

357
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,705
Farmer's almanac.

358
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:05,656
"Jeb Shiner of reading, Pennsylvania
and his prize-winning swine,"

359
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:08,100
"December 22, 1929."

360
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,966
Three days before Violet was killed.

361
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:12,185
And the pig contest was in California.

362
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:15,638
In 1929, it would've taken him more than 
three days to get from there to here.

363
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:18,815
So jeb wasn't in Philadelphia
when Violet died.

364
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,988
What'd you dig up on
the Bartleby relationship?

365
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,727
That the man was a dog.

366
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,285
Check it out.

367
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,275
Photoplay, us weekly back in the day.

368
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:31,872
And there's Nick Bartleby looking smug
with a gal named Carmela Lefleur.

369
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:34,383
- Who's that?
- She was Mae West-type actress.

370
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:36,406
Had a burlesque show.
It was pretty famous,

371
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:39,248
and she and Bartleby were 
an on-again, off-again thing.

372
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:40,491
Where's Violet fit in?

373
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:44,124
According to gossip?
right in the middle.

374
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:48,394
"Nick Bartleby had the nerve
to bring his new squeeze"

375
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:51,057
"to the black cat house in Philadelphia..."

376
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:56,803
 ¢Ü I'm wearing secondhand hats ¢Ü

377
00:22:56,803 --> 00:22:59,516
 ¢Ü secondhand cologne ¢Ü

378
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:05,481
 ¢Ü That's why they call me

379
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:10,234
 ¢Ü even our piano in the parlor ¢Ü

380
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,497
I don't have the right clothes
for this place.

381
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:17,175
To look like you do in that dress,
these women would pay $200.

382
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:20,176
Well, they only need two and a quarter.

383
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:26,727
Nick, this might just be 
the greatest night of my entire life.

384
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,631
Is it me or the dancers?

385
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:34,677
Right now, I'm looking over your right
shoulder at Carmela Lefleur in the flesh.

386
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,827
Trust me, you're not
seeing her in the flesh.

387
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:39,727
She is absolutely sensationally beautiful

388
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:43,033
and she'd be just the right gal
to sing my songs.

389
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:45,571
Hello, Nick.

390
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:48,119
Carmela.

391
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,106
Oh, I see.

392
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:52,567
So Philadelphia really is a small town.

393
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:55,642
Violet, let's go.
We can go anywhere you'd like.

394
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,667
I just don't want our evening ruined.

395
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,386
Hey, pal? What's the meaning of this?

396
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,814
The milk's for the girl you're baby-sitting.
Help her grow up strong.

397
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:09,784
- Keep it to yourself, would you, Carmela?
- From now on, I will, mister.

398
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,543
Don't cry, darling.

399
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:14,255
This is nothing compared
to what I'll do to you

400
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:18,285
if I catch your flat behind
with Nick Bartleby ever again.

401
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,781
Okay.

402
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:25,414
Carmela Lefleur put it out there.

403
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,189
Don't be in public with my man.

404
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:30,751
Could be Violet didn't take the advice 
to heart. Got spotted again.

405
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:34,127
Got a contact for Carmela.
It's a local guy.

406
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:37,278
- Where'd you get that?
- Name on a web site.

407
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:43,909
"Mickey Stein. No. 1 fan."

408
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,181
I know, fan sites are so cheesy.

409
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,792
I put it up to attract info for my thesis.

410
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,609
What's your thesis on, Mr. Stein?

411
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:54,179
"Carmela Lefleur:

412
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,340
The quintessential vaudeville girl's 
re-invention of the feminine"

413
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,302
"in her work in Philadelphia
from 1927 to 1930."

414
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:08,096
- Specific.
- And yet there's so much to tell.

415
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,602
- What sparked your interest in Carmela?
- My grandfather was her dresser.

416
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:14,121
His job was to put her clothes on her?

417
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:18,355
Wardrobe, personal assistant, hair,
full-time confidante.

418
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,902
He tell you about Carmela's
relationship with Nick Bartleby?

419
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:25,952
Like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, 
those two. Back and forth.

420
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:29,145
We're looking into the murder of a girl
that went out with Bartleby.

421
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,024
- Carmela wasn't happy about it.
- Murder?

422
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:35,506
Really!
Do tell.

423
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:38,822
We're gonna be the ones taking notes here.

424
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:41,631
- Violet Polley. Ever hear about her?
- Sure!

425
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,009
Didn't know she was murdered.

426
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,014
She really pissed Carmela off,

427
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:47,013
showing up at the burlesque show
with Bartleby.

428
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,293
Well, that, that was then.

429
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:53,037
A few months after that,
the girls made up.

430
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:55,537
- How do you know about it?
- My granddad was there.

431
00:25:55,537 --> 00:26:01,192
It was after one of Carmela's "Dragon Lady" 
performances at The Black Cat House.

432
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,154
Such gorgeous silk.

433
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:05,918
Straight from the orient, darling.

434
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:10,712
I've got a chinaman mad for me. 
He thinks I'd be big as tea over there.

435
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,584
Hello, Carmela.

436
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,212
Can I have one moment of your time?

437
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:19,727
Autographed pictures in an hour,
behind the stage door. Shoo, fly.

438
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:23,004
It's all right, Mickey.
Don't you know who this is?

439
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:26,555
- It's Nick Bartleby's girl.
- Oh, dear.

440
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,664
Carmela, please don't turn me away.

441
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,322
I'd like to ask you something.

442
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,288
Well, what is it?

443
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:38,205
I'm a songwriter,
writing original tunes.

444
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:42,402
I write from the soul, about the plight
of the average Jack or Jane,

445
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:47,560
people like my parents were
humble, good people.

446
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,334
Get her a soda water.

447
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:57,171
I'm sorry. This is so strange.

448
00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:59,729
You been crying like this regular?

449
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:02,492
Nick's in Europe.
I suppose I miss him.

450
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,925
Feeling queasy, too?
Achy, like you got the flu?

451
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:08,455
Yeah. That's it.
You had it, too?

452
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:11,185
I did. Once.

453
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:14,162
You're knocked up, kid.

454
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:16,772
No.

455
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:19,686
What would you know about it?
You don't have kids.

456
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:22,551
It doesn't always have to end that way.

457
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,909
But judging by the way you
filled out through the middle,

458
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,905
it's too late for you.

459
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,993
I don't know what I'll do.

460
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,977
I've almost run through my savings.

461
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:35,751
Nick's gone and I've been
too ill to get a job.

462
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,976
What about your humble parents?

463
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,344
They're gone.

464
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:46,222
Um, cigarette? Uh, scotch?

465
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:48,202
No, thank you.

466
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:52,053
Kid, how much for a song?

467
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:56,278
- How many do you want?
- How many you got?

468
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:01,362
It was Nick Bartleby's baby.

469
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:03,189
Aimee's a Bartleby.

470
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:06,158
- That oughta blow her socks off.
- I know I'd be thrilled.

471
00:28:06,158 --> 00:28:08,284
Rich guy doesn't wanna set up
camp with his side dish?

472
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:09,906
And her illegitimate child.

473
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:17,026
Gorgeous, rich man seeks poor songwriter
to birth scion and live in marital bliss?

474
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:19,554
I don't think so.

475
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:32,010
Are you dating anyone?

476
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:35,291
Ray came through town.

477
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:40,201
- Who's he?
- I want better for you, is all.

478
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:45,947
Well, there was this D.A. Kite.

479
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:49,543
- He was a good one, but...
- He was too good, right?

480
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,793
- Not for me. I'm a lightweight.
- She is.

481
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:56,120
Remember when you broke your jaw?
She was always into something.

482
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,627
What happened? You fell, right?

483
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:00,355
A broken jaw is horrible.

484
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:02,402
She used to run out 
in the middle of the night.

485
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,630
I can't believe I even slept,
I'd, I'd worry so much.

486
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,502
I was attacked.

487
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,594
I didn't fall.

488
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:14,230
We lived in some bad neighborhoods.

489
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:17,188
How about I check on our order?

490
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:20,910
The look on your face, all night, what?

491
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,755
He doesn't even know
that you're an alcoholic? / Was.

492
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:26,108
You could try being polite to him.
This is my new husband.

493
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:28,151
- For the next month.
- Oh, stop it.

494
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:29,921
- Maybe I fail, but I try.
- It's more than failed

495
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:33,963
when you bring home guys
who hit you and steal from you.

496
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:38,764
But I try, okay? I find happiness,
if only for a little while.

497
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:40,792
That's more than you can say.

498
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,631
At least I'm not alone.

499
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:46,406
I'd rather be alone than clinging 
to a man who doesn't even know me.

500
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:49,021
Well, as usual,
you're so much better than... / Stop.

501
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,011
How long did you and the D.A.
keep it together, huh?

502
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,173
- More than a month?
- I can't go to your wedding.

503
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,596
What, work is so important?

504
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:58,061
Because I can't smile and,
and pose for pictures

505
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,142
and pretend that everything's
fine when it's not.

506
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:03,628
I just want one night of
happiness with you there.

507
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,169
Is that so wrong?

508
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,439
Have I done so badly I can't have that?

509
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,072
Well, I can't give it to you.

510
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:16,170
You deserve it, too, Lilly.

511
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:19,428
To just be happy.

512
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:00,386
I'm out right now.
Leave your message.

513
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:01,828
Kite.

514
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,818
Lilly Rush.

515
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,537
Well, you're working late, I bet.

516
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:12,061
Look, I want to say something,

517
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:19,559
and I know the ship has sailed with us,
so that's not why I'm calling.

518
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,912
I, uh...

519
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:25,577
well, I'm just gonna say it.

520
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:31,899
Look, I know it's on me,
how we ended things.

521
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,636
I got flipped out.

522
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,504
I just...

523
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:42,347
I just want to not end up
like my mom, you know?

524
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:46,454
But I don't wanna end up
like this either.

525
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:49,469
So I'm done.

526
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:54,068
I'm done with having 
to walk home alone.

527
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:59,986
She can't do it, but I can.
I can change.

528
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,402
Lilly?

529
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:13,702
- I'm related to the Bartlebys?
- Yes. / Definitely?

530
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:16,009
We got a lead from Carmela
Lefleur's biographer

531
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,445
on the doctor who helped
girls in trouble back then.

532
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:22,794
This is the doctor's record
of your grandmother's birth.

533
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,889
"Baby girl. Eight pounds, 
three ounces. Rose."

534
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:29,593
That's my grandmother.

535
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:32,964
There's a quilt from the boarding
house where Violet lived.

536
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:36,427
- Says "Rosie" on it.
- Maybe Violet made it.

537
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:41,478
So why did I grow up the way I did
and the Bartlebys grew up the way they did?

538
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:43,178
We're gonna find out.

539
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:46,096
Your great-grandmother was a songwriter.

540
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:50,650
She published a song called "300 flowers."

541
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,292
What's it sound like?

542
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:57,162
It's beautiful.

543
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:59,913
I'll have to find it.

544
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:02,572
Muriel Bartleby's gang 
of lawyers just called.

545
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:06,413
Says you've got 20 minutes.
And they're timing it.

546
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,706
That sounds like we're being summoned.

547
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:24,917
I hear we've got
20 minutes with you, Muriel.

548
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,325
I, uh...

549
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:28,913
I don't see people as a rule.

550
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:30,937
Thanks for the exception.

551
00:33:31,978 --> 00:33:34,660
Do you know about our family?

552
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,969
My brother had the most
marvelous parties in this house.

553
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:42,334
The walls pulsed with life.

554
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:47,330
Now look. / Violet Polley had 
your brother Nick's child.

555
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,579
People always wanted
to claim our name as their own.

556
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:52,003
People like Violet?

557
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:58,323
We were so careful not to allow 
a crooked branch on the family tree.

558
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:01,015
Now there are no Bartlebys left.

559
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:04,167
Except for Violet's descendants.

560
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:09,247
Sounds like your brother will do anything
to protect the family name.

561
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:13,704
My brother had nothing
to do with Violet's death.

562
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:15,456
How do you know?

563
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:19,497
Because I saw him wash 
his hands of her. / When?

564
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:24,489
Some time after the crash.

565
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:32,559
Violet was right here,
in this room with her baby.

566
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:36,091
Daddy gave it to me!
I won't sell it!

567
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:39,139
Muriel! Behave!

568
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:45,803
Our banker, Mr. Treehorn, threw himself 
out of his sixth floor window today.

569
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:48,098
Buck up, Bartleby.
It'll turn around.

570
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:50,009
It's the end of the world.

571
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:54,323
Violet Polley is here to see you, sir.

572
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,302
Tell her I'm away.

573
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,044
You should see her, sir.

574
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:04,653
- Get out of my house, Spyczyk.
- Sir?

575
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:08,909
I cannot afford you.
You are dismissed.

576
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:26,146
Violet.

577
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:29,599
You've been home awhile now,
and you haven't rang me back.

578
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,168
It ain't on me, kid.

579
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:34,861
Me and him are strictly platonic.

580
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,460
What is that?

581
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,408
This is our daughter.

582
00:35:45,124 --> 00:35:48,936
I know you meant to be through with me, 
Nick, but this is our child.

583
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:51,311
I named her Rose 
after the roses you gave me.

584
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:53,034
This is scandalous.

585
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:54,244
Then marry me.

586
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:55,996
Violet, that's ridiculous.

587
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:58,418
You're a grown man.
You can do as you please.

588
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:02,391
I did. 
And now I'm through.

589
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:06,425
If you won't marry me, take Rose.

590
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,690
I can't provide for her alone.
I need your help.

591
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,763
I can't give you anything!

592
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:14,264
I can't help you,
I can't even help myself.

593
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:17,000
You can take my clock.

594
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,311
It's made of gold.

595
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,162
You're no kind of man, Bartleby.

596
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,593
Why don't you save the day, Carmela?
Take the baby yourself,

597
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:44,900
and raise it backstage with your
opium pipe and your fairies.

598
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:49,982
We, uh...

599
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:52,565
we could've taken the little baby.

600
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:54,461
We survived.

601
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,791
When was this?

602
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,105
Christmas day.

603
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,812
You gave Violet your gold clock?

604
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:04,398
A child's idea of help.

605
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:08,336
Who knows how much it was worth?

606
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,925
Seventy-five dollars.

607
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:14,239
Daniel, we'd like to take 
the clock in with us.

608
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,836
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Why is that, Daniel ?

609
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:18,431
Well, it's a family heirloom.

610
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:21,708
You know the story
Felix told you isn't true.

611
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,128
Bartleby didn't give him that clock.

612
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,558
Well, it's what he always told me.

613
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:29,946
Except that one time
when he told you the truth.

614
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:34,482
You said your grandfather wanted
to tell you his stories before he died.

615
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,252
To get them off his chest.

616
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:39,419
We think he told you
about a murder, Daniel.

617
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:42,689
Felix Spyczyk was an honorable man.

618
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:45,440
He was the last one seen
with her, day she died.

619
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,166
He took the clock from her.

620
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,365
Why do you have to do this?

621
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,260
He's gone now. He's long gone,
and he can't be punished.

622
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,747
Violet's family has been punished.

623
00:37:54,747 --> 00:37:58,835
Their lives would have been so different
if they had her around.

624
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:02,138
They deserve to put it to bed.

625
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:12,311
I thought about destroying the tape.

626
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,804
But it's what he wanted.

627
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:17,702
He wanted to tell the truth.

628
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,585
So here.

629
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:34,805
That's okay, grandfather.
You can rest now.

630
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:38,428
I want to say it,
what I did to her.

631
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,058
It's okay.

632
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:45,558
It was after she left Bartleby's
with nothing but a crying baby

633
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:48,672
and that gold clock.

634
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:58,395
It's okay, baby Rose.
It's okay.

635
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:00,285
It's okay.

636
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:02,087
It's okay.

637
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:09,245
- He is scum.
- Yes, he is.

638
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:11,306
People think he is like god,

639
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:15,903
all of them, in their beautiful house,
Bartlebys!

640
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:18,678
We know the truth about Bartleby,

641
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:22,575
and what he did to you 
and your little baby.

642
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,553
We can tell the world.

643
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:27,170
What are you suggesting, Mr. Spyczyk?

644
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,147
I will tell him give us money
or we tell newspapers.

645
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:33,189
He has no money.
You heard him.

646
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:35,931
These people survive like cockroach. 
He has money.

647
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:39,228
He can always find what he needs, 
Nick Bartleby.

648
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:42,002
No. I've made it this far.
I'm a girl who finds a way.

649
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:44,069
Wake up.

650
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:47,904
You have baby and no money.

651
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:49,586
Today I don't, but tomorrow...

652
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:51,512
This is good plan.

653
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:54,654
This is how to do
as the rich do in America.

654
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:56,300
Squeezing them.

655
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,128
I'm not that sort of person.

656
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:02,435
You take clock already.

657
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:04,912
You let him buy you.

658
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:08,763
I'd rather find a way to make it 
on my own than be a lowly blackmailer.

659
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,112
I am not lowly!

660
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:13,462
Blackmailing makes you
as bad as Bartleby.

661
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:18,308
I'm not like Bartleby!

662
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:22,788
I'm not.

663
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:31,135
Rosie...

664
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:08,773
All right, moppet. All right.

665
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:40,138
 ¢Ü You and I said good-bye ¢Ü

666
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:45,440
 ¢Ü I thought I'd die ¢Ü

667
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,832
 ¢Ü 300 flowers ¢Ü

668
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:58,635
 ¢Ü I've been sitting here forever ¢Ü
