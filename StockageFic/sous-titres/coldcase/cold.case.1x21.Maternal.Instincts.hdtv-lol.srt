2
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:10,753
# I'm trying to tell you 
something bout my life #

3
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:15,995
# Maybe give me insight 
between black and white #

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:20,680
# And the best thing 
you've ever done for me #

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,741
# Is to help me take 
my life less seriously #

6
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:29,310
# It's only life after all #

7
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:35,627
# Now darkness has 
a hunger that's insatiable #

8
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:40,442
# And lightness has 
a call that's hard to hear #

9
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:45,377
# I wrap my fear around 
me like a blanket #

10
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:49,120
# I sailed my ship of 
safety till I sank it #

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,162
# I'm crawling on your shores #

12
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,210
What's up?

13
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,027
You know Lindesy Dunlay?

14
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:36,007
No.

15
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,907
Court-appointed child psychologist,
I went to high school with her.

16
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,275
Oh, yeah? What she want with us?

17
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,391
Case of hers. Sean Morgan was
arrested for a strong-arm.

18
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,491
Judge sent him to Lindsey for evaluation.

19
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:46,036
And?

20
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,293
When he was three, Sean 
witnessed his mother's murder.

21
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,644
The case was never solved. / Lil!

22
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,215
Hey, Lindsey. / Hey.

23
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,232
It's my partner Scotty Valens.

24
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,798
How you doing? / Good.

25
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:57,351
So, uh, what was she like in high school?

26
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,903
She'll never tell, right?

27
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:02,016
Let's just say Lilly and I 
never made the year book.

28
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,789
The holy terror is over there.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,119
What's his deal?

30
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,840
17-year-old thug in the making.

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,455
Sean came up in foster care?

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,983
I'm hoping the judge goes easy,

33
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:17,318
'cause in another year 
he gets the big time.

34
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:18,490
What was the robbery?

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,471
Purse snatching off an LOL.

36
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,892
Done two others just like it.

37
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,725
He's next to hopeless.

38
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:28,015
But it seems like he has some real 
memories of his mom getting killed.

39
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,698
That's why I called you.

40
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,302
He never told anyone about it?

41
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,135
No one that believed him.

42
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:40,970
Sean, this is Detective Rush 
who I told you about.

43
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,509
My partner Detective Valens.

44
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,126
Partners, huh?

45
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,584
You hit that yet?

46
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,215
I know I just misunderstood you, Sean.

47
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,829
I'm about to turn 18.

48
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,705
If he don't man-up real soon, 
maybe you and I could hook it up.

49
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,595
Yeah, yeah, I'll think about it.

50
00:02:56,595 --> 00:03:00,136
Sean, stop wasting their time 
and tell them about your mom.

51
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,801
Lindesy said you had some specific 
memories about her being killed?

52
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:04,988
I forget 'em.

53
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:07,510
So you like stealing from old 
ladies, huh? That's impressive.

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,901
What do you know about it, smalls?

55
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:13,478
I know I got better things to do that 
monkey with a kid trying to get attention.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,048
Let's bounce.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,835
I'm sorry, I thought this kid was different.

58
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:27,951
What?

59
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:29,977
You get ignored all the time, right?

60
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,553
Treated like what you say
either ain't true or worth crap.

61
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:34,976
Yeah, that's about it.

62
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,515
And here come two people who want 
to listen to what you have to say

63
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:39,136
and you're letting us walk away?

64
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,906
You want your mom's case 
looked at, we're your chance.

65
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:46,627
Why should I believe you?

66
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,629
Look at me.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,597
Am I lying?

68
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,534
Red and yellow balloons.

69
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:06,996
A train and the name "Bobby".

70
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:11,086
That's what I remember 
about her being murdered.

71
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:24,176

79
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,077
Rebecca Morgan.

80
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,414
A 30-year-old waitress.

81
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,527
Stabbed to death in her 
rowhouse in Mayfair.

82
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:50,545
No weapon recorvered.

83
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,455
Got some prints, hair, but never a match.

84
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:54,065
Lady was butchered real good.

85
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,267
Gaping neck wound.

86
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,685
Three-year-old Sean sat 
with her all night like that.

87
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,413
No wonder he's a little s.o.b.

88
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,787
Who found the body?

89
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:02,988
Neighbor. Leon Kincaid.

90
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:06,213
Up early for a jog, heard 
the kid wailing, called 911.

91
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:07,173
Suspects?

92
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,741
She worked as a cocktail waitress
at a joint called Boilermakers.

93
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,302
Ton of interviews from there.

94
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:15,076
Patrons, co-workers--- nothing stuck.

95
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,421
Jeffries is running the names again.

96
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,506
Maybe 15 years later someone's 
true colors have come through.

97
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:21,419
Anything on Sean's father?

98
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,554
The assigned's notebook says 
he was never in the picture.

99
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:26,063
No next of kin, landing Sean in foster care...

100
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,540
leaving us with red and yellow balloons,

101
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,574
a train and the name Bobby.

102
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:34,956
Pretty modest starting point.

103
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,206
Any luck for us?

104
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:41,047
Yeah. Your 911 caller, Leon Kincaid,
the guy's on the books.

105
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:42,399
What'd he do?

106
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,136
Well, starting in '91, been arrested 
for open lewdeness, loitering,

107
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:49,721
and my personal favorite, 
prowling at night.

108
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,349
Any idea where Leon 
hangs out these days?

109
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:57,241
Yeah, he happens to be the top man
at the Germantown Dorsett Bank.

110
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,975
Leon Kincaid?

111
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,504
Detectives Rush and Valens. 
Can we have a minute?

112
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,629
Um... Okay.

113
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,947
I'll be right back, Jodie.

114
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,439
This way.

115
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:16,762
About 6:00 a.m.

116
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:19,656
I'm out running and hear 
the kid bawling his head off,

117
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,278
so I go aroung the back

118
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:24,443
and look in, and, uh... 
it was just awful.

119
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:26,204
Did you know Rebecca?

120
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,595
Enough to say hello, that's about it.

121
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:30,921
Ever see anyone go in 
or out of her house?

122
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,103
Nah.

123
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,127
Pretty girl, right?

124
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:36,036
I guess.

125
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:38,068
Ever ask her out?

126
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,562
Like I said, we never really spoke, so, uh...

127
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,722
I'm sorry, I'm not much help.

128
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,565
Uh, but I should get back.

129
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,154
To Jodie?

130
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,385
Pardon?

131
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:53,460
Need to get back so he can look over 
her shoulder, down her blouse.

132
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,990
Busty girl.

133
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,701
We know about you, Leon.

134
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,624
We know you've had your 
trouble with boundaries.

135
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,955
I never hurt anyone.

136
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,619
I never touched.

137
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:05,070
Did my probation, got counseling.

138
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,326
Good for you.

139
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,556
But in '89, you were just getting revved up.

140
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:11,691
Hey, Leon, you registered 
as a sex offender?

141
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,081
No, hell no. I never molested anyone.

142
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,406
Still, maybe I'll talk to sex 
crimes see what we can do

143
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:17,673
about getting you on the books.

144
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:19,679
Yeah, 'cause this sheep 
dresses up real good.

145
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,922
Better get the word out.

146
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:24,608
Oh, jeez, okay. Okay.

147
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,876
I'd peep on Rebecca.

148
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,267
Pretty regular?

149
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:33,878
Yeah.

150
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,589
How about the night she died?

151
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,651
But I didn't kill her.

152
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,642
Ned, is something wrong?

153
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,178
I wanted to apologize for earlier.

154
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,902
You don't have to say anything.

155
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,453
Just...

156
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,122
well, the ball's in your court, okay?

157
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,892
Okay. Thank you.

158
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,928
One more thing.

159
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:05,866
What's all this?

160
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,626
For Sean, for his birthday.

161
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,651
Hey, these are for you, little man.

162
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:11,595
There you go.

163
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,546
Ned, don't give him any gifts.

164
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,921
Oh, every boy needs something 
to open on his birthday.

165
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,499
We have cake, that's enough.

166
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,703
Oh, here.

167
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:20,392
This is gonna be just like the Pampers.

168
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,843
Oh, no, no, no. 
I take back what I said earlier.

169
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,807
I've written everything down.
I'm going to write you a check.

170
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,483
What, so it can bounce?

171
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,369
Here you go.

172
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,628
Red and yellow balloons.

173
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,699
Like Sean remembered.

174
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,868
So, Leon, that's all you saw?

175
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:48,237
I wasn't exactly pumped to stick around
for a three-year-old's birthday party.

176
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,913
Right. No girl coming out of cake.

177
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,561
Where's the upside for the 
guy standing in the hedge?

178
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,133
At least my move wasn't handling 
out Pampers and balloons.

179
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,935
This Ned guy's a complete stooge.

180
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,394
Ned Ryan.

181
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,829
The write-up here says you 
told the assigned detective

182
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,467
you hadn't seen Rebecca in over a week.

183
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,868
Been so long now.

184
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:14,046
I couldn't tell you when 
I talked to Rebecca last.

185
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,093
Well, how about the night 
she was murdered?

186
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:16,457
No.

187
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,697
Ned, we know you were at Rebecca's
shortly before it happened.

188
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:22,160
And you came bearing gifts; balloons.

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,796
So don't lie about it like you 
did the first time around.

190
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,094
Maybe... I was there.

191
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,459
But I left after a few minutes.

192
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:32,967
But you were angry, right?

193
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,247
So maybe you did a U-turn.

194
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:37,596
Yeah, 'cause you and Rebecca 
fought earlier that day, too.

195
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,233
Rebecca was a regular at the store.

196
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:43,461
I felt bad for her-- struggling 
to support Sean on her own.

197
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,779
You were giving her Pampers.

198
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,847
Yes, I'd slip her Pampers, 
baby food-- to cut her a break.

199
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,019
Thanks so much, Ned.

200
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:52,855
Not a problem.

201
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,440
I just added another shift at the tavern,

202
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,956
so it won't be long before 
I'm on my own two feet.

203
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:00,753
I wish you were working 
less at that bar, not more.

204
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,692
A woman like you in such a filthy place...

205
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:04,995
it's not right.

206
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:08,407
Well, you're a doll, but it's a real 
blessing to have more work.

207
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,189
Thanks again, Ned.

208
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,496
Oh, Ned...

209
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,969
Oh, Ned, I'm sorry.

210
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:18,652
I'm just not the kind of gal who 
casually necks with a man.

211
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,519
Rebecca, I didn't mean it like that.

212
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,055
I would like to kiss you,

213
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,812
because what I have to say 
is anything but casual.

214
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,601
But you barely know me.

215
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,634
My folks dated one 
evening at a county fair

216
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,333
to know that they would spend 
the next 51 years together.

217
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,235
Oh, Ned.

218
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:35,721
You need a man in the house.

219
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:37,726
A father figure to Sean.

220
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:41,082
There's already a man in my life.

221
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,951
What?

222
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,159
Who?

223
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,574
And where is he?

224
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:50,002
He's from before -- back in Virginia.

225
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,718
Well, how could he allow 
you to be here alone?

226
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,999
It's just all mixed up.

227
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,775
It's upside-down.

228
00:10:56,153 --> 00:10:57,992
I'm sorry, Ned.

229
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:02,508
This just isn't proper airing 
these personal matters.

230
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,077
I guess I would have figured 
it all out soon enough, huh?

231
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:08,696
Yeah, Sean's three today.

232
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:12,116
I guess he won't be needing 
boxes and boxes and boxes

233
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,905
of Pampers too much longer!

234
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,872
So you felt rejected.

235
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:24,803
No, no, no. I felt horrible 
for blowing up like that.

236
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:30,431
And that night, when I goofed 
again, I left... for good.

237
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,269
Where were you the rest of the night?

238
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,742
I lived in an apartment building at the time.

239
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:38,208
Whether anyone saw me, 
can vouch for me, I wouldn't know.

240
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,531
Okay, Ned.

241
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,618
We'll look into it.

242
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:45,328
I just wanted to find a gal like 
my mother... from a better time.

243
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,599
Rebecca was that girl.

244
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,275
Ned's story checks out.

245
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,913
An old coot at the Tree Lane Apartment

246
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:58,800
knew all about his pining for Rebecca.

247
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,301
What, he see him the night of the murder?

248
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,413
Coot says Ned was on his 
balcony for hours that night

249
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,641
letting balloons go one by one.

250
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,740
Time to shift focus to this man in her life.

251
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,606
Well, maybe the man in 
her life was Sean's dad.

252
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:09,791
Maybe that was Bobby.

253
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,310
Got something?

254
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,641
Autotracked Rebecca Morgan

255
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:14,637
looking for that connection back in Virginia.

256
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,173
Rebecca Morgan...

257
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,348
died in 1982.

258
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:24,071
Four years before Sean was even born.

259
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,527
Rebecca Morgan was a 
19-year-old freshman at Virginia.

260
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:33,894
Died in a car crash in 1982.

261
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,950
So who was Sean's mom
and why she using an alias?

262
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,829
Woman goes into hiding, 
she's usually running from abuse.

263
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,591
Abuser could be the man in her life.

264
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,067
She told Ned she was in 
a mixed-up relationship.

265
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,500
"Upside down."

266
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,046
Someone who wasn't around.

267
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:48,678
Maybe why he wasn't around.

268
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,995
Brings us back to, 
she was probably on the run.

269
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,228
So let's figure out who "she" is.

270
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,907
Start with the ME's office, Scotty.

271
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,631
They should have her 
fingerprints to run through AFIS.

272
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:00,210
You get her name, buzz me.

273
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,181
I'm going to go see Sean.

274
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,610
So how's Elisa?

275
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,871
Good. She liked meeting you.

276
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,077
Coming to first Thursdays.

277
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,400
She someone serious?

278
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:17,774
We were engaged.

279
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,713
Yeah.

280
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,785
Before everything happened.

281
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,008
Well, maybe you'll get it back.

282
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm hoping.

283
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,826
I'm not supposed to have girls up here.

284
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,226
It's my foster parent's rules.

285
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:45,762
Sean, the red and yellow balloons, 
they meant something.

286
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:47,849
That's supposed to make me feel better?

287
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:51,103
Tell me more about the train, and Bobby.

288
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,866
I'm not even sure the train was real.

289
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,574
Maybe a toy train?

290
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:58,084
No, it was a sketch, 
a drawing or something.

291
00:13:58,084 --> 00:14:01,087
That's it, that's all I got.

292
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,549
Sean, I think your mom 
was running from someone.

293
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,862
Yeah? Like who?

294
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,616
I'm not sure.

295
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:10,240
In fact, I'm not sure who your mom was.

296
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,612
Rebecca Morgan.

297
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:16,126
No, that's the name she was going 
by, but she was someone else.

298
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,026
Soap opera city.

299
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,951
She was trying to get 
away from something.

300
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,908
Let me tell you the 411, okay?

301
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:24,478
Solve my mom's case or don't.

302
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:27,759
'Cause I could give a flying 
middle finger, okay?

303
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,243
So why have Lindsey contact me?

304
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:31,871
'Cause I was bored.

305
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,539
And now I'm bored again.

306
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,610
You're not doing it for me anymore.

307
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:37,304
You're too pushy.

308
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:40,394
So how about the hearing you got 
coming up-- that bore you, too?

309
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:42,118
You're 17.

310
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,945
The judge dosen't have to 
treat you like a kid, you know?

311
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:47,750
The judge can show up with 
no drawers under his robe.

312
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,894
He can also kiss my ass.

313
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:52,428
That's a smart attitude.

314
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:56,134
Rush.

315
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,746
Yeah. Okay.

316
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,084
Bye.

317
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,518
Wanna know your mom's real name?

318
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,043
No thanks.

319
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,483
When did my daughter die?

320
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:24,983
1989.

321
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,041
I'm sorry to hear that.

322
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,364
Care for a drink?

323
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,144
No, no, thank you.

324
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,800
I'll be truthful.

325
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:39,886
Having Linda was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

326
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,693
She was a bad kid?

327
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:45,055
Not so bad. I just never took to her.

328
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:47,678
No matter how you slice it,

329
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,376
for 18 years you lose your life.

330
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,236
I know I wasn't maternal.

331
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:57,546
Everyone kept saying, "when 
she pops out, you'll feel different."

332
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,947
Well, guess what?

333
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:03,555
Miss Frandsen, do you remember 
the last time  you saw Linda?

334
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,371
Guess the spring of '87?

335
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:07,650
What was the occasion?

336
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,263
Vic.

337
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,763
Her ex-husband.

338
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,770
We weren't aware she had a husband.

339
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,818
Well, they didn't walk down the aisle,

340
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,023
but for all intents and purpose...

341
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,726
And so Linda showed up here?

342
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:22,354
Unannounced.

343
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:25,385
It'd been three years 
since I last saw her.

344
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,343
I wasn't even aware 
she'd gotten pregnant.

345
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,239
His name's Sean.

346
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,842
Finally got your wish, huh?

347
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:35,786
Yeah, and he's been so healthy.

348
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,953
Happy to hear it.

349
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,241
Why are you here?

350
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,765
Vic's a freak.

351
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,147
It's one thing if he wants to punch 
on me, but I won't let him hurt Sean.

352
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:44,033
Here we go.

353
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,859
Here we go what?

354
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:47,320
If he's as bad as you claim he is,

355
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,995
go to the police,
get a restraining order.

356
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:52,490
All that'll do is help make for
a tearjerker on the 10:00 news.

357
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,354
Sure that's not the drama 
queen coming out?

358
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:57,042
Don't you dare do that, Mama.

359
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:00,615
So what?

360
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:03,823
You don't wanna go to the police,
what am I supposed to do?

361
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,104
Let us stay here with you.

362
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:11,131
One night, then we'll leave 
and I'll be out of your hair forever.

363
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,745
Linda and Sean were on the road early.

364
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:20,853
What about Vic?

365
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:21,781
He ever come around?

366
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,735
No. Didn't call either.

367
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,103
I'm sure he didn't expect me 
to know where she was.

368
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,919
You never heard from Linda again?

369
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,149
Nope.

370
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:36,297
I always figured they were 
still out there somewhere.

371
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:41,473
Hey, Rocky... relax.

372
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,308
How was she murdered?

373
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:46,402
We'll get to that.

374
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,606
Linda's mom says she 
was on the run from you.

375
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:51,184
Well, that's wrong. I never met her mom.

376
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:53,310
Not that I didn't want to.

377
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,832
Linda wouldn't let that happen?

378
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:56,159
She had a lot of rules.

379
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,630
She has one against marriage?

380
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,521
She said a piece of paper's 
what ruined things.

381
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:01,638
I disagreed.

382
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:05,285
So LInda keeps pulling that kind of 
nonsense, why keep her around?

383
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,982
'Cause my life was different with her.

384
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:10,577
Ton of smiles.

385
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:15,992
Vic, you front like this big, gentle giant,
but you know what... I don't buy it.

386
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,133
'Cause we've been here five minutes

387
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,648
and not once have you 
asked about your son.

388
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:20,833
My son?

389
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,347
Sean.

390
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:25,024
Is that Linda's son?

391
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:27,198
'Cause it wasn't my son.

392
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:30,598
Linda's only dream was to have a baby.

393
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,053
I couldn't give her one.

394
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,046
Shooting blanks.

395
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,931
Thanks for that.

396
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,679
I failed her in the biggest way.

397
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,909
What? Horse, why you smiling?

398
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,969
'Cause we're going to get a pony.

399
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,558
Vic, what?

400
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,461
I went to the adoption agency 
today, got us an appointment.

401
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:55,925
Oh, no.

402
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:57,602
I thought that'd make you happy.

403
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,086
They're not going to 
approve our application.

404
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,723
You don't know. Might get lucky.

405
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:05,492
We're not going to get lucky.
You've been out of work too long.

406
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:06,967
That'll change.

407
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,195
'Cause it is time to 
play less and work more.

408
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,628
Hey, we'll slow down.

409
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,017
Better yet, we'll get married.

410
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,372
Huh?

411
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,179
Yeah, it'll increase our chances.

412
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,433
Baby, what's wrong?

413
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:36,071
I'm pregnant.

414
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,698
I didn't think I could make that happen.

415
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,660
It's not yours, Horse.

416
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:48,964
Horse, I'm sorry.

417
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,649
I'm so sorry, Horse.

418
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,750
I'm sorry.

419
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:01,736
Tried talking to her, 
I thought we could work it out.

420
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:05,189
I come home one night from 
job hunting, she was gone.

421
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:06,277
And when was this?

422
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:08,588
It was April in '85.

423
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,026
You know who the father was?

424
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,537
Found a name written down once.

425
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,471
Had a hunch he was the guy.

426
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,582
Any chance the name was Bobby?

427
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,118
No. Silver.

428
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,486
Kyle... Silver.

429
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,477
Not a period of my life I was so proud of.

430
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,615
No?

431
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,228
I'm married 30 years.

432
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:33,935
Linda was my one transgression.

433
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:36,033
My wife almost divorced me.

434
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,275
Pregnancy didn't go over 
real big at home, huh?

435
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,253
That part was never a problem.

436
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:42,386
Linda had a miscarriage.

437
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,638
Miscarriage?

438
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,542
Caught the biggest break of my life.

439
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:48,073
I mean, an affair is one thing, but...

440
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:52,282
a second family-- that only plays in Utah.

441
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,683
That was it then?

442
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,233
As far as you know, Linda 
moved on to someone else?

443
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:59,489
I wouldn't say she went quietly.

444
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,889
Nor was it easy for me to say good-bye.

445
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,259
Why not?

446
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:08,434
Because this girl was 
so sexy that it was sily.

447
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,332
Kyle.

448
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:16,592
What are you doing here?

449
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,437
Let me put my tongue in your mouth.

450
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:21,386
Are you out of your mind?
I asked you not to come here.

451
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:22,870
Everybody's looking at us.

452
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,886
"Who's the piece with Silver? 
Is he doing her?"

453
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,846
You love it. / Stop it.

454
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:30,392
I'm telling you, this is not the right way.

455
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,756
That's too bad.

456
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:34,128
- 'Cause I'm not giving up.
- What are you doing? Linda.

457
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,385
Linda...

458
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,797
You know this is how you want it.

459
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,181
Linda...

460
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,382
Don't you?

461
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,651
Don't you? / Linda.

462
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:46,022
Yes. Yes. Yes.

463
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,391
I'm not giving up, baby.

464
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:55,711
I can't do it this way. / Come on.

465
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,312
I'm sorry.

466
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,167
For the last time.

467
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,120
This is all wrong.

468
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:14,308
I walked back to my office 
and never saw her again.

469
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:18,713
And sexually speaking, 
this is how Linda was?

470
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,550
Overt like that?

471
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,621
Well, I guess that makes 
two secrets I've kept.

472
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,615
I mean, if my wife knew the particulars,
she never would have forgiven me.

473
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:34,331
Hospital records confirm, Linda 
had a miscarriage September '85.

474
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,442
Sean was born October '86.

475
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,226
She had to have gotten pregnant fast.

476
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,792
Well, after hearing Silver's account of Linda

477
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,567
that would have taken her all of an hour.

478
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,096
Question is, do you believe 
Silver's version of Linda

479
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:47,007
or ex-husband Vic's?

480
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:47,955
Or Neds?

481
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,719
Mm. Three different girls.

482
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,970
Or three girls in one.

483
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,329
There she is--

484
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:55,856
best and brightest physician 
in all of Philadelphia.

485
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:57,404
Shut up, Vailens.

486
00:22:57,404 --> 00:23:00,124
It's Valens. V-a-l-e-n-s.

487
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,189
Hey, Frannie. Thanks for coming so late.

488
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,109
What else am I doing at 10:00 at night?

489
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,826
Our victim had a miscarriage shortly 
before getting pregnant a second time.

490
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:09,339
Yeah, we're determining a timeline

491
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,046
for when the actual roo-roo took place.

492
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,431
This is Rebecca Morgan, 
now Linda Frandsen case?

493
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,587
No. According to the autopsy,

494
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:20,034
there's no indication of striation
in the bone structure of her pelvis.

495
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,470
Come again?

496
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,802
Your victim never gave birth at all.

497
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,305
Linda's autopsy shows 
she never dilievered a baby.

498
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,632
Sean wasn't hers.

499
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:34,480
She was in no position to adopt.

500
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,904
We contact the Center For 
Missing and Abused Children?

501
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,673
Ran a search on abducted children

502
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:41,212
in the Virginia, mid-Atlantic states, 
'85 to '89.

503
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,316
Two possible matches :

504
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:45,950
John Barrett of Aberdeen, Maryland, 
Robert Gordon, Richmon, Virginia.

505
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,684
Robert?

506
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,793
Bobby.

507
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:51,609
Gordons could be Sean's real parents.

508
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,264
Don't float that till you're sure, Scotty.

509
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:55,701
I'll contact Virginia. They'll 
have the Gordon's DNA on file.

510
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:59,066
I'll call over and get Sean to get a DNA 
swab, say it's part of the investigation.

511
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,336
As soon as you get a match, heads out.

512
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,765
You say Bobby's been 
in several foster homes?

513
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,821
Moved a lot.

514
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,079
He's had it rough.

515
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,989
Been arrested?

516
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,858
Jeff, don't assume that.

517
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,937
A bunch of foster homes -- come on.

518
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:16,149
Am I right?

519
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,060
Several times.

520
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,949
For what?

521
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:21,912
Assaults, theft.

522
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:24,776
But so far, the juvenile 
courts have bailed him out.

523
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,570
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon,

524
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,594
ever known someone 
named Linda Frandsen?

525
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,165
She the one who took our boy?

526
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:34,543
Frandsen? Wasn't that what's 
his name ex-wife, the landscaper?

527
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:35,762
Hector?

528
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:37,151
Victor.

529
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:38,213
Lake?

530
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,594
Yeah.

531
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:43,767
Linda came by with him once.

532
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:54,312
What a sweetie!

533
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,834
How old is he?

534
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,624
Ten months.

535
00:24:58,902 --> 00:24:59,912
What's his name?

536
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:01,046
Bobby.

537
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,559
Bobby!

538
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,647
You're just a little miracle, 
aren't you, Bobby?

539
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:09,300
That's what I tell myself as I'm 
combing the Cheerios out of my hair.

540
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:12,236
Can I tell you a secret? / Sure.

541
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,617
I'm expecting.

542
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:15,537
That's wonderful.

543
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:17,815
I think it's a boy.

544
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,575
She seemed lovely.

545
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,800
They came off decent enough.

546
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,543
Yeah, we know Vic.

547
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:31,822
When can we see Bobby?

548
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:34,624
He goes by "Sean" now.

549
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,389
And he doesn't know about you yet,

550
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:40,480
but Child Services will be 
in touch to facilitate things.

551
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:46,667
Will you tell him that we miss 
him and we want to see him.

552
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:50,425
Why?

553
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,397
Why what?

554
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:55,537
You came here because you 
want to solve her murder?

555
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:59,101
Why? To hell with her.

556
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:13,752
How'd it go?

557
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:15,219
He's getting another chance.

558
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:19,614
But if he so much as jaywalks during 
probation, Judge Haze will look him up.

559
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:23,982
So, you want to do girl's night soon?

560
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:25,186
Yeah.

561
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:29,639
Of course, if you'd rather go 
fly a kite, I'd understand.

562
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:33,587
Who you been talking to?

563
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:43,899
Oh, man, my shadow again.

564
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,764
You caught a break today, huh?

565
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:46,962
I don't know.

566
00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:48,357
You did, Sean.

567
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,575
Don't screw it up.

568
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,931
Thank you for your advice.

569
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:59,056
Her name was Linda Fransen.

570
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:02,445
I told you I could give a heave-ho.

571
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:05,084
She kidnapped you when you were two.

572
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:08,571
Man, you keep trying to shock 
me and you keep missing.

573
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:11,294
I'm just giving you the straight story.

574
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:14,276
Here's the rest :

575
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,781
we found your parents.

576
00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:19,315
What?

577
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,202
Yeah.

578
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:23,458
Mom and Dad?

579
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:26,145
I got a bunch of brothers and sisters, too?

580
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,897
Two brothers.

581
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,487
You know what?

582
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:32,634
You can have 'em.

583
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:35,295
They don't want me, they want you.

584
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:37,299
You talk to 'em?

585
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:40,149
They want to meet you.

586
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,434
I bet.

587
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:44,310
They got to be thrilled their 
kid's a juvie delinquent.

588
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,463
Sean, you got a family waiting for you.

589
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,636
I don't want a family.

590
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:51,007
I would have settled to have 
one parent looking out for me.

591
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,340
Here you got two and you're snubbing it?

592
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,834
I didn't realize you were such a hothead.

593
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,804
Sean, you can be the kind of 
kid they want, or be a thug.

594
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,661
It's up to you.

595
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,921
Snatching babies, huh, Vic?

596
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:09,999
What?

597
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,152
Thought you'd work the 
old razzle-dazzle on us,

598
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:14,668
send us to Dr. Silver
and the trail would end there.

599
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:15,942
But it didn't.

600
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:18,281
I'm sorry. You fellows are losing me.

601
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,084
It led to your old employers, the Gordons.

602
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:24,371
Yeah, where you and Linda stole a baby.

603
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,421
Come on.

604
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,935
And afterwards, we're thinking 
Linda must have ditched you.

605
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:30,274
Yeah, that's why you looked 
her up, to wipe her out.

606
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,357
I want a lawyer.

607
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:33,016
We'll get you a judge and jury, too.

608
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,652
You do that, 'cause I didn't kill her.

609
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:37,417
Say we're in the jury box 
and we're eyeballing Vic here.

610
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,564
We know he's a kidnapper.

611
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:39,659
I didn't do that.

612
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,497
You ain't going to beat that one, Vic.

613
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,021
That'd be a one-in-a-million shot.

614
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,919
Think about how whupped
he was by this Linda,

615
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,929
so much he swiped a baby for her.

616
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,208
Did a federal crime for his lady

617
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:51,114
and she gives you the high hat?

618
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:52,647
I see motive, real clear.

619
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,270
Oh, yeah.

620
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,402
Who do you think the jury's 
going to put the murder on?

621
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,800
I did not do murder.

622
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,254
Okay. Good luck with that.

623
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:00,068
I didn't.

624
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:03,306
I only ripped off the kid.

625
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:10,831
After Linda lost that other yo-yo's 
baby, she come back to me.

626
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,788
I wanted her to stay.

627
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:17,797
I said I'd do anything.

628
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:20,066
What'd she say?

629
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:21,894
"Prove it."

630
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,265
Anyone see you?

631
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,762
I don't know.

632
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:47,151
Calm down. Calm... Look at me.

633
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:48,528
Hand him over.

634
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:50,253
Give me my boy.

635
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:53,083
Scoot over, I'll drive.

636
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,498
No, darling, you got to get back.

637
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:55,516
Finish your work.

638
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:57,400
I can't go back. I'm nervous.

639
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,207
Horse, you're such my baby, too.

640
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:03,350
You go on. You be strong for me, okay?

641
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,924
In a few hours, you'll be 
seeing us at the motel.

642
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:07,396
Go on.

643
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,070
Go on.

644
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,458
I got back to the motel that 
night, she'd cleared out.

645
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,847
Just like that?

646
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,932
She left a note.

647
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:21,831
Said she's going to Philly 
to find us new haunts.

648
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:23,442
That she'd send for me.

649
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:26,710
Meanwhile, I'm supposed to keep 
clocking in over at the Gordon's.

650
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,130
Never got the call, huh?

651
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,657
Weeks turned into years.

652
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:35,450
Who else knew she came to Philadelphia?

653
00:30:36,716 --> 00:30:39,254
A few years later, I told this guy

654
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,833
that'd come around asking 
questions about her.

655
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,797
What guy?

656
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,670
A private investigator.

657
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,148
P.I. say what he wanted with Linda?

658
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:48,155
No, I didn't push it.

659
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,711
I was pretty torqued off by then.

660
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:55,415
I told him, "Hey, she's somewhere in Philly."

661
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,561
Vic copped to the kidnapping,
not the murder.

662
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:00,641
You believe him?

663
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,247
Linda humiliate him pretty good.

664
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,675
Made a fool of Ned, too.

665
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:05,632
Seems like that was kind of the 
way she walked through life.

666
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,509
Got a trail of guys behind her she duped.

667
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,867
Eventually, one of 'em didn't sit still for it.

668
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:13,016
The P.I. who approached Vic was a 
weasel by the name of Isiah Bagley.

669
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,118
Did he say who worked for?

670
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:17,282
You'r gonna love this. Dr. Kyle Silver.

671
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:19,211
Homicide.

672
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,322
Why's a doctor hire a P.I.?

673
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:23,041
Thought he was glad she split.

674
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,969
Bagley said he wanted 
her found at any cost.

675
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:26,453
Okay, thanks.

676
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:29,601
That was your friend Lindsey.

677
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,036
Sean just got picked up for stealing a car.

678
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:55,245
My lawyer says I could get two years.

679
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,208
I heard.

680
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:00,055
So I'm supposed to sit 
in this joint for two years?

681
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:02,397
You stole a car and you were drunk.

682
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:03,110
Three beers.

683
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,580
Drunk driving can lead to homicide

684
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,225
and homicide leads to jail 
for the rest of your life.

685
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,697
So I get it.

686
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:11,459
You're as full of it as 
everyone else. / Sean...

687
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,296
what is it that you want?

688
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,794
Right now, to get up out of here.

689
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,211
Say you're out...

690
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,819
the foster homes, too.

691
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,464
Then what?

692
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,559
I'm on the run and I'm not looking back.

693
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,486
You taking anyone with you?

694
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:30,980
A girl?

695
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,369
Nah.

696
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,468
I'm going to meet my woman.

697
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,756
Someone who doesn't know you.

698
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,123
Make a fresh start.

699
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,538
Yeah.

700
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:44,116
And me and her gonna
settle down, kick back

701
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,621
and make a lot of love.

702
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:49,473
Be careful.

703
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:51,953
Nah, no jimmies for me.

704
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,381
I want kids.

705
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,671
I'm gonna have 13 of them.

706
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,816
What are you gonna do for work?

707
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:00,352
Whatever. I don't know.

708
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:03,209
13 mouths do feed and you don't know?

709
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:06,080
So not 13.

710
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,060
Maybe just one.

711
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,897
Make it a girl.

712
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,478
So what happens when your little girl

713
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:16,860
comes home with a purple foot?

714
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,260
Why would she get a purple foot?

715
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,996
Because it's winter time 
and you got no job,

716
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:22,568
your wife has new guy

717
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,108
and  your daughter's 
got holes in her shoses.

718
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:25,548
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, answer me,

719
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:27,915
what are you gonna do?

720
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:29,985
What are you gonna do?

721
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:32,305
So you're saying I got no right 
to want anything in this life?

722
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:35,581
No, no, no, you can have it all.

723
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,498
But you're gonna need help.

724
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,186
How would you know what I need?

725
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:42,716
Because I wanted everything, too.

726
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:50,001
But I was too damned proud to 
ask for help for way too long.

727
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,325
Good luck, okay.

728
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:03,533
I did wanna meet my family.

729
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:15,980
Silver ever call back?

730
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,483
He's here.

731
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,548
Let's do it.

732
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,063
Detective.

733
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:26,987
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon...

734
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:28,530
what are you doing here?

735
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,159
We were told Bobby stole a car.

736
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,802
Jeff, use his other name. Use Sean.

737
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,467
How serious is this?

738
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,466
Serious.

739
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:39,216
He violated his probation, 
so he's in custody.

740
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,211
Tomorrow morning he 
goes before a judge.

741
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,881
Oh, God.

742
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,402
Maybe we go back to the hotel,

743
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:46,088
take the boys home.

744
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:49,999
It might not be the best way 
for the boys to meet Sean.

745
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,012
I see.

746
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:53,958
We'll just wait till this 
whole thing blows over.

747
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,342
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, 
this isn't blowing over.

748
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:01,611
Sean will probably go to jail
for the next two years.

749
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,205
What if we showed up at the hearing,
would the judge show leniency?

750
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,079
You can't count on that.

751
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:11,872
For what it's worth, I know it'd be 
good for Sean to see you tomorrow.

752
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,735
Excuse us.

753
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,311
Doctor...

754
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,801
you said your wife almost divorced you,

755
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:35,582
but the D.C. Superior Court says 
you initiated proceedings.

756
00:35:35,582 --> 00:35:37,496
I was the one who filed. Big deal

757
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:40,678
It's not that you filed, Doc,
it's when you filed.

758
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:43,325
September '89, a month 
before Linda was murdered.

759
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,128
Please.

760
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,705
And we know how bad you wanted Linda.

761
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:46,779
I admitted that.

762
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,721
Here's what I think, Doc.

763
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,100
You already had the wife 
and kids, the experience,

764
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,375
so this time you wanted a little hottie

765
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,521
to go off with, have a romp all over Europe.

766
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,566
Yeah, Linda was your girl...

767
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,040
so sexy it was silly.

768
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,682
But when you tracked her down,
you find a baby, too.

769
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:03,307
Bummer.

770
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,638
And now she don't want you 
anymore, she only wants the kid.

771
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:08,362
So you damn near take her head off.

772
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,273
Tough to look at, huh?

773
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:13,614
Yeah.

774
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:15,188
'Cause she was a decent girl.

775
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:18,211
Silver, we know you hired P.I. to find Linda.

776
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:22,509
You had Isiah Bagley on the case 
for six months, so don't tell us

777
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:25,885
you never went to see her again.

778
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,509
Okay, I visited Linda.

779
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:33,598
On October 11, 1989, that night?

780
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,247
It was somewhat like you said.

781
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,713
I went there to take Linda away, 
but she didn't want to go.

782
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:46,570
But I took it in stride.

783
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,097
You just left.

784
00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:52,925
I hopped a train to Washington, D.C.

785
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,976
You were travelling by train.

786
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,797
Not a car? Can you prove that?

787
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:03,091
I purchased a round-trip ticket 
from Whshington, D.C.

788
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,255
Look it up.

789
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,352
We will.

790
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:07,463
Here's another bummer, Doc.

791
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:11,307
Linda's son can put you in her 
house at the time of the murder.

792
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:13,281
He remembers you taking that train.

793
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,181
A three-year-old remembers 
me taking a train.

794
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,288
That's not even worth my calling a lawyer.

795
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:20,290
It's enough for us to call a judge 
to make you submmit DNA.

796
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,900
And the hair samples and prints we 
got, that's put-you-away evidence.

797
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:32,224
That little boy spent nine hours 
sitting in his mom's blood.

798
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,460
I wanted what I wanted.

799
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:46,586
She should've just come away with me.

800
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:54,092
Kyle.

801
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:56,904
You gonna invite me in?

802
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:58,524
Four years.

803
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:01,180
You look so different, Rebecca.

804
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,452
How did you...?

805
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,896
Rebecca.

806
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:05,784
I like that, Linda.

807
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,713
Sexy.

808
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:09,505
How did you find me?

809
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:13,348
It wasn't easy and it wasn't cheap,
but the important thing is, I'm here.

810
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:15,469
What do you want?

811
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,499
What do you think I want?

812
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,959
You.

813
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,350
You had your chance.

814
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,378
But I told you then it was wrong.
My kids were still in school.

815
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:28,628
And I told you, I wasn't giving up.

816
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:31,194
Now I have what I wanted.

817
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:35,476
Yes, and that we need to talk about.

818
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:38,100
What a good-looking boy.

819
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,472
Funny, he doesn't resemble you.

820
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:43,532
Why don't you just go back to D.C., Kyle?

821
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:45,715
I know what you've done.

822
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,996
I know every move you've 
made for the last six months.

823
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,257
Walk out of here.

824
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,966
Relax. I'm gonna help you.

825
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:54,083
Sean's the man in my life now.
I don't need anyone else.

826
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,154
Linda, if you look at it, 
you have two choices :

827
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:58,183
You can come with me 
or you can go to prison.

828
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:00,654
Come with you? Are you high?

829
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:02,062
I know how to get Bobby back home.

830
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:03,688
Don't call him that.

831
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:05,873
Nobody's gonna know where 
he's been, right, Bobby?

832
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:08,203
Don't touch him!

833
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:13,042
You always did like it dirty.

834
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,349
Let me put my tongue in your mouth.

835
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:19,572
Don't talk to me like that. / Why?

836
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,500
You know you love it.

837
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,954
You've got to be kidding.

838
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:29,720
What are you smiling at?

839
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,327
You.

840
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,902
You were the worst I ever had.

841
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,723
Sorry, Bobby. I gotta catch a train.

842
