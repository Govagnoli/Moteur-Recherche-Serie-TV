00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,908
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,992
August 28, 1965

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,279
Are you ready?

4
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,337
Here it goes, here it goes!

5
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:18,415
Vivian, run!

6
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:19,706
I'm gonna get you,

7
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:22,728
I'm gonna get you!

8
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:25,839
Oh, here she comes!

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,960
Go higher, go higher

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,967
Coming in for a landing!

11
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:38,892
It's a perfect day

12
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,685
But now we should think about
heading back

13
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:42,910
But I don't wanna go home

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,482
It's getting late, Vivian

15
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:48,062
Why can't we just stay here
forever?

16
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:51,603
OK, close your eyes

17
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,408
Come on

18
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:59,081
OK, listen really really hard

19
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,876
Do you hear the ocean?

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,046
Now look
but don't open your eyes

21
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:07,431
Can you see it?

22
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,504
It'll always be here for you

23
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,430
No one can ever take it away

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,397
'Cause it'll always be
right in here

25
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:21,111
Forever
Our perfect day

26
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:22,434
Forever?

27
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,800
And ever

28
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,109
Some bum out fishin'
this morning got a bite

29
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,517
Floater in the water?

30
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:55,432
A hand from the river bottom

31
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,960
That's the way to jump start the AM

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,090
It was a kid's

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,167
Female, probably white,
3 to 5 years old

34
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,193
Been under for maybe decades

35
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,330
Cause of death?

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,073
Too early to tell but she's got crushed
vertebrae in the neck area,

37
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:11,817
shattered skull,
and check this out

38
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:16,150
Two breaks, radius and ulna
Forearm bones

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,323
Overkill?

40
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,385
These are old wounds,
healed over

41
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:21,284
Someone abusin' her?

42
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:24,626
Takes some kind of rage
breakin' a kid's arm in two places

43
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,575
Some kind of monster

44
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,814
I'd like to meet whoever's
responsible face to face

45
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:32,206
Hearin' you loud and clear, boss

46
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:35,017
Doer better still be out there

47
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,948
Kind of job you hate the most to catch,

48
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:40,970
but worth the most to close

49
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:18,105
Miller

50
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:20,283
Oh, crap

51
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:22,964
I'm tryin' to quit

52
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:25,148
Yeah?
How's that going for you?

53
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:28,940
I do it twenty times a day,
I figure one time's gotta stick

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,043
I want you to know I appreciate
your contibution on the last job

55
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,518
Glad to be of service

56
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:35,288
Good group of folks you got
over there

57
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,965
Ever consider joinin'?

58
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,167
Homicide?

59
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,835
You makin' me an offer?

60
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,963
You got reservations?

61
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,510
Because of Fishtown?

62
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,042
You heard about that, huh?

63
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,251
Fellow cop gets shot,
word gets out

64
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,815
Well, anyway, uh,
I made my peace with that,

65
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:01,641
it's just some scheduled stuff
I gotta look at

66
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,130
Anything I need to know about?

67
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,297
Nothin' I can't handle

68
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,023
So you'll get back to me

69
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:10,310
Definitely

70
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:14,515
Thanks Lieutenant

71
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,863
According to the lab,
baby Jane Doe's

72
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:21,447
been at the bottom of this river
for forty-some years

73
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,617
Puttin' her murder some time
in the 60's

74
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,193
But from '60 to '69

75
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,277
we got no missing persons report
of a 3 to 5 year old white female

76
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:31,086
What kind of family
doesn't report their kid missing?

77
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,842
The kind of family that kills their kid?

78
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:36,829
Maybe we check DHS's
child abuse unit records

79
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,922
Kid's doctor might've reported
that broken arm

80
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:41,133
There was no Child Abuse Unit
back then

81
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:44,239
Docs weren't trained
to recognize abuse, no one was

82
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,098
Like this would've
fallen through the cracks easy

83
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:47,981
And we got another boy in the box

84
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,776
No one ever came forward
to claim him

85
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:53,642
Back then they didn't have
facial reconstuction technology

86
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:54,966
We do

87
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,483
So we create a picture of what the victim
could have looked like off the skull

88
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,070
Put this picture in circulation,
maybe an old neighbor

89
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,441
or family member recognizes
baby Jane Doe

90
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:08,263
Needle in a haystack but I might've
tracked your victim's fractures

91
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:11,258
Two breaks on the forearm,
real unique injury, right?

92
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:15,309
Same kind of breaks were treated at St
Boniface's emergency room circa 1965

93
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,686
Did it say who the victim was?

94
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:20,110
Vivian Smith, age 4, white female

95
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,165
Doc who treated her,
still alive and kickin'

96
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,249
Yes, that's my signature

97
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:30,295
I was in my first year of
residency in '65

98
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,268
Do you remember
that patient Dr Greys?

99
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,418
Vivian Smith, 4 years old, white female

100
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,182
Multiple fractures to the radius, ulna

101
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:42,192
Yes I remember her

102
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:45,862
First time I realized how little I could
do for children like that

103
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,319
What d'you mean?

104
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,750
I patch 'em up,
send them home untill the next time

105
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,906
We think she was killed
shortly after you treated her

106
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:56,076
Any idea who might've
been responsible?

107
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,856
Mom
She brought her in

108
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:00,859
A local waitress from
what I can remember

109
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,633
Is there a father in the picture?

110
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,516
According to this,

111
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:08,682
Mom kept insisting
she dropped her kid

112
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,571
It just happened so fast,
I was holding her

113
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,013
and then next thing you know,
I dropped her

114
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,638
Dropped her, huh?
How'd that happen?

115
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,410
You dropping her?

116
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,318
Silly me, I think I need glasses

117
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,813
See my eyes they don't  work so hot
and I just keep dropping things

118
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,783
Your daughter has spiral fractures

119
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:31,940
It's caused when you take
a child's arm and snap it

120
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,099
Take her away

121
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,459
Excuse me?

122
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,493
She's better off without me

123
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,886
What about your mother's?
Or a relative's?

124
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,467
I don't have anyone

125
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:49,990
Please, just take her away
before it's too late

126
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,901
I can't just take your kid

127
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,839
You wanna get those eyes looked at

128
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,896
Sign for your daughter here

129
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,498
So Mom was trying to
save the kid from herself?

130
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:08,838
There was nothing I could do

131
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:12,113
Child abuse wasn't even
a concept in '65

132
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:14,636
Anyway Mom gave us a false name

133
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:16,226
How did you know that?

134
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,463
Hospital bill came back a week later

135
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,121
No known recipient
No known address

136
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,679
You said she was a local girl?
A waitress?

137
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,257
Car-hop kind of uniform?

138
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:26,956
That's what it looked like

139
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,113
The only car-hop in Philly
is Milt's Burger Joint

140
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:30,490
Thurman Street

141
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,149
Best cheese fries in town

142
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:42,483
Place was a car-hop back in '65

143
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,389
You worked here as
a waitress, Madi?

144
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,118
Scrimped and saved my tips for years
'til I could call this armpit my home

145
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:53,712
You remeber another waitress?
Had a daughter 4 years old

146
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:57,256
Kid might've had a cast
on her arm

147
00:07:57,256 --> 00:08:01,563
Sure
Cindysomething

148
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:03,499
I don't recall her last name

149
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,501
Well maybe we'll have a talk
with the former owner

150
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,128
Good luck

151
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:13,429
Cheap pervert took a nose dive
into his cheese fries 10 years back

152
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:17,274
What do you remember
about this Cindy?

153
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:19,479
Restless skittish kind of gal

154
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,699
The type who had it all

155
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,372
Great husband, great kid

156
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,743
Wanted nothing to do with 'em

157
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:26,619
She was married?

158
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,188
Met her husband once

159
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:32,031
Heart of gold type, but her,

160
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:36,176
something was rotten
up in the old spaghetti factory

161
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:58,684
You get used to it honey

162
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:02,299
How much money does it take to

163
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,662
- run away?
- Run away?

164
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:06,373
What would you want to
run away for, honey?

165
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,824
Don't you have a family?

166
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:11,025
I'm a bad mother

167
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,201
Oh, you don't mean that now

168
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,954
Sometimes I think my only way out is
when one of them dies

169
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,960
Sweetheart?

170
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,928
What are you doing here, Roger?

171
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,717
Why aren't you at work?

172
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:30,283
- I went to see my girls
- Mommy, mommy!

173
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,813
Look what daddy got me!

174
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,553
Oh, Vivian, she's beautiful

175
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:40,018
I got a white paw just like Snowflake

176
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:46,308
Stay in the car sweetie,
let Mommy and Daddy talk

177
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,944
She's gonna be OK, Cindy

178
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,572
How can you say that?

179
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,530
The most important thing
is that we work this out

180
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,880
As a family

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,118
- I can't
- You're her Mommy

182
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:04,124
Nothing's ever gonna change that

183
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:06,574
She needs you

184
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,965
I need you

185
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:21,514
Had that man wrapped
around her little finger

186
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:24,350
Sounds like she was about to bolt,

187
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,305
and he was desperate to keep her

188
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:30,459
- At any cost
- Lil, boss called

189
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:33,191
Thanks for your time, Madi

190
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:36,674
They put those facial reconstuction
photos of baby Jane Doe out

191
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,142
- That was fast
- Got a hit

192
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:41,969
Lady came in 5 minutes ago,
says she knows our girl

193
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:49,806
I was just leaving the courthouse
when I saw this

194
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:52,707
You work at the PD's office,
Miss Stanton?

195
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:54,144
Court reporter

196
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,768
Are you saying you know this girl?

197
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,981
No I mean yes, I think I do

198
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:02,556
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure

199
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:06,810
- Rumor has it you found her in the river
- Yes, we did

200
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,404
How did she die?

201
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,608
We're not sure yet

202
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:15,449
Anyway, cut to the chase

203
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,425
It's a pretty close match

204
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,262
Where'd you get this photo?

205
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:26,749
It's one of the few things
I have left from my childhood

206
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,180
How do you mean?

207
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,096
That little girl in the photo,
that girl is me

208
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,943
I was adopted when I was 4

209
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:44,720
There's very little I remember
before then

210
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,496
But I always felt a part of me
was missing

211
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:51,141
Do you remember her at all?

212
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:56,017
I remember a girl but
I thought she was my invisible friend

213
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:59,426
Something a child makes up,
I never thought she could be real

214
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:01,299
Well we'll need to take a swab

215
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,471
Test your DNA against our
baby Jane Doe

216
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:07,824
So the girl you found in the river,

217
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:12,248
- she could've been my sister
- It's possible

218
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:16,522
What about your parents?
Do you remember them?

219
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,266
Last time I saw my mother,

220
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:24,581
that's the only memory I have

221
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:39,500
Where's Vivian, Mommy?

222
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,952
Listen to me, sweetheart

223
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:47,248
Vivian, she's just someone
you made up in your mind

224
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:50,069
Like an invisible friend

225
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,811
Vivian's just make believe?

226
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,477
Don't you see?

227
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,467
It's so much better this way,

228
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,504
because she'll always be with you

229
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:01,441
Watching over you
no matter where you go

230
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:04,072
Like an angel?

231
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:10,035
Yes Like an angel

232
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:12,144
Go to sleep now, sweetheart

233
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,987
Close your eyes

234
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:21,013
You'll be in good hands here

235
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:24,404
Better off without me

236
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,616
He'll keep you safe

237
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,371
And whenever it seems
Mommy's far, far away,

238
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,084
all you have to do
is close your eyes

239
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:36,186
And I'll be here with you

240
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,945
Forever?

241
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:48,377
And ever

242
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:53,748
Bye-bye, baby

243
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:59,194
I never saw her again

244
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,347
DHS found me a home

245
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,524
Good loving people raised me,
I was lucky

246
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:06,242
That medallion your mother gave you,

247
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:09,520
- do you still have it?
- I do, yeah

248
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,242
She mentioned a man
watching over you,

249
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:18,648
he'll keep you safe, she said

250
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:22,938
St Michael, maybe
that's what she meant

251
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:26,792
BN 3546

252
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,946
I always wondered
what that meant

253
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:31,724
St Michael's the patron saint of cops

254
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:35,883
BN could mean badge number

255
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,460
I'll let you know
if there's something to it more

256
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,189
Thanks for your time

257
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,310
I've had a good life

258
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,234
But still I'd like to know

259
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:52,606
Why she left

260
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,495
Art Balduchi?

261
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:06,052
No need to shine them badges

262
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,000
Cheery mugs give you boys away

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,042
Takes a cop to know a cop

264
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,106
Badge number 3546

265
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:14,926
Hung up the uniform 20 years ago

266
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,028
Good riddance

267
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,723
Ever run accross this girl
on the job?

268
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,351
Looks familiar, who is she?

269
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,746
The kid who had this

270
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,618
My St Michaels,
where'd you find it?

271
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:31,939
Same little girl all grown up now

272
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:33,947
Is that a fact?

273
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:36,655
Yeah, now I remember her

274
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:40,296
And her sister
Twins

275
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:44,126
- You close with the family?
- No Met 'em once, that's it

276
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,013
So why'd you give
her your medallion?

277
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:51,444
I was a rookie, see,
we got a call to this house

278
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:55,293
Neighbors are complaining
because of the noise

279
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:59,032
Police!
Open up!

280
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,534
Police
Open up

281
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:11,532
Can I help you officers?

282
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:13,402
We got a noise complaint

283
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,839
Everything OK here?

284
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,504
We're sittin' down to a meal

285
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:19,117
Ain't that right, sweetheart?

286
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:24,203
It's Hawaiian casserole night
Good, right girls?

287
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,913
Don't wanna disturb your evening
now, folks Have a good night

288
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,454
Is everything OK here, ma'am?

289
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,104
I'm just fine, thank you

290
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,185
What'd you do to her?

291
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,846
Shut up, kid
Let's go

292
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,863
He beat her
On her face

293
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,870
No, I just, I fell

294
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,197
It's my eyes, they don't work very well,
I think I need glasses

295
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,246
Let's take a walk around the block

296
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:55,005
- Cool your engines
- Yeah, sure

297
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:01,347
Get yourself cleaned up, lady

298
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:08,994
Daddy's gonna come back
and make Mommy cry again

299
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,304
Do you know who this is?

300
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:15,596
It's St Michael
He's the patron saint of Mommy's

301
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,198
He keeps an eye on 'em,

302
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,423
and never let's 'em come to harm

303
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:22,454
- Really?
- Sure Go on

304
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:25,027
Put it on your mommy

305
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:29,822
- What'd you say, Maura?
- Thank you

306
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,057
It's time for your bath, girls

307
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:47,362
I should give this back to you

308
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,799
Oh, no, no, keep it

309
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,192
Your girls will notice if it's gone

310
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:53,426
That's very kind of you

311
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:55,371
- Thank you
- Sure

312
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,007
Oh, I'm Cindy Mulvaney

313
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,226
Pleased to meet you

314
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,703
I think you see just fine, ma'am

315
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:03,864
Pardon me?

316
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:06,525
Situations like this,

317
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:09,224
they always end up bad

318
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:12,131
You need to take your girls
and leave

319
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:16,112
- Tonight
- And go where?

320
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:18,075
My parents are dead,

321
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:22,241
I'm an only child
and I haven't had a friend in years

322
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:25,304
so please tell me,
where should I go?

323
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,010
If you need a place to go,

324
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,033
you call this number

325
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:38,658
So it was her husband
abusin' the girls, not her?

326
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,466
She was covering it up

327
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,199
They always do

328
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,102
So what was this number
you gave her?

329
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,894
Some kind of shelter?

330
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:47,697
No shelters back then

331
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:51,667
Just a few good Samaritans
who knew what it was like
to be on the recievin'
end of a fist

332
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,431
So did she call this number?

333
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,641
Got me
Never heard from her again

334
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,852
No way she would've turned
to the police for help, after that

335
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,943
Police

336
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:02,762
Her husband was the police

337
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:07,117
Roger Mulvaney was a cop
in my precinct

338
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:16,860
Her husband was a cop
in the 14th district and a bona fide hero

339
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,019
Decorated twice for valor,
killed in the line of duty 1965

340
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,928
They got his picture up
at Jone's Tavern

341
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,152
Well that's great

342
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:26,080
Bad enough cops in '65
turned a blind eye on abusers

343
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,312
If that abuser was a cop

344
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:30,915
The guy had a free pass,
24/7, 365

345
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,986
- What do you got on the mom?
- Cynthia Mulvaney,

346
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:36,830
drops off the face of the earth in '65,
few months before her husband's killed

347
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,735
We tracked down 9 other
Cynthia Mulvaney's in the tri-state area,

348
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:42,781
we're following up if she's still alive

349
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,204
Meanwhile I got a name and a number
on the lady who ran that
makeshift shelter in '65

350
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,308
A Nancy Walsh

351
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:51,665
Still in the life, heads up a battered
women's shelter in Germantown

352
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:57,451
So in '65 you set up an underground railroad
for battered women?

353
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,298
It was hardly a railroad

354
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,596
Just my living room
with a handful of cots

355
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,631
I took in as many families as I could

356
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,493
Last stop on the line?

357
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,157
The only stop, dear

358
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,627
Do you remember a woman
named Cindy Mulvaney?

359
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:15,098
Twin girls?

360
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,453
This is one of  'em

361
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,940
Oh, yeah

362
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,861
They're mother wouldn't speak
one word to anybody but her daughters,

363
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:26,655
- first two weeks she was here
- Why not?

364
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,330
Her husband swore
he'd find her if she ever left him

365
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,304
Take everything she loved

366
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:37,248
He meant he'd kill the girls
and make her watch

367
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:39,430
What a prince

368
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,102
So she blamed herself
Like we all do

369
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,245
Just push the button here, see?

370
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,773
Like we did at the beach

371
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,810
You make a home made movie

372
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:55,771
Lot of laundry today, huh?

373
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,634
Anyway, thanks for pitchin' in

374
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:06,367
They're just a few months old

375
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,002
The girls

376
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,904
When he first hits you

377
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,489
Who, Cindy, your husband?

378
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:16,544
Then you tell yourself
it was just a shove, really

379
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:19,686
He didn't mean it, he loves me,
so you stay

380
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,501
We all stayed

381
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:24,637
Until one day you realize
the door you could've walked out

382
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:30,768
a long time ago is
nailed shut forever

383
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:36,233
You provided each and every nail
every time you stayed

384
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:40,121
You had nowhere to go, no money

385
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:45,449
But you left, remember that

386
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,331
I miss my wife

387
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:57,743
Cindy, take the girls and go upstairs

388
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:00,508
I don't know what came over me

389
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:03,392
I swear it will not happen again

390
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:06,768
You always say that

391
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:10,590
Being all alone in that house
the last few weeks,

392
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,856
it made me realize

393
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:18,703
Without you, without my girls,

394
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,773
I'm nothin'

395
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:25,444
Let me go, Roger
Please

396
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,385
I can't

397
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:30,701
Because you're my wife

398
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,965
You're my happily ever after

399
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:39,101
Come home to me

400
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,854
My shift ends at midnight

401
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:52,030
I'll see you then

402
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:00,700
Let's pack up our things

403
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,602
You don't have to go
back to that jerk

404
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:10,176
You have another choice, Cindy
Remember?

405
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,947
Choice?

406
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,351
What'd she mean by that?

407
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,311
I don't know

408
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,878
Tiffany was her friend,
her confidante

409
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:24,334
Maybe you could ask her

410
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,706
Do you know
where we can find this Tiffany?

411
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,404
She's one of our most generous doners
Volunteers here

412
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:31,967
I can give you her number

413
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,112
A lucky woman,
getting out

414
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,856
What about Cindy?

415
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,494
- She get lucky, too?
- No

416
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:41,638
No, she packed her bags
and went home that very night

417
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:45,104
I tried to convince her to stay
but she said there was no use in running

418
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:46,868
He'd track her down
to the ends of the earth,

419
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:50,423
the guy was a cop
Had the resources / Yeah

420
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:53,529
Did you ever see Cindy again?

421
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:57,766
Usually don't, after a woman
goes back to her husband

422
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:01,593
Unless I pay a visit
to the local cemetery

423
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,191
You were Cindy's friend, Tiffany

424
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:14,588
You knew she had other options

425
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,799
When I said Cindy had a choice,

426
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,414
I meant the man
who was madly in love with her

427
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:22,079
And I wasn't talking
about that pig of a husband

428
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,928
Cindy was having an affair?

429
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:27,408
Don't make it sound tawdry,
because it wasn't

430
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,342
It was sweet

431
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,568
Who was this guy?

432
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,655
I don't remember his name,

433
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:43,079
but he had eyes like yours
Kind Sexy

434
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,249
He was Cindy's way out

435
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,645
I always told myself she took it

436
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:53,887
Firm shoulders, he had those too

437
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,443
And how would you know that?

438
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:58,923
He brought us to the beach one day

439
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,843
Just a few days after Cindy
came to the shelter

440
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:04,900
Had the affair been going on
for a while by then?

441
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,946
It was just beginning

442
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:11,025
Cindy wouldn't talk to a soul
except the girls

443
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,307
So which beach did he bring you to?

444
00:25:13,307 --> 00:25:15,989
The dreadful Jersey shore

445
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,388
But still,

446
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,903
we were able to forget
where we'd come from,

447
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:26,328
that we were depending
on the kindness of strangers

448
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:29,827
It must've been nice, Tiffany

449
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:32,067
It was magical

450
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:35,666
If just for a day

451
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,931
Shot a home movie of it

452
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:42,130
You don't still have this home movie
by any chance?

453
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,028
It's yours for a smile, big boy

454
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,911
DNA results came in positive

455
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:55,497
Vivian was your identical twin

456
00:25:56,368 --> 00:26:00,112
Your mother's name was
Cynthia Mulvaney

457
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:04,449
Your father was a police officer,
his name was Roger

458
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,242
You found my parents?

459
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:08,219
We're still looking for your mom

460
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:12,622
Your dad was killed
on the job in 1965

461
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:18,466
Well what was he like?

462
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,704
We think he was abusive

463
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,196
To your mother

464
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:24,322
To you girls

465
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:27,130
You have memories of that, Maura?

466
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,872
Like I said there's very little
I remember from my childhood

467
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,975
No wonder

468
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:36,760
We need your help identifying this guy
in this home movie

469
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,652
Of what?

470
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:43,684
Your mother and Vivian and someone
else we can't identify and you

471
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:47,008
Maybe he knows
what happened to your sister

472
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:51,582
Well what are we waiting for?

473
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,432
Oh, my God
Is that my mom?

474
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:18,206
Yeah, and Vivian

475
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:22,680
That smell in the air, the water

476
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,723
It was the first time I saw the ocean

477
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:28,036
This help you remember anything else?

478
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:34,491
That swimsuit Vivian's wearing,
we fought over it and she won

479
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:37,047
Do you remember that man, Maura?

480
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:40,768
The one picking up Vivian?

481
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:42,430
Maura?

482
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,537
She was so happy,
and sad at the same time

483
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:48,973
Your mom was?

484
00:27:49,555 --> 00:27:53,524
That day on the beach
she called it our perfect day

485
00:27:53,524 --> 00:27:59,742
And if you closed your eyes,
it would last forever

486
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,761
Vivian's it, Mommy

487
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,535
Play us a song, Mommy

488
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:07,712
- A song?
- On the piano

489
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,723
I didn't know you played the piano

490
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,718
Mommy played all the time, before

491
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:13,963
Even when she was a little girl

492
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:18,834
She stopped 'cause of Daddy / Oh

493
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:22,926
Would you play a song for me?

494
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:28,878
Wow! That's beautiful

495
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:30,954
I don't hear anything

496
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,860
Well you know what we got here?

497
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,677
It's a top 40 hit
Isn't that right, Mom?

498
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,736
- Can you girls sing?
- No

499
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,784
- Dance?
- No

500
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,908
Fantastic, we're gonna take
this show on the road

501
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:48,432
You and me and our
dancing chimpanzees

502
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,718
What do you say, Mom?

503
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,813
You'll run away with me?

504
00:28:55,813 --> 00:29:00,062
Are you gonna kiss Mommy?

505
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:07,469
- That was Art
- Art Balduchi?

506
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:09,484
The cop who came to
your house that time?

507
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:10,941
Yes, that's him

508
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,180
He was in love with your mother?

509
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,775
And she was in love with him

510
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:19,337
Can't you see?

511
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,717
So why did you keep it a secret, Art?

512
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:30,573
You and Cindy?

513
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:32,348
I've got nothing to say to you

514
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:34,547
Unless you knew
what happened to Vivian

515
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:36,158
How she was killed

516
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:39,616
Or maybe you're protecting Cindy

517
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:43,798
The way she'd lay her finger
on her own kid No way

518
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,362
Somebody did

519
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,711
He didn't deserve her

520
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:52,282
Or those girls

521
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:54,619
You on the other hand
were willing to start a new life

522
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,923
with someone you'd known
for 2 weeks

523
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:00,987
So how'd it begin?
You and Cindy?

524
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:07,466
I went to that shelter
to check in on her

525
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:12,042
I thought it'd be that one time

526
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:16,761
But I found myself goin' every day

527
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:18,281
That's how

528
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:21,255
And a few weeks later
the hubby tracks her down,

529
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,723
wants her back for good

530
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:24,307
You couldn't let that happen

531
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:27,526
I did my best to save her

532
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:31,892
But my best wasn't enough

533
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,558
He found us at the shelter, Art

534
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,597
We'll never get away
from him now, never

535
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:40,326
He found you?

536
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,472
He'll be home in an hour
and he expects us to be there

537
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,991
- Where's he now?
- On shift

538
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,907
What are we gonna do?

539
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,182
OK, we're gonna run away
All right?

540
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:54,548
You, me and the girls

541
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,903
We'll go to the shore,
he's never gonna find us there

542
00:30:56,903 --> 00:31:00,769
You can't leave your life here Art,
your job! / Why not?

543
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,930
You're young,
your life has just started,

544
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:09,854
you can't just take on
someone else's kids Their wife

545
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:12,936
Then be my wife

546
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:15,977
- Marry me
- What?

547
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,198
I don't have much

548
00:31:18,198 --> 00:31:21,900
but what I have is yours,
and the girls

549
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,198
And I'll love you
and protect you

550
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,003
and I'll never let harm
come your way

551
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:30,778
Don't say those things
if you don't mean them /I do

552
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:37,372
So?

553
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,883
Will you marry me?

554
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:50,533
Does that mean
Mommy's name is Mrs Balduchi now?

555
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:58,386
Yes

556
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:06,944
What about him?

557
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:11,411
- What about Roger?
- Right

558
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,918
You stay here with the girls

559
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:15,535
No, where are you going, Art?

560
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:19,514
I'm gonna make sure
he never bothers you again

561
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:25,833
Keep an eye on Mommy,
girls / OK

562
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:43,972
Oh, hey Balduchi,
you gave me a fright

563
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,870
Is the whole precinct comin' down
to see me home?

564
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,444
You let her go!

565
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:57,663
You let her be!

566
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:01,002
You understand my meanin'?

567
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:05,347
Yeah, yeah

568
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:09,097
You'll never hurt her again

569
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:17,529
That's how we dealt with
abusers back then

570
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,506
Off the books

571
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:24,023
OK So then you tried
to run off with Cindy?

572
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:26,826
I thought we were free

573
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:31,655
But I went back to my place
and they were gone

574
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:34,265
Cindy, the girls

575
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,567
There was a note

576
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,494
We forgot Snowflake,
be back soon

577
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:41,549
They went back for the cat

578
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:43,458
To the house

579
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:49,246
I raced over but it was dark Empty

580
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:51,972
I drove around for hours that night,
looking for 'em

581
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:57,490
Went down to the shore,
walked that beach till dawn

582
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,794
Never found 'em

583
00:33:59,794 --> 00:34:02,977
I kept hopin' she'd call

584
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,893
But she never did

585
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:08,039
And that's when I knew

586
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,186
Roger had found her
The girls

587
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:18,567
He never said a word but
I knew

588
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:22,709
Roger was killed in the line of duty
a few months later

589
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:25,816
You knew his beat

590
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:32,102
She was Mrs Cindy Balduchi
for the day

591
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:34,799
At least I had that

592
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:38,198
Cindy Balduchi

593
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:43,013
No need to write any of that
last part down

594
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:47,165
Don't remember what
the man said anyhow

595
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:54,426
If you ever find Cindy
out there somewhere,

596
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,978
would you tell her

597
00:34:56,978 --> 00:35:00,620
she doesn't need to be afraid
of him anymore?

598
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,279
Art took care of it

599
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:27,456
Cindy Balduchi?

600
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,231
Yes, may I help you?

601
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:36,019
Philadelphia PD,
or is it Mulvaney?

602
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:41,571
That's all for today
I'll see you next week

603
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,913
Please go away

604
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,631
Maura wants to know
why you left

605
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:56,804
I don't know anyone by
that name I'm sorry

606
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:10,020
She can't know
He'll find her

607
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,686
Your husband?
He's dead, Cindy

608
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:19,522
He can't hurt Maura
Not anymore

609
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,609
He swore he'd find me
He'd find her

610
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,860
He would take everything I'd loved

611
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,026
Like he took Vivian

612
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,011
What'd he do to Vivian?

613
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,402
Don't you see?

614
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:43,394
I still had Maura left

615
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:48,524
I had to be sure
she would be safe from him

616
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:53,693
That's why I left her
in the church

617
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:56,619
And she was safe

618
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:02,160
But now Maura needs to know
why she ended up alone

619
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:08,023
Tell her

620
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:12,569
I had no choice

621
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:16,752
I had to make sure he'd never find you

622
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:20,997
Even if it meant giving you up forever

623
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,431
Snowflake, where are you?

624
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:25,968
Shh, keep your voice down

625
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,784
But Daddy's still at work Mommy

626
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:29,892
I know but we have to be quiet, OK?

627
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:33,267
I'll get Snowflake but you have
to promise to stay put, OK?

628
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,919
OK

629
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:45,857
Snowflake

630
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,193
Snowflake

631
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:48,351
Snowflake

632
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:54,970
Stupid cat!
Come here

633
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,317
Oh, thank God

634
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:03,734
Let's get out of here

635
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:09,905
Wanna drive?
Or should I?

636
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:12,097
Get in

637
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:24,144
We're a family

638
00:38:24,144 --> 00:38:26,780
We're gonna work this out

639
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,720
Families always do

640
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,490
Ain't that right, girls?

641
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:37,298
First I wanna know something

642
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,969
Where are you taking us?

643
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,469
Did you make it with him?

644
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,767
Roger, not in front of the girls

645
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:48,506
- Did you make it with him!
- No, I didn't

646
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,961
Good

647
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:56,397
That's good

648
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,670
That means we can start again

649
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,098
- You and me
- Roger

650
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:07,208
I'd kill myself if we couldn't

651
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:11,162
You're the only thing
in my life that counts

652
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:15,285
I'm nothing without my family

653
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:21,344
I missed my wife

654
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:26,144
I missed you too

655
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:29,761
- You missed Daddy, girls?
- Yes, Daddy

656
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:31,262
Should we go home, then?

657
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,834
What about Mrs Balduchi, Mommy?

658
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,370
We don't need to talk about her

659
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,830
Who's Mrs Balduchi?

660
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,333
Mommy is

661
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:54,872
- I'm sorry
- Me, too

662
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,379
What are you doing, Roger?

663
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:12,989
What are you doing?

664
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:15,555
Roger?

665
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:20,494
What are you doing with them?

666
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:22,753
Roger?

667
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,678
Give them back to me

668
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:28,378
I'll do anything you want

669
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:30,834
- Just give'em back to me
- Mommy

670
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:34,044
Think you could just drive off
into the sunset?

671
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:38,908
- Live happily ever after?
- No, no I don't

672
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,187
No, no!

673
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,054
There is no happily ever after

674
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:49,219
Not for us, babe
Not for you

675
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,435
- Not if I can help it
- Mommy! Mommy!

676
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:56,513
No!

677
00:40:56,513 --> 00:41:03,079
No!

678
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:20,501
* Donovan 'Catch The Wind' *

679
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:25,522
* In the chilly hours and minutes, *

680
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:30,176
* Of uncertainty, I want to be, *

681
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:37,666
* In the warm hold of your loving mind *

682
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:41,474
* To feel you all around me, *

683
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:46,068
* And to take your hand,

684
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:53,937
* Ah, but I may as well try

685
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:57,799
* When sundown pales the sky, *

686
00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:02,503
* I wanna hide a while,
behind your smile,

687
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:10,106
* And everywhere I'd look,

688
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:13,809
* For me to love you now, *

689
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:18,622
* Would be the sweetest thing,

690
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:26,547
* Ah, but I may as well, try

691
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:42,702
* When rain has hung

692
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:46,784
* I want you near, to kill my fears *

693
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:54,524
* To help me to leave

694
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:57,991
* For standin' in your heart, *

695
00:42:57,991 --> 00:43:02,646
* Is where I want to be,

696
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:10,242
* Ah, but I may as well,

697
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:26,836
* When rain has hung

698
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:30,813
* I want you near, to kill my fears *

699
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:38,342
* To help me to leave

700
00:43:38,342 --> 00:43:41,932
* For standin' in your heart, *

701
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:46,515
* Is where I want to be,

702
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:54,226
* Ah, but I may as well,

703
00:44:02,317 --> 00:44:10,045
* Ah, but I may as well,
