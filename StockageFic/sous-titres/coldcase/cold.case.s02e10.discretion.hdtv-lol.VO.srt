4
00:00:11,106 --> 00:00:13,071
Let him go!

5
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,412
He didn't do anything!

6
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,727
Look they're coming down the stairs!

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,532
Let him go!

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,308
We want REAL justice!

9
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:46,273
Did you know that there'd 
be all this cameras?

10
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,686
It's a big case.

11
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,398
Oh God, Greg. 
You could be governor.

12
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:53,498
You should have a better wife.

13
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,842
Anna.

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,413
Be strong.

15
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:58,289
Hey!

16
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,243
They want a statement.

17
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:11,635
Good afternoon, 
I'm ADA Harold Mott.

18
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:13,181
Allow me to introduce Greg Vizcaino,

19
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:16,241
he's the lead prosecutor 
on the Stacy Hall case.

20
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,362
Two days ago, Stacy Hall,

21
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:20,578
a young Yale graduate 
was on a morning jog

22
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,742
when her life was finally cut short.

23
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,852
I'm grieved with parents.

24
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,452
The man you just saw let away
is Antonio Mendez,

25
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:31,525
who we will prove as responsible
for this shocking crime.

26
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,129
Now, mr. Mott and I
will take any questions.

27
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,480
That was six hours well spent.
I'll tell you that.

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,346
Ah, the training seminar.

29
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:25,034
Yeah. This guy, was never 
been on the line,

30
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,493
never worked a homocide.

31
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:27,959
But he's an expert.

32
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,673
His answer for everything?

33
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,498
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

34
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:33,604
You guys get dinner?

35
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:34,761
There's pizza in the fridge.

36
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:39,582
Every job that ever happened in Philly
was autoerotic asphyxiation.

37
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:42,058
Thaks for coming Mrs. Vizcaino.

38
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,419
Greg wasn't perfect.

39
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:47,445
- But he was no thief.
- I hear you.

40
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:49,622
Hi.

41
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,084
Hey, Gil. / Rush.

42
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:53,964
Gents.

43
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,765
Who's uh.., who's the visitor?

44
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:57,075
In from Connecticut.

45
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,113
Husband was killed in 2000.

46
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,629
Job never came in.

47
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,766
Good looking widow.

48
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,443
Guy's from Connecticut 
but died in Philly?

49
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:06,099
Ah, the case was a bag 
of bones from the start.

50
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,103
Actually, Valens. 
You might want to take a look at it.

51
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:09,979
Why me?

52
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,037
Guy was Puerto Rican.

53
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:14,012
Greg Vizcaino.

54
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,469
What was his story?

55
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,408
Up and coming DA in New Haven.

56
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:20,905
Turns up a 150 miles away 
in North Philly, stabbed to death.

57
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,980
He prosecuting somebody 
put a hit out on him?

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,504
Ah, I looked into that.

59
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,337
All the other thugs he put away.

60
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:27,751
The widow had bring you 
something new?

61
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,233
Harold Mott.

62
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:33,785
He partnered with Vizcaino on 
a murder case the time he died.

63
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:36,980
And? / And Mott's in a runoff
for state treasurer.

64
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,310
He's knocking the dead guy.

65
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,631
How? / Last week a reporter
looking for dirt?

66
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:45,978
He found that 10K went missing 
from the DA's office back in 2000.

67
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:47,939
So the smug get accused of taking it?

68
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,685
Now, he points to Vizcaino.

69
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:51,707
It's handy, he can't defend himself.

70
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,805
But the widow says 
no way he'd taken it.

71
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,367
But if he did, it could be 
connected to his murder.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,315
So, New Havens the beginning,
North Philly's the end.

73
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,004
What's the middle?

74
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,830
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

75
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:16,888
Cold Case 
2x10  Discretion

85

Greg Vizcaino, 35.

86
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,964
Grew up in the New Haven barrio,

87
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,991
went to Cornell, then Yale law school.

88
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,810
Success story.

89
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,770
So what was he doing in North Philly?

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,440
No family or work connect.

91
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,056
He's supposed to be in court 
the next day on his murder trial,

92
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:59,571
but for some reason he drives 
a 150 miles to Philly the night before.

93
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,692
Maybe the answer is tied 
to the missing money.

94
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,048
So why do we believe he took it?

95
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:05,019
Just because some politician said so?

96
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,457
We don't believe it yet, Scotty.

97
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:07,433
But we're gonna check it out.

98
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,745
Or maybe I'll look at this job.
Sinclair Thomas.

99
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,794
- You got any direction?
- Nah, I just like his name.

100
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,396
If Vizcaino did need money, why?

101
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,972
Gambling debt? Black mail?

102
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,109
There's gotta be something personal, Lil.

103
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,712
You don't stab someone 12 times

104
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:22,727
just to rob'em, then leave the car 
and money behind.

105
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:26,654
Hey! This Harold Mott, the guy 
who said Vizcaino swiped the cash?

106
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:29,153
Took over as lead prosecutor 
after Greg died,

107
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:32,337
won the case, made him 
a household name in New Haven.

108
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:34,160
Huh, now he's on the political track.

109
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,248
it could've been Vizcaino's future 
if someone hadn't shanked him.

110
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,694
Oh, maybe there's your motive.
Let's start with Mott.

111
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,716
See why he's saying that 
Vizcaino stold the money.

112
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,359
A roadtrip to New Haven?

113
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,044
Job gonna spring for Howard Johnson's?

114
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,378
Sure, but the boys got to bunk together.

115
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,159
- Junior guy gets the cot.
- No way!

116
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,755
That's the known fact.

117
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,307
We called him 'Golden Greg'.

118
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:13,492
Good looking, smart as a whip! 
A+ guy.

119
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:17,966
Yet you told the New Haven register
that this "Great guy" stold that money.

120
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,610
Look, I hate to tarnish his name,

121
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,260
but when it was suggested I took it,
I was pushed to the wall.

122
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,643
But why would Greg do that?

123
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,015
Take the 10 grand.

124
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:27,864
I wouldn't speculate about that.

125
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:29,649
Best guess.

126
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,845
Greg, wasn't himself at the end.

127
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,012
How's that?

128
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:36,141
The Hall case was the big leagues.

129
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,152
A white jogger raped and 
killed by a latino kid?

130
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:41,851
It was a slam dunk until the kid 
recanted his confession.

131
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,555
Then, it got tough.

132
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:44,640
And Greg couldn't take it?

133
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,546
It was his first time as lead prosecutor

134
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:50,149
he started out great but he lost focus.

135
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,894
Yeah? How?

136
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:54,552
At work he was all over the map.

137
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,962
Pulling vice reports, 
making weird phone call.

138
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:01,674
He..., he just seemed distracted 
by something other than the case.

139
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:03,088
You asked him about it?

140
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,387
Nah, he was first chair.

141
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:06,726
I wasn't suppose to question him.

142
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,331
He ever mentioned Philadelphia?

143
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,400
Hmm, No.

144
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,634
But, he would disappear for hours at a time.

145
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,830
Maybe...he went there?

146
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,072
But so, middle of his case 
he'd go AWOL

147
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,472
and you had no idea where to.

148
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,728
I know where he went, one time.

149
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:28,374
If this gets out,
it's a pandora's box, though.

150
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,747
It won't get out.

151
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,043
The day before he disappeared,

152
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,724
Greg did something
that any law student

153
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,891
would tell you is incredibly unethical.

154
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,638
I just heard from 
the prison ward at county. / Yeah.

155
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,039
They said that you visited 
Antonio last night.

156
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,340
I said that had to be wrong.

157
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,234
Harold, I know what I'm doing.

158
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:53,277
You visited the defendant 
without his lawyer present?

159
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:55,325
You know what this could 
do to our case, right?

160
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,661
You know you could be disbarred?

161
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,327
- It's under control. It's fine!
- Fine?

162
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,597
Greg, what is going on?

163
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:00,514
Nothing!

164
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,424
Where are you going?

165
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,959
- I gotta be some place.
- We're in the middle of a trial!

166
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,808
And I'm first chair, telling you 
I gotta be some place.

167
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:10,133
I know what I'm doing.

168
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,083
I don't care what Greg said.

169
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,959
He was drowning.

170
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,005
And the next day, he was dead.

171
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,232
Antonio was the guy 
you were prosecuting?

172
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:29,245
Serving a life sentence now.

173
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,898
Real tough luck kid.

174
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,217
Tried suicide in jail before trial.

175
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:35,312
So you never told anyone 
about Greg's visit?

176
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:37,001
Would've led to a mistrial.

177
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,314
And you wouldn't make the front page.

178
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,448
Antonio confessed to rape and murder.

179
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:44,444
But recanted.

180
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:47,000
Public defender gets involved, 
it's always this strategy.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,020
Bottom line, I wasn't gonna 
let that kid walk,

182
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,600
because Greg was crackin' up.

183
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,554
What do you think happend to Greg?

184
00:08:56,733 --> 00:09:00,542
He was a striver, and on his way. 
But...

185
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,483
he wasn't ready for the job.

186
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,915
And being proud, 
he wouldn't ask for help.

187
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,039
So he self-destructed.

188
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:11,316
Whole thing was 
an American tragedy.

189
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:23,275
Detective Jefferys and Vera, Antonio.

190
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,227
Philly cops, huh?

191
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:26,743
I don't like talking to police.

192
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:29,502
We gotta ask you about Greg Vizcaino?

193
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,556
The lawyer that died 
in the middle of your trial?

194
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:32,599
Wasn't me.

195
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,125
I was locked up.

196
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,143
Well, we know he'd came 
to see you before he died.

197
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,217
D'you tell anybody 'bout that?

198
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,083
What for?

199
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,850
He'd give you money to stay quiet?

200
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,557
- Try and pay you to plea guilty?
- I am guilty.

201
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:44,289
Haven't you heard?

202
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,475
What did Greg want with you that night?

203
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:49,739
Make sure the case was 
gonna go his way.

204
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:52,593
I tried to hang myself.

205
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,770
He thought I wouldn't make it to trial

206
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,863
blow his chest to be a hero.

207
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:57,856
That what he'd told you?

208
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:02,700
'You gotta stay alive, Antonio. 
My ass is on the line here.'

209
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,738
Except, he's the one who didn't make it.

210
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,590
Didn't make a difference.

211
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:09,151
Cops had me on video

212
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,442
saying I did it.

213
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,882
Got sent here for life.

214
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,085
Antonio went in ten minutes.

215
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,413
I'm almost embarrassed to 
show you how easy it was.

216
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:28,986
Almost feel sorry for him don't you?

217
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,260
We got a saying here.

218
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,323
'If they weren't dumb, 
we wouldn't catch'em.'

219
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,479
Applys in Philadelphia, too.

220
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,793
Here goes.

221
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,098
I've seen her running in the park.

222
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,188
Did you chase her?

223
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:44,587
Nah, just waited for her to pass.

224
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,748
Then what d'you do?

225
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:47,862
I jumped her.

226
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,151
He took it all back once 
he got a lawyer.

227
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,394
- You testified the trial?
- Sure.

228
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,052
I was the lead detective.

229
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,071
Hey, guys.

230
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,779
This is Sergeant Sal Martin.

231
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,163
He worked the Stacy Hall job.

232
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,790
Hi. / Welcome to New Haven.

233
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,864
Lily Rush, Scotty Valens.

234
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:02,819
Hey.

235
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:09,806
According to Harold Mott,

236
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:12,117
Greg was unravelling 
the last few weeks of his life.

237
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:14,146
How'd he seem to you?

238
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,374
Alright.

239
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:20,202
You don't say that like you mean it.

240
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,222
Well, Stressed, maybe.

241
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:24,536
The young star at the DA's office,

242
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:26,656
people talking about your political future,

243
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:27,941
it's a lot of pressure.

244
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:28,970
Right.

245
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,274
Any reason he'd need 10K?

246
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,265
Hmm, we could all use 10K.

247
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,813
But Greg, in particular.

248
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,291
He was a good kid.

249
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,995
But even good kids growing up in bad
neighborhood pick up bad habits.

250
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:43,893
What kind of bad habits?

251
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,248
Oh, crap!

252
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:56,582
Greg was a good guy.

253
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,994
That's what Harold Mott said.

254
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,740
Everyone has a dark side.

255
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,749
Greg's was...pretty dark.

256
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:05,766
Hey!

257
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,581
That's the last I want to see you.
Get outta here!

258
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:21,188
- Way behind on payments, Greg.
- I know, I know.

259
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,005
This is all I have right now.

260
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,817
When's the next installment coming?

261
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,737
This guy bothering you counselor?

262
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,123
No, detective.

263
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:30,875
It's alright.

264
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,015
I was just,

265
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,083
Walking the murder scene again?

266
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,504
Stacy Hall was killed 
at the park down the street.

267
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:47,808
You were just checking out 
the area for yourself.

268
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,096
Right?

269
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:51,193
Right.

270
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:53,883
Just...walking the scene.

271
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:01,117
Don't make it so obvious, Greg.

272
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:13,038
I've seen him a lot with this dealer.

273
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:14,728
Guy named Kiki.

274
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,392
He was known on the street that...

275
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,538
he had habit.

276
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:20,006
Kind of an open secret?

277
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,141
Look, I don't want to
speak ill of the dead.

278
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:23,786
But a coke habit?

279
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,486
Takes a lot of cash.

280
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:28,547
So despite what the widow says, 
maybe Greg was a theif?

281
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,424
And an addict.

282
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:34,256
Yeah, Maybe.

283
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,940
So, 'Golden Greg' is losing at work,

284
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,669
blowing his murder case, 
and feeding a coke habit?

285
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,542
Which still doesn't tell us 
how he winds up at Philly.

286
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:50,104
Just hope I don't come down with
the cold sleeping in Siberia all night.

287
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:52,166
Man, you need the windows
open for fresh air.

288
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,925
So you told me.

289
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,641
You guys worked out the cot problem?

290
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:59,862
Nah, we drew straws, Vera lost.

291
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:01,833
he leaves all miffed, 
doesn't come back.

292
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:02,751
You worried?

293
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,480
He went out to check out the hot spots 
of New Haven with Martin.

294
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,120
All I wanna know is uh, who's Lena?

295
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,243
Hey! / Listen now, Lena.

296
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,647
Just sing it one more time.

297
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,687
- Stop that!
- You talk in your sleep, man.

298
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,957
Ah, look who's here!

299
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,977
Rough night, Vera?

300
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:26,418
This city blows, Nothing to do.

301
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:27,725
Can I get some coffee over here?

302
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,353
Hey, did Martin tell 
where to find that dealer?

303
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,434
Ah, Eden Park.

304
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:34,290
Look for some crazy guy 
with dreadlocks.

305
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,168
Ready?

306
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,743
Drop me off at New Haven PD?

307
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll catch up.

308
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,427
He's paying.

309
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,386
Smell it, smell it.

310
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,731
Kiki Solano?

311
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:59,872
Uh-oh! Man of the street.
New haven's finest on the beat.

312
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:03,423
Some five-o? Five-bro?

313
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:07,037
Yeah, detective Jefferys 
and Valens from Philly.

314
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,039
We're here about Greg Vizcaino.

315
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,665
DA who got killed four years ago.

316
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:13,197
You ain't gonna tell me 
who Greg V is.

317
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,091
Went to grade school together.

318
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:16,309
On the day he died?

319
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,870
Whoo, hysteria in the area.

320
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,374
Whole barrio dressed in black.

321
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:23,903
We know you were selling him 
blow before he died.

322
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,474
Just all I sell.

323
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,947
Strictly botanical, always organical.

324
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,473
We ain't Narcs.
(Narc: Narcotics Officer의 준말. 마약수사대)

325
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:32,279
We know Greg owes you money.
You kill him over that?

326
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,563
Greg was my brother.
Hermanos.

327
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,877
I wasn't worried about his debts.

328
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:39,717
I was worried about his soul.

329
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,487
Yeah? Why?

330
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,412
They loved him at the DA's.

331
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:46,332
Because he was light bright 
and damn near white.

332
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,486
I tried to get him to see that 
they was just using him.

333
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:00,619
Why you gotta parade that kid
in front of the cameras, G?

334
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,040
- To show he's Puerto rican?
- I'll parade any murderer in the street.

335
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,914
And put that lady's rich, 
white parents on display?

336
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,945
It's fact, Kiki. She's white, he's not.

337
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,573
That kid didn't do it!

338
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:12,781
Then why'd he confess?

339
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:14,569
And why'd he recant?

340
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:17,062
He's from the barrio like us!

341
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,797
You got to listen to the word.

342
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,175
What word is that?

343
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,828
The streets have eyes.

344
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:23,840
And they tell no lies.

345
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,110
The streets know something 
about this murder.

346
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,401
Am I suppose to call the streets 
as witnesses?

347
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:33,734
I got a deal for you, G.

348
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:36,284
Check out what the streets got to say,

349
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:38,903
Then I won't sell to her no more.

350
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:43,582
Who would you stop selling to?

351
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:46,934
Anna. Greg's wife.

352
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,657
She hooked on the incense.

353
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:54,170
You said you wasn't narcotics player?

354
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,653
So his wife was the one 
with the coke problem?

355
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,330
Gone on the wagon,
Rode it hard, but...

356
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,514
the wheels come off every now and then
when things got bumpy.

357
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,097
Greg take you up on the deal?

358
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:07,168
I held up my end. 
Don't know about G.

359
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,130
What was the word from the streets.

360
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,611
That kid didn't kill the lady.

361
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,622
It was the Kennedy brothers!

362
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:20,664
Like John and Bobby, you mean?

363
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:24,295
That's one good tip, Kiki. Thanks.

364
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:34,184
It was a left over thing from college.

365
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,780
Used to get me through stressful times.

366
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,246
The way your dealer tells us, sounds
more like a meal than a left over.

367
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,599
Yeah, it was out of control.

368
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,041
I admit that.

369
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:48,068
So you're in debt to Kiki, 
Greg needed money to pay it.

370
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,709
My husband would never steal.

371
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,710
That missing money had 
nothing to do with him.

372
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,170
Gotta look at the facts, Anna.

373
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,349
I told Gil Sherman.

374
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:57,767
He was no thief.

375
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,815
Sometimes when you love someone,

376
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:02,418
you only see them like you want to.

377
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:10,595
I changed my views over last four years

378
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,499
I was so ashamed then.

379
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,946
Of what?

380
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,981
...Completed its recount and vice president Gore

381
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:21,072
has only picked up 54 votes on governor Bush.

382
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,542
You get my message?

383
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,555
I was working.

384
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,125
No-no, I don't believe you!

385
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,707
You're doing that crap on in the house?

386
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,761
What, the girls here?

387
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,564
- Where do you go?
- I'm working!

388
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:33,842
Who calls here and hangs up 
everytime I say hello?

389
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,619
Do you hear how paranoid you sound?

390
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,304
I brought the car in for service,

391
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,854
and they asked why there was 
so much mileage built up on it.

392
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,375
Where do you go?

393
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,199
I cannot talk to you when you are wired.

394
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,646
Tell me!

395
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,172
Kiss me.

396
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,360
You won't do it, will you?

397
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,199
Not when you're like this.

398
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:11,383
How are you going to be governor
with your secrets?

399
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,514
What do you think he was hiding?

400
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:20,384
I know what he was hiding.

401
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,632
I'm not proud of it, but I looked 
through his briefcase once

402
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:25,886
and found some newspaper ads.

403
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:27,349
For escorts.

404
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:28,857
Call girls?

405
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:31,882
Boys.

406
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:34,533
He had some names circled.

407
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,646
His favorite seemed to be one name Ramon.

408
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:38,844
You confront him?

409
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,323
Nah, I was too shocked.

410
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:42,154
Ashamed.

411
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:46,518
But if people find out now? So be it.

412
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,828
My husband's a gay.

413
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:51,181
What isn't a crime.

414
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,460
Yeah, but stealing is.

415
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,308
I want his name cleared.

416
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:56,905
Do you remember what 
newspapers they were, Anna?

417
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,315
They were those free rags you 
find on the streets.

418
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,784
Action,

419
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,523
Gay Times,

420
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,345
City Paper.

421
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,824
You sure about that? City Paper?

422
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:09,332
Hmm. / That's from Philadelphia.

423
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:13,708
Hmm. Maybe we finally 
got our Philly connect.

424
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:19,331
- So he wasn't the coke head?
- That was his wife.

425
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,949
He was busy prowling for boys.

426
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:22,661
Huh! But why in Philly?

427
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,856
Too much to lose if he was 
found out in New Haven?

428
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,956
Hartford's closer, Scotty,
New York.

429
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,298
Well, maybe he started there,

430
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:31,349
and something
or someone brought him here.

431
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,747
Maybe Ramon.

432
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:35,738
I remember Harold Mott said Greg 
was looking at vice reports.

433
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:37,435
- Instead of working?
- Yeah?

434
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,933
Maybe with all this stress 
he went looking for comfort.

435
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,052
Arrest reports could tell him 
where to find them by name.

436
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:43,377
Easy targets, too.

437
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,040
More willing to play if they'd 
been arrested before.

438
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,126
Go see Harold Mott again. 
Get some details on the reports.

439
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:50,846
Don't count on him
being too helpful.

440
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:51,916
No? Why?

441
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,675
I've been following that missing money?

442
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,951
- Only Greg and Harold had access.
- Yeah?

443
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:58,650
Guess who lost a bundle 
on tech stocks in early 2000?

444
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,864
Harold. / And he was in hot water
until suddenly nine grand

445
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,512
appears in his wife's stock account,

446
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,089
the week after the 10K goes missing?

447
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,978
You send it to New Haven PD?

448
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:11,238
So don't be surprised if Harold 
pulls the welcome mat.

449
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:19,264
I knew I timed it this right!

450
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:21,414
You can't stay away from the place?

451
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,534
I'm droping gloves off for Lil.

452
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,156
Temperature went down 
20 degrees over the day.

453
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,501
Oh well, She's still up there.

454
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,468
I was going to leave'em at the desk.

455
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:31,679
She doesn't like to see me here.

456
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,115
Too friendly.

457
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,746
There are worse things.

458
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:40,280
You know, you dress way 
better than the average cop.

459
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,809
That ain't saying a lot.

460
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,004
No, guess not.

461
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:47,509
Your girlfriend pick out your clothes?

462
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,673
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

463
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,834
I mean, I used to. 
She's in the hospital right now.

464
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,134
Sorry. / She's okay. 
She's getting out.

465
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,050
That's good.

466
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,956
Well, even though, 
we're not really together anymore.

467
00:22:03,212 --> 00:22:08,178
I work at the Mcginty's tavern,
if you ever want a free beer.

468
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,711
Yeah, okay.

469
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:13,602
See ya.

470
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,986
- Oh great! What do you want?
- Bad day?

471
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,722
The cops and press are all over me

472
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:35,282
because of you sticking 
your nose in this.

473
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:38,025
That's the price of being 
a public figure, Harold.

474
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,757
We need to know more 
about Greg Vizcaino.

475
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,184
I told you what I know. 
He cracked.

476
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,441
The price of being put into game 
before you're ready.

477
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,917
Hm, but you were ready?

478
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,426
I tried to help him.

479
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:50,751
But you can't expect the water boy
to play the quarterback.

480
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,495
The vice reports he was pulling,

481
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:56,409
any reason to think he was 
using them for personal reasons?

482
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,083
What the hell! Yeah.

483
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,612
Golden Greg?

484
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,675
Liked his boys young and cheap!

485
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,656
Go on.

486
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,945
Ramon, from juniper street.

487
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:28,049
- Another Puerto Rican packer?
- Screw you!

488
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,519
No! Screw you!

489
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,280
We've got the trail of the year to prep for

490
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,826
and you're chasing male hookers!

491
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,284
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm 
doing because I'm a promiscuous latin!

492
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,631
And a light weight token.

493
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,229
You barely made it through 
Acme Law School,

494
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,449
and you're calling me a light weight?

495
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,276
Spare me the barrio superiority!

496
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:43,974
So you grew up poor and hungry, 
Boo-frigging-hoo.

497
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,724
It doesn't entitle you to my job!

498
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,479
No, me being smarter than 
you entitles me to my job!

499
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:51,619
- You're delusional.
- You're a cracker, flunky!

500
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,056
He was a disgrace to his heritage.

501
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,750
Well, you know all about that, huh?

502
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,532
You wanted the truth.

503
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,546
While I was busting 
my ass to the Hall trial,

504
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:08,171
he was in here using vice reports
to chase boy friends.

505
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:09,912
And who's Ramon?

506
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,066
A name he got off a report.

507
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:14,614
Probably some barrio trick.

508
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:18,045
Is there a Juniper Street in New Haven?

509
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:19,825
Not that I know of.

510
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:21,959
We done here?

511
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,347
Yeah. We're done.

512
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,478
You know a hustle named Ramon?

513
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:32,158
Puerto Rican, probably in his twenties?

514
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:33,719
What do I look like 411?

515
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,910
Came from Connecticut.
Showed up about four years ago?

516
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,479
Four years ago, I'm in highschool.

517
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,458
So that's a no?

518
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,875
Try the boy trade theater on 13th street.

519
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,378
Will do.

520
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,214
Any luck?

521
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:53,246
Squat.

522
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:55,411
We covered all of Juniper Street.

523
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,242
Wish we had a skecth on this guy.
We're chasing ghost.

524
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:00,122
Let's try the theater.

525
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,569
Ever notice how we're the one 
always chasing the Marys?

526
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,660
You know a trick named Ramon?

527
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,358
Pretty boy in the cap.

528
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:26,709
Ramon?

529
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:28,627
Na.

530
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,158
You're not a Ramon formerly 
from New Haven?

531
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:41,217
Look I didn't do nothing 
I was just talking that guy!

532
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:43,357
We wanna know about Greg Vizcaino.

533
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:44,396
I don't know Greg.

534
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,762
He was a DA in New Haven.

535
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:46,680
You two hung out.

536
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,918
He was your boyfriend.

537
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:49,848
Maybe out of lover's quarrel
and you killed him.

538
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,545
I didn't kill nobody!

539
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,919
He had it bad for you 
he even left his wife and kids.

540
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,659
Chase you down from New Haven,
wouldn't take no for an answer?

541
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,933
Killed him to get rid of him?

542
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,950
Look, that's all crazy.

543
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,899
I never knew him in New Haven.

544
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,614
Then why did he come down here 
looking for you?

545
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:11,066
Come on, boyfriend. 
What was he looking for?

546
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,859
I guess, what I saw.

547
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,930
You want a date?

548
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:37,972
No, I want to talk.

549
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:41,705
If you're paying for it, 
you can have anything.

550
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,987
I want to hear about 
that lady in the park.

551
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:57,046
Back in New Haven.

552
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:59,788
- I don't know nothing.
- Ramon, you do.

553
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,524
You saw.

554
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:03,851
How do you know my name?

555
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,074
You ain't gay, are you?

556
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:09,446
No.

557
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:12,891
So you never had your ass 
kicked by bastards?

558
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:14,104
No.

559
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:18,411
You think you're just gonna die on
the street and no one's gonna care?

560
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,649
I don't need them brothers 
mad at me.

561
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:22,775
What brothers?

562
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,153
Look, just forget it.

563
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,969
I didn't see nothing, no at all,

564
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,485
and I ain't going back to Connecticut.

565
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:31,585
There's a kid sitting in prison
for killing that woman.

566
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,842
He just tried to hang himself.

567
00:27:33,842 --> 00:27:34,912
He's 17.

568
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:40,161
If you saw someone else hurt her
you gotta say so right now Ramon!

569
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,696
Two white guys.

570
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,936
It was dark, how could you tell?

571
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,831
Everybody knows them.

572
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,661
They come to park to buy drugs.

573
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,525
So who were these white guys?

574
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:04,567
College kids.

575
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,492
Like to beat up on innos like me.

576
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,981
Now the queens knew to 
watch out for the Kennedys.

577
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:09,988
Kennedys?

578
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,865
Two brothers, I think.

579
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:15,085
They used to drive in old green volvo.

580
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:16,831
Told cops what you saw?

581
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,162
I told Martin.

582
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,942
Some puerto Rican cop on the case.

583
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:22,268
Yeah, we know Martin.

584
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:26,396
You told him, you saw 
the Kennedys attack the woman?

585
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,542
But he said no.

586
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,848
That I didn't see nothing.

587
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,548
That I'd better get out of New Haven.

588
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:36,928
So Martin's the reason 
you booked to Philly?

589
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:42,136
He told me you ever saw me back
there, that would be the last time.

590
00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:51,959
So Martin was a dirty cop.

591
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,757
Why else would he ignore 
the tip from Ramon?

592
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,432
Didn't believe him, the kid's a hustler.

593
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,771
Or because he already 
got his confession from Antonio,

594
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,439
didn't want to mess with a solid case.

595
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,392
Lets go a step further.

596
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,566
You think Martin killed Greg?

597
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,956
If he knew Greg found Ramon?

598
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,032
Gives him motive.

599
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:08,752
Alright, go back to Antonio.

600
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:10,523
See how martin got
the confession from.

601
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:11,731
Boss, we saw the tape.

602
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,454
Just see where it takes us, Nick.

603
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,974
Try to place Martin in Philly that night?

604
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,761
Second time we heard 
about these Kenndy brothers.

605
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,807
And who can help us find them?

606
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:26,859
Don't seem so crazy now, does it?

607
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,321
We looked in enrollment records
for every college in New Haven.

608
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:31,860
There were no Kennedy 
brothers listed in 2000.

609
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,417
Man, forget literal!

610
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,178
Think subliminal.

611
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,575
That ain't their real names!

612
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,394
Just what we call them sports 
around here.

613
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:40,630
Didn't think of telling 
New Haven PD about them?

614
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,281
Player, please.

615
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,478
They gonna believe the dreadlock
guy or the college boys?

616
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:49,025
Plus, talking to cops is bad for business.

617
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:50,258
Greg believes in Kiki.

618
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:52,757
And he found the witness 
who saw them attack the jogger.

619
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,935
- For real?
- Yeah. Local hustler.

620
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,040
That's why G was in Philly?

621
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,281
He died trying to prove 
Antonio was innocent.

622
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,699
Guess we both kept our promise.

623
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,979
We gotta find that brothers.

624
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:07,874
Can you help me?

625
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:12,541
They come around sometimes
on Thursdays.

626
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,189
Getting ready for the weekend.

627
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,467
Where're the other guys at?

628
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,054
Back in Philly.

629
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,316
We need you tell us 
about detective Martin.

630
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:22,699
Nothing to tell.

631
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,405
We know he's dirty.

632
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:29,129
Antonio, he can't hurt you now.

633
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,679
No matter what he threatened you with.

634
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,758
- Why am I gonna believe you?
- Who else you got?

635
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:37,552
- We'll protect you.
- Don't need no protection now!

636
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,643
But my mom's.

637
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,292
No one's touching your mom.

638
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:47,258
Where were you at four years ago?

639
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:49,072
We're here now.

640
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:52,311
So how'd Martin found you?

641
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:58,037
I walked by the dead lady, 
when the cops got there.

642
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:00,867
Martin had seen me. 
Asked me what I know.

643
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:02,413
- What d'you tell him?
- The truth.

644
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,503
I didn't see nothing.

645
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,836
My mama send me to buy eggs.

646
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:08,900
And then?

647
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,544
He let me go.

648
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:11,972
But later?

649
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:15,885
He comes to my house.

650
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,505
Tells my mom, he gotta take me
down to the station.

651
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,920
Did he?

652
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:24,365
Took me to an old building.

653
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,666
This was a meat packing plant 
when I was a kid.

654
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,341
We goin' to the station?

655
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:33,146
Ha, my buddies and I used to 
play baseball right out there.

656
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,828
It's cold in here!

657
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:40,287
What happened at the park, Antonio?

658
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:43,169
- I was goin' to the store.
- Yeah, yeah.

659
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,934
Goin' to the store to buy eggs.

660
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,408
At six in the morning? Come on.

661
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:51,342
My mom said... / You sneaker tracks
were all over the crime scene, Antonio.

662
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,716
I play ball in the park sometimes.

663
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:56,180
What happened when 
you saw that lady running?

664
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:59,477
- I didn't see her...
- Sure you did.

665
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,346
You were behind the tree,

666
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:02,722
when you saw her running by.

667
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,490
I didn't see the lady running!

668
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:15,055
- Why are you hurting me?
- You're lying to me, Antonio.

669
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,233
I lied, sir. / Good.

670
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:20,248
Now tell me how you killed that lady.

671
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,005
I've never seen her.

672
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:31,359
How am I supposed to say
I did something I didn't!

673
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,980
Listen good!

674
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,805
Please!

675
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,796
We ain't leaving here until you tell me
how you murdered that woman.

676
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,239
I didn't kill nobody.

677
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:54,445
Ain't nobody can help you.

678
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,469
'Cause you tell anybody about this?

679
00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:00,150
I'm gonna bring your mom 
down here and have a talk with her.

680
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,956
Understand?

681
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,561
And I know she ain't strong like you.

682
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:06,778
Even if you are a punk!

683
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,796
Yeah...

684
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:12,251
Knew how to do it.

685
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,025
So I got the wind knocked out of me.

686
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:17,817
Over, and over.

687
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,104
How long were you there?

688
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:23,581
'Til I said what he wanted me to say.

689
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:27,063
Then he take me to the station.

690
00:33:27,063 --> 00:33:29,833
So I can say it to the video.

691
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,818
We're gonna be back.

692
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,668
Look at me.

693
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,672
We're gonna be back.

694
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,913
The first? I just talk.

695
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:56,215
I'm... I'm a good talker,
I'll talk you into a statue.

696
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:58,129
Oh, that Doctor Phil over here.

697
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:00,685
Start with the "C" material,  you know.

698
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:02,962
I put the needle in here.

699
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:05,231
And you're dead in eight minutes.

700
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,202
It works on the real dumb ones.

701
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:09,084
What's your "B" material, Vivo?

702
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:12,955
Oh, bounding!
Um, you got a sick kid?

703
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:15,831
Me too. I feel your pain.

704
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,910
I save that line for the ladies.

705
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,967
When all else fails, we go for a drive.

706
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,693
down in the old shipyards.

707
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:27,188
We got no shipyards here, 
but we got a lot of old buildings.

708
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:30,239
I take a mug down there,
just the two of us.

709
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,015
He's squawking in the bag, 
need about a lawyer?

710
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,499
I don't say a word.

711
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,221
When we get down on the shipyards,

712
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,597
I pull out a trashbag full of oranges.

713
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:43,267
And I hit him hard, in the stomach.

714
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,725
That's good!

715
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,892
Don't even leave bruisings.

716
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:52,284
So these buildings?

717
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:57,102
Hm, big, empty, quiet.

718
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:00,062
So that's where you took Antonio?

719
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,790
Come on! I saw that tape.

720
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,010
I know what the fear of God looks like.

721
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,007
Twenty minutes with that kid. / Oh!

722
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:09,186
that's all?

723
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:11,550
It's almost too easy like I said.

724
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,599
That kid was gonna be 
in the system soon enough,

725
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,803
I..., I just helped him along.

726
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,225
That let you sleep
at night, Martin?

727
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,876
What's going on?

728
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,340
You're screwed.

729
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,564
Your badge don't mean nothing here.

730
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,698
The Lieutenant's right there.

731
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,188
You played a fellow cop!

732
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:44,099
You coerced that kid, 
you crossed to the other side, Martin.

733
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,378
He was there at the scene, 
right after the murder.

734
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,986
You thought he was guilty, 
when you tuned him up.

735
00:35:48,986 --> 00:35:51,454
Ramon told you he saw
the Kennedys do...

736
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:53,116
Ramon is a two-bit hustler!

737
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,904
You knew you were wrong
but it was too late!

738
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:56,008
But you had to protect your case

739
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,535
bcause you were heading
for a Sergeant?

740
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:00,729
We got phones and easy 
pass records or that night.

741
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:02,560
Greg called you. 
Left you a voice mail.

742
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,260
It was about the trial.

743
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,142
An hour later you were 
on the turnpike heading for Philly.

744
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:08,658
The kid Antonio was going nowhere...

745
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,926
That kid was poor and slow.

746
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:13,906
Now he's destroyed.

747
00:36:16,736 --> 00:36:20,075
You're gonna turn 
on your own kind, hermano?

748
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:22,360
You ain't my kind.

749
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,479
And you ain't my brother.

750
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:28,205
Talk about Philadelphia.

751
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,086
Finding Greg.

752
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:40,993
He..

753
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:45,160
He said we arrested the wrong guy.

754
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:50,771
'Come to Philly. Help me find
the witness who saw everything'

755
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,233
Greg.

756
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,257
You got my message?

757
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:14,496
Yeah.

758
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,881
You already knew about Ramon.

759
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,009
He's not a credible witness.

760
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:21,298
No?

761
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:22,688
Why d'you drive him out of town?

762
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,252
Greg, be reasonable.

763
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,294
An innocent kid is sitting in jail!

764
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:27,663
This is a amazing!

765
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,878
I gave you,

766
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:31,074
the biggest case of your career 
and this is my thanks?

767
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,482
You gave me a mess.

768
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,605
This case is bogus.

769
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:36,057
You think those white kids 
are gonna confess?

770
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:37,643
You'll put this case away.

771
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:40,340
- We can both win here.
- Yeah, while that kid loses!

772
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,955
He ain't got no future.

773
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,871
We can change that, set this right!

774
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,546
It's too late for that.

775
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,080
I've got my phone.

776
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,294
Let's call the judge right now.

777
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:50,175
And screw our careers?

778
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,551
What's more important?

779
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,400
His life? Or our careers?

780
00:37:58,097 --> 00:38:00,895
- It's cold-blooded, Martin.
- Think it through, Greg.

781
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:03,401
You're the great political 
hope of New Haven.

782
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:06,175
People are talking about 
you being governor.

783
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:09,232
You're gonna chuck that for this dimwit?

784
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:12,628
Yeah. Guess I am.

785
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:15,196
Not with me in tow. / No?

786
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:17,194
What are you going to do?

787
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,821
Take me to an empty building?

788
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,516
