Hello.

12
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,261
Where are you from?

13
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,031
Medellin, Colombia.

14
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:10,217
Why are you here?

15
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,504
Visiting my boyfriend.

16
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:17,183
Third time in the last year.

17
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:19,146
He misses me.

18
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,860
Is this all your luggage?

19
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:25,562
Yes.

20
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:27,431
Are you carrying any drugs?

21
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,126
No.

22
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,296
Welcome to the United states.

23
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,195
- Hola, carino.
- Hola.

24
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,804
You look good.

25
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:13,449
Mentiroso. No, I don't.

26
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,083
Come on.

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,701
Let's hit the road.

28
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:01,132
Go! Go!

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,111
Narcotics said it's about a cold job?

30
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:06,670
Drug mule killed in '98, Ana Castilla.

31
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,780
Number one suspect was 
her handler, Ramiro.

32
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,618
- The guy inside.
- Disappeared for eight years.

33
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:13,290
Came back to Philly for 
his brother's wedding.

34
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,165
Lil, you remember Manny Fernandez,
my old boss at west. / Sure. Hi.

35
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,852
Me and Manny worked
the Cortez drug bust together.

36
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:22,668
Ramiro was Cortez's point man.

37
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,673
Nailing Cortez was the biggest
takedown of the '90s.

38
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,575
Your undercover job.

39
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,164
I didn't know you worked undercover.

40
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:34,274
Just the one job.
Ramiro's lackey.

41
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,018
So you knew the victim?

42
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:38,412
Ana. Yeah.

43
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,582
Alvaro?

44
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:59,372
Detective Valens.

45
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,591
You're a cop?

46
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,568
Yeah, I've been waiting
a long time to see you again.

47
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,676
Son of a bitch.
I trusted you!

48
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:06,336
Ah, don't break my heart here, Ramiro.

49
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:08,051
You moved the drugs the same as I did.

50
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,312
Ain't gonna be me rotting
in a prison cell though, is it?

51
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,929
What'd you do to Ana Castilla?

52
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:14,320
- I didn't do nothing to her.
- Right.

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,726
Who cares about a dumb bitch mule?

54
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,617
- Let's go, pal.
- I did.

00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:05,899
Undercover, huh?

70
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,787
Uh, yeah.

71
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:10,289
Seems like something 
that would've come up.

72
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:14,655
Also went to soccer camp as a kid.
I ever mention that?

73
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,745
Yeah, but the Cortez bust,
that was huge.

74
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:20,625
Would think you'd still be
bragging about it.

75
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,526
What'd you do for Ramiro?

76
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:26,401
I was a driver. Supposed to find out 
the chain of command.

77
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:32,966
Ana Castilla. 22. Found stabbed and 
gutted outside of st. Abigail's church.

78
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,509
Died from a pellet bursting?

79
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,972
They cut her open to get the drugs?

80
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:37,388
That was the theory.

81
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:40,483
Ramiro was her boss,
and the number one suspect.

82
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,615
Job went cold when he skipped town.

83
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,734
But now he's back, and on our turf.

84
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,210
And you knew Ana?

85
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,896
I picked up the girls at the airport,
brought them to Ramiro.

86
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:51,508
You get Ana all three of her trips?

87
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,485
Yeah, we talked.
Connected, I guess.

88
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,377
- This was gonna be her last run.
- Oh, yeah?

89
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:00,432
She was 24 hours away 
from getting out,

90
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:01,873
going home to Colombia.

91
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,191
You see her the day she died?

92
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,873
Yeah.

93
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,095
You never brought flowers before.

94
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:20,367
Well, there was a lady
selling them outside.

95
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:24,006
Never kissed me before either.

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,605
Just making it look good.

97
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:38,473
You must be fighting
with your real girlfriend.

98
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,992
- What makes you say that?
- I'm right, yeah?

99
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,930
Yeah, she wants a wedding date.

100
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,439
And I don't know what the rush is.

101
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,096
You should be happy
you have someone, Alvaro.

102
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,426
I just don't see doing that
till I want kids.

103
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,137
When's that?

104
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:04,849
40, maybe.

105
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,574
You're like my sister Sofia.

106
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,501
We call her la princesa 
because she wants everything.

107
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,428
Asi?

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,447
What's that?

109
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,632
It's what I want.

110
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:26,460
Get a job for a big company in Bogota.

111
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,632
Work by a window with a nice view,

112
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,357
flowers on my desk.

113
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:35,254
Bet you could make that happen.

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,492
So you gonna stop this work?

115
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,597
I'm telling Ramiro tonight.

116
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,449
You know he won't let you go easy.

117
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,528
I know.

118
00:07:58,657 --> 00:07:59,868
Dropped her at the motel,

119
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:03,034
where they collect the goods
from the girls.

120
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,577
Next morning, her body's found.

121
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,056
You look into it at all?

122
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,317
Couldn't.
I was still on the job.

123
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,517
Maybe Ana didn't die
from a pellet bursting.

124
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:13,754
Maybe Ramiro killed her
because she wanted out.

125
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,018
Then why cut her open?

126
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,074
A warning to his other girls,

127
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,866
keep them in their place?

128
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,301
Narcotics just handed Ramiro
over to west.

129
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:25,679
- You can have a go at him.
- Yeah? Good.

130
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:43,028
That suit looks like
a Halloween costume on you.

131
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,498
Trick or treat, huh, Alvaro?

132
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:49,315
Forgot how funny you were.
And how stupid.

133
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:53,473
Weddings and funerals always bring back 
the dummies who are supposed to stay lost.

134
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:56,755
I figured eight years later you wouldn't 
still have your nose to the ground.

135
00:08:56,755 --> 00:09:00,448
But I guess you had it bad
for her, eh, Alvaro?

136
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,622
Don't call me that.

137
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:05,308
Hermano, I saw how you watched her.

138
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:10,684
Were you doing her the whole time?
Huh? Alvaro?

139
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,360
Did you hear me or not?

140
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,786
Why'd you cut up Ana?

141
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,194
She O.D. from the drugs inside her?

142
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:18,188
We got all 70 cookies, no problem.

143
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,148
So why's she gutted like a fish?

144
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:23,048
Someone sliced her,
make it look like me.

145
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,616
But I never touched her.

146
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:26,918
Ana wanted out.
She told you that, didn't she?

147
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,671
Por favor, they all talk big.
So what?

148
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,986
But this girl, 
good English, gutsy.

149
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,888
She was one of your best.

150
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,364
No way you were letting her go.

151
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:39,419
What happened, Ramiro?

152
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:42,546
She lost her mind.

153
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,807
That's what.

154
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,195
Tranquila.

155
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,734
You'll be okay 
when they're all out.

156
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,818
You felt like this, too?

157
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,692
For a little while.

158
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:04,429
- But I'm fine now, see?
- See

159
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,932
- I did this for my son.
- Yeah?

160
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:10,784
To get him out of jail.

161
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:13,758
His wife gave up on him.
He's a good boy.

162
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:16,928
He just needs another chance.

163
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:22,046
Ana.
You travel again in two months.

164
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:35,919
No, Ramiro.

165
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,960
This is my last run.

166
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:42,048
Oh, you decide now?

167
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,955
I have the money to help my sister.

168
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:45,994
But you haven't even been paid yet.

169
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:47,675
Yeah, I gave you all 70 cookies.

170
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:51,807
But you haven't been paid yet.

171
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:55,068
You don't need me.
You have lots of girls.

172
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,113
But not everyone can bluff like you.

173
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,474
Those big innocent eyes, huh?

174
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,448
- People believe your crap.
- I want out.

175
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,400
What matters is what I want!
You understand?

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,399
And I want to keep
the money from this trip,

177
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,769
you'll get it next time.

178
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,732
You can't keep me here.

179
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,355
Where will you go without this?

180
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,111
Come get it.

181
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,968
I came out in a few minutes.
She was gone.

182
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,491
Where could she go?
No money, no passport.

183
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:46,048
If you're smart like you,
you stay alive.

184
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,939
- She was dumb, so she's dead.
- She wasn't dumb.

185
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,568
Okay, she was a genius.
She's still dead.

186
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,663
You know what? Hmm?

187
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,331
You should have seen him with this Ana.

188
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,439
He was all over her.

189
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,996
He says she was just a friend.

190
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,269
And you believe what he says?

191
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,522
Do you think that he's never lied to you?

192
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,928
You didn't know him then.
I did.

193
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:17,243
We're done here.

194
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,282
So how many of them drug cookies
could one girl swallow?

195
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:28,799
Up to 80.

196
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,220
And they're each worth two
or three grand?

197
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,001
So every girl's carrying a quarter 
of a million bucks in her gut.

198
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,526
No wonder they open them up
if they die.

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,295
How did you do? / Talk to some of her 
drug buddies, think we got a lead.

200
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,977
There's a Colombian guy,
helps newcomers in the community.

201
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,353
El Ranchero.

202
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,557
- Also known as Father Peralta.
- A priest?

203
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:51,736
Who, in '98, told the cops he didn't know 
Ana, but her contacts say otherwise.

204
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:55,238
- Is that right?
- And guess what church he serves?

205
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,707
St. Abigail's.

206
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,702
Where Ana's body was found.

207
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,230
Local Columbians say you're 
known as El Ranchero, the rancher.

208
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,487
Because you wrangle the mules.
That some kind of joke?

209
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,376
I can't help what people call me.

210
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:20,642
But you do help these girls.

211
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,334
I do what I can.

212
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,357
You help a girl named Ana,
September '98?

213
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,940
Hard to forget that pretty face.

214
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,820
You know she ended up dead
behind your church.

215
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:40,314
I was new here,
was reaching out to these girls.

216
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:42,803
Figured it was someone warning 
me not to. / And?

217
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:46,226
I ignored it.
Help them still today.

218
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,291
What'd you do for Ana that night?

219
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,336
Gave her a place to stay,
sanctuary in the church.

220
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,965
Out of the kindness of your heart?

221
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:57,759
Saints, sinners,
I serve people in need.

222
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,518
But you didn't help the cops
solve her murder.

223
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:03,821
You said you didn't even
know Ana in '98.

224
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,464
These girls work for drug dealers.

225
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:10,327
Most of my parishioners are here illegally.

226
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,466
I'm not gonna deal with cops.

227
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,069
So what else did you lie about?

228
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,156
Are you suggesting I had
something to do with Ana dying?

229
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,847
Did you?

230
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:23,686
I was administering last rites
at a hospital that night in Cobbs creek.

231
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:25,748
Anyone else here with Ana?

232
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,501
There was another girl in hiding, Ceci.

233
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,864
Know where we can find Ceci?

234
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,646
I helped her get her job.

235
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,221
Philadelphia police.

236
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm just a housekeeper, and I have all 
my papers. Miss Caroline can tell you.

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,984
We're here about Ana
Castilla's murder, Ceci.

238
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,512
I, I heard they cut her up.

239
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:56,381
Yeah, but we're not sure
she was holding any drugs.

240
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:59,505
You know why someone 
might have done that?

241
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:02,826
I don't know.
It could be revenge. Girls are property.

242
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,267
Dealers don't like them getting away.

243
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:10,554
I was lucky this was all I got,
the first time I tried to run.

244
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,905
So how'd you finally get out?

245
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:16,529
After ten runs, my stomach
couldn't hold anything no more.

246
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,558
I was useless to them.

247
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:22,594
You were bunked up with Ana 
at the church, the night she died.

248
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:24,889
Those were bad times.

249
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,906
Well, looks like things have improved.

250
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,754
No, my boss gives me her hand-me-downs.

251
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,256
What do you remember about Ana that night?

252
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:37,867
How she was a nice girl,
trying to help her little sister.

253
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,495
She was wound up.

254
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,078
Running for your life will do that.

255
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:43,534
She talk to you about Ramiro?

256
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,826
That's all she talked about.

257
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,819
How she had to make it home.

258
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:03,637
After the first run,
I bought my parents a car.

259
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,687
Sofia wanted to know
where I got the money.

260
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,056
Did you tell her?

261
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:10,689
No. She looks up to me.

262
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:17,006
It pays good.
Being a secretary?

263
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:22,043
If I could get a job like that,
I could put her in school.

264
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:26,048
I bet you could get a job, too.

265
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,510
I don't want to go back there.

266
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:35,463
Besides I'm going to Miami soon
with my boyfriend.

267
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,160
What are you waiting for?

268
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,343
He's caught up, too, you know?
He's trying to get out, like us.

269
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:46,314
Oh, yeah?
Are you okay?

270
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:53,257
I quit using when I got here.
Father Peralta's rules.

271
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:58,748
Ceci, digame, what's Miami like?

272
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:05,365
Nightclubs, music, sun...

273
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,455
sun all of the time.

274
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,579
Oh, my god, Ana.

275
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,216
How did you get away
from Ramiro tonight?

276
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,391
I ran.

277
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:21,576
Left a new lady there.
She was sick.

278
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,036
If a pellet opened,
there's nothing you can do.

279
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:25,692
she's gonna die 
if you're there or not.

280
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,638
But maybe I can get her out,
get her to a doctor.

281
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,794
He would never let you.

282
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,381
Besides, you can't go back.

283
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:42,637
I stole two cookies.

284
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,635
What?

285
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:47,532
- Let me see.
- I hid them.

286
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,896
- Ramiro's gonna kill you, Ana.
- No.

287
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:54,502
He's going to give me
my passport for them.

288
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:00,806
I tried to help her,
but she was crazy.

289
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:03,327
- She went back to the motel.
- Back to Ramiro?

290
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,093
She had that, that trade
stuck in her head.

291
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,676
The pellets for her passport?

292
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:12,147
I wonder if her sister ever
knew how much Ana wanted to help her.

293
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:13,946
Was that the last time
you saw her, Ceci?

294
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,856
She went.

295
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:19,969
She never came back.

296
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:26,832
You lied to us, Ramiro.

297
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:29,970
Look who's talking.
Never saw a guy hustle good as you.

298
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,017
Ana stole two cookies from you.
Came back to the motel to barter.

299
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,832
You were a natural on the street,
you know why?

300
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,275
Yeah, I know you killed her.
You'd cut a girl up for a lot less.

301
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:43,384
You got a criminal nature, is why.
You loved it out there in the dirt.

302
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,798
Not like now.

303
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,886
Choking on that tie.
You're so shined up,

304
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,155
- there's nothing left of you.
- You bought my act, Ramiro.

305
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:50,986
- It's your bad. 
- That's right. I bought it.

306
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,556
So did the whole crew.

307
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:56,825
You were damn good at lying
to the people you was with every day.

308
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,234
Talk trash all you want.
It don't change what you did.

309
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,678
Why you care so much about this girl?

310
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,596
We ain't talking about me.

311
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,742
She came back to trade you the drugs
for her money and passport.

312
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:10,795
Is that when the knife came out?

313
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:14,342
She came, but without the drugs.

314
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,050
So I couldn't kill her.

315
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:23,355
- Where's Delia?
- Done.

316
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:26,533
- Where are the cookies?
- I didn't bring them.

317
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,940
I want my passport and a thousand dollars,
and then you'll get them.

318
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,023
Why you think you can call the shots, huh?

319
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:37,602
Because I got something you want,
hidden somewhere you'll never find.

320
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:39,107
Not how it works.

321
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:41,813
We do the deal, and I go.

322
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:47,125
Ramiro. Got them all.
Minus the busted one.

323
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,288
Oh, god. Delia?

324
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,345
Stop walking unless
you want to be next.

325
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:56,454
She died.
You know how it goes.

326
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,922
Padre!

327
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,804
Ramiro, open it!

328
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,303
Ramiro, open it!

329
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,634
Open it.

330
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,849
Valos.

331
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,403
She's coming with me.

332
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:29,713
Father Peralta?
What's he doing there?

333
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:32,081
He's looking out for his newest girl.

334
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,371
And I'm the fool who actually fears god.

335
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:36,117
What's that mean, his newest girl?

336
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:41,300
You think that he took care of young, 
pretty girls just for heaven points? No.

337
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,906
He's getting something back,
and it wasn't nothing holy.

338
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,335
Ana wouldn't do that.

339
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:49,634
She put 70 lumps of heroin in her gut.

340
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:53,684
She wouldn't do something naughty 
for a night of safety? Come on, Alvaro.

341
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,336
Sure she would.

342
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:01,277
...before she died.

343
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:06,072
We know you're not pals with the cops.

344
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:08,923
But that needs some explaining.

345
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,166
I went there to protect her.

346
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,934
was this still out of
the goodness of your heart?

347
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:21,007
Or did you have something else in mind?

348
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,249
- Like what?
- Young girls.

349
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,314
No money, no family, no nothing.

350
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:29,462
Who better to get an off-the-record
piece of tail from?

351
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,435
But maybe Ana wouldn't go for it.

352
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:35,705
Maybe she didn't think a man of the cloth
should be trying to get in her pants.

353
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:40,487
And maybe she threatened to expose 
the big community hero as a scumbag.

354
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,316
Have I sinned in my past?

355
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:48,543
Yes. We all have.

356
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:51,662
Priests are supposed to aim higher
than the average slob.

357
00:21:51,662 --> 00:21:54,278
My church is in a war zone,

358
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:58,323
filled with desperate people.
They sin to stay alive.

359
00:21:58,323 --> 00:21:59,683
You want to do some good for them?

360
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:02,327
You get your hands dirty
if you have to.

361
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,391
For the greater good.

362
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,377
So it's okay to hit on her.

363
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,571
I didn't.
Not Ana.

364
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:12,275
That girl brought out the best in me.

365
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:17,400
Talk about the motel.

366
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,641
I got her out of there.

367
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:28,867
Back to safety.
At least for the night.

368
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,467
I told Delia she would be okay.

369
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,230
It wasn't your fault.

370
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,306
But I knew she was dying and I lied.

371
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,297
It wasn't a lie.

372
00:22:56,353 --> 00:23:00,199
It wasn't a lie.
It was hope.

373
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,811
Ana, you have to leave.

374
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,947
- But you said I'm safe here.
- Yes. For tonight.

375
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:21,200
But he will come here tomorrow.

376
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,106
- Looking for you.
- He still has my passport.

377
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:26,335
Forget that.

378
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:29,925
Forget going home?

379
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,518
Then I'll find work here.

380
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,969
- I'll send money to Sofia to bring her over.
- Ramiro will find you here.

381
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:47,182
I have the pellets.

382
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:50,145
- Maybe I can get money for them...
- I can't help you with that.

383
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,708
They're worth a lot.

384
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,736
Forget the drugs.
Forget the money.

385
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:57,394
It's time for you to save yourself.

386
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,085
Now we have to find you a place to stay.

387
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,178
There is someone I can call.

388
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,794
She used the rectory phone.

389
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,609
Left a few minutes later.

390
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:43,163
- Who'd she call?
- All I heard was his name, Alvaro.

391
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:49,578
Alvaro.

392
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:53,377
- Isn't that...
- Scotty. Yeah.

393
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:56,986
What's up?

394
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:02,175
Close the door, Scotty.

395
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:12,169
We know you talked
to Ana later that night.

396
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,256
No, I didn't.

397
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:16,336
The priest overheard a conversation.

398
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,001
I just said it didn't happen.

399
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:23,528
Do you think I'm lying to you, boss?

400
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,414
Lil?

401
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:28,232
Why'd she have your number, Scotty?

402
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:30,592
My number?
No, she...

403
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,300
It's because, um...

404
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:55,617
I screwed up.

405
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:03,255
I got in with her.

406
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,492
Those car trips.

407
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:10,341
We'd talk.

408
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,722
And...

409
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,156
- she got into my head.
- Was she a girlfriend, Scotty?

410
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:22,524
No. I didn't do that.
Look, she didn't want much.

411
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,220
To get home to Colombia.

412
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,852
Get a clerical job,
put her sister in school.

413
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,056
- Did you tell her you were a cop?
- No, absolutely not.

414
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,584
Did she know?

415
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:34,868
She figured me out.

416
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,396
- I didn't deny it.
- Right.

417
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,118
Look, I guess part of me
wanted her to know.

418
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:50,181
Wanted her to call me.

419
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:52,743
So I could save her.

420
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:06,186
You drive fast.

421
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:09,166
It's the only speed I know.

422
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,098
You like the rush.

423
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,494
- Don't you?
- Nah.

424
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:15,641
- What?
- Come on.

425
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,124
When you're lying to that
ball-buster customs cop,

426
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:23,816
and all those drug dogs
are sniffing at you,

427
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:26,198
and then he finally waves you on through,

428
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:28,095
how do you feel?

429
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,806
Great.

430
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:31,593
Yeah, it feels great.

431
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,799
Because it's a rush, right?

432
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,173
That's what I'm talking about.

433
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:39,053
I pretend I'm someone else
when I talk to them.

434
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,764
Someone who's not scared.

435
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,979
And it works.

436
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:46,967
You do the same thing?

437
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:54,285
I took your phone, Alvaro.
Last trip.

438
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,084
I thought I'd lost it at work.

439
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,768
I saw the names on it.

440
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:03,618
I know who you really are.
It makes sense. / Ana...

441
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:06,155
That you're more  than just this driver.

442
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:09,643
Look, Ana, don't talk about it.
I mean it!

443
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,888
Ready?

444
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,415
Will you give me your phone number?

445
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:36,334
I can't.

446
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:39,021
So this is good-bye, then.

447
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:44,126
It's been good.

448
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,770
Talking.

449
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:55,382
Be nice to your girlfriend.
She won't wait till you're 40.

450
00:28:58,174 --> 00:29:00,123
Ana...

451
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,456
Only if you're in trouble.

452
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,964
Now you know why
I don't talk about it.

453
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:36,215
I was no good.

454
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:41,623
I didn't have the discipline
to not get involved.

455
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,208
You should have told us, Scotty.

456
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:47,548
I didn't think it mattered. I hoped it didn't 
matter, because she never called.

457
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:49,128
But she did call.

458
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,382
I never talked to her.

459
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:53,866
What number did you give her?

460
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:56,474
My undercover line at west.

461
00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:59,578
If you didn't answer it, who did?

462
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:03,894
Only could have been my boss.

463
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,654
Manny.

464
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,533
Hey, something new on the case?

465
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:19,931
Yeah.

466
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:23,078
- Ana called me that night.
- And?

467
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:27,974
- And she got you.
- What? / Do not lie to me.

468
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:31,965
The Cortez case is in, Manny.
We can talk safely.

469
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:36,138
Okay.

470
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:41,198
Yeah. She called for Alvaro.
Said he gave her his number.

471
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:44,474
I knew that had to be wrong,

472
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:47,005
because Scotty Valens wouldn't
make a dumb move like that.

473
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:49,374
- How could you not tell me?
- How could I?

474
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:52,383
- You were protecting the Cortez bust.
- That's right.

475
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,227
That was our job, Scotty.
You took your eye off the ball.

476
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:56,667
Yeah, I did.

477
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:59,074
She was a drug runner, part of his 
operation. we were trying to bring down.

478
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,624
But you sent her to die, Manny!

479
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:03,997
And I wouldn't have had to
if you didn't screw up!

480
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:08,991
I was cleaning up your mess.

481
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,981
What did you tell Ana when she called?

482
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,342
- I said no Alvaro here.
- She leave it at that?

483
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,465
No, she said, "I know where 
the station is. I'm coming there."

484
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:19,314
- Ana showed up at west?
- If she was seen there,

485
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:22,610
Cortez would've closed ranks,
our bust would have been screwed.

486
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,391
I had to head her off at the pass.

487
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,031
Ana.

488
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,386
Who are you?

489
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:40,490
I talked to you on the phone.

490
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,700
I need Alvaro!

491
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,967
- There's no Alvaro here.
- Please.

492
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,417
There's a car following me.
It's him.

493
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:51,114
- Who?
- Ramiro.

494
00:31:58,135 --> 00:31:59,514
You must have got a wrong number.

495
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:02,212
No! Alvaro knows me!

496
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,991
Please! I'm trying to stay alive!

497
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,143
I can't help you.

498
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:09,502
Don't send me away.
Arrest me! Put me in jail!

499
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:11,382
You'll be okay.

500
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:13,496
They're gone now.

501
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:17,908
Por favor.

502
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:21,448
Please.

503
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:37,922
You think I wanted to do that?

504
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,834
Think I got no heart?

505
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,950
- No.
- Tough choices, Scotty.

506
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,737
You get your hands dirty
if you have to.

507
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:48,881
For the greater good.

508
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:51,356
You get a look at this girl in the car?

509
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:56,274
Yeah. Black hair, blonde streaks, 
hopped up.

510
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,190
Nice spot.

511
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,170
I killed this girl.

512
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,163
Come on.

513
00:33:41,163 --> 00:33:44,049
I shouldn't have done that job.

514
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:46,060
I can't keep my boundaries.

515
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,023
Look, you give a damn.

516
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,754
Makes you a great cop in most situations.

517
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:54,330
I do this over and over.

518
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,535
You saw me last year with Christina,
so damn sloppy.

519
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,192
You were screwed up last year.

520
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:04,007
I wasn't screwed up in '98.

521
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:08,830
If I'd just been careful,

522
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,019
- kept things clean...
- What?

523
00:34:13,562 --> 00:34:17,318
A girl swallowing drugs
to get a better life?

524
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:19,549
She was doomed.

525
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,902
You couldn't have saved her.

526
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:25,991
I got bad habits.

527
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:29,254
I got to change.

528
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,913
So who was driving the car, Ceci?

529
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,347
The night Ana died.
Blue SUV, headlights off, following her.

530
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,761
- You were in the passenger seat.
- No. It wasn't me.

531
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:46,056
That ain't gonna fly, Ceci.
A cop picked you out of a photo spread.

532
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:49,524
You were a junkie, and you knew 
Ana had two cookies somewhere.

533
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:51,786
You'd been in that church
for two days without a fix.

534
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:53,779
You'd have done anything to get some.

535
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:56,310
Two pellets of pure heroin would 
have been worth following her for.

536
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,541
- Worth killing for.
- No.

537
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,961
Who was driving the car?!

538
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:04,785
Talk about that, maybe we make a deal.

539
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:09,248
What kind of deal?

540
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,112
Lighter sentence.

541
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,720
- How light?
- Talk.

542
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:28,010
My boyfriend.

543
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,975
He have a habit, too?

544
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:37,878
I told him she had two pellets,
and he said, "let's go find her."

545
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:40,954
I was just trying to get to Miami.

546
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:42,959
The sun.

547
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,340
Ana!

548
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:12,414
- I thought it was Ramiro.
- I saw you leave the church.

549
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:15,980
- Ceci, I'm so scared.
- It's okay. My boyfriend will help us.

550
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,421
- We'll drive all the way to Miami.
- Veras? / Come on.

551
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:24,048
Thank you, Ceci.

552
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,628
- You have the cookies, right?
- No.

553
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:29,179
- We have to get them.
- Forget it, it's too dangerous.

554
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:32,808
No, Ana. Where are they?

555
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,887
No.

556
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,099
You're the one who cut Delia.

557
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:42,351
Tell us where they're at.

558
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:44,360
I looked everywhere
you could've put them.

559
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,590
- We need them, Ana.
- Oh, Ceci...

560
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,805
Where are they?

561
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:52,342
What about Miami?

562
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:55,065
We can go.
If you just tell us where you...

563
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:57,767
- You swallowed them.
- No.

564
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:02,649
If they ain't at the church,
where else are they going to be?

565
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:05,731
- I didn't swallow them.
- Yes, you did!

566
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:09,610
You think that we won't get them?

567
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,690
Give them to us, Ana.
You know what can happen.

568
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:19,078
You'll kill me.
