The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event

2
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,277
December 1, 2001

3
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:13,844
Mrs Edino, I'm gonna put in
an extra side of roasted peppres for you

4
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:16,446
Oh, Ricardo made them?

5
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,209
She won't eat my peppers any more

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,326
Even if they're free
it has to be you made 'em

7
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:22,715
Sorry, Frank

8
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,937
- Oh, there you are
- Hey, Dad

9
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,139
Tommy, see if there's any meat sauce

10
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:34,510
- The spicy stuff
- OK

11
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,898
Did I tell you about
the night classes Tommy's takin'?

12
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,075
Computers at the junior college?

13
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:42,079
The kid's just in high school
but he's thinkin' ahead

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,432
- College level classes
- Oh, he's a smart guy

15
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:48,155
Frank, my daughter has
a friend you'll like

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:52,503
- A divorcee but very slender
- I'm real busy

17
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:55,877
Oh, Lydia, God rest her soul,
has been gone over a year

18
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,425
It's time, Frank, you need a wife!

19
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,998
Have a good day, ladies

20
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,881
Hey, why not go on a date?

21
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:08,224
I'm busy, that's why

22
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,093
Hey, there you go, King

23
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,845
That dog is the wife

24
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:17,682
Hey, can it, you two

25
00:01:56,676 --> 00:02:01,717
CLOSED
Dec '01
DiCenzio, F

26
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:12,150
Heard a rumor that Kat Miller
from narcotics is coming to homicide

27
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,482
Where'd you hear that?

28
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,773
I've got sources

29
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,875
Detectives!

30
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,359
Gabby Wise, Public Deffender's
Remember me?

31
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,672
Oh, the Lopez case Sure

32
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:25,322
This is Paulo Munoz

33
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,656
- Lilly Rush
- Mucho gusto

34
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:29,880
Scott Valens Mucho gusto

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,692
Paulo's brother Ricardo was convicted of
robbing and killing his boss back in 2001

36
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,000
I represented him

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,144
But Ricardo, he did not do this crime

38
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,230
That is why I come here
To help

39
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,849
The trial was four years ago

40
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,721
It took Paulo that long
to get through the post 9/11 customs maze

41
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,014
Where are you from, Paulo?

42
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:48,821
El Salvador

43
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:52,003
Ricardo has money when the police come
so they say he robs

44
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,290
Where'd he get that cash?

45
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,602
He lives with 6 men in a basement

46
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,565
So he holds his money on his body

47
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:00,380
No other place is safe

48
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,946
Ricardo sent me a letter,
before Frank dies

49
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,489
Says Frank is scared

50
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:06,912
Scared of what?

51
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,679
He didn't have it at trial but Ricardo
always said that someone

52
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,188
broke into Frank's apartment
before he was killed

53
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,231
You follow up on it?

54
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:19,046
No The thing is
I was hoping you could take this over

55
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:21,338
It's our job to put people back in jail,

56
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,644
not get them out

57
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:24,222
Ricardo was my first murder case,

58
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:27,092
I was overwhelmed and I really think
I failed him

59
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:30,987
He deserves more this time
More than I can give him

60
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:33,571
Tienes hermanos?

61
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,316
What is he asking?

62
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:39,251
If I got brothers
Yeah I do

63
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:45,361
- Paulo, the detective's really busy
- I know Ricardo inside

64
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:48,047
Same as you know your brothers

65
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,221
He's innocent

66
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,921
Can you help me?

67
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,829
Help my brother

68
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,280
We can try

69
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,893
- What is this?
- Could he be alone?

70
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:59,831
Hey! This baby belong to anybody?

71
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:04,552
Maybe someone went inside
for a minute?

72
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:08,120
Who leaves a baby sittin' alone?

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,572
Let's talk to the desk

74
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,765
- Hey, Dubitsky
- Yeah

75
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:23,612
Some idiot left their kid
just outside the entrance

76
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,358
Well the main elevator's broke

77
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,586
Maybe they didn't want to
lug it up the stairs

78
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:30,756
It?
You mean the baby?

79
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:33,406
Just keep an eye on him
until whoever parked him comes back

80
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,668
Oh, no
No, don't make me the chump

81
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,249
Look, I'm sure you'll handle it just fine

82
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,399
And when they show up,

83
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,943
you tell them
they're lucky we didn't call DHS

84
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:52,884
Frank DiCenzio, 49,
owned the deli where Ricardo Munoz worked

85
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,531
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma

86
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:57,423
Some kind of adhesive residue
on the wounds,

87
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,661
weapon was a long flat object,
never recovered

88
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,567
Ricardo Munoz had no alibi,
had access to the deli

89
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,391
and a thousand dollars on him
when the police found him

90
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,889
About the same amount they figured
was missing from the till

91
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,721
The guy couldn't get a bank account

92
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,973
Lived with 6 guys in tight quarters
so he kept the cash on him

93
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,511
He sent it to his wife and kids
every month

94
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:18,804
It's the same as my granddad

95
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:20,372
Letter's in Spanish

96
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,688
It says there was some kind of
break-in at Frank's apartment

97
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,500
Ricardo felt Frank was in danger

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,447
Frank report this break-in?

99
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:29,441
Uh, no Not sure why,
maybe Ricardo can tell us

100
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,673
You think Ricardo was railroaded, Scotty?

101
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:35,583
If we take away the robbery aspect,
motive's weak

102
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,114
Frank was his meal ticket

103
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,368
An illegal immagrant, alone, no money,

104
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:45,148
I just thought we could give
it another look

105
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:47,292
Let's see if we can get some traction
on this new information,

106
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,513
the break-in at Frank's

107
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:50,494
We'll talk to Ricardo up in Graterford

108
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,907
We're gonna need something solid
on this to keep goin' Of course

109
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:58,321
New detective comin' in today,
Kat Miller from narcotics

110
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,026
How'd you meet Frank?

111
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:16,833
I came here because I heard
there's more jobs than in New York

112
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,551
But for months, nothing

113
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:21,408
Then I saw a help sign
in Frank's Deli's window

114
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,869
And how'd you two get along?

115
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,662
First he was a good boss

116
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:26,665
Then he was a good friend

117
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,253
Never any fights
between the two of you?

118
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:31,010
Never
He always helped me

119
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,503
Always listened to me

120
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:35,268
Why would I kill Frank?

121
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:39,011
Your letter said Frank had a break-in,
right before he died

122
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,224
It was not just a break-in
It was an attack

123
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,475
I told police but no one cared about it

124
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,028
An attack?

125
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,216
On who?

126
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,581
It was two weeks before he died

127
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,705
Ah, made too much food

128
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,489
I thought with the holidays comin' up
we'd be busier

129
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,748
Tomorrow there will be more people

130
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,943
Your pasta salad is bad, boss

131
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:13,501
Too much garlic

132
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:18,164
What you don't know
about pasta salad is a lot

133
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:28,070
King sleeps like an old man

134
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,738
Wanna stay,
Have some dinner?

135
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:38,044
I see you all day

136
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:40,218
Come on, sit down

137
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:44,770
Tommy's in school at night,
it'd be nice to have company

138
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,536
How's the family?

139
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:47,677
You called them today, right?

140
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,899
My daughter is angry with me now,

141
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,718
because I am so far away

142
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:58,841
She's too young to understand
that everything we do is for out kids

143
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:09,630
King? King?
You here buddy?

144
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:12,073
King

145
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:17,068
Oh, my God

146
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,985
What the hell happened to you?

147
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:22,529
- Frank, he needs a hospital
- Yeah

148
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,702
Yeah, there's a vet
on the boulevard open all night

149
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:30,086
Who
Who would've done this?

150
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,091
- Let me help you, OK?
- OK

151
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,976
Alright King,
Let's go buddy

152
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,964
When I tell them,

153
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:41,050
the police say it's just a dog

154
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,384
But Frank thought it was
someone trying to mess with him

155
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,702
Scare him

156
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,279
And did he have any idea who?

157
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,772
He said he didn't know

158
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:49,956
Why didn't Frank report it?

159
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,299
Nothing was broken
Nothing gone

160
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,320
And the door was locked

161
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,919
So it wasn't really a break-in
Someone had a key

162
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,003
What about his son?
Tommy

163
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:04,112
Frank said someboday else
got a key somehow

164
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:06,723
And what'd you think?

165
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,524
Tommy was the only one
I knew with a key

166
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:12,513
What makes you so sure
this was connected to Frank's death?

167
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,886
Two bodies in two weeks

168
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,738
Beaten and beaten

169
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:20,971
Like someone can not stop

170
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,583
My dad was like
the mayor of Oxford Circle

171
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,614
Everybody loved the guy

172
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,408
Were you surprised
when Ricardo was arrested?

173
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,071
At first, yeah

174
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,799
My dad was always good to him

175
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,820
It makes me sick
just thinkin' about that lowlife

176
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,826
Why're you guys askin'?

177
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,327
We're maybe reopening the case

178
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:51,806
See anything the night your father died?

179
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:54,498
No, I had a junior college class

180
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:57,790
It was supposed to help me
get an edge career-wise

181
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,337
See how much good that did me

182
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:03,048
We heard someone got into the apartment
two weeks before your dad died

183
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:04,569
Beat the dog up pretty bad

184
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,894
That's got nothing to do
with what happened to my dad

185
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,034
- Trust me
- How do you know that?

186
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,619
- I know, OK?
- How, Tommy?

187
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:15,351
Thank God for the all night vet

188
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,897
The cat went out on to our balcony

189
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:20,064
and PS, we're on the third floor
so I figure,

190
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,356
she's not gonna jump

191
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:25,299
- The cat jumped?
- Worse She fell

192
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:29,848
How stupid does a cat have to be for that?

193
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:31,665
What happened to yours?

194
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:34,311
I think someone got into our apartment

195
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,180
- Went after King
- They hit the dog?

196
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,224
Bad
The vet's operatin' on him now

197
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,770
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry

198
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,194
Dad
What happened?

199
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:49,147
King's in pretty bad shape Tommy

200
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,168
It could be a while till we hear anything

201
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,779
- I can stay
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me

202
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,242
Why is Stump even here?

203
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,132
I thought you said we were gonna hang
after you saw your dad

204
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,492
He said King's in pretty bad shape

205
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,042
Come on,
that mutt got what it deserved

206
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,536
What did you just say?

207
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:07,119
Nothin', Mr DiCenzio

208
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:08,541
It's all good

209
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:13,024
You stay the hell away
from my son and my dog

210
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,639
I told you

211
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,208
I don't want you hangin' around
with this punk

212
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,004
You understand?

213
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,987
Wuss

214
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,436
I haven't talked to Stump in years

215
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:34,781
I can see why

216
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,216
The guy sounds a little psycho

217
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,905
My dad always hated him

218
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,549
You know, said his mom was a druggie,

219
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,894
whole family was trouble

220
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,749
Sounds like Frank thought Stump
beat the dog / Yeah, he did

221
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:47,195
The worst part is he could've been right

222
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:50,310
How'd Stump get into the apartment?

223
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,872
I didn't have a lot of friends
after my mom died,

224
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,510
Stump was it

225
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,503
I gave him a set of keys so he'd have
a place to hang out afternoons

226
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,053
To do what?

227
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,174
He got girlfriends

228
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:04,822
And your father always worked

229
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:08,815
Look, Stump was a messed up dude
and yeah he might've hit the dog

230
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:10,849
but there's no way in hell
he hurt my dad,

231
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:14,435
he wouldn't do that,
he was my friend

232
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:22,149
So this kid Stump beat up the dog?

233
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,505
Well, sounds like it

234
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,253
But Tommy was real insistent
Stump didn't kill Frank

235
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:27,873
Maybe a little too insistent

236
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,757
If Stump did it,
Tommy'd feel responsible,

237
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,083
it'd be tough to face

238
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,766
Nick "Stump" Fanelli's just out of jail

239
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,769
Got a rap sheet a mile long

240
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,385
Beat a neighbor with a baseball bat,

241
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:45,646
whole list of other assaults dating
back to December 2001

242
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:48,613
Right after Frank's murder

243
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,363
Detective I'm headin' out

244
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:01,800
No one claimed this kid

245
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,623
What? How's that possible?

246
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:06,397
Maybe because
there's so much good in the world?

247
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:09,127
Nanette from records,
put this bag together,

248
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:09,945
said to give it to you

249
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,935
Hey, hey hey, shh

250
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,480
Hey, I'm gonna call DHS right now

251
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,617
Right now

252
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:21,398
Detective Vera, hey, Kat Miller

253
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:25,337
- Yeah, real busy
- Oh, busy, yeah

254
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,801
Cute kid you got

255
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,449
How are you Lieutenant?

256
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:38,930
Detective Miller, welcome

257
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,310
Dress code's a step up from narcotics

258
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,587
Guess I'd better shop

259
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,986
The clothes are more expensive
but the pay's the same

260
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:46,191
Welcome to homicide

261
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:48,195
On the plus side there are
all the dead bodies

262
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:49,496
And the long hours

263
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:52,206
I hope you cleared your social calendar

264
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:56,904
I just got this thing I do
Wednesday's at 7:00 / OK

265
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:59,176
Can't miss it

266
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,661
Fair enough

267
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:04,356
Find a pigeon hole and fill this out,
I'll get you goin'

268
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:08,459
It's biographical info for personal records

269
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:18,227
I'm real glad to be here Lieutenant
Thanks

270
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,172
Hey, I've been staight
since I got out of jail

271
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:39,385
For a whole two weeks, huh, Stump?

272
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,522
Come on

273
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,286
What'd I do to deserve a visit?

274
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:46,696
Remember a buddy of yours,
Tommy DiCenzio?

275
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,044
Yeah, of course,
we met in computer class for JC retards

276
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:54,463
Well you remember the family dog,
big mutt, wouldn't hurt a fly

277
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:57,090
Somebody beat him up
pretty bad back then

278
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,028
Heard maybe it was you

279
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:01,640
You're here to ask me about a dog?

280
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,139
What are you the canine police?

281
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,023
Where were you the night
Frank DiCenzio was killed?

282
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:08,936
Whoa! I was at class

283
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,523
You check it out
and you'll see yourself

284
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:14,735
And look even if I did hit that dog
I didn't kill Frank

285
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:18,472
That Spanish guy he's upstate for that

286
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:21,535
We're takin' another look at the case

287
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:24,560
If the guy didn't do it with his own hands,
don't mean he wasn't responsible

288
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,589
What're you talkin' about?

289
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,596
Ricardo he brought some serious trouble
into that deli, I saw it myself

290
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:42,719
Where's Ricardo, chummy?

291
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,117
He ain't here, Felix

292
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,285
And he said he's gonna
pay you so lay off

293
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,964
Due date's long past

294
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:52,204
and I have to keep stict rules
about that you know

295
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:54,288
Give the guy a break

296
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:56,342
He's just tryin' to bring his family here

297
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,072
I'm a business man like you

298
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:02,595
My business is Felix's best

299
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,224
Ricardo pays me soon

300
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,045
or I start givin' out penalties

301
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,502
- That's how I keep my business running
- Yeah?

302
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,709
And I call the cops and I tell them
what you do to these people

303
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:18,882
No you won't 'cause they'll just
pull Ricardo back to El Salvador

304
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:22,222
You're just lowlife scum preyin'
on other people's predicaments

305
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:24,025
Oh, that's very insulting, Frank

306
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,243
I heard what you did to Ricardo's roommate,

307
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:31,517
knockin' out his teeth,
breakin' his jaw, you're a sick bastard

308
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,712
I don't get my money,

309
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:37,431
then there's two of you
I'm gonna take care of now

310
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:50,043
Who was this guy Felix?

311
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:51,330
I'd never seen him before

312
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,896
but he was a bad ass, I'll tell you that

313
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,066
Tell anyone about it?

314
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,518
Nah

315
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:58,934
Frank, he was on my case
all the time back then so I,

316
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:02,783
I figured he deserved
a little heat comin' his way

317
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:08,054
OK, Stump
We'll be in touch

318
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,943
Well I'll be right here

319
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:15,031
'Cause where else am I gonna go?

320
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:23,449
- Stump's alibi clear?
- Yup

321
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,576
Checked the attendance records,

322
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:27,019
both he and Tommy were in class
the night Frank was killed

323
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,456
And Ricardo was borrowing money
from this Felix guy, a loanshark?

324
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:31,791
Prestamista

325
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,643
They help illegals in the community
by givin' out loans

326
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:37,044
Some of 'em deal, too

327
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,421
Bad ones play by
intimidation and violence

328
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,761
Will you be able to track this guy down?

329
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,883
I made some calls, couldn't get a hit

330
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,904
The name Felix is kind
of common, I guess

331
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,095
Maybe reach out in the neighborhood
where Ricardo lived

332
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,043
Paulo could help with that,
he's stayin' there

333
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:52,251
Good
Get him to take you around

334
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,292
- Hey
- I was thinkin' I should stay

335
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:58,249
Keep an eye on the kid
'till DHS gets here

336
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:02,113
Last time I handed him off
Dubitsky gives him a stapler to play with

337
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,808
You wanna hit Francisville?

338
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:07,614
- Let's do it
- All right

339
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:24,636
The Bembe
I busted this place once

340
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:27,078
Ricardo's old neighbor would be here

341
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,808
I might run into some
old neighbors of my own

342
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,982
Where's your family from?

343
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,076
Dad's Cuban
Mom's Puerto Rican

344
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,741
Grew up about have a mile from here

345
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,650
Your family must be proud of you

346
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,108
I guess so, yeah

347
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,757
Alla

348
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:55,082
Felix

349
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:00,027
You Felix Darosa?

350
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,905
Yeah

351
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,534
We got a few questions for you

352
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,594
You guys aren't so good
for business, you know

353
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,102
So talk fast

354
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:10,858
You know a Ricardo Munoz?

355
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:13,609
Ricardo Munoz?

356
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:16,189
Got put away for murderin'
his boss, Frank DiCenzio

357
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,372
Owed you some money

358
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:19,717
I like to help sometimes when I can,

359
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,942
enrich my community
to the best of my ability

360
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,052
The thing is Felix,

361
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:26,318
we heard Frank's the one
who tried to help Ricardo out

362
00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:27,551
And you weren't happy

363
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,139
Said you'd have to take care of two people

364
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,129
Ricardo's in jail, Frank's dead

365
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,214
That's two people taken care of

366
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,462
Frank wasn't a problem to me

367
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:38,849
Him and Ricardo busted up
A bad divorce

368
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,387
And how do you know that?

369
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:43,931
'Cause I saw it with my own two eyes

370
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:46,901
He sido muy paciente
con tigo, ricardlito

371
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,066
Pero ahora me estoy enojando

372
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,536
Quepuedo hacer?
Digame

373
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:57,084
Por favor

374
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:06,986
Frankie

375
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,779
You forgot your keys

376
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,288
And you're supposed
to open up tomorrow

377
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,910
Everything OK, Frank?

378
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,163
I just saw you have the key
to my apartment on your key ring

379
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,912
Where'd you get this?

380
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,044
You give it to me,
when I start the job

381
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:24,724
No I gave you the key to the deli

382
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,811
I never gave you the key to my home

383
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:30,094
Then I don't know how it gets there

384
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:34,305
You took a long break that day
King got beat up

385
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:35,870
Did you go to my apartment, Ricardo?

386
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,861
No I was with you when we found him

387
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:42,111
But you were itchin' to get out of there
as soon as we came in

388
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:45,647
You always saying how I should
leave the dog at home, he gets in the way

389
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:49,331
Get out of here, Frank
This is crazy

390
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:51,627
We're done, Ricardo

391
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,054
- You're fired
- What?

392
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:58,425
I don't know who the hell you are

393
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,136
- He fired Ricardo?
- That's right

394
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,685
Ricardo say anything to you
about where he got the key to Frank's place?

395
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,948
Nothing

396
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:20,985
But two days later, he paid me back

397
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:22,531
The whole loan

398
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,340
So I got no reason to
bother anybody, you see

399
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,453
All worked out good for me

400
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,576
Sounds like Ricardo left out a major detail

401
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:37,701
Did you know they fought?
That Ricardo was fired? / No

402
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,059
This is the only way I could get this
whack-job to go to sleep

403
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,968
Well, he's sleeping pretty sound now

404
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,877
You should've seen it

405
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:03,201
The later it got, the more energy he had

406
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:05,496
It was nuts

407
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:10,887
You remember Lindsey?
Child Services / Sure Hey, Lindsey

408
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,486
Sorry we couldn't send
anybody last night

409
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,329
We had a group home crisis

410
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,214
But they found the mom

411
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,591
So where's she been
for the last 24 hours?

412
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:22,024
She had a double-shift at work,
the sitter canceled,

413
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:24,955
- her brother got the baby
- I guess he's troubled

414
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,906
Dumped him on the way
to a court appointment

415
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,375
She gave her son to a head case?

416
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:33,666
Well, we'll investigate
Make sure the home's OK

417
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,814
I hope so

418
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:50,700
It seems like you got
a knack for that stuff

419
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,129
One night and I'm fried

420
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:59,805
I'm glad Julie and I never had kids

421
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:09,228
You didn't tell me Frank fired you, Ricardo

422
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,099
It was not important
He took me back the next day

423
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,175
Well how about owin' money
to Felix Darosa

424
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:17,734
and him pushin' Frank around?
That not important either?

425
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:21,267
Frank talked to Felix?
I didn't know!

426
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:24,391
What else did'ya leave out
that might make you look bad? / Nothing!

427
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:26,346
Where'd you get the key to Frank's house?

428
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,124
I didn't know that key was there

429
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:31,383
You got pretty angry
when Frank started askin' about it

430
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:35,402
Felix was threatening me about money
and then Frank comes and accuses me!

431
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:39,699
I work hard every day,
day after day and it's never enough!

432
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:41,934
Is that why you snapped and killed Frank?

433
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,337
No! Frank took me back, I told you!

434
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,942
Well how'd you get the money to pay Felix?

435
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,902
Frank loaned it to me!

436
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,925
You got proof of that?

437
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:56,448
No

438
00:24:57,143 --> 00:25:01,326
And I come all the way out here again

439
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,848
- You just playin' me, ain't you?
- Wait

440
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,250
- Detective Valens!
- Open up

441
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,157
Por favor, the key, I promise you,

442
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,999
I didn't put it there
And Frank didn't

443
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:18,597
Only one other person could have

444
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:21,957
Tommy?

445
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,664
Hey Tommy

446
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:31,098
A couple questions popped up

447
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,337
We thought you could help

448
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:35,347
We found out there was a key
on Ricardo's key ring to your apartment

449
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:38,463
Any thoughts on how it got there?

450
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:43,396
Yeah I put it there

451
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:46,764
All these years I thought Ricardo was
the one who killed my dad

452
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:49,694
I wouldn't have done anything
to help the guy

453
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:51,714
but now you're saying
that he didn't do it

454
00:25:51,714 --> 00:25:53,228
Why'd you put the key there, Tommy?

455
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:55,736
It was when my dad was so obsessing
over who got in and hit the dog

456
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:57,360
And you knew it was Stump

457
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,909
- So you were protecting your friend?
- It's not just that,

458
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:02,162
I was trying to get Ricardo fired,

459
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,964
I mean, he was takin'
advantage of my dad

460
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,929
So you were watching out for you dad?

461
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,970
Nobody else was going to

462
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:14,555
Not easy Losin' a parent

463
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:17,797
Tryin' to take care of
the one you got left

464
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:20,590
After my mom died, it was like

465
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,888
he lost all his common sense
or something

466
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,625
- I mean, the people he picked
- Friends?

467
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,685
- Sorta
- Like who?

468
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:32,025
There was this one lady

469
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:35,274
- It doesn't really matter
- Well let us decide that

470
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:39,066
I was a little concerned about her

471
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:43,173
Tried to open his eyes

472
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,814
It's been a while since I went on a date

473
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:51,589
Should've bought a new suit

474
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:54,122
These pants got a little too small

475
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,486
Nobody wears suits anymore

476
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:59,514
I wear suits It's respectful

477
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:03,480
Maybe just a good sports jacket

478
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,054
I got a navy blue one with nice buttons

479
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:08,736
See if it's in the closet?

480
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:12,354
So you going out with that lady
Mrs Edino was talking about?

481
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:16,049
Nah, it's the one I met
at the vet Antonia

482
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,132
Lives right around the corner

483
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,179
- Her?
- Yeah

484
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,236
- You know her?
- Ain't she married?

485
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:25,218
Everytime I see her she's with this
big bruiser lookin' guy

486
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:27,133
No, she's seperated now

487
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,885
Well, Must've just happened,
Pretty soon to be dating

488
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,561
- For both of you
- Whoa

489
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,378
You're the one that said
I should go on a date

490
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:38,297
Yeah but I didn't think you'd do it

491
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:43,507
And this lady she's real loud and flashy

492
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:45,680
She's not like mom

493
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,059
No one's gonna be like your mom

494
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:53,692
She was one in a billion

495
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,696
Listen,

496
00:27:56,696 --> 00:28:00,956
I've been too wrapped up
in work since mom

497
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:03,475
I haven't been home enough

498
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:07,249
I'm sorry about that

499
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,951
Maybe we could start spending time

500
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:16,789
together again, like the old days

501
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:20,050
Yeah, we could do that
father-son hockey league again, maybe

502
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,975
There you go

503
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:28,091
Just, be careful, OK?

504
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:34,061
Don't worry about me, T
I'm fine

505
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:41,470
Is this Antonia the woman
your dad met at the animal hospital?

506
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,543
Yeah

507
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:44,460
What about this bruiser ex of hers?

508
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,661
What was his story?

509
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,532
It was some sort of loony,

510
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:50,338
You know, he stalked her after they split

511
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:52,450
They used to have these fights
in the streets

512
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,110
Antonia and your dad going out,
that rile up the crazy ex?

513
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,306
Something bad must've happened

514
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:01,172
He was home half an hour after he left

515
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,149
Never said a word about it

516
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:05,893
When did Frank go on this date?

517
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:09,373
A few days before he was killed

518
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:20,310
We asked around

519
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,578
Heard your ex-husband wasn't
the nicest guy, Antonia

520
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,117
Well that's the understatement
of the century

521
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,970
What'd Ray do this time?

522
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,576
Well that's what we're here to figure out

523
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:31,352
Did he have a problem
when you started dating?

524
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,618
Gave me a hard time
but he was the one who had two girlfriends

525
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:36,249
when I'd packed up my last suitcase

526
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,421
What's this about?

527
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:42,149
You remember Frank DiCenzio?

528
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,284
Of course I do

529
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:46,358
Do you think Ray might've
had a beef with Frank,

530
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:48,386
considering the two of you went out?

531
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,746
Trust me if Ray heard
about my date with Frank,

532
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,827
- he would've loved it
- Why's that?

533
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:56,260
'Cause it was a total friggin' disaster

534
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:04,207
Oh, you're sweet, you know that?

535
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,236
So how's King doing?

536
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,585
Better Got home a couple of days ago

537
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:15,724
Bootsie's doing better too but she's missing
all her front teeth which

538
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:18,924
PS is not a pretty picture

539
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:24,606
- Your son is Tommy, right?
- Yeah

540
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:27,004
Hard being a single parent, huh?

541
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:30,400
Caitlin wears me down sometimes

542
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,573
My wife, she was the one who knew
how to talk to Tommy

543
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:38,685
I try but I can't hold a family together
like she did

544
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:40,086
I'm gonna do better

545
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:42,978
Teenagers can be hard to handle

546
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:49,233
He had a tough time this year
But he's a good kid

547
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,617
I think I should tell you something
about his friend Stump / You know him?

548
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:57,872
I take Caitlin to skate on Monday nights,
see him and Tommy playing hockey

549
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:05,062
What? / The thing is, that kid Stump races
around the ice, bullies the smaller kids

550
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:10,762
Oh, you're mixin' him up with somebody else,
they got computer classes on Monday

551
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:13,479
I'm sure Frank

552
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,521
And I heard Stump stole money
from the snack stand,

553
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,649
beat up the kid who works there

554
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:21,723
Stump ain't that bad
Tommy wouldn't put up with it

555
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:25,441
I'm sorry if I

556
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,151
Let's just forget it
It's none of my business anyway

557
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,364
You're damn right
it's none of your business

558
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:36,937
Excuse me? / You don't know
what the hell you're talkin' about

559
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,788
I gotta get out of here

560
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,772
If my daughter was acting up
out of my sight,

561
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,156
I'd wanna hear about it
Some people don't I guess

562
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:54,989
So you saw Stump and Tommy
every week? / Yup

563
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:58,567
The poor kids on the ice were
scared to death of that Stump

564
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,350
Rink on Mondays, that means
they could sneak out of class somehow

565
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,144
There goes their alibis for
the night of Frank's murder

566
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:07,162
If Stump killed Frank,

567
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:10,214
you think Tommy would
protect him all this time?

568
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:14,142
He would if he thought
his life depended on it

569
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:21,978
Well it must've felt pretty good

570
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:23,996
Knockin' up that snack shop,
beatin' that kid up

571
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:26,143
The snack shop?

572
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,011
We took like 30 bucks,
it was no big deal

573
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:30,628
So maybe you tried movin' up

574
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:32,140
Stealin' from the deli

575
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,512
You break in meaning just to skim
a little cash but things go wrong

576
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,178
Maybe Frank walks in, catches you?

577
00:32:37,178 --> 00:32:40,643
Frank? I have nothing to do
with that, I told you

578
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,139
I was at class that night

579
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,774
No Stump, you weren't
You were sneakin' out playin' hockey

580
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:47,570
And residue on Frank's body
matches sports tape

581
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,085
The kind you put on a hockey stick

582
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:51,661
This isn't right
I've been gettin' on track

583
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,721
Well your past is catching up on you

584
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:57,389
It's not my past, it's his

585
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,209
- His?
- Tommy's

586
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,411
Well from what we hear,
Tommy just did whatever you said

587
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,621
Yeah well everybody thought
Tommy was the good guy

588
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:08,216
But he had a whole other side

589
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,941
After his mom died it was like
a switch got flipped or somethin'

590
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:12,316
How is that?

591
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:13,862
He could get crazy

592
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,627
And rage fits

593
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,973
And he's the one that beat up
that kid at the snack stand

594
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:19,845
Scared him into keepin'
his mouth shut

595
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:23,122
What about Frank, who did that?

596
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:26,474
Oh, stop protecting Tommy,
he's no friend of yours

597
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:32,187
What happened the night Frank
was killed, Stump?

598
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,564
We snuck out of class

599
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:40,491
We were gonna have snacks and beers
from the deli and then play a little hockey

600
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:46,285
But things didn't go like we planned

601
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:54,229
Ah, damn Your dad's here

602
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,926
He can't hear us

603
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:09,507
I'm sorry about everything

604
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,864
You've been nothing
but good for this place

605
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:14,835
I get real emotional
when it comes to King,

606
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:20,196
- I got him with Lydia, you know?
- It's OK, Frank

607
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:24,412
You know, someday maybe
we could be partners in this deli

608
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:27,584
We'd make a great deli, Frank
I'm proud to work here

609
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:31,206
I had big plans that this would be
a family business,

610
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:33,401
that's why I work so hard

611
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:37,306
I thought that Tommy
was gonna be my partner one day,

612
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:42,135
and now I'm not so sure

613
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:45,697
I found somethin' out from the vet

614
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:52,036
- What?
- Forget it It doesn't matter

615
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:55,111
You are like family to me, Frank

616
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:57,303
So it is family business

617
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,237
I feel the same way

618
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:04,100
The fact is,
I feel closer to you than my own kid

619
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,180
Is that nuts or what?

620
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:20,181
Let's go

621
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,702
- So Tommy took the cash?
- Yeah

622
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:29,953
What did Frank mean
he found something out from the vet?

623
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:32,981
He probably found out
that Tommy beat that dog up

624
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,813
When Tommy got mad,

625
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,906
it was like an explosion

626
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:40,357
You should have seen him whalin'
on that snack shop kid

627
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:42,335
What'd you two do
after you left the deli?

628
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:43,443
We drank the beer,

629
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:46,459
Tommy didn't want to play hockey,
he just went home, he's all worked up

630
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,993
I never saw Frank again

631
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:52,128
And you've been coverin'
for him ever since?

632
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:56,358
I wasn't coverin' for him
because he was my friend,

633
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,822
I was coverin' for him because
I didn't want to end up like Frank

634
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:11,307
We're hearin' some things Tommy

635
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:12,532
What things?

636
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:14,542
Like you're the one that
beat up the family pet

637
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,626
That's crazy

638
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:18,944
Actually it's pretty normal

639
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:22,339
Havin' all that anger build up

640
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,932
- I wasn't angry
- Yeah?

641
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,949
Then you're a stronger kid than I was

642
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:31,916
After my dad left I was mad all the time
Mostly at my mom

643
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,387
My dad tried his best

644
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:35,458
I don't know about that

645
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,304
What's that supposed to mean?

646
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:40,427
No, he's right Tommy
Frank took care of the deli,

647
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:43,178
he was real good with Ricardo
but what about with you?

648
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:44,420
He tried

649
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,469
Come on, your dad left you high and dry
after your mom died

650
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:50,848
Like all he cared about was himself

651
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:54,167
No, he was just busy,
we both were

652
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,231
Too busy for his own son?

653
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:58,395
Sounds to me like
he was a selfish little man

654
00:36:58,395 --> 00:36:59,849
who couldn't take care of his own family

655
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,080
Hey, he was a great guy!

656
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,064
The whole neighborhood loved him!

657
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:06,250
The measure of a man is his family

658
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,821
So your dad was a failure

659
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,771
He wasn't a failure,
you don't know him

660
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:14,788
But he abandoned you
And you were just a kid

661
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:19,311
- He tried to help me
- How? By ignoring you?

662
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:22,256
If he loved you he'd pay attention,
even get up in your face if he had to

663
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,260
That's what he did,
that's exactly what he did!

664
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,607
So he confronted you
Took you on

665
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:29,284
Yes, he did pay attention

666
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:33,304
Is that what got him killed?

667
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,545
Grief can make you crazy, Tommy

668
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:41,811
I know

669
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:46,889
But I'm the failure

670
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,847
Not dad

671
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,241
Me

672
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,733
Beer's gone

673
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,776
Whole register's empty

674
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:07,892
You must've known I'd see that

675
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:10,150
It was Stump's idea

676
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,055
Told him not to

677
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:13,819
What about hockey on Mondays?

678
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:16,331
- That Stump's idea too?
- What?

679
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:19,828
I know you've been sneakin'
out of class, Tommy / One time

680
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:22,903
Maybe two,
it's no big deal

681
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:24,928
And the vet called

682
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:28,547
Told me that King wouldn't let
you touch him the day you visited

683
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,705
You beat him up, didn't you?

684
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:33,798
No, I didn't! Stump did it

685
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:38,410
This is my fault
I've been a bad father

686
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,498
I didn't reach out to you enough

687
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:44,447
- It's fine, dad
- No, it's not fine

688
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:49,450
I think that there's
somethin' wrong with you Tommy

689
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,967
I lost my temper, OK,

690
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,399
I made a sandwich and
he grabbed it right off the table,

691
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,613
I didn't mean to hurt him that bad

692
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:57,399
Geez, Tommy, King was almost dead
when we found him!

693
00:38:57,399 --> 00:39:01,478
I lost my temper, I told you!

694
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:06,836
Look, there's places where
they help kids with your kind of problems

695
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:10,150
You had a hard year

696
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,049
You wanna send me away
to a school for some freaks?

697
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:18,314
It's not for freaks, it's a place
where you could go to get better

698
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,463
Then you could come home

699
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:22,539
We could work the deli together

700
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,101
Have a future

701
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,624
But I got Stump here

702
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:29,366
It'd be good for the two of you
to seperate for a while, trust me / No!

703
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,825
That's not fair, you have everything,

704
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:33,315
you've got the deli, the dog, Ricardo!

705
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,053
I'm gonna have nothing!

706
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:38,460
You got me and I got you!
No matter what, T!

707
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,474
I don't care about that!

708
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:43,477
You can't do this to me, you can't!

709
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:46,831
I'm not going away!

710
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:51,487
You are my son, you'll do as I say!

711
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:55,221
No! I won't!

712
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:09,504
* The Calling 'Wherever You Will Go' *

713
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:14,758
* So lately, been wondering *

714
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:19,150
* Who will be there to take my place *

715
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,369
* When I'm gone you'll need love *

716
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:28,536
* to light the shadows on your face *

717
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:32,690
* If a greater wave shall fall *

718
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,961
* and fall upon us all *

719
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:41,124
* Then between the sand and stone *

720
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:44,817
* could you make it on your own *

721
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:49,106
* If I could, then I would *

722
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:53,426
* I'll go wherever you will go *

723
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:57,776
* Way up high or down low *

724
00:40:57,776 --> 00:41:02,180
* I'll go wherever you will go *

725
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,069
* And maybe *

726
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:06,313
Adoption Application
* I'll find out *

727
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:10,508
Adoption Application
* A way to make it back someday *

728
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:12,702
Adoption Application
* To watch you *

729
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,330
* to guide you *

730
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,992
* through the darkest of your days *

731
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:24,493
* If a greater wave shall fall *

732
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:28,579
* and fall upon us all *

733
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:33,465
* Well then I hope there's
someone out there *

734
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:36,526
* who can bring me back to you *

735
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:40,608
* If I could, then I would *

736
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,920
* I'll go wherever you will go *

737
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,210
* Way up high or down low *

738
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:56,953
* I'll go wherever you will go *
