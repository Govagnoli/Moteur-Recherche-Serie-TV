00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,490
August 13,1975

2
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Tell mama I'm going to play.

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,120
You better be home before the streetlights come on, girl.

4
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,970
fireflies turn into fairies at the end of summer.

5
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,840
Why fairies?

6
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,240
'Cause, they do.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
You made that up.

8
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,370
You never see fireflies in the winter, right?

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,820
In brooklyn, we never saw them ever.

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,780
'Cause they turn into fairies, that's why.

11
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,430
Yeah?And go where?

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,360
Their castle in the sky, where nothing ever dies.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,950
But not all fairies make it.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,850
Why not?

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
'Cause the trolls catch them.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,550
Where do the fireflies really go, melanie?

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,230
I don't know.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,710
My brother said when summer ends,
you won't play with me anymore.

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,430
Why?

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,550
'Cause you're white, and I'm black.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,940
But we're best friends.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,890
- Forever?
- Forever and a day.

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,480
Maybe when summer ends, the fireflies go to heaven.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,980
Yeah, maybe.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,330
Let's get forensics in here,
see if they can pick anything up.

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,120
- Lil.
- Morning, boss.

27
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,080
What do you got?

28
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,200
Ever hear of a letter arriving 31 years too late?

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,400
Too late for what?

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,610
Save the life of a young girl.

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,030
Former postman lived here?

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,380
Died last week.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,020
Refused to deliver mail to blacks on his route back in '75.

34
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,720
Welcome to the U.S.Postal service.

35
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,550
His family found bags of mail stashed in the basement.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,860
The inspector's been sifting for hours.

37
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
This was in one of them.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,140
From an eight-year-old girl, melanie campbell.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,820
Went missing in '75.

40
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,980
Body never found.Presumed homicide.

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,190
Postcard's addressed to her best friend,
next door neighbor,

42
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,790
cherise pierce, black girl.
Take a look.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,990
"The trolls got me.

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,340
" Some kind of message?

45
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,880
It was postmarked the day melanie disappeared.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,710
Cry for help.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,580
31 years too late to save her.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,460
Maybe not too late to catch her killer.

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,420
Melanie campbell, age eight.

53
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,350
Abducted from her bedroom,
night of october 23, 1975.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,650
Her bloody ballet shshoe found in a nearby park.

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,620
Tender-age search.

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,630
Lot of time, manpower on this one.

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,750
Body never recovered.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,480
Theory was an intruder came in
through a broken basement window.

59
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,360
A postcard was sent to her neighbor, cherise pierce.

60
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,130
Never made it.

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,380
These kids were tight.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,210
Best friends, hung out 24/7.

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,840
Not the only pierce in here.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,380
Prime suspect at the time was cherise's
teenage brother, terrell pierce.

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,110
Based on what?

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,900
Kid had no record, straight-a student, Mr.Clean.

67
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,790
Neighbor id'd terrell in the campbells' backyard,
night of the abduction.

68
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,940
In these words: "Saw that colored boy
monkeying around on

69
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,870
the side of their house.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,080
" That's credible.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Lifted a partial palm print from
the campbells' basement window.

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,070
No match to terrell.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,320
Didn't stop them from interrogating him.

74
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,480
Six times.

75
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,830
Parents were questioned, too,
but dismissed as suspects.

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,330
'Cause once the black kid was id'd,
it was all about him.

77
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,730
Brewerytown was lily-white back then.

78
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,610
Pierces were the first black family to move in.

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,190
That some kind of excuse?

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,490
Not an excuse, the times.

81
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,790
Aka white flight.

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,470
Families hightailing it to the burbs,

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,990
terrified that their property values would tank.

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,030
One way to spin it.

85
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,670
At least one white family stayed: The campbells.

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Families of missing kids do that, refuse to move.

87
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,470
Yeah, waiting for their child to walk through the door.

88
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Lily's gonna talk to the parents.

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,180
You want to take cherise and terrell?

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,530
Sure.

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,170
Could be terrell didn't deserve any of this.

92
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,520
Neither did melanie.

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,080
"The trolls got me.

94
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,720
" It was addressed to the girl next door,
cherise pierce.

95
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,640
You think melanie wrote that?

96
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,580
Possibly.Could "the trolls"
have meant something?

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,820
Melanie was always going on
about fairies and trolls and fireflies.

98
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,460
Quite an imagination.

99
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,090
But it was just child's talk.

100
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,700
Melanie did not write this.

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,620
How do you know?

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,890
She just started the third grade,
and she didn't know cursive.

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,320
Of course melanie wrote that.
These are her words.

104
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,380
But anyone who heard her
playing would've known them.

105
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,680
Who wrote it, then?

106
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,410
Maybe the person who took her.

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,520
What kind of a monster would do a thing like that?

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,270
That's what I'm here to find out, mrs.Campbell.

109
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,590
- So you'll find melanie, too?
- Oh, frances.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,420
She is alive.

111
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,060
It's been 31 years.

112
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,360
I don't care if it's 131 years.

113
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,910
Melanie is out there.

114
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,740
Can I walk you out?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,960
We are prisoners in this house
because my wife believes

116
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,480
our daughter's gonna walk through that front door.

117
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,640
Just thought you should know we're reopening the case.

118
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,470
All I want is to bury my child.

119
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
I understand.

120
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,820
Then bring her home.

121
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,960
It was a lifetime ago.

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,760
I barely remember that girl.

123
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,130
You were best friends back when
blacks and whites didn't exactly mix.

124
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,820
Take a look around.

125
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,110
Still don't.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,800
I know you probably got an unfair shake in '75.

127
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,460
Probably?

128
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,000
Cops had me in the box for 16 hours at a time.

129
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,150
That's rough.

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,980
Should've seen the '50s and '60s,
you want to talk rough.

131
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,580
You were id'd in the girl's yard
the night she disappeared.

132
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,700
By an old busybody who thought blacks
should go back to africa.

133
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,640
So that was a flat-out lie?

134
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,370
Flat-out.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,180
Talk about you and melanie.

136
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,900
Like I said, it was long time ago.

137
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,820
"The trolls" mean anyone in particular?

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,800
Could be the difference between
finding melanie's killer or not.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,490
Trolls were people we didn't like.

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,210
Go on.

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,800
We had codes for everything.

142
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,820
I'd say something like: "Alvina lights a spark.

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,260
" Alvina lights a spark?

144
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,660
Code for: "I left a note on our clothesline.

145
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,720
" So who were the trolls?

146
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,260
Almost everyone.

147
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,230
Our friendship wasn't looked on too kindly.

148
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,100
By who?

149
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,120
The whole neighborhood had it out for us,
from the start.

150
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,390
Everyone except melanie.

151
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:56,280
Leave...!

152
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,760
get out of here, critters!

153
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:06,340
Leave...!

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,410
What does "critters" mean, terrell?

155
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,990
Dad told you to go inside, cherise.

156
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,970
"Critters" means bugs and stuff.

157
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,180
Oh.

158
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,100
Want to see my fireflies?

159
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,480
Are those...bugs?

160
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,260
Their booties light up at night.

161
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,050
they do.Like magic.

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,880
I mean, if you believe in that stuff.

163
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,140
Quit talking to that girl!

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,250
Go home, melanie!

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,980
You're not the boss of me, Mr.Wilson!

166
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,290
I told you to go home.
Now!

167
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:53,460
Leave...!

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,000
My mom said you can come over after dinner.

169
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,590
I live right here.

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,160
We can catch fireflies when it gets dark.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,070
Okay.

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,300
See you later, alligator.

173
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,700
After awhile, crocodile.

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,440
Quite a welcoming committee.

175
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,420
Courtesy of hank wilson, head of the civic club.

176
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,680
Civic club?
More like a lynch mob.

177
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,650
Racists parading around as
neighborhood associations.

178
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,620
Who was this bozo?

179
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,520
He owned the local hardware store.

180
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,450
To him, the only thing worse than us
were whites who didn't go along.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
Like melanie.

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,270
Our friendship might have cost her her life.

183
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,220
It was our neighborhood, not theirs.

184
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,340
Your family was there for 30 years,
then, here come the coloreds.

185
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,260
And to make matters worse, little melanie

186
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,180
campbell gets all buddy-buddy with the black girl.

187
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,340
Could make a die-hard racist like you blow a gasket.

188
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,260
Whoa, hold on there.

189
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,520
When melanie disappeared, all the
white people got spooked, moved out.

190
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,440
Had to sell my house at a loss.

191
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,640
Boo-hoo.

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,870
We were working people.

193
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,220
House was all we had.

194
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,620
Beat up your own kid regular for looking at you funny.

195
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,010
What's that got to do with anything?

196
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,690
Maybe you let the fists fly with melanie.

197
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,560
Lippy little kid must have pissed you off.

198
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,300
I was working at the hardware store
the night she disappeared.

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,070
We'll check that.

200
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,290
Go ahead, and while you're at it,
check out a guy by the name of wes floyd.

201
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,150
Who's he?

202
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,130
Real estate scumbag that was creeping
around the neighborhood back then.

203
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,810
Tried to scare all the white folks into moving.

204
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,890
Why?So he could clean up?

205
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,250
Type like that would do anything for a buck.

206
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,340
You hear about that break-in the other day?

207
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,210
Right down the street.

208
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,800
Thank goodness no one was hurt.

209
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,560
Imagine what would happen if that family was home?

210
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:51,571
That's terrified!

211
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,330
Known fact-- blacks move in, crime goes up.

212
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,580
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

213
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,600
" bad things happen to decent people.

214
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,140
Well, we all know one another here.

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,140
Oh, for now, sure, but once the dam breaks,
no stopping who comes in.

216
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,350
You don't want to be the last to leave, do you?

217
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,310
I guess not, but...

218
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,870
place like genessee creek offers a safe
environment for families like yours.

219
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,040
State-of-the-art kitchens.Big yard.A pool.

220
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,890
This heat, a pool would be nice.

221
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,800
Huh?

222
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,830
Don't you fall for it, frances!

223
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,900
Get out of here.

224
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,940
I know what you're doing.

225
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,140
Just doing business.

226
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,300
Showing the nice lady the homes I have for sale.

227
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,270
You're trying to scare whites
out of this neighborhood,

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
but nobody here's leaving.

229
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,420
Except the spooks over there.

230
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,730
It's our neighborhood.

231
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,890
Sure it is.

232
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,630
My husband would never agree.

233
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,670
Neighborhood's gonna tip one day soon,

234
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
and you'll be the last white face around.

235
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,470
Not if I can help it.

236
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,310
And if one bad thing happens to some nice little white kid?

237
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,190
Won't be up to you.

238
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,990
His houses in the suburbs
weren't selling worth squat.

239
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,730
Then melanie disappears and he makes a killing.

240
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,510
Neighborhood tipped in, like, eight seconds.

241
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,170
Thanks for sharing.

242
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,380
Now get before i drop-kick you out of here.

243
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,940
Genessee creek.

244
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,130
It's that tony subdivision over near abington.

245
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,770
Lot of people made a killing off of white flight.

246
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,460
Sounds like this wes floyd guy was one of them.

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,450
I see your real estate ads all over the place, wes.

248
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,070
Bus stops, billboards.

249
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,010
I do well.

250
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,800
And to think, it all started with genessee creek

251
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,870
and the abduction and murder of a little girl.

252
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,700
I'm a businessman, not a killer.

253
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,430
You made out like a bandit after
melanie campbell disappeared.

254
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,500
Sold 12 homes in one week.

255
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,800
They say you make your own luck.

256
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,440
Maybe you made yours.

257
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,570
The timing was fortuitous, so arrest me.

258
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,100
Already have a record, wes.

259
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,080
Silly trespassing charges for putting
a few "sold" signs in people's yards.

260
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,480
To make it look like people were
moving when they weren't.

261
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,110
Smashed a few windows, too.

262
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,620
Made people think crime was going up.

263
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,830
Scare them out of brewerytown
into your white suburb.

264
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,860
It was business.

265
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,690
And it was the neighbors that
had it out for melanie, not me.

266
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,750
Neighbors like who?

267
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:53,551
The kibbitz on that block.

268
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,390
Saw the troubles myself at the bus stop.

269
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,050
Fairies like sweet stuff.

270
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,770
Like honey?

271
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,510
What if we put some in a jar?

272
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, and if they like it...

273
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,110
first day of school and melanie's
already got a show-and-tell.

274
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,400
you gonna talk jive for us, huh?
Dy-no-mite.

275
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,510
Shut up, dale.

276
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,670
Come on, mel, we don't got to listen to him.

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,730
What'd you say, darkie?

278
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,350
Um...nothing.

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,530
Then say you're sorry.Or I'm gonna smack you.

280
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,000
Like your daddy smacks you?

281
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,020
Second thought...

282
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,360
maybe melanie should get in the first lick.

283
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,760
- Hit her.
- No.

284
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,490
- Hit her.
- Stop it!

285
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,080
- Hit her!
- I said stop!

286
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,540
Little bitch.

287
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,460
Come on.

288
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,800
Stupid troll.

289
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,630
Saw that kid picking on the little ones all the time.

290
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,760
You know his name?

291
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,360
Dale wilson.Hank wilson's son.

292
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,650
Runt-of-the-litter type.

293
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,480
Humiliated by a little girl.

294
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,210
Infront of the other kids.

295
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,040
And if dale was anything like his pops, not exactly the

296
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,680
forgiving and forgetting type.

297
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,650
How'd it make you feel, dale?

298
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,570
Getting popped by melanie campbell in front of everybody.

299
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,240
Not long after, she goes missing.

300
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,540
I was just young, dumb.

301
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,980
Can't argue there.

302
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,140
Held back twice.

303
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,680
So?That don't mean nothing.

304
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,370
Your old man was damn near burning crosses on lawns back then.

305
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,010
You telling me you didn't get even?

306
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,400
I'm not my father.

307
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,280
Sure acted like him at that bus stop.

308
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,200
and I felt bad about it.

309
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,700
No one knew better than me
what it's like getting picked on

310
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,140
by someone twice your size.

311
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,210
Oh, so you just let it pass, then?

312
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,650
Let bygones be bygones?

313
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,870
I went to melanie's house the next day.

314
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,560
To even the score?

315
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,720
To apologize.

316
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,780
we can leave notes to
each other here from now on.

317
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,120
Where no one'll see 'em.

318
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,100
- In the storm pipe?
- Yeah.

319
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,540
What are you doing?

320
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,600
Get away from us, dale.

321
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,430
I'm sorry for what I did, okay?

322
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,970
Sorry to both of us?

323
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,500
Yeah.

324
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,570
Now get down from there before you hurt yourself.

325
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,510
Why are you crying?

326
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,570
My mom took down the clothesline.

327
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,540
She said we can't play together anymore.

328
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,180
Her mom said they're going to move, too.

329
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
Why?

330
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,650
'Cause the neighbors don't like
fireflies and bugs and stuff.

331
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,380
Who doesn't?

332
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,140
Them.

333
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,030
That isn't about your fireflies.

334
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,710
It isn't?

335
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,850
It's about cherise.

336
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,530
She's the critter, stupid.

337
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,030
I'm a bug?

338
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,000
No, not a bug.

339
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,670
- A critter's like...
- like what?

340
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,280
Like not us.

341
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,120
A critter's like...not a person.

342
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,220
But I'm a person.

343
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,670
Yeah.

344
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,730
Look, you don't see horses
and chickens playing together, do you?

345
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,170
I like horses and chickens.

346
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,300
But they don't pl together, do they?

347
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,530
That's a hell of a thing to tell a kid.

348
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,560
That's the way the world was.

349
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,810
I was just the messenger.

350
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,160
Someone vandalized their house?

351
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,800
That's, uh, the story, anyway.

352
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,910
What, you disputing it, dale?

353
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,590
All I know...

354
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,550
Mrs.Campbell came into my dad's hardware
store asking about paint removers.

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,190
To get rid of the graffiti.So what?

356
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,110
So that was two days before her house got vandalized.

357
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,230
Are you saying Mrs.Campbell
knew it was gonna happen?

358
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,790
I'm saying she wrote those words herself.

359
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,890
Melanie and cherise were best friends.

360
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,750
That's right.

361
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,930
It concern you at all?

362
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,330
Your daughter hanging with a black girl?

363
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,170
No.Why are you asking?

364
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,430
"Critter lovers.
" Remember that?

365
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,260
Someone spray-painted
those words on our house.

366
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,130
Never reported it.Wonder why.

367
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,350
It was nothing, it was just a couple of pranksters.

368
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,030
Co why stir up more trouble?

369
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,730
We know about the visit to
the hardware store, Mrs.Campbell.

370
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,890
What are you talking about?

371
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,860
Things were heating up.

372
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,160
You wanted to get out of the neighborhood.

373
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,130
Get to genessee creek.

374
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,960
That's why you vandalized your own home.

375
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,330
People were so angry.Hank, all the rest.

376
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,370
I was afraid.

377
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,320
Of what they'd do to you.

378
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,720
Not me.Melanie.

379
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,370
There was so much hatred.Ugliness.

380
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,950
You wanted to shield her from all that.

381
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,190
So I...told her not to play with cherise anymore.

382
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,170
That sometimes it's best to stick with your own.

383
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,300
Aw, for god's sake, frances!

384
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,760
You refused to leave.
I didn't have a choice.

385
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,120
They were decent, hard-working people just like us.

386
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,350
I know.

387
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,090
I was just trying to protect my little girl.

388
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,830
I had no idea what damage it would cause.

389
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,060
Dale?

390
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,260
What happened?

391
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,990
It's nothing.

392
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,790
Who hit you?T-tell me.

393
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,970
My dad.Heard about that "critter lover.

394
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,420
" Said it's my fault all the white people are moving out.

395
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,450
Crazy, huh, mrs.C.?

396
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,580
Be sure and get an ice pack from the school nurse.

397
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,510
Alvina lights a spark.

398
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,310
Mel, you hear me?
Alvina lights a spark.

399
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,570
I'm not playing that anymore.
It's little kids' stuff.

400
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,450
You don't wanna see the fireflies?

401
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,270
No.

402
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,620
They're gonna leave, turn to fairies.

403
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,350
Fireflies aren't fairies, okay.

404
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,570
But you said...

405
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,580
and horses and chickens don't play together.

406
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,940
You said we'd be friends forever.

407
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,510
No such thing as forever.

408
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,400
That night, my little girl was gone.

409
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,010
I thought our child was in danger.

410
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,420
And she was.

411
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,930
"Alvina lights a spark.

412
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,800
" That meant cherise left a note for melanie.

413
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,250
But the clothesline was down.

414
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,460
So they were leaving them in the storm pipe, right?

415
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,050
The note never turned up.

416
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,780
Oh...that's a reach.

417
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,760
Need some leverage.

418
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,640
Same basement window the doer used in '75.

419
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,240
Lifted a partial palm print off of that ledge.

420
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,350
wasn't a hand print on the ledge.

421
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,520
It was a foot.

422
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,570
Neighbor spotted you in the campbells' yard
night melanie disappeared.

423
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,700
Already told you...
racist old bat made that up.

424
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,300
Got a print off that window ledge.

425
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,500
From a heel.

426
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,780
Tell me it's not gonna match yours, terrell.

427
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't hurt that white girl.

428
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,840
I said...tell me it's not
gonna match yours.

429
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,640
You made me a fool.

430
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,040
I defended you to my boss, believed in you.

431
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,920
Maybe you shouldn't have.

432
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,290
what were you doing in her yard?

433
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,730
Getting the note back for my sister.

434
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,030
Then why not say that?

435
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,060
A black boy in a white girl's yard
same night she goes missing?

436
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,080
No one's going to believe me.

437
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,230
I would!

438
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,960
You're the police.

439
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,740
I learned 31 years ago what that means.

440
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,150
Guilty till proven innocent.

441
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,610
They treated me like I wasn't even human.

442
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,770
Times change, terrell.

443
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,730
Not so much.

444
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,860
I just wanted to protect my little sister.

445
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,500
I did what I had to do that night.

446
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,350
Go on.

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,900
I told cherise the truth.

448
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,060
Heard about what went down
at the bus stop today.

449
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,460
Sorry.

450
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,760
I left a note for her in the storm pipe.

451
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,630
For melanie?

452
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,250
Maybe she'll find it and want to be friends again?

453
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,470
Cherise...

454
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,350
she's never going to be your friend.

455
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,280
You see, white people, they look at us,
and they see ugliness.

456
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,800
They do?

457
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,180
They don't see how pretty you are,
or how smart or how cool.

458
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,000
But I do.

459
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,210
And you gotta see that, too.

460
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,270
Melanie thinks I'm cool.

461
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,530
You can't trust 'em.
Not even melanie.

462
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,000
I can't?

463
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,300
Emmett till learned that the hard way.

464
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
Who's emmett till?

465
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,050
Boy who whistled at a white girl.

466
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,320
After, these dudes dragged him out of bed
in the middle of the night, shot him.

467
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,810
He wasn't even that much older than you.

468
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,310
Now I'm not trying to give you
nightmares or nothin', cherise.

469
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,570
I'm just lookin' out for my little sis.

470
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,620
Will you get the note back for me?
Please?

471
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,500
Sure thing.

472
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,720
Now to bed, okay?

473
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,800
Terrell?

474
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,220
Yeah?

475
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,810
Asdid emmett go to heaven?

476
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,900
all kids go to heaven.

477
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,420
I never forgot the look in her eyes
when I told her that.

478
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,820
She grew up faster than she should have.

479
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,220
Sounds like you both did.

480
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,130
So...you got the note?

481
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,720
It was gone when I got there.

482
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,560
Gone?Who took it?

483
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,820
I guess melanie.

484
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,550
You tell cherise that?

485
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,650
Yeah.

486
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,060
Do you know what the note said?

487
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,550
You gotta make this right, terrell.

488
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,710
By me.

489
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,250
Cherise ju wanted her friend back.

490
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,470
What'd the note say?

491
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:35,810
"Meet me in the woods...tonight.

492
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,790
" So melanie went into the woods that night.

493
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,440
And so did cherise.

494
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
Melanie wasn't abducted from her bedroom.

495
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,090
She went to the woods that night.

496
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,250
The woods?

497
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,790
You asked her to meet you there, cherise.

498
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,650
In your note.

499
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,530
That's ridiculous.

500
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,380
"Alvina lights a spark.

501
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,310
" Your secret code.
Meant you left her a note.

502
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,280
"Meet me in the woods tonight.

503
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,440
" You were waiting for her there.

504
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,620
We were best friends.
For forever and a day.

505
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,970
But melanie didn't believe in forever anymore.

506
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,750
The bus stop.She abandoned you.

507
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
Quite a betrayal.

508
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,700
It was.

509
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,910
What happened in the woods that night?

510
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
I spent my whole life trying to forget.

511
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,280
But you couldn'T.

512
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:33,210
we moved to an all black neighborhood,
a world away from brewerytown.

513
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,380
And it just got easier to pretend like it never happened.

514
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,680
What never happened?

515
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,510
I should have listened to terrell.

516
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,430
Black and white, never meant to be.

517
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,730
And I have spent my enre life living like that.

518
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,630
Never trusting another white person.

519
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,810
We believed fireflies were fairies
and friendships lasted forever.

520
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,690
But we were wrong.

521
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,220
Look.Fairies.Last of the season.

522
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,950
Thought you didn't believe in fairies.

523
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,870
I'm sorry I was mean to you at the bus stop.

524
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
Why'd you do that?

525
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,520
My mom said it was better to stick with your own.

526
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,250
Terrell said that, too.

527
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,980
But I don't want to stick with my own.

528
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,800
I want to be with you, cherise.

529
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,290
Me, too, mel.

530
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,900
You're my best friend.

531
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,700
- Forever?
- And a day.

532
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,700
Can't keep away from that critter, can you?

533
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,090
What do you want, dale?

534
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,690
I drive to this critter's house to
scare her, and what do I see?

535
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,280
This one trying to sneak off.

536
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,530
Thought you could get away, huh?

537
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,460
I got beat because my dad thinks
I spray-painted your house.

538
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,630
- Did you?
- No.

539
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,230
And now the whole neighborhood's gonna
move out and he says it's 'cause of me.

540
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,570
He hates me.

541
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,210
You're scaring us.

542
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,460
None of this would've happened if you hadn't moved here.

543
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,000
I wanna go home.

544
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,810
Melanie, run!

545
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,680
I heard the gunshots, and I knew,
and I did nothing.

546
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,750
Just kept running.

547
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,910
Anyone would have.

548
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,070
It's my fault we were in the woods.

549
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,540
it's my fault she died.

550
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,940
You weren't the one with the gun.

551
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:54,360
Every night I would dream about him
coming into my room and taking me.

552
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,200
And then the dreams finally stopped.

553
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,440
Until now.

554
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,030
The postcard.

555
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,240
Just the other night I had a dream.

556
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,830
Melanie was with the fireflies.

557
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,560
In a better place.

558
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,440
Heaven.

559
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,930
We got an eyewitness who saw you shoot melanie.

560
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,160
That's crazy.

561
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,530
Is it?

562
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,560
Cherise didn't see me shoot nobody.

563
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,730
Never said it was cherise, dale.

564
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,580
You sent the postcard.

565
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,460
Insurance, to keep cherise quiet.

566
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,930
Your old man beat the crap outta you.

567
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,080
You were lookin' to get even.

568
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,540
You followed cherise into the woods
that night, with your father's gun.

569
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,470
I never meant to hurt...

570
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,100
oh, cut the bull!

571
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,380
You shot at cherise!

572
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,390
To scare her.

573
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,070
But then...she screamed...

574
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,810
"and I thought...I thought I killed her.

575
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,820
And I panicked.

576
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,030
So, you had to kill melanie, too--
she was a witness.

577
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,290
Point of no return.

578
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,450
My dad beat me every night for that critter lover thing.

579
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,090
If he found out about this...
he'd kill me.

580
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,970
So I did what I had to do.

581
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,510
What, dale?

582
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:47,270
I put her in the car and drove...For hours.

583
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,290
Till we got to the west virginia state line.

584
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,630
Then what happened?

585
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,510
Then I pulled off the road.

586
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,930
It was dark and there was no one around.

587
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,620
Just us.

588
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,140
stop.

589
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,440
Right here.

590
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,230
Why'd you have to be friends with that critter?

591
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,490
why?

592
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,750
I just want to go home.

593
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,330
This is all your fault, you hear me.

594
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,820
'Cause you had to be friends with her.

595
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,170
Please.

596
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,430
Close your eyes.

597
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,330
I want my mommy.

598
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,920
You can't tell on me.

599
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,080
Please.

600
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,300
Not anymore.

601
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:17,490
And then I just...drove away.

602
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:37,210
No unidentified child murder victims
that age in west virginia, 1975.

603
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,180
Doesn't make sense.

604
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,380
Rural area.

605
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,960
Animals could've carried her off.

606
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,310
Or the body was never found.

607
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,420
Interstate files are a joke.

608
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,200
No national database on missing kids back then.

609
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,610
Kid crossed state lines, easy to fall through the cracks.

610
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,260
So even if the body was found, no way
to connect it to our missing philly girl.

611
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,570
Needle in a haystack.

612
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,160
Police report, west virginia, october '75.

613
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,800
State trooper found a girl just off route 1.

614
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,870
She was shot but alive.Head injury.

615
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,430
No memory of who she was or where she came from.

616
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,830
Transported to the county hospital in critical condition.

617
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
Then put in foster care.

618
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,250
Melanie's still alive?

619
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,190
Excuse me?

620
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,690
Are you jennifer robinson?

621
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,800
Yeah.

622
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,410
Philadelphia pd.

623
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,690
Okay.

624
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,090
You were a gunshot victim in '75.

625
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,400
Ain't you folks a little late to the party?

626
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,980
Hmy you don't remember the shooting?

627
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,430
Or where you're from?

628
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,630
Couldn't have been good, right?

629
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,610
Family was probably the reason
I was in those woods.

630
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,510
You're wrong.

631
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,140
Your mom and dad never stopped looking for you.

632
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,600
Never stopped hoping you'd
walk through their door again.

633
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,000
Is that right.

634
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,840
Their names are norman and frances campbell.

635
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,950
Good people.

636
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,450
I don't remember.Sorry.

637
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,960
They never forgot you, melanie.

638
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,060
Is that my name?

639
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,220
And your best friend was a girl named cherise.

640
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,190
She was with you that night, in the woods.

641
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,090
A lot of people still waitin'...
for you to come home.

642
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,350
I should get back to work.

643
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,750
You and cherise left notes for each other on the...

644
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,090
on the clothesline.

645
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,840
You believed in fireflies and fairies.

646
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,060
Please.Stop.

647
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,340
That's why he brought you into the woods.

648
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,690
Because you were brave.

649
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,470
In a world that wasn'T.

650
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:03,770
I remember...I wasn't alone.In the woods.

651
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,130
Because the fireflies were there...

652
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,960
telling me heaven had to wait.

653
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,360
'Cause I had to live.
