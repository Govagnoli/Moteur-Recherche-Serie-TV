3
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,504
Get her in the back.

4
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:22,286
- What... what do I...?
- Follow directions.

5
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:45,984
Okay, let me get out first.

6
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,740
The guys were digging up the 
foundation of the old Calvin building.

7
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,580
They made the discovery this morning.

8
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,121
Two bags of bones.

9
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,803
- In the cement?
- No, underneath.

10
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:30,755
So they got thrown in here when they 
were first putting up the building?

11
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,317
Yeah, the doer figured 
they were buried forever,

12
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,931
and now the city wants a parking lot.

13
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,694
The remains are mostly skeletal,

14
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:43,244
but they were buried in plastic, so, 
uh, a lot of the clothes survived.

15
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:47,276
One male... one female.

16
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,917
How can you tell that?

17
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:52,279
Pelvic bones. Shoe size.

18
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,240
When did bell bottoms 
come back in style,

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,503
five years ago?

20
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,233
Don't look at me.

21
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,805
They've been down here 
more than five years.

22
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,581
This building's at least 30 years old.

23
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:07,103
So they're from the original 
days of bell bottoms.

24
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:08,933
The '60's.

25
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,389
Those pants were ugly 
the first time around.

26
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,556
Look at that.

27
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,771
Summer of love.

28
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,612
Where did it all go wrong?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/03/07

38
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:02,544
1969. You weren't even 
born yet, right?

39
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:05,299
World had to wait till the '70s for me.

40
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,478
You know how many words 
there are for narcissist?

41
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,864
Scotty.

42
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:10,937
Hey. You okay?

43
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:15,012
Yeah. You just forgot to fill 
this out before you left.

44
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,564
I'll see you upstairs.

45
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,180
Hi... uh, I'm Elisa.

46
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,420
Lilly. / Hi.

47
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:25,686
My partner.

48
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:28,164
You're a detective?

49
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:29,412
Yeah.

50
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,074
You're so beautiful.

51
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,933
Thanks.

52
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,491
See you up there.

53
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,013
Sorry.

54
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:46,054
Did I embarrass you? / No.

55
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,914
You never told me 
your partner was a girl.

56
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:50,589
Yeah.

57
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,333
We... okay today?

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,003
Yeah.

59
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,055
It's a good day, I think.

60
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,285
Quiet.

61
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,677
No box on these two jobs.

62
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,152
Had to go to Missing Persons.

63
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:14,155
A white woman and black man 
disappeared together June 3, 1969.

64
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,227
Missing persons didn't 
knock themselves out.

65
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:18,915
If you're over 18 and of sound mind,
you're allowed to disappeared.

66
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:20,093
And the lifesyle.

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,861
A lot of people disappeared 
in the '60s.

68
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,226
Some of 'em don't even know it.

69
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:26,210
The woman was Julia Hoffman, 22,

70
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,060
reported missing by her 
parents, now deceased.

71
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,656
Lived in a commune.

72
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:34,096
Disappeared with Gerard Gary, 23.

73
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,355
Looks like Julia's station 
wagon disappeared, too.

74
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:37,669
We ran an NCIC search,

75
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,799
see if the car ever turned 
up anywhere, but no luck.

76
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:43,115
These bodies were dumped professional
style in that construction site.

77
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,675
Which says organized crime.

78
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,834
So how does that intersect
with hippies?

79
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,019
Drugs?

80
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,087
Had to buy them somewhere.

81
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,094
Maybe the black-white 
thing bothered somebody.

82
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,688
You got any family contacts 
on either of them?

83
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,448
No, but we have a name 
on a boyfriend for Julia.

84
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,676
Another commune member.

85
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,833
You mean the guy she was 
found with wasn't her boyfriend?

86
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,423
If he was, she had one at home, too.

87
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:02,568
Not a bad motive for 
boyfriend Number One,

88
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,977
there being a Number two.

89
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,598
Let's go see this commune guy.

90
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:12,552
Adam Clarke, where are you now?

91
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,742
Life coach.

92
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,212
You get to choose...

93
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,200
how to view your experience.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,376
What's the empowering choice?

95
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,984
Taking responsibility.

96
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:31,769
Winners take responsibility, all right?

97
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,343
All right. See everyone tomorrow.

98
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,129
Thanks.

99
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,282
Adam Clarke?

100
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,584
Yeah.

101
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:41,971
Detective Rush and Valens, Homicide.

102
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,036
That's a room-emptier.

103
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,339
We're here about Julia Hoffman.

104
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,863
You were dating her in 1969?

105
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,247
Yeah.

106
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,458
Till she disappeared on me.

107
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,344
Her remains have been found.

108
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:01,522
Along with the remains of Gerard Gary.

109
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,486
You mind?

110
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,289
They're herbal.

111
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,384
I thought Julia went to Canada 
with that Gerard guy.

112
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,739
Looks like they never 
made it out of the city.

113
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,229
Ugly.

114
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,333
What kind of relationship 
did you two have?

115
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,827
Six months of hot and 
heavy in the commune.

116
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,413
Serious?

117
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:30,942
No. I was more serious 
about ending the war.

118
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,321
So her being with this other 
guy didn't rile you at all.

119
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,647
We had an open relationship.

120
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,516
It was the '60s.

121
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,995
It was part of the revolution--

122
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:42,568
change the world, 
change ourselves.

123
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,697
But human nature doesn't always
conform to revolutionary ideals.

124
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,451
Well, that's why I do this work.

125
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:51,390
And that's being a life coach, 
I take it.

126
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,469
It's easy to make fun of.

127
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,149
We have a saying:

128
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,540
"Being cynical's the booby prize."

129
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,451
Any idea if Julia and Gerard 
were dealing drugs?

130
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:01,325
No chance.

131
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,408
Aw, come on, Adam -- summer of '69.

132
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:06,428
Oh, we took drugs, 
for sure, but... dealing?

133
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,197
We just weren't that organized.

134
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:13,465
The last time you saw Julia, did 
you fight, and part on bad terms?

135
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,554
Furthest thing from it.

136
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:32,888
It's time.

137
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:46,743
Our soldiers are coming 
home in body bags!

138
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:50,349
The Vietnamese people die and die!

139
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:54,265
Now, there comes a time when you 
have to throw yourself into history,

140
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,949
not stand on the sidelines.

141
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:02,024
My draft card!

142
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,681
You let'em arrest me!

143
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,416
I'm saying no!

144
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,918
I'm saying hell, no!

145
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,974
I... won't... go!

146
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,582
Hell, no, we won't go!

147
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:26,899
Hell, no, we won't go!

148
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:29,104
Hell, no, we won't go!

149
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,100
Hell, no, we won't go!

150
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,977
Hell, no, we won't go!

151
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:34,908
Hell, no, we won't go!

152
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,677
Hell, no, we won't go!

153
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,363
Glory days, huh?

154
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:42,931
Intense...
as we used to say.

155
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,644
And Julia and Gerard being together,

156
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:49,641
that didn't bring up any intense
feelings, like jealousy?

157
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:51,808
It hurt, some.

158
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,653
But that was our deal.

159
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,506
Who was the girl with Julia?

160
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,296
Her friend Terri.

161
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,318
She lived with us for awhile.

162
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,579
Remember her last name?

163
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:02,955
Maxwell.

164
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,576
A rich Cherry Hill girl who came and 
played hippie for a couple of years.

165
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,268
Now she's a rich art dealer.

166
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:18,573
Julia and I were on dishes 
duty at the commune.

167
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:23,728
The men were totally into equality
until we ran out of clean plates.

168
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,197
So you knew Adam Clarke?

169
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:30,103
Of course! He was the 
king of the commune.

170
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,655
Well, he claims he didn't mind 
Julia being with Gerard.

171
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:34,938
You believe that?

172
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,023
I do, actually.

173
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:41,079
Only because he was 
so... self-absorbed.

174
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,092
How so?

175
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:44,677
He was the star of the 
anti-war movement.

176
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:47,990
And he was inspiring, I admit.

177
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,676
But he was an ass.

178
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:53,127
He thought of himself as 
a babe magnet, '60s-style.

179
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,613
Well, even babe magnets 
don't like being dumped.

180
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,394
Especially babe magnets.

181
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:01,240
I just don't think he cared 
enough about Julia to harm her.

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,219
Right.

183
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,803
There is something I didn't 
tell the police in '69.

184
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:10,628
In my world, back then...

185
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,278
you just didn't tell the 
cops a lot of things.

186
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:14,900
Oink, oink?

187
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,874
Yeah.

188
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,777
What didn't you tell?

189
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:25,848
Julia and Gerard were into 
something... clandestine.

190
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:27,007
Like what?

191
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,381
There were a lot of 
secret phone calls...

192
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:35,026
um, messages from someone 
who called himself Dr.L.

193
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:38,892
And Julia always had 
these envelopes of cash.

194
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,921
And how do you know 
Gerard was involved?

195
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,609
The night before they disappeared,

196
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,612
they were planning something.

197
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,183
Hell, no, we won't go!

198
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,293
Hell, no, we won't go!

199
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,302
The meeting place 
doesn't work anymore.

200
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,784
I know.

201
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:57,328
7:00 a.m. tomorrow, 
we pick up on a new corner.

202
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,769
She'll have the bread?

203
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,210
Yep.

204
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:03,398
You scared?

205
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,907
No way, baby. You?

206
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,468
Hell, no, we won't go!

207
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,774
Does he know?

208
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,765
I'd never tell him.

209
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:36,122
Julia was your best friend, and 
you didn't ask her what was up?

210
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:38,133
She didn't wanna tell me.

211
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:42,149
And to be honest,
I was scared to know.

212
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:45,599
I was a suburbs girl trying 
out the commune life.

213
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,922
If it ever got too gritty, 
I knew I could always go home.

214
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:53,963
But Julia, she was for real,

215
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,129
and she was into something... deep.

216
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,933
Forensics found a long 
brown hair with the bodies

217
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,617
under a piece of tape
on the plastic.

218
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,859
Could be Julia's.

219
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:06,513
We'll catch a break if it's not.

220
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:07,827
Any leads on the missing car?

221
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,768
Mm. Sludge.

222
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:10,894
What about it?

223
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,852
Uh, it was smeared on 
the plastic and the clothes,

224
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,572
and has caffeic acid
and pyrazine in it.

225
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:17,744
Chemicals made in 
manufacturing coffee.

226
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,414
Killer gave'em one last cappuccino?

227
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:21,300
Or they were wrapped 
up near the waterfront

228
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,868
by the Bogata Coffee plant.

229
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,215
Was it there in '69?

230
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,959
Established '66.

231
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:26,832
Smart, Nicky.

232
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,542
Gives a specific place to 
dredge for a station wagon.

233
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,922
That enough to get the divers out?

234
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:33,307
I'll call the Marine Unit.

235
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,812
I was at Woodstock, you know.

236
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,046
You?

237
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,812
Jimi Hendrix. That cat could play.

238
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,234
Did he say "cat"?

239
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,691
You take your clothes off 
and roll in the mud, boss?

240
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:54,097
Uh, set-up and security
for one of the vendors.

241
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,733
Which one?

242
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,218
Porta Potti.

243
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:59,915
Now I'm seeing it.

244
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,772
Let's take a look.

245
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,376
There's a real time capsule for you.

246
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,428
35 years as a fish motel.

247
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,627
What've you got there, Lil,
a dead fish?

248
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,803
Or a wallet.

249
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,085
I should be doing this in the lab.

250
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,043
I won't tell on you, Louie.

251
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,559
Want an Orange Crush?

252
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,371
Yeah.

253
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,679
So, Elisa you actually 
introduce people to.

254
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,783
Sets her apart.

255
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,210
Yeah.

256
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,479
I'm sorry about that, uh, comment.

257
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,261
I don't mind getting 
called beautiful.

258
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,977
Well, she's not a hundred 
percent healthy.

259
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,308
Doctor calls it a... 
a thinking disorder.

260
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:55,903
Sometimes she...

261
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:59,482
I think he's ready.

262
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,734
This pouch was inside the wallet.

263
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,600
And it seems to be airtight.

264
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,910
Like a ziplock?

265
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,164
Right.

266
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:12,582
So it protected whatever's inside.

267
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,483
Maybe.

268
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,017
What is it?

269
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,314
It's an address.

270
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:23,674
"4912 Spruce Street. Jane."

271
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:24,958
West Philly.

272
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,179
"Do not give out address 
except in emergency."

273
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,811
I'd call a double murder an emergency.

274
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,400
Detectives Rush and Valens.

275
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,405
We're looking for Jane.

276
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:53,045
You're here about Jane?

277
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:55,063
Yeah. Is she here?

278
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:57,284
Well, Jane's not a person.

279
00:14:57,284 --> 00:15:00,101
Jane's an organization.

280
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:03,663
I'm Dr.Linden.

281
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,592
Dr.L.

282
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:08,050
Yeah. Please come in.

283
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:12,364
They were volunteers.

284
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,689
Then they stopped, suddenly.

285
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,864
What were they volunteers for?

286
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:19,471
Jane.

287
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,649
An abortion service.

288
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:24,931
Underground.

289
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:28,103
In the '60s, abortion was illegal.

290
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,591
Women still had them, of course.

291
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:32,121
Yeah. Coat hangers.

292
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,503
Knitting needles.

293
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,271
Ballpoint pens.

294
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,696
Jane's purpose was to 
keep people away from

295
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:39,255
those dangerous procedures,

296
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,698
and provide them with safe ones.

297
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:43,966
And you were a provider?

298
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,444
Yeah.

299
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,428
Until '73, when the law changed.

300
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,806
What's with the name, "Jane"?

301
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:52,484
Security.

302
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,689
Everything had to be anonymous.

303
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,173
How'd that work?

304
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,301
Well, women would call 
a number and ask for Jane.

305
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,385
The volunteers would call back,
set up an appointment.

306
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:04,456
That what Julia and Gerard did?

307
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:07,097
They escorted the patients,
handled the money,

308
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:09,127
they did everything.

309
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:11,509
When did you last see them?

310
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:15,969
In the morning, the day 
they disappeared.

311
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,994
They brought over a young girl...

312
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,787
Sorry about the blindfold.

313
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,782
I wouldn't tell anything.

314
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,788
Especially if you don't 
know where we are.

315
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:34,144
It's not dangerous.

316
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,974
It's gonna be okay.

317
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,400
What do I have to do?

318
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,071
The doctor will talk you through it.

319
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,402
He's a real doctor?

320
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,395
You'll get a D and C.

321
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:51,449
I don't know what that is.

322
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,574
Dilation and curettage.

323
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:56,906
It's the safest way. 
Dr.L's real good.

324
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,204
He helped me.

325
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:02,510
Doctor, this is Renee.

326
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,537
How do you do?

327
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:05,961
Come with me now.

328
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,171
We'll get through this together.

329
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,899
The procedure went fine.

330
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,952
Julia and Gerard left with her...

331
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,583
and that's all I know.

332
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,242
You never got the girl's last name?

333
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,151
No.

334
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,472
I had to protect my medical license.

335
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:31,499
But Jane must've had her infomation,
in case something went wrong.

336
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:32,749
Probably.

337
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,672
But I only knew the contact people.

338
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,685
Did you get a new contact 
after Julia and Gerard?

339
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,597
Colette Ferguson.

340
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:43,247
She's a poly sci professor at Temple.

341
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:48,875
I had an emergency number 
and first name for that girl.

342
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,573
Renee.

343
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,232
No last name?

344
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:58,741
When Julia and Gerard went missing,
I called her, like it was routine.

345
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:00,411
She said everything was fine.

346
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,938
You save that number?

347
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,417
I did.

348
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:05,683
I don't know why.

349
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:08,949
Last link to Julia, probably.

350
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,088
I'd have to find it.

351
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,764
You were close to Julia?

352
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,962
We met under the worst of circumstances.

353
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,532
You okay?

354
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,125
He says I am.

355
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,180
Does he do it here?

356
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,635
The kitchen.

357
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,732
What's he use?

358
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:52,742
A bicycle spoke.

359
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:59,230
He says to keep it in
twenty... four hours...

360
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,890
then it happens.

361
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:05,678
He's supposed to be good.

362
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,493
You got the $400?

363
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,126
I...

364
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,862
I-I have $350.

365
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,907
Okay, it's four.

366
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,963
I couldn't get more.

367
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,974
I'll get you some wine.
Calm you down.

368
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:45,590
He made me touch him before.

369
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,796
W-We should leave.

370
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,437
She took me home, checked 
in on me the next day.

371
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,613
Which was lucky for me, 
because I had an infection.

372
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:13,951
By the time she got me to the hospital...

373
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,105
Bad, huh?

374
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:20,540
Couldn't have children because of it.

375
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:25,819
So... how did Julia get to Dr.Linden?

376
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:29,210
She found an ad for Jane
in the Free Weekly.

377
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:32,818
She was so grateful after, 
she went to work for Jane.

378
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:33,847
I did, too.

379
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:35,003
And she brought Gerard in?

380
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:37,477
No, he was already a volunteer.
That's how they met.

381
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:40,109
Why was he doing it? He know 
someone who had one?

382
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,919
Most everyone does, son.

383
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,740
Sounds risky.

384
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:50,670
Especially for Gerard.

385
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:52,677
Why's that?

386
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,906
He was in the Black Liberation Front.

387
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,567
They were very militant, 
and dead set against abortion.

388
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,347
Considered it genocide for Black people.

389
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,448
Dead set as in murder?

390
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:08,979
His working for Jane was like a 
declaration of war to some people.

391
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:12,447
Know anyone we can 
talk to from the BLF?

392
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,907
Lionel Royce was the 
leader the local chapter.

393
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,994
Where's Lionel now?

394
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:20,862
I hear he's in and out of prison.

395
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:24,957
Where he belongs, if he's 
the one hurt those two.

396
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,142
We want to talk to you about 
your old friend Gerard Gary.

397
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:30,789
Tragic man.

398
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,680
Limitless potential, unwise choices.

399
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,192
You didn't like some of his activities.

400
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,817
Helping black girls commit genocide?

401
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,124
No. I didn't like it.

402
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,036
But I'm a peaceful man.

403
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,944
So what's the rifle about?

404
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:50,602
Remember George W. Bush in that 
flight suit, landing on the aircraft carrier?

405
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,325
All about the image.

406
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:57,058
This... armed robbery beef 
you're in for, that just image?

407
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:59,599
I was collecting reparations for slavery.

408
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,333
From a 7-eleven?

409
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,477
Look, I had issues with Gerard.

410
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:10,233
However, if you're 
suggesting I'd kill a brother?

411
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:14,517
We were way too busy getting 
spied on, lied to, informed on,

412
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:18,135
and framed-up by the U.S. 
Government to turn on each other.

413
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:20,632
You think you had an 
informant in the BLF.

414
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,366
I know there were informants.

415
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,620
And maybe Gerard was one?

416
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:26,814
It's possible.

417
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,245
Way I see it, the White 
man's got your mind,

418
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:34,127
and the White woman's
got your Jonhson.

419
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,567
She's a friend.

420
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,378
No, our friends don't come in that color.

421
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,330
What, you tellin' me who I can see?

422
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:45,518
We gotta be role models, brother Gerard.

423
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,798
Can't be running around with no 
blue eye, blond hair Barbie doll.

424
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,742
Man, you gonna turn white yourself.

425
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:54,355
In case you haven't noticed, 
the black don't rub off.

426
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:56,439
But this is serious, brother.

427
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,918
You know our secrets, man.

428
00:22:59,225 --> 00:23:01,103
You pillow talk with that girl?

429
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,162
Huh?

430
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:04,250
You can't trust no white girl.

431
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,941
This ain't real to them.

432
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:06,997
They just playing a game.

433
00:23:06,997 --> 00:23:09,582
This will never be real to them.

434
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,376
We got to have to dry clean 
this place of yours, Gerard.

435
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,313
You think I'd betray you?

436
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:26,094
Standard operating procedure.

437
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:41,430
So the Black Liberation Front thought 
Gerard was talking to the FBI.

438
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,617
Even if he was, we'd never 
use a bullet on a black man.

439
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:49,324
How'd you know it was a bullet?

440
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,727
Just a metaphor, brother man.

441
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:03,608
Thanks for meeting me here.

442
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,540
My kids are home... you know.

443
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,142
Sure.

444
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,631
These people were good to me.

445
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:12,040
I feel like they saved my life.

446
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,230
You were 17?

447
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,657
I didn't come from money, 
and I wasn't smart.

448
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,770
I wasn't gonna go to college or 
anything, but I wanted to get out.

449
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,103
Yeah.

450
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:26,257
Have a life that was bigger 
than two square miles.

451
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:30,182
If I had a baby in high school...

452
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,983
Who knew about you being pregnant?

453
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:36,199
No one, for weeks.

454
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,985
And then I told my boyfriend.

455
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:42,224
He feel the same as you?

456
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,594
Wow.

457
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:51,599
Yeah.

458
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,583
So we'll get married.

459
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:01,269
Charlie, I was thinking an abortion.

460
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:04,266
That's illegal.

461
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:07,459
How do you even...?

462
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:10,567
I'm trying to find out.

463
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,507
Renee...

464
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:14,555
I applied Pan Am.

465
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,819
Stewardess training.

466
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,697
I did real good on the test.

467
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,848
Tell them something's come up.

468
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,266
Charlie, I want to go places...

469
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:29,063
London and stuff, you know?

470
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:33,850
We can go places together.

471
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,607
No, we can't.

472
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:42,713
If we have a baby... we'll 
never even leave Fishtown.

473
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,790
You talk like your mind's made up.

474
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:57,017
I need money.

475
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:02,807
Screw you, Renee.

476
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:10,291
So you were on your own.

477
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,268
I asked around and finally 
found a girl at school

478
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:17,921
whose cousin had a number for "Jane".

479
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,283
How'd you pay for it?

480
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,274
Sold a coat and my record player.

481
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,380
And Charlie?

482
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:36,388
I thought it was best if we 
didn't have any contact.

483
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,014
But...?

484
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,605
Renee...

485
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,669
you said those people saved your life.

486
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,844
I thought I saw his truck.

487
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,632
That day?

488
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:59,052
Right before they picked me up.

489
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:07,912
I had no idea anything 
happened to those people.

490
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:15,626
I wasn't upset about it.

491
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,369
That's not what Renee said.

492
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,246
She said you wanted to get married.

493
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:22,365
That's what you were supposed 
to say if you got a girl in trouble.

494
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:24,718
So you didn't want to marry her?

495
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,159
No.

496
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,689
Excuse me.

497
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:30,377
And you were for the abortion?

498
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,369
I didn't want to get involved.

499
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,220
Then why were you at the meeting place
the day Renee went for the procedure?

500
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,844
She saw your truck, Charlie.

501
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:41,849
Look this is 35 years later.

502
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:45,917
My wife... / No one's 
talking to your wife.

503
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:51,601
I followed Renee.

504
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:55,178
Saw her meet those hippies.

505
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,121
And...?

506
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,006
I tailed the car to West Philly.

507
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:03,259
Where's Renee?

508
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:03,901
Be cool, man.

509
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,010
- Shut that door.
- She in here?

510
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,848
No, no, this is a private home.
You can't just crash in here.

511
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,071
I'm gonna call the cops.

512
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,859
No, no you don't wanna do that.

513
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,081
But look at you, you're just a kid.

514
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:15,647
How old are you?

515
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:16,588
Seventeen.

516
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,373
You want a baby at 18?

517
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:22,337
And a wife before your senior prom?

518
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:31,905
Look, how about some air, brother?

519
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,781
I cried on that hippie's 
shoulder for ten minutes.

520
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:50,445
Then what?

521
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,215
Nothing.

522
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:54,106
Home.

523
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,864
Where were you two 
hours later that day?

524
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,341
Home.

525
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,499
With anyone?

526
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:06,203
Yeah, my mom. 
She's gone now.

527
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,008
That's too bad, Charlie.

528
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:12,309
'Cause those hippies 
went missing that day.

529
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,785
Look, I didn't want Renee to do it.

530
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:19,704
But in retrospect, it was 
the right thing for me.

531
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:24,416
Did you realize that 
before or after they died?

532
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:29,406
Lil, Scotty, we got 
the FBI file on Jane.

533
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:30,518
What, they had a file?

534
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,078
And they gave it up?

535
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,243
It's public record now.

536
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:34,650
We get names of informants?

537
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,512
No, they drew the line there, 
but we did get these.

538
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:39,314
Yeah, surveillance photos 
of the Jane volunteers.

539
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:42,745
Julia and Gerard, picking up 
and dropping off women

540
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:44,860
April through June of '69.

541
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,185
This your young Renee?

542
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:49,450
That's her.

543
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,302
Then this was the day they disappeared.

544
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:53,798
Someone else was there.

545
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:56,476
Someone who took these photos 
and gave them to the Feds.

546
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:58,095
An informant.

547
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,147
That nut case Lionel was right.

548
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:03,603
Lionel thought Gerard was a snitch.

549
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,876
Gerard didn't take these.

550
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,819
So who did?

551
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,571
Informants?

552
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:16,893
Sound off the wall?

553
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:18,823
Sounds dated.

554
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:21,099
Our case is dated.

555
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:23,998
There were always rumors like that.

556
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:26,385
Looks like a parlor game at the commune,

557
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,906
trying to decide who the snitch was.

558
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:31,163
Weird.

559
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,553
It was a paranoid time.

560
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:37,343
Well, it seems there was 
someone watching Julia.

561
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,760
Then I guess it wasn't paranoia.

562
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,152
So in the parlor game, 
who'd you suspect?

563
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,571
It wasn't a suspicion.

564
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,967
Intuition?

565
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:54,713
Adam and Julia were non-monogamous.

566
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,690
He told us.

567
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,177
And I...

568
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:03,676
Had first-hand knowledge of that?

569
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,712
Yes.

570
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:10,064
Granted, I was sort of 
tripping at the time.

571
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,851
It's so fragile.

572
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,455
Can I take its picture?

573
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:37,799
These are great.

574
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:40,923
I'm documenting the movement.

575
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,299
Yeah?

576
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,560
I'm gonna do a book someday...

577
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,610
tell the story.

578
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:51,754
I love this one of Julia.

579
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:55,690
Yeah.

580
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,367
Have any of me?

581
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,724
I'll take some right now.

582
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:12,013
How about a rich Jersey girl 
beds penniless draft dodger.

583
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,235
The camera was pretty 
sophisticated for a guy like him.

584
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:23,749
It came into my mind for a 
second, but I was so flattered

585
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:28,050
that he considered me part of 
the movement I put it out again.

586
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:31,119
He ever put out that book?

587
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,722
Boss, we got some.

588
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,616
Yeah, us, too.

589
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:43,075
Adam Clarke, burning his draft card in '69.

590
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,556
He told us about that.

591
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:47,135
Problem is, Adam shouldn't 
have had a draft card in '69.

592
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:49,395
We checked his military records.
He's already served.

593
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,685
Vietnam, '66 to '67.

594
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:52,714
Really?

595
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:55,240
When Adam gets home, 
it gets more interesting.

596
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,399
He crossed state lines driving 
a "peace van" loaded with weed.

597
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,940
Arrested for drug sales.

598
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,255
Thought he was too 
disorganized for that.

599
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:05,643
The case should have 
bought him state time.

600
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,560
But then the feds took over 
jurisdiction.

601
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,416
Poof. Case went away.

602
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,988
He made a deal with them.

603
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,833
Became a CI.

604
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,709
"Stay in the movement, 
keep us informed."

605
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,925
Now those photos he had 
of Julia really make sense.

606
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,574
Black and White, long lens.

607
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:24,220
Adam Clarke: '60s babe magnet,
star of the anti-war movement.

608
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,655
And FBI informant.

609
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:27,893
That'd be big news.

610
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:28,893
Big, bad news.

611
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,940
And if Julia found out?

612
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,309
There's your motive for murder.

613
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,537
Do you mind?

614
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:40,670
Not at all.

615
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,242
I know why you're here, Lilly.

616
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:56,453
Yeah?

617
00:33:56,959 --> 00:34:01,007
I was an informant fot the FBI in 1969.

618
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,087
Go on.

619
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,431
My old case agent called.
Give me a heads up.

620
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:07,939
Questions were being asked.

621
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:10,871
They didn't give us name. / I know.

622
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:14,658
And when you told me 
about Julia and Gerard,

623
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:21,391
I... I hoped that my background 
was irrelevant, but...

624
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:24,716
it may not be.

625
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:31,017
I was surveilling them 
the day they disappeared.

626
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,101
June 3, 1969.

627
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:38,973
7:20 a.m.

628
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,430
Yeah. This guy's name is 
Charlie Rinzler.

629
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,892
I-I know who he is.

630
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,577
Is-is that all you have of him?

631
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:48,668
Oh, he was so agitated,
I reported it to my case agent.

632
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,894
The Feds ran his license,
had me follow him for a week,

633
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:54,246
but nothing much came of it.

634
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,845
So, you have photos of Charlie from the 
week after Julia and Gerard went missing?

635
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:03,056
Yeah, but nothing too exciting.

636
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,606
Can I see them anyway?

637
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:10,957
I basically followed him every 
day for a week to and from work.

638
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:14,848
He was a day worker, in construction.

639
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:18,973
Can I take these?

640
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,193
They're yours...

641
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:28,074
if I can ask a favor.

642
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:32,931
If we can keep your secret, we will.

643
00:35:37,008 --> 00:35:40,098
You worked construction back 
in the 60s, huh, Charl?

644
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,146
Yeah, couple of summers.

645
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:44,389
Remember a job at the Calvin Building,

646
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:45,390
summer of '69?

647
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,311
Putting down the foundation?

648
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,411
Maybe.

649
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:51,435
'Cause that just happens to be 
where Julia and Gerard were dumped.

650
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,542
The same week you worked there.

651
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,508
It's an amazing coincidence.

652
00:35:54,508 --> 00:35:56,877
Mm, too amazing.

653
00:35:57,215 --> 00:36:00,017
That-that can't be right.

654
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:04,127
This is you at the 
construction site, Charlie.

655
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,054
- Who the hell took that?
- Good luck you had.

656
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:08,586
That foundation was being laid

657
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:10,545
just when you needed to 
stash two dead hippies.

658
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,708
I never hurt them.

659
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,374
That guy was nice to me.

660
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,636
Long as that building was up,
you figured you were home free.

661
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,825
Too bad they want 
a parking lot there now.

662
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:24,588
It's coincidence.

663
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:26,852
That's all.

664
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:33,937
I guess I need a lawyer.

665
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,570
Update for you.

666
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:45,270
Forensics is back on the 
hair found with the bodies.

667
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,716
And?

668
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,192
It ain't Julia's.

669
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:51,545
So, there was someone else
at the scene with long, brown hair.

670
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,352
Charlie?

671
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,458
He was Nixon youth.

672
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,616
Crew cut.

673
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:57,106
How about Adam Clarke?

674
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:57,815
Long.

675
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,888
Yeah, but a lot of people 
had long hair back then.

676
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:02,185
And Adam came clean 
about being an informant.

677
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:03,621
FBI wasn't gonna confirm.

678
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,865
Put himself in harm's way.

679
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:09,427
Unless he practices what he preaches.

680
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:16,087
"People who win face the real facts
of whatever situation they're in."

681
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,849
Maybe he looked at the odds,

682
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,911
knew we'd make him as the informant,
with or without confirmation.

683
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:22,975
So he steps out ahead of us.

684
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,449
Make himself look good.

685
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:26,123
And sets up Charlie.

686
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:30,560
"Audacious action, with the element of 
surprise, will give you the upper hand."

687
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,708
We know Adam followed 
Charlie around for a week.

688
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,088
He saw where he worked.

689
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,677
Could've dumped the 
bodies there one night.

690
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:38,707
Which points right to Charlie 
if anything ever comes to light.

691
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:41,836
And Adam gets 35 years
to have a life...

692
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,497
till his luck runs out.

693
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:45,179
We got enough to compel a DNA sample?

694
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,521
I mean, this guy ain't gonna give it up.

695
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,809
He already did.

696
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,214
Those pictures, 
they were real helpful, Adam.

697
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,309
I'm glad.

698
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,142
You're an excellent photographer.

699
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:02,155
Composition, framing...

700
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,032
Especially framing.

701
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:05,858
How'd it go down, anyway?

702
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:09,091
You get sloppy that day, 
Julia and Gerard catch you?

703
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:11,656
I... don't follow.

704
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,448
Charlie didn't kill them.

705
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:14,568
Good try, though.

706
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:16,508
I never said he did.

707
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:22,289
Adam Clarke -- 
real hippie or... poser?

708
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,689
Real.

709
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:26,581
My passions were very real.

710
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:29,327
How'd you like having long hair?

711
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:31,445
All them strands blowing around.

712
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:32,856
And guess what, Adam?

713
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:36,995
One of them blew right into the plastic
bags you wrapped your friends in.

714
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:38,833
Got stuck under the tape.

715
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:41,839
A long, brown hair that don't 
belong to either of them.

716
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,113
You think I was the only guy with long 
hair those two were in contact with?

717
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:50,139
Well, the DNA on this will confirm it.

718
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:54,492
Whether you were a real 
hippie or not doesn't matter.

719
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,992
Your long hair got you in the end.

720
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:58,778
Why'd you do it Adam?

721
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:02,034
Were you against 
what "Jane" was doing?

722
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,708
I thought they were heroic.

723
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:10,249
I didn't want Julia or 
Gerard to be harmed.

724
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,922
But then they found out about you.

725
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:17,479
Pretty soon the whole movement would 
know you were a snitch for the FBI.

726
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:20,283
The Feds had me.

727
00:39:20,707 --> 00:39:22,019
I had no options.

728
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,924
How about taking responsibility?

729
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,771
Ain't that the winner's way?

730
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:31,184
I was a leader in the revolution.

731
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:35,052
We were living like it meant something.

732
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,281
I loved that life.

733
00:39:40,092 --> 00:39:42,585
Couldn't stand to give it up.

734
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:46,113
Ever wonder if Julia 
and Gerard felt that way?

735
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:49,267
Think they loved their lives?

736
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:33,339
Hey, Jules.

737
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,036
Gerard.

738
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:37,914
What are you guys doing here?

739
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,278
What's going on, Adam?

740
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:41,067
You taking our pictures?

741
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,675
I'm always taking pictures.

742
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:46,208
Yeah, what 8:00 in the morning, 
on a deserted corner?

743
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,478
I-I don't get this.

744
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,800
Oh, man.

745
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,225
This is sad.

746
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:55,736
He's a snitch.

747
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:57,049
Come on, Adam Clarke?

748
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,011
Who better?

749
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:02,087
This is crazy, right?

750
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,823
Let's...

751
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:07,641
Let's get in the car. / Adam.

752
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:09,068
Just do it, Jules.

753
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:10,925
The man of peace and 
love has a handgun?

754
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,505
No, he ain't that man at all.

755
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:14,402
Just get in the car.

756
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:27,226
Crank the radio, Gerard.

757
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:38,512
Turn it up.

758
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,940
No.

759
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,881
Adam, please, no...

760
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:07,918
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:20,813
# Youngbloods의 "Get Together" #

762
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:30,163
# Love is but the song we sing, #

763
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:35,040
# And fear's the way we die #

764
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:41,166
# You can make the mountains ring #

765
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:47,122
# Or make the angels cry #

766
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:52,890
# Know the dove is on the wing #

767
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:58,376
# And you need not know why #

768
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:01,987
# C'mon people now, #

769
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,606

773
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:24,726
# We shall surely pass #

774
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:30,165
# When the one that left us here #

775
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:36,573
# Returns for us at last #

776
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:42,632
# We are but a moments sunlight #

777
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:48,417
# Fading in the grass #

778
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:50,896
# C'mon people now, #

779
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:52,566
