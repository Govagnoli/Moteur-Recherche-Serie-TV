April 5, 1943

4
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,053
Never can get enough girls 
for all the shifts.

5
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:33,244
And heaven knows, we have to
work 24 hours a day for victory.

6
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:34,185
Sure.

7
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,791
They're a real nice bunch. 
You'll see.

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,393
Well, this here's Martha.

9
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,185
Martha, meet Alice Miller.

10
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,218
Hi there, joining the line?

11
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:44,378
I suppose.

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,069
Husband overseas?

13
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:47,810
Watch it, girls.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,619
Goodness.

15
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,921
Better get that girl a pair of slacks.

16
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,642
That's Fannie.

17
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:57,799
Dottie, this the new girl?

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,394
Yes, sir. My neighbor Alice.

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,198
Know how to work a vertical lathe.

20
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:04,173
I've never worked a day in my life.

21
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:08,427
Oh, it's no tougher than 
a sewing machine, you'll see.

22
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,781
- What is it?
- Air raid siren.

23
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,358
It's just practice.

24
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:16,320
If it was the real thing, you would
a heard the bombs already.

25
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:18,901
Lil.

26
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,673
Hey, Dana.

27
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,838
Are these the Rosie the Riveters?

28
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:26,591
Give them the parts, a few weeks,
they can build you a war plane.

29
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:28,198
How's your story going?

30
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,134
Well, this was the assignment 
nobody wanted,

31
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,536
but my great aunt was 
one of the workers and

32
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:36,083
it turns out, there is a bigger story here.

33
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,652
Martha, come meet Lilly Rush.

34
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:44,741
You're the lady detective.

35
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,103
Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,596
Martha worked with my aunt Alice.

37
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,511
A real nice gal.

38
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:54,222
Quiet as a mouse at first,
but couldn't have been sweeter.

39
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:56,671
Terrible, what happened.

40
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,752
The official story was 
she died in a fall.

41
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:01,560
But here's the thing.

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,445
The night they say she fell was 
my last night on the job.

43
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:09,475
Before I left, 
I asked the owner where Alice was,

44
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,682
wanting to say goodbye.

45
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,258
And?

46
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,536
He told me she quit, 
wasn't working there anymore.

47
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:20,324
But they found the body the next day
at the factory in her work clothes.

48
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:24,307
Could your memory be mistaken?

49
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,185
You get old, you start forgetting things,

50
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,471
you don't start making them up.

51
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,109
What was the owner's name?

52
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,745
Henry Walker. 
Mean as a snake.

53
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,051
And a drinker.

54
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,781
I could smell liquor 
on his breath that night.

55
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,627
The guy was hiding something.

56
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,486
Like, maybe Alice didn't fall.

57
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:47,382
Maybe she was pushed.

60-year-old case?

69
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:31,908
Talk about your ancients.

70
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,214
Who brought it to you, Lil?

71
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:37,816
Dana Hunter. Her great aunt died
in a factory accident, 1943.

72
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,189
Is that that pushy reporter?

73
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,093
Yeah, the pretty one, 
covers court.

74
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,069
She's doing a story 
on women of World war II,

75
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,964
met some of the factory girls 
who knew her aunt.

76
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:46,003
I don't like that Dana.

77
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,231
Yeah, that's 'cause 
she covered the chimayo job,

78
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:51,235
kept writing you had no new leads.

79
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:54,024
Truth hurts, man.

80
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,243
Anyway, now she's thinking this
accident, looks more like homicide.

81
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:00,189
Let's say it was.

82
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,392
Doer's probably dead.
Whole thing's a formality.

83
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:05,710
You just don't want to drive 
out to records and storage.

84
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,101
60 years, huh?

85
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,500
61.

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,937
Skip it. 
No one cares.

87
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,127
What's with you?

88
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,359
He's just happy.
It's his anniversary.

89
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,043
You wanna KO this one, boss?

90
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,891
Too old to matter?

91
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,189
No, take a drive.
See what's there.

92
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,420
Great, boss. Thanks.

93
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,753
Do we really need this police telegraph?

94
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:32,294
Everything we can get.

95
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,941
There's probably like one page.

96
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,216
We can blow it up.

97
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,631
60-year-old case, 
we're not gonna need much help.

98
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,182
What does the factory report say?

99
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,631
Accidental death.

100
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:47,402
Impact from the fall, broke her neck,
but..hmm, this is interesting.

101
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:49,128
Guess who found her body.

102
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,544
Uh, I give up.

103
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:52,999
Henry Walker.

104
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,007
The mean drunk.

105
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:58,712
The mean drunk who told Martha 
Alice didn't work there anymore.

106
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:01,282
September, '43.

107
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,415
Telegraph from the 39th district.

108
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:05,935
Three pages.

109
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,006
Alice Miller, age 22,

110
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:11,943
reported missing by husband,
Nelson, 11:20 in the evening.

111
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:14,233
He found two whiskey glasses 
on the kitchen table

112
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,298
when he came home, 
but no Alice.

113
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,712
She was partying with someone?

114
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,205
Henry Walker had liqour 
on his breath that night.

115
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:22,582
Drinking buddies.

116
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,392
Or more.

117
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:28,890
Problem is, Walker's dead, 1988.

118
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,874
Is anyone alive?

119
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,810
Alice's husband.

120
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,010
In East Falls.

121
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,072
I never understood 
those whiskey glasses.

122
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,428
Alice and I were teatotallers.

123
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:45,724
You were out that evening?

124
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:47,679
Seeing about getting my old job back.

125
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:50,634
Got home and don't I found those 
two glasses on the table.

126
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:51,878
What time was that?

127
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,984
Oh, eight or so.

128
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,444
I got worried enough by 11 
to notify the police.

129
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:59,098
You didn't know 
she had gone to the factory?

130
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:01,765
She quit that place the day 
I got back from the war.

131
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:04,453
So you must have been 
surprised they found her there.

132
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:06,993
I've only been back a few days,

133
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,230
I figured cross wires.

134
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,774
Maybe they got her to 
come back for one last shift.

135
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:12,952
She didn't like the job?

136
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,161
Oh, she did.

137
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,234
But she was a curtains girl.

138
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,354
What's that?

139
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:22,560
Saying was when it's curtains
for the axis, it's lace curtains for her.

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,072
So when the war was done, 
back to the kitchen?

141
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:30,159
I know it's out of fashion now 
but that's what Alice wanted.

142
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,206
I blame myself for sending her to work.

143
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:34,078
It was my idea.

144
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:44,091
Tomatoes do real well. 
So do radishes.

145
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,232
It's so difficult preparing 
Nelson's meals.

146
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,075
We won't eat that variety meat.

147
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:51,784
Our boys need the fresh
cuts more than we do.

148
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,938
Take a look, Nelson.

149
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,569
I planted our own victory garden.

150
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,829
Swell.

151
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:02,774
Alice.

152
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,151
Oh, no.

153
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,036
We knew this was coming.

154
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,223
What do I do?

155
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,984
Write me every day,

156
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,445
pray for victory.

157
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,458
It's his duty, Alice.

158
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,704
I know. I know.

159
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,702
Look here, kitten.

160
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:25,019
Women wanted.

161
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:27,138
Important war work. / No.

162
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,104
No, I couldn't possibly.

163
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,659
A lot of girls are working for victory.

164
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,092
I'm too shy.

165
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,711
I'm not cut out for that kind of thing.

166
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,701
It'll help pass time,

167
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,216
bring me home faster.

168
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,886
I'll take you to the factory Monday,
introduce you to my boss.

169
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:45,344
Kitten, give it a try.

170
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:47,954
You might surprise yourself.

171
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,044
I shoulda listened to her.

172
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,282
She was too delicate for
that kind of thing.

173
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:01,462
Ever meet Alice's boss, 
Henry Walker?

174
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,310
No, never did.

175
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,215
Know any of her factory friends?

176
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:07,739
Just our neighbor Dottie 
who got her the job.

177
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,755
Lives right over there.

178
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,710
I was Mr. Walker's secretary.

179
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,858
Good man?

180
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,403
He was a Christian man,

181
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,537
but he was in a lot of pain.

182
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,591
He lost two sons to the war.

183
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,823
Is that why he drank?

184
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,500
He wasn't a saint.

185
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,562
Think he and Alice coulda had 
a drink together before work that night?

186
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,446
Heavens, no.

187
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:46,327
He was the boss, she was...

188
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,108
She was just a factory girl.

189
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:51,272
It's probably be done before.

190
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:55,300
More likely, 
it was one of her new friends.

191
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,650
What new friends?

192
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,439
Alice has started to run 
with the fast crowd at Brill,

193
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:03,194
and they were known to hit the sauce.

194
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:04,735
So was her boss.

195
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:11,063
Once again, Mr. Walker 
and Alice were not friendly.

196
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:13,415
What was the problem?

197
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,986
A secretary doesn't tell secrets.

198
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:19,269
Mr. Walker's dead, Dottie.

199
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,566
You can't hurt him.

200
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,090
Well,

201
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:28,072
Alice did come to me one day.

202
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:31,406
I say it's rotten we girls getting 
the lowest wages.

203
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,383
Why don't you write to 
Mrs. Roosevelt about it?

204
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,181
She likes to meddle 
into unpopular causes.

205
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:38,776
Excuse me, Dottie.

206
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,562
You should be on a poster 
with that perfect wave.

207
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,816
Am I intruding?

208
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,564
I'll leave you girls.

209
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,750
Stay away from that one.

210
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,103
She's got a past.

211
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:55,250
So, how are you doing out 
on the floor?

212
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,498
I've doubled my pace on the drill press.

213
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:59,367
Well, that's fine.

214
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,988
I've noticed something, 
Dottie, the last few weeks.

215
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,645
What's that?

216
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,514
We're missing boxes of rivets.

217
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,456
Every third day, 
we're short one.

218
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:10,010
You must be counting wrong.

219
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,125
No, I'm sure of it.

220
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,896
I thought I'd tell Mr. Walker.

221
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:14,818
I wouldn't.

222
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:17,659
Someone's stealing materials like
that, it's awfully unpatriotic.

223
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,518
Alice, listen to me, now.

224
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,994
Don't mention it to Mr. Walker.

225
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,984
It sounds like something 
the boss would want to know.

226
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,872
Unless he was the one 
lifting the boxes?

227
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:34,570
Mr. Walker wasn't a saint.

228
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,754
What can you remember from 
the night Alice died, Dottie?

229
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:42,108
Big even tlike that probably stayed
in your mind pretty good.

230
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:50,854
I do recall that Mr.Walker disappeared
for quite a while that night. And...

231
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,276
that was unusual.

232
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:56,831
Were you there 
when he found Alice, the next day?

233
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,213
No.

234
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:01,601
We worked the night shift 
that evening.

235
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,689
He shouldn't have been there 
in the morning.

236
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,261
My dad worked his tail off for Brill.

237
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:23,131
If he was there that morning,

238
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:26,608
it's cuz he stayed
all night doing the books.

239
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:27,810
He do that a lot?

240
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,284
Pull all nighters?

241
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,192
Whatever it took.

242
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:33,100
What about drinking on the job?

243
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,775
Was that a regular thing?

244
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,746
He was a drunk his whole life.

245
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,218
Died of liver failure.

246
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,477
How about Alice Miller?

247
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,510
Heard she and your dad 
were getting along.

248
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,268
Look, fellars.

249
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,739
I was 17. I was thinking 
about other things.

250
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:57,074
You remember accusing him 
of skimming supplies?

251
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,477
You know about that?

252
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,458
Yeah.

253
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:07,329
My older brothers died in the war.

254
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,222
Dad felt he was owed some payback.

255
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,302
That justified the pilfering?

256
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,515
Alice shouldn't have 
brought that up to him.

257
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:19,728
So she did confront him with it.

258
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,691
Want to go to the show today?

259
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:31,823
There's something new on.

260
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,183
Yeah, what?

261
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:35,239
Think it's called Casablanca.

262
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:38,347
Take a girl your own age, 
someone from school.

263
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:41,632
Oh, they're all bunch of dumb klutz.

264
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,743
Inventory.

265
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:47,314
14 propellars, assembled, 
geared, and inspected.

266
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,002
16 for me, dad.

267
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,721
Keep 'em coming.

268
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:55,185
Um, Mr.Walker, 
can I have a moment?

269
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,730
It's about the blind rivets.

270
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,685
Yes?

271
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:08,974
They disappear with regularity, 
both the Cherry and Dupont.

272
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,641
I..I know what you're doing.

273
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,255
What?

274
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:15,650
That you're involved 
with side businesses.

275
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,782
You wanna be fired on the spot,
Ms. Miller? / No,

276
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,178
I want something else.

277
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,989
I need help.

278
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,923
There's someone named Ivan.

279
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,658
Who's Ivan?

280
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:37,409
Alice had secrets.

281
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,429
No guesses on what that all meant?

282
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:46,384
All's I know is she thanked him 
for his help.

283
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:50,750
And said she hoped to heaven 
her husband didn't find out.

284
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,679
So, who's Ivan?

285
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,298
Her boyfriend?

286
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,412
What kind of help did Alice need?

287
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,592
Whatever it was, she didn't 
want the husband knowing.

288
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,077
Sounds naughty.

289
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,217
Why would she go to the factory 
owner for help?

290
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:09,480
He had access to something 
on the side.

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,863
Underground.

292
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,251
He still a suspect?

293
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,899
Yeah, but his motive ain't clear.

294
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,470
Bank records 
always come through.

295
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,010
What have you got?

296
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,060
Alice opened up her own 
account in May, 1943,

297
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,380
made weekly deposits of 35 dollars.

298
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,598
Her factory salary.

299
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:26,428
Makes sense.

300
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:29,289
And it keeps making sense 
until July, '43,

301
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:31,240
when 2000 bucks shows up.

302
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,934
How's a woman in 1943 get 
that kind of money?

303
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,960
Like I said, naughty.

304
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,019
Your mind goes right to the gutter.

305
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,304
Who wants to bet me?

306
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,358
I do.

307
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,016
Twenty bucks.

308
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,647
Going to court, boss.

309
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,826
Dana dug through her attic last night,

310
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,603
got something for me.

311
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:52,895
Send her my regards.

312
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,092
Never heard of Ivan.

313
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,132
Me neither.

314
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,253
Where'd you hear the name?

315
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,398
Just came up in the investigation.

316
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:04,978
Maybe part of her new crowd 
from the factory.

317
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:07,631
Nelson tells me Alice was a writer.

318
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:08,711
Yeah?

319
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,065
Poems, short stories.

320
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:12,246
She was too shy to let anyone 
read them.

321
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:16,931
She always said everyone had 
at least one story 
that could stop your heart.

322
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,227
So you take after her.

323
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,374
I'll let you gals talk.

324
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:24,957
You know, if you pack your lunch,
you wouldn't have to pay 6 dollars to eat.

325
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:26,994
Child of the Depression.

326
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:28,936
You're a frugal man.

327
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:31,044
Alice lived with the crash, too.

328
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,330
She understood.

329
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,592
A lesser woman might have 
minded it, not her.

330
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,360
Bye.

331
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,179
For years, people tried to 
set him up after Alice died,

332
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,185
and he'd just say,

333
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,943
I've had my wife.

334
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,104
So, what'd you find in the attic?

335
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,345
Oh, her diaries.

336
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,595
These cover the early forties.

337
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,773
Maybe she wrote about Ivan.

338
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:02,800
Badminton with the gang.

339
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,457
That was a big sport 
with 43.

340
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,030
Took the Pennsy Railroad 
to visit her mother.

341
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,183
Amtrak hadn't made the scene yet.

342
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:13,093
Anyone find Henry Walker or Ivan?

343
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,523
Looking.

344
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,590
Rations on beef means eggs 
or horsemeat for supper.

345
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,719
Horsemeat? 
Now that's a deal breaker.

346
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,781
Oh, pay dirt.

347
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:24,918
Ivan?

348
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,274
Henry.

349
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:31,638
June, 12, 1943,
Henry sent me to Smokies dance hall.

350
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,827
I'm looking for the owner, Richard.

351
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,841
Not here. / Oh.

352
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:58,665
Maybe I can help you.

353
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,778
I doubt it.

354
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,869
What do you want from Richard?

355
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:03,991
Nylons?

356
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,050
Liquor?

357
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,483
Certainly not.

358
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,931
Black market's his specialty.

359
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:11,454
That's not what I'm after.

360
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:15,729
Old stag with soda, Bruno.
You drinking?

361
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,630
I have to get home.

362
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,756
For what?

363
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,628
Not the husband or kids.

364
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:23,299
Dr. IQ on the radio?

365
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,067
Maybe I will have a drink.

366
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,776
Two on the house.

367
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,882
Lonesome, ain't it?

368
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,381
All the men overseas.

369
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:41,026
Can be.

370
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,740
They tell you at work to 
steer clear of me?

371
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,970
Account of my checkered past?

372
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,470
No details.

373
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,844
Just to keep your distance.

374
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,482
What did you do?

375
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:57,037
They say I shot my husband.

376
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,760
And I did, too.

377
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:01,669
But I had a reason.

378
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:05,401
Did you kill him?

379
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,132
Just blew up his shoulder.

380
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:10,940
He ran off after that.

381
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:15,880
So why did you come to Smokies, 
huh?

382
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:21,683
I came because I believed 
what you said.

383
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,732
End of entry.

384
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,063
She believed what Fannie 
said when?

385
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:32,593
Who's Fannie?

386
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,109
One of the factory girls.

387
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,702
D'you think she really 
shot her husband?

388
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,459
Better find out.

389
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,431
I'll go with ya.

390
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,682
I'd like to meet an 80-year-old 
who shot a guy.

391
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:53,649
Me and Alice, 
we started out kinda shaky,

392
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:56,347
but then we got along.

393
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:59,562
We pulled an arrest record 
from 1940, Fannie.

394
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:00,986
Not my best year.

395
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:03,956
Seems you've shot your husband
in a late night dispute?

396
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:07,237
Not until he took a screwdriver 
to my head.

397
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:10,132
Yeah, that's in there, too.

398
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,893
You didn't have any reason 
to hurt Alice, did you?

399
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,242
No, sir.

400
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,237
I loved that girl.

401
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:22,377
You two must have been 
an odd pair.

402
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:25,526
War time made for 
unusual companions.

403
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,788
All the men were away

404
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:30,436
and you made friends 
where you could find them.

405
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:32,597
So you and Alice were friends 
with each other?

406
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:37,495
Making B-25's together,
it kinda bonds you.

407
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:40,379
Did you ever hear her 
talk about Ivan?

408
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:41,635
Sure.

409
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,282
Who was he?

410
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:45,478
Her cousin in Europe.

411
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,859
You see, her family was Jewish.

412
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:51,797
She hadn't heard from Ivan in months
which worried her

413
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,992
and I told her she had good 
reason to worry.

414
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:11,499
I met this seaman last night 
at Smokies.

415
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:14,511
You meet a seaman every night 
at Smokies.

416
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,310
Anyone bring stockings to donate?

417
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,060
I did.

418
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,968
Penciling in your own seams looks
just as nice as your nylons.

419
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:25,326
Matter of opinion.

420
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:29,337
Smoking now, are we?

421
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:31,684
Just on breaks.

422
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:38,108
So this here sailor just came back
from Europe.

423
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:41,138
He says there's real bad things
happening over there.

424
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,946
Like what?

425
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:44,551
Like there's these camps.

426
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,456
For Jews.

427
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:48,800
We're doing the same to the Japs.

428
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,586
Except these aren't just 
internment camps.

429
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,337
Then what are they?

430
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,551
They're killing people there.

431
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:59,826
We'd be hearing it on Ed Murrow
if that were true.

432
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,588
You sure they're doing that to Jews?

433
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:05,071
Herding them up, 
taking them off to die.

434
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:06,719
I don't believe it.

435
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,542
Neither do I.

436
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:17,811
It seems crazy now,

437
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:23,461
but most people didn't know the truth
until the Liberation.

438
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:26,736
So Alice was trying to help Ivan.

439
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,728
Smokies' owner was 
a Portuguese fellar,

440
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,120
Richard.

441
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,309
Had a contact in the consulate 
that could be helpful to her.

442
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,721
For a fee.

443
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:42,728
Said for 2000 dollars, he would
smuggle Ivan into Lisbon.

444
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,985
The amount in the bank acount.

445
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:48,996
Oh so, she got the money?

446
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,786
Any idea how?

447
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,961
Well, no thanks to her husband.

448
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,101
So, Nelson did know Ivan?

449
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:58,942
Oh sure, 
and Alice begged him to help,

450
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:01,483
but he wouldn't budge.

451
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,733
Thought you didn't know 
who Ivan was, Nelson.

452
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,772
You forget he was 
your wife's cousin?

453
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:14,910
No.

454
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:17,040
Then what?

455
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:19,618
I wanna cooperate.

456
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,847
It's a funny way of showing it.

457
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:24,231
I brought these letters.

458
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,885
All the correspondents from the war.

459
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,895
Let's not lose focus.
Why did you lie about Ivan?

460
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:32,843
Because I didn't believe her,
I didn't think he was in danger.

461
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:35,735
This one's from Alice, June, '43,

462
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,324
asking me for the money.

463
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,243
Telling you what she heard 
about the camps?

464
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,402
I was in Europe. 
I never heard such a thing.

465
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:45,624
I thought it was just gossip that 
she'd picked up at the factory.

466
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:49,021
And you're a frugal man.

467
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:52,016
So I wrote back, said no.

468
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:53,615
Few months later,

469
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,794
Ivan was dead.

470
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,964
So how did you figure 
Alice came by that two K?

471
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,501
I don't know how,

472
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:04,845
but with these letters, 
you can tell when.

473
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,924
What do you mean?

474
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:11,049
She wrote about him in every letter 
until July, 11th.

475
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,558
But she doesn't mention him again.

476
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,243
So the problem was solved by then?

477
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,511
- Could we hang on to these?
- Please.

478
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,684
I'm sorry I lied.

479
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,131
I just..

480
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,354
I've been so ashamed of this 
for 60 years.

481
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,808
Between the diaries and letters,

482
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,720
we know Alice got that money 
July, 10th.

483
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,366
A month after she started 
trying to raise it.

484
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,236
Could be the month Ivan died.

485
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:45,079
So what happened that day, 
July, 10th.

486
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,447
She worked the day shift

487
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:49,622
and then there was a 
swing for victory dance at Smokies.

488
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,553
Smokies again.

489
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,001
Figure something happened 
that night.

490
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,667
Someone she met there gave 
her the two K.

491
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,431
In exchange for what?

492
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,277
Let's recreate that night, 
go back to Smokies

493
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:03,492
and take Fannie and Martha with us.

494
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:05,259
Well, the place is still around.

495
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,866
An Italian restaurant now.

496
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:07,931
There you go.

497
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,681
Scotty found the old owner, Richard.

498
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,014
Retired in Merriam.

499
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:12,883
Well, between the three of them,

500
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:15,302
maybe they can piece 
together Alice's night.

501
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:17,337
Let's take a field trip.

502
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,750
Oh.

503
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,225
Lordy, I spent a lot of hours in here.

504
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:37,034
Makes me feel twenty again.

505
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,990
You swing?

506
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:41,829
- Excuse me?
- She means dance.

507
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:43,982
Right, no.

508
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,942
I'm a two left feet guy.

509
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,133
For good time, girls.

510
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,489
Richard.

511
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,314
Francesca.

512
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:57,185
Martha.

513
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:00,746
I'm John Stillman.
And this is Lilly Rush.

514
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:02,591
How do you do?

515
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,278
You remember our friend Alice Miller?

516
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,978
A real swell girl palled around 
with us the summer of '43.

517
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:11,525
Sure.

518
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:15,820
There was one night in particular.
The swing for victory dance?

519
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,025
Big business that night.

520
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,857
I worked the bar with Bruno.

521
00:26:20,857 --> 00:26:24,902
Oh, and I met a real nice marine.

522
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:30,363
And Alice and I were dancing, 
collecting a quarter a song.

523
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:49,381
That makes three dollars even.

524
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:51,037
Martha.

525
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:54,734
Was that serviceman getting 
fresh with you?

526
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:57,760
Yes, lucky thing you came by.

527
00:26:58,198 --> 00:26:59,898
Oil us up, Richard.

528
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:00,994
What you drinking?

529
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,028
Rum and coca-cola.

530
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:06,915
Saw you out there breaking hearts,
Alice.

531
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:09,078
With that neckline 
who could overlook her?

532
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:10,640
Is it too low?

533
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,969
It's just not the Alice 
we met a few months ago.

534
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,620
I suppose it's just nice having 
some men our age around again.

535
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,063
They'll all be shipped off again soon.

536
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:22,116
Then it's back to us girls and 
gimps with bad teeth.

537
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:25,402
We are not all 4-F.

538
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,050
20 dollars for every dance
the rest of the night.

539
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,896
Why, Buddy.

540
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,528
Starting right now.

541
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,069
You gotta stop this.

542
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,902
You're selling your dances,
I'm buying it.

543
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:36,412
You can't keep following me.

544
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:37,892
Behave yourself, Buddy.

545
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,990
Don't treat me like a kid.

546
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,290
You are a kid.

547
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,060
I'm old enough to go kill people,
I'm old enough to be with you.

548
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,264
Lays it right out, don't he.

549
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:49,664
Let's go for a walk.

550
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:58,564
So, Henry's son was there?

551
00:27:58,564 --> 00:27:59,978
I've forgotten that.

552
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,945
And Alice left with him?

553
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:04,571
Don't think I saw her 
the rest of the night.

554
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:09,198
The boy was pretty determined 
to get her alone.

555
00:28:09,198 --> 00:28:11,651
Oh, Buddy had it bad for Alice.

556
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:14,995
And I've forgotten about 
that marine, too.

557
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,629
Oh look him up,

558
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:19,449
maybe he'll get fresh 
with you again.

559
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:27,492
This Richard who owned 
the dance hall had a colorful career.

560
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:32,757
He was a horse bookie, graftman, and
proprietor of house of assignation.

561
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:34,532
A house of what?

562
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,773
That's polite for whore house.

563
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:40,475
I'm calling it a night, guys.

564
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,280
Crap, I gotta get home.

565
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,764
You wanna hit the Black Sheep,
have a pint?

566
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,878
Nah, I'm good.

567
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:54,164
You talking to Elisa at all?

568
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,521
She's back in the hospital.

569
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:58,888
Oh, I didn't know, Scotty.

570
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,690
It's a circle game.

571
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,094
She's sick and better,

572
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:07,196
and for a while you're hoping 
and then

573
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,601
it starts again.

574
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:10,313
Yeah.

575
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,073
I just can't go round and round 
with her any more.

576
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,395
So I was sweet on Alice.

577
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:34,420
So what?

578
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,955
Sweet can turn to sour on a dime.

579
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:40,835
And if it's so what, why not tell us
that in our first conversation.

580
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:42,951
It's just a kid's crush.

581
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:46,457
20 bucks in 1943 was 
a lot of money to throw down.

582
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:50,406
Where does a 17-year-old get 
a cash like that? / My dad.

583
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:53,633
Tell us what happened when you
and Alice went walking after the dance.

584
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:54,872
What's it matter?

585
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,674
That wasn't the night she died.

586
00:29:56,674 --> 00:29:59,798
Then you don't mind telling us 
about it.

587
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,771
Oh, jiminy

588
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,747
We didn't go walking.

589
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,707
We went driving.

590
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:36,821
How do you come by gasoline for 
this big old car in times like these?

591
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,035
My dad has his ways.

592
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,741
Sorry, Alice. Honest.

593
00:30:45,741 --> 00:30:47,714
I lost my cool.

594
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,380
Okay.

595
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:57,311
So, why are you trying to make money?

596
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,628
To help someone.

597
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:00,952
Who?

598
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:05,805
It's complicated. 
Never mind about it.

599
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,833
You and your secrets.

600
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,387
Well, I got a secret, too.

601
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:11,727
What's that?

602
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:13,715
My dad has an account for me.

603
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,348
For when I go to college.

604
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:16,517
Yeah?

605
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,804
Wants me to take it and run away.

606
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:20,723
Wait out the war.

607
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:22,475
He doesn't wanna lose a third son.

608
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:25,147
Yeah, but no amount of money's 
gonna make me run.

609
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:31,265
I want to serve. Soon as I turn 18,
do like my brothers did.

610
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,518
I want you to have the money.

611
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,619
I couldn't.

612
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:45,683
I know I'm just a kid to you.

613
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:48,740
Buddy, you're a swell kind of guy

614
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,102
and you're gonna find a girl 
who's just right for you.

615
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:53,138
Will you wait for me?

616
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,003
I can't.

617
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:56,842
I ain't scared of dying.

618
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,653
Don't say that.

619
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:01,054
But I am scared of going

620
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:04,557
never having kissed you.

621
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,660
Well, here's the dirty shame.

622
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,966
You're at that window day and night,
aren't you, Dottie.

623
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,127
I was simply walking Lady.

624
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:17,288
Weren't spying at all.

625
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:19,025
You should be ashamed 
of yourself, Buddy.

626
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:19,874
I'm not.

627
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:23,008
But you're a red-blooded youth,
it's almost understandable.

628
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,406
Please, Dottie.

629
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:27,088
You have a good man overseas 
and he deserves better.

630
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:29,154
- Someone like you, you mean?
- Maybe so.

631
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:30,423
I know you'd love that.

632
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:36,417
- Well, listen to the five cent tramp.
- Says the fussy old maid.

633
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:47,731
So you gave her the money.

634
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,732
2000 bucks, no questions asked.

635
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:53,267
That old maid comment must 
have hit below the belt.

636
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:55,357
Especially back then.

637
00:32:55,357 --> 00:33:00,379
A girl who wasn't married was 
considered a real flop.

638
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:06,758
And I guess Dottie was pretty 
in love with Alice's husband.

639
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:10,087
That could make you wanna 
take a girl out.

640
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,954
Arrange for an accident.

641
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:19,367
We've been your letters, Dottie.

642
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,543
I don't know what you mean.

643
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,191
War time correspondence.

644
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,780
Dear Nelson,

645
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,094
how empty the neighborhood feels 
with you gone.

646
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,101
He gave you that?

647
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:37,400
I hear the radio reports
every night

648
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,201
and think of my brave soldier
fight in the axis.

649
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:45,402
Now, why are you calling someone
else's husband my soldier?

650
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:49,576
Are you accusing me of having 
an affair with Nelson?

651
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:51,994
No. We ain't.

652
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:55,125
Boy, that Alice had all the luck.

653
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,642
Popular at work, more popular 
than you ever were.

654
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,150
I wasn't interested in that.

655
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,615
Painting town nights 
with the new girlfriends,

656
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,390
going to the show, dancing.

657
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,721
Teenage boys falling for her right
there on the street for all to see.

658
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,341
Why couldn't some stuff like
that happen to you?

659
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,920
Why were you an old maid and 
she was the girl of the hour?

660
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,142
So you know about that night with Buddy?

661
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:19,466
She had sweethearts to spare 
and you had none.

662
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,201
All you wanted was Nelson.

663
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:24,837
And factory accidents did happen.

664
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:29,897
Alice was changing, straying.

665
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:32,327
I felt Nelson should know.

666
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:35,608
So you wrote to him. 
Real faithful.

667
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:38,173
Maybe he'd get the drift, 
you'd make the better wife?

668
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:40,888
How did it go when he got back?

669
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,865
You make a move?

670
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:45,181
He came home wounded

671
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,530
and it was plain as day

672
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,488
that Alice didn't know how to be 
a good wife anymore.

673
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:54,350
Real nice you'd bring pie, Dottie.

674
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,727
Blueberry, too.

675
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,874
Nelson's favorite.

676
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:59,004
Kind of a welcome home.

677
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,808
Got any vanilla ice cream, 
Alice? Make it a la mode.

678
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,652
No, I don't.

679
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:06,293
I noticed the victory garden's dead.

680
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:08,613
I didn't keep it up.

681
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:10,901
House could use a dusting, too.

682
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:14,060
No pie for me, Dottie.
I'm off to the night shift.

683
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,696
I would think that now that Nelson's
home, you'd be done at the factory.

684
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,041
Easy.

685
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,656
Oh heavens, I'm sorry.

686
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:22,913
Try this, dear.

687
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:24,684
Since when is there a whiskey 
in the house?

688
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,014
I bought it for your pain.

689
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,440
Do you mean to say Alice that 
you are going to keep on at Brill

690
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,418
even with Nelson home?

691
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:34,204
Turns out I like it there.

692
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:35,181
Do you now.

693
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,630
It's nice feeling useful.

694
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,849
Do you know, Nelson,
I helped build 14 B-25 Mitchells.

695
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,293
My.

696
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,643
Plus having my own paycheck.

697
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,061
I give you your allowance.

698
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,999
It just feels different 
when you earned it yourself.

699
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:53,123
Well, I work because I'm a single gal.

700
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:57,081
If I were married, I'd be more than
content to just keep house,

701
00:35:57,081 --> 00:36:01,678
do the washing, bake pies.

702
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:04,867
I made some nice friends 
at the factory, too.

703
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,407
Yeah, I heard about your friends,

704
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:11,038
in particular a young teenage friend.

705
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:23,965
I'll take this to Martha,
it's her last shift tonight.

706
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,485
More pie?

707
00:36:35,678 --> 00:36:37,589
But he didn't go for it, huh?

708
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:38,837
No.

709
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:44,051
I'm sure it's amusing to you 
young people, but to this day,

710
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,000
I would jump for Nelson 
if he wanted me.

711
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,090
But he wanted Alice.

712
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,756
Even after she changed so.

713
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:54,767
Now, did he go the factory that night

714
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:58,568
to set his wife flying
straight again?

715
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:01,952
You were real helpful giving us 
Mr. Walker, Dottie.

716
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:04,056
Is that because you were 
protecting someone else?

717
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:08,315
- Nelson is a good man.
- Come on now, Dot.

718
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:11,802
He ain't gonna choose you.

719
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:25,080
I saw him with Mr. Walker that night.

720
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,092
Where?

721
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:30,957
They went in to his office late,

722
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,288
stayed about an hour.

723
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:36,722
You were pretty surprised
to see Nelson there?

724
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,167
Yes.

725
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:40,675
But?

726
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:43,819
A secretary doesn't tell secrets.

727
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:48,196
Plus, all those feelings 
you had for him.

728
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:55,942
Nelson just wanted the wife that
he had before he went away.

729
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:59,588
That war changed everybody.

730
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:04,115
So, news on Alice?

731
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,655
I talked to Dottie.

732
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:11,324
Is that right?

733
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:16,668
You knew Alice put those whiskey
glasses out that night.

734
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,232
And that she went to the factory,

735
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,552
cuz you went there, too.

736
00:38:30,152 --> 00:38:32,049
Dottie said that?

737
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,912
Was it the boy?

738
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,449
Or that she didn't need 
allowance any more.

739
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:43,942
Didn't make you nice 
home-made pies?

740
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:45,650
You learned a lot.

741
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,623
It's my job.

742
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:51,600
Well, you're good at it.

743
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:55,798
I've been reading Alice's diaries.

744
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:58,886
Told you she could write.

745
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:01,413
Did you know she was 
so terrified her

746
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:04,972
first morning of work she got sick
in the girls' room?

747
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:05,989
No.

748
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:10,368
Almost left at lunch time but 
she felt her skills were so poor.

749
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,618
I didn't know that.

750
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:14,832
And she was so filthy 
at the end of that day

751
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:17,413
that she got looks 
from the men on the bus

752
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:23,095
who surely take a dim view of 
working girls in grubby slacks.

753
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:27,790
It wasn't easy for her making 
that change. / No.

754
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:30,981
But she was brave,

755
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:35,846
and cleared the way for the people
coming behind her.

756
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,301
I loved her.

757
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,627
Then honor her,

758
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:52,769
tell the rest of her story.

759
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:59,455
I just went there to ask her 
to come home.

760
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:02,645
What's so terrible about that?

761
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:07,427
Nothing.

762
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:13,770
The factory owner saw 
something, didn't he?

763
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,924
How'd you keep him quiet?

764
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:20,979
I gave him my war bonds.

765
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,821
I was only away six months,

766
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:30,964
but it was like I didn't know the girl
I came home to.

767
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,523
What are you doing here?

768
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:04,535
We need to talk, kid.

769
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:07,612
You should be home, 
you're injured.

770
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,912
I'm sorry, kitten.

771
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,122
Okay.

772
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:17,290
Stop all this foolishness and 
get on to home.

773
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,671
I'm not off till six.

774
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:22,153
Forget this place.

775
00:41:22,153 --> 00:41:24,719
I don't think I can.

776
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:28,666
I don't care about the boy,

777
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:31,036
what Dottie told me.

778
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:38,319
I still wanna have a life with you, 
Nelson. I do love you.

779
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,714
I love you, kitten.

780
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:43,384
It has to be a different kind 
of life now. I changed.

781
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,677
We'll give it six months.

782
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,862
- You'll change back.
- No.

783
00:41:49,168 --> 00:41:52,775
I couldn't bare to sit home,

784
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,150
not making anything of the day,
having no company.

785
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,205
Not now, knowing what I can do.

786
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:02,605
There's a whole rich life I can 
have besides being a wife.

787
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,581
It's enough now.

788
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:09,317
- It's that or it's nothing.
- Alice, you cut it out.

789
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,378
Nelson, let me go.

790
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,478
