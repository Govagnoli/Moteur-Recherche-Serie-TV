***********

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,009
April 18,2003

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,009
Do I miss you?

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,049
Only when I breathe.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,379
Take-out tuesday,brent...your favorite.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,999
Take-out tuesday,my favorite.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,379
Ruby,off the phone.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,609
I got to go.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,359
Ruby,it's almost 6:30.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,379
It's not like you didn't see
the boy a couple of hours ago.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,099
Yeah. Me,too.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,859
Totally.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,139
Doug says hi.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,839
Hi,doug.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,269
His parents still on the outs?

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,279
If that's what you want to call it.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,559
We're going to study later,if that's okay?

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,039
Study?

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,469
Yeah,dad,study. Over here.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,349
'Cause the racket at his house
makes it,like,totally impossible.

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,159
Somehow I doubt that's the only reason.

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,409
can I just eat in my room? I'm starving.

23
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,759
Ruby,you can wait 30 seconds.

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,409
did you ever think that maybe
sammy likes yellow,brent?

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,449
- No.
- Well,what if he does?

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,429
- What if he loves yellow?
- Ruby...

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,139
I'm sure sammy hates yellow,

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,549
- just like you do.
- Three red flakes,

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,679
two blue,one green,no yellow.

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,619
That's what sammy likes.

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,549
That's exactly what
sammy will get,because...

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,289
dinnertime.

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,419
So this kid,brent harris?

34
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,719
Yeah,one of the orderlies told me
about him when I was here on a dhs job.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,349
Parents were killed three years ago?

36
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,499
Well,found in their car.

37
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,029
.38 caliber rounds to the chest,neck.

38
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,409
Well,it says here this kid,brent,was
at home when it happened.

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,479
But you think he knows something?

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,989
Well,all I know is,I mention his parents'
murder,and he blurts out this number.

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,919
What kind of number?

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,119
It's a long one. I don't know.

43
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,759
All right,we're here for a number?

44
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,719
Look,a lot of people with autism have
rotograph memories. Details matter

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,849
,and I figured since I'm familiar
with this ace detective...

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,129
you mean me,right?

47
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,609
Yeah. I thought it'd be worth a shot.

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,619
I should warn you,though.
He's,uh... he's not real friendly.

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,759
I ain't lookin' for a friend.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,389
He used to be real high-functioning.

51
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,129
- But not anymore?
- No,not since his parents died.

52
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,109
Good luck.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,029
Brent?

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,859
I'm detective rush,and this
is my partner,detective valens.

55
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,579
We want to talk to you about
what happened to your parents.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,289
They died three years ago.

57
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,139
They were murdered.

58
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,419
065739.1.

59
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,139
What does that number have to do
with your parents' murder,brent?

60
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,709
065739.1.

61
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,389
Brent. Did you hear the question?

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,689
Brent,does that number
mei somethicb or what?

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,589
It's a wild-goose chase.

64
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,889
Yeah.

65
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,829
Kid doesn't even understand the question.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,389
It means something,scotty.

67
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,179
What?

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,489
Harrises' car,night of the murder?

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,519
Look at the odometer reading.

70
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,269
The same number the kid's been saying.

71
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,299
Down to the exact tenth of a mile.

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,289
Yeah,but that car was impounded.
How could he know that?

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,209
'Cause he was there.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,499
He saw his parents murdered?

75
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,899
065739.1.

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,919
steve and lisa harris.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,029
Gunned down a block away from their house.

81
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,959
Theory was a carjacking gone wrong.

82
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,489
Cold from the start. No suspects,no nothing.

83
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,649
According to the daughter's statement, parents
were on their way to the local drive-thru.

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,359
These people had some serious bad luck.

85
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,809
Six months prior to getting whacked,
their tropical fish store burnt down.

86
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,979
Daughter said brent was with her at home
waiting for her parents to come back.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,039
Well,now we know he was in the car.

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,699
- So why'd she lie?
- Good question.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,839
So this brent,can he count
cards,toothpicks,what?

90
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,869
All we know is he can't show emotion.

91
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,669
Got to be rough, being a
parent to a kid like that.

92
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,589
No hugs,no affection.

93
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,829
I can't imagine.

94
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,059
Brent, your sister said
you were home with her.

95
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,459
Why would she say that?

96
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,379
Did you see your parents murdered,brent?

97
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,869
065739.1.

98
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,049
Did you see who did it?

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,889
Do you remember anything
from that night,brent?

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,689
Anything at all?

101
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,089
look,you were in the car,brent.

102
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,919
You saw the odometer number,065739.1.

103
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,199
What did you see before the numbers changed?

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,849
What did you see when the
number was 065739 point zero?

105
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,989
065739 point zero.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,379
Yeah. What happened?

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,409
The light turned red.

108
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,329
"Are you high"?

109
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,229
Uh,the killer was wearing those shoes,brent?

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,099
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

111
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,879
He tell you anything else?

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,849
Yeah. Um... killer's shoes.

113
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,529
"Are you high" was written on them.

114
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,589
- Are you high. I went there.
- Come again.

115
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,649
Ritter union high school. That's
what all the kids called it.

116
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,549
So the doer went to the
same school as brent.

117
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,109
It's not such a bad idea,
me bringing you down here.

118
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,429
Serious lead on a double.

119
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,669
Not too shabby.

120
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,729
Maybe you should deputize
me like in the old west.

121
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,759
catch up with you in a second?

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,829
So,um... I know it's been
kind of hectic lately.

123
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,959
What's going on,lil?

124
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,899
An old friend's in trouble.

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,759
What kind?

126
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,109
A long story. It'S...

127
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,499
no. I mean,what nd of friend.

128
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:08,409
He,uh... he asked me to marry him once.

129
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,209
You never told me that.

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,479
Just a dumb pipe dream.

131
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,839
Ray's not the settling down type.

132
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,599
And you are?

133
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,689
It doesn't matter.

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,809
I'm here with you.

135
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,869
Are you?

136
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,679
Foster parents don't let me
out of this pit, but whatever.

137
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,839
I visit brent every weekend.

138
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,549
Barely says a word.

139
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,089
How'd you guys get him to open up?

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,489
Asked him about your parents' murders.

141
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,549
Rattled off a bunch of
numbers at the mention of it.

142
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,949
Well,I guess that's good, right?

143
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,189
I mean,if he can do that,
maybe he'll be ready.

144
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,449
Ready for what?

145
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,209
Living with me.

146
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,419
I'm turning 18,moving out.

147
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,979
You know,he's the only family I've got left.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,469
So,why'd you lie to the cops,ruby?
Say brent was at home with you?

149
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,279
I didn't lie.

150
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,639
He was home in his room.

151
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,359
No possibility you're wrong?

152
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,709
I was on the phone.

153
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,299
I just assumed. I mean,it
was take-out tuesday.

154
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,579
Take-out tuesday?

155
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,879
Yeah. Every tuesday night, my parents would bring
back take-out while I stayed home with brent,

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,049
- unless...
- unless what?

157
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,949
to people with autism,
routine is everything.

158
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,629
So?

159
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,149
So sometimes,my parents
would bring him along.

160
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,839
You know,try to get him used to change.

161
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,179
So this could've been a practice run?

162
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,409
What does this have to do with
what happened to my mom and dad?

163
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,099
We think brent was in the car
when the murders took place.

164
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,029
- No.
- And he saw the killer's shoes.

165
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,189
The words "are you high"
were graffitied on 'em.

166
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,589
The guy who killed my parents
went to my high school?

167
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,749
Anyone come to mind?

168
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,349
Yeah. A big tagger.

169
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,349
Even bigger jerk.

170
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,389
no touching

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,829
oh,crap.

172
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,519
No,no,no. No,no.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,199
- Here we go again.
- Brent?

174
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,059
Ruby to the rescue.

175
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,019
I thought we was tight, brent,huh? Homies.

176
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,149
I thought we shared our work.

177
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,689
No-no touching,no touching.

178
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,709
now,give me the math homework.

179
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,349
No touching! No touching!

180
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,629
Why you got to be getting all
selfish on me? Withhold the love...

181
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,429
leave him alone!

182
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,819
Little miss thang, getting all gangsta.

183
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,519
Look who's talking,moron.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,599
Stealing brent's math
homework when you're,like,19.

185
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,599
Least I ain't the one
with dumbo in my family.

186
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,489
No! You just act like you're
not lily-white from the suburbs.

187
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,969
- Shut up before I cap you!
- Bring it on,dumbo!

188
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,099
Hey,you want to mess with my girl?

189
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,829
I- I ain't got no beef with you.

190
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,109
See,you mess with brent, you mess with me.

191
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,829
That goes for all of you.

192
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,939
You touch my brother
again, and I will kill you!

193
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,599
Not if I kill you first,skank.

194
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,399
You say something, punk-ass?

195
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,779
No,dawg,I ain't say nothing.

196
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,869
I didn't think so.

197
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,959
Know what happened to this jackass?

198
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,869
Yeah,he dropped out of school
after my parents were killed.

199
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,209
So maybe he goes after some payback
on ruby or brent, wearing those shoes.

200
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,429
But the parents got in the way.

201
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,439
got to say, not bad for a
white kid from the 'burbs.

202
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,899
Or for a punk beats up
the special needs kids.

203
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,429
I don't even know what that means.

204
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,009
Ruby harris humiliates you
in front of all your friends.

205
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,549
And her parents wind up dead.

206
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,459
Ruby harris...

207
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,339
I do her?

208
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,469
brent harris's sister.

209
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,829
The autistic kid.

210
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,149
Oh,dumbo!

211
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,299
Yeah,dumbo that wouldn't let
you cheat off his math test.

212
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,309
Why do you think I dropped out of school?

213
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,999
When dumbo's lapping you, it's time to go.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,029
Killer wore shoes,like the
ones you're wearing now,greg.

215
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,909
That's impossible.

216
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,949
I mean,these dogs ain't even that old.

217
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,299
I just made 'em this past year.

218
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,739
So maybe you were wearing a prototype.

219
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,289
Lady,you know how many pairs of
shoes I've customized for people?

220
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,739
We're only interested in one pair.

221
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,559
Said "are you high" on them.

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,609
That narrows it to,like,a hundred.

223
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,709
So you just let it go,then?

224
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,469
Ruby dissing you in front of all your pals?

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,169
I didn't just let it go. But I
sure the hell didn't kill nobody.

226
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,209
What did you do?

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,039
I got some practice in.

228
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,889
Wasn't my finest work,but...

229
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,829
Principal's office.

230
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,119
What the hell happened?

231
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,809
Brent,mom and dad are here,all right?

232
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,109
We're going to take you home.

233
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,209
So you can see sammy.

234
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,759
He misses you.

235
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,109
Sammy's a fish. He doesn't miss people.

236
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,689
Did you do this?

237
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,979
Do what? I'm here for a
student council meeting,dawg.

238
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,199
- Mr. And mrs. Harris, I am so sorry.
- Sorry?

239
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,419
You promised you'd have
someone looking out for brent.

240
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,879
- The state mandates it.
- The state bud

241
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,679
gets one special needs counselor
for the entire ninth grade.

242
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,069
I can't tell you how sick to
death we are of your excuses.

243
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,499
If you have a problem with the way
the special needs program is run...

244
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,429
don't you dare tell us to write
another letter or call the school board,

245
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
because we've already
done that a dozen times!

246
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,779
It's okay. It's over.

247
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,179
We are officially withdrawing
brent from your school.

248
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,019
Well,that is your prerogative.

249
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,089
You're glad,aren't you?

250
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,649
I think brent might be
happier in another school,yes.

251
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,389
But I know the alternatives are expensive.

252
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,109
Yeah,they are expensive.

253
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,339
Too expensive.

254
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,319
There's no turning back now.

255
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,349
Come on,brent.

256
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,999
it's time for plan b

257
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,609
Plan b?

258
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,739
Any idea what that could've meant?

259
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,979
Hey,I'm the guy who needed to
cheat off the dummy,remember?

260
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,269
I been reading up on autism.

261
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,069
- Yeah?
- They can't lie.

262
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,749
Incapable of it.

263
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,539
No kidding.

264
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,229
Same with humor. They don't get it.

265
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,229
You say something like,
"guy was high as a kite."

266
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,079
And they're like,"how could
a guy be high as a kite?

267
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,509
He weighs too much."

268
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,049
Riveting.

269
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,069
hello,brent.

270
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,529
Remember me? Detective valens.

271
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,029
9136.

272
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,979
- That's my badge number.
- Neat trick.

273
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,509
It's all about triggers.
I say,"detective valens."

274
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,729
9136.

275
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,159
And he coughs up. I get it.

276
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,559
Listen,kid,I want to ask
you some questions. Okay?

277
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,729
- Hey.
- vera.

278
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,849
You remember when your parents pulled
you out of ritter union high school,brent?

279
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,229
You were covered in yellow spray paint.

280
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,949
You don't like yellow, do you,brent?

281
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,509
Three red flakes,two
blue, one green,no yellow.

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,709
Not my favorite color,either.

283
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,559
Well,now that we got that settled.

284
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,499
As your parents were leaving
the principal's office,

285
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,129
your dad said, "it's time for plan B."

286
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,149
Save sammy.

287
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,019
Plan b meant "save sammy"?

288
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,359
Plan B. Save sammy.

289
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,479
Who the hell is sammy?

290
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,119
Plan B.

291
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,039
Save sammy.

292
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,769
So sammy's a fish?

293
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,139
Siamese fighting fish. Betta
splendens. Indigenous to thailand.

294
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,309
Males live alone...

295
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,339
who saved sammy,brent?

296
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,079
Doug saved sammy.

297
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,249
Doug,your sister's boyfriend?

298
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,659
Doug says hi.

299
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,039
Is that a yes?

300
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,169
You did good,brent. Real...

301
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,049
good.

302
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,519
Had a talk with brent,doug.

303
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,339
Brent's talking?

304
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,959
That's great.

305
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,749
Maybe not so great for you.

306
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,350
Why's that?

307
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,439
He put you at the scene
of his parents' murders.

308
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,589
No way. That can't be.

309
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,429
Says you.

310
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,819
I was at the batting cages. I didn't
clock out till 9:00. You can check.

311
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,199
We will.

312
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,879
Besides,i loved that kid. His
whole family, not just ruby.

313
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,379
- You still in contact with her?
- No.

314
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,869
After her parents died, she froze me out.

315
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,279
Why's that?

316
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,479
I hung out with the harrises a lot on account
of my family being a total disaster area.

317
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,219
So you reminded ruby too much of the past?

318
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,789
That's what I like to think,anyway.

319
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,819
Better than the alternative.

320
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,189
That she stopped loving me?

321
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,619
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,009
Brent was real specific,doug.

323
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,269
Said you saved sammy.

324
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,139
Saved sammy?

325
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,199
Said you picked his cup off the floor
of the car the night of the murder.

326
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,349
Yeah. I know what he's talking about.

327
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,999
Oh,yeah?

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,239
You see,autistics like brent,
they can't keep time straight.

329
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,459
You made a study?

330
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,709
No. Ruby told me.

331
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,639
You see,it's like brent can't
keep things in sequence,you know?

332
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,219
Like,he talks about yesterday or a year
ago like it happened at the same time.

333
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,399
What's that got to do with brent
placing you at the crime scene?

334
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,609
Everything. 'Cause I did save sammy.

335
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,919
Just not the night he was talking about.

336
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,009
No. No. No. No. No. No,no,no.

337
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,439
Go back to your room,brent.

338
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,419
No. No,no,no. No,sammy
doesn't like other fish.

339
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,829
Brent,calm down.

340
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,619
No,this is sammy's house.

341
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,839
You're right,brent, this is sammy's house.

342
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,039
And no one's gonna hurt him.

343
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,429
He's going to start stimming for sure.

344
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,609
No... the fish store is their house.

345
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,999
Brent,remember how we
talked about transitions?

346
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,859
Well,this is one of them.

347
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,559
You're just going to have to get
used to these fish being here.

348
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:23,009
No,no,no,no. No. No,no,no,no.

349
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,329
Save sammy! Save sammy! Save...

350
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,399
it's okay,brent. See? It's okay, brent,look.

351
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,579
See,look,i saved sammy. He's fine.

352
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,489
doug saved sammy.

353
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,089
Yeah,he did.

354
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,399
You know what,brent?

355
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,159
I bet sammy would like
to look at the other fish.

356
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,509
Betta splendens. Males live alone.

357
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,249
Just-just look, not go near them.

358
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,509
Just look,okay?

359
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,099
See,brent. He likes it. I can tell.

360
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,509
what were the harrises doing with
all those fish in the basement?

361
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,449
I promised i wouldn't say.

362
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,379
When did this happen,doug?

363
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,279
this was before the fire,wasn't it?

364
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,859
Yeah.

365
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,269
They didn't want to kill their own fish.

366
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,169
So they brought them home.

367
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,009
That's what plan b was.

368
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,389
Burning down their own store.

369
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,540
so they're finally kicking

370
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,700
you out of here,huh?

371
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,770
I'm driving the nurses

372
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,200
to distraction.

373
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,330
Keep coming in

374
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,580
and giving me sponge baths.

375
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,130
It's nice your guy

376
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,000
let you come visit.

377
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm here to say good-bye,ray.

378
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,030
Good-bye,good-bye?

379
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,240
Like sayonara? Adios? Forever?

380
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,130
This isn't a joke.

381
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,020
Who's laughing?

382
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,980
Um...

383
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,110
I'm leaving in the morning.

384
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,370
Back to jersey?

385
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,650
Nah.

386
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm thinking maybe california.

387
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,830
California.

388
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,980
Wow.

389
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,240
Yeah.

390
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,720
You know this guy,

391
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,860
he's just a rookie.

392
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,890
We go way back,lil.

393
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,440
I know.

394
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,400
So come with me?

395
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,060
I got to stop running sometime.

396
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,700
I'm ain't running

397
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,300
from anything.

398
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,100
I meant me.

399
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,870
Then stay.

400
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,640
Bye.

401
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,840
Bye.

402
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,500
Bye.

403
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,790
Your brother may not

404
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,150
be able to lie,ruby.

405
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,780
But you don't seem

406
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,360
to have any problem with it.

407
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,670
What are you talking about?

408
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,260
The fish store.

409
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,770
Your parents

410
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,950
burning it down.

411
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,110
My parents were the best,

412
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,670
so don't you dare.

413
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,290
You got a temper,ruby?

414
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,180
When it comes to people

415
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,000
talking trash

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,090
about my family,yeah,I do.

417
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,550
Ever occur to you that arson

418
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,210
might've had something

419
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,010
to do with their murder?

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,490
My parents did what they had to do.

421
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,960
They had to burn down their own store?

422
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,740
They were desperate.

423
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,170
Why?

424
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,010
Because a couple months

425
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,870
before they yanked

426
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,830
brent out of school,

427
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,290
this jerk offered them

428
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,470
something they couldn't resist.

429
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,560
What?

430
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,340
Hope.

431
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,180
On the autism spectrum

432
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,220
disorder,mr. Harvey,

433
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,990
high functioning.

434
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,290
He knows everything there is

435
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,940
to know about tropical fish.

436
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,780
And he's excellent at math,

437
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,750
aren't you,brent?

438
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,590
I'm in algebra 1a.

439
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,130
Well,that's terrific.

440
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,120
But here at north bend,

441
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,680
our real focus is on emotional

442
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,960
and social development.

443
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,240
That's great. That's just

444
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,380
what we're looking for.

445
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,620
Here's an example

446
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,190
of what I'm talking about.

447
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,220
That's jason. When he came

448
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,900
to north bend,

449
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,570
he wouldn't let

450
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,210
anyone near him.

451
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,380
Now look at him.

452
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,810
That's amazing.

453
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,570
Has brent ever hugged you?

454
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,620
Or held your hand?

455
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,060
Touched your face?

456
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,610
No.

457
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,350
Well,

458
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,670
that's the hope we hold out

459
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,890
for parents here at north bend.

460
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,620
But there is

461
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,890
one obstacle.

462
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm afraid we have a

463
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,950
waiting list.

464
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,610
How long?

465
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,880
We're not even taking names.

466
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,810
There is

467
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,460
an alternative,however.

468
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,920
It's,uh,an

469
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,650
incentive program.

470
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,840
One where I see

471
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,470
to it that

472
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,710
brent's name goes to the top

473
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,530
of the waiting list.

474
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,550
You see to it?

475
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,590
Yes.

476
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,850
For an incentive.

477
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,630
How much?

478
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,420
20 grand. In cash.

479
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,560
So your parents

480
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,610
burned their own store

481
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,610
to pay the bribe?

482
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,230
Except the insurance company boned us.

483
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,870
Said the store

484
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,190
had faulty wirG.

485
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
Never paid the claim.

486
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:58,760
Your mom and dad

487
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,880
must've been devastated.

488
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,550
They were.

489
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,330
They lost everything

490
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,620
trying to pay off that pimp.

491
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,770
But they were determined,right?

492
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,240
Desperate.

493
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,840
Would've done anything.

494
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,830
So what if they went

495
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,510
back to him?

496
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,230
Turned the tables.

497
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,650
Used his bribe against him.

498
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,310
Got to hand it to you,harvey.

499
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,850
Heck of a scheme.

500
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,910
Extorting

501
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,730
desperate parents.

502
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,250
That's offensive.

503
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
You make $42,000 a year

504
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,470
and live in an $800,000

505
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,930
waterfront condo.

506
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,540
I have dedicated my

507
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,870
life to this school.

508
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,870
To these kids.

509
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:36,990
doesn'explain cbe

510
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,030
discrepancy in your finances.

511
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,610
Do I receive gifts every now

512
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,950
and then from grateful parents?

513
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,550
Yes. Guilty.

514
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,880
Now what about people who can't afford

515
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,100
to give you gifts?

516
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,890
People like the harrises.

517
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,700
The harrises?

518
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,730
Yeah,they came to you,

519
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,550
threatened to expose your

520
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,940
little incentive program.

521
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,530
Oh,they never

522
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,090
threatened me.

523
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,120
Sure about that?

524
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,850
Yeah,they begged me

525
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,380
to let their kid in.

526
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,490
And you said no.

527
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,690
I gave them my best advice.

528
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,700
Gratis.

529
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,190
Which was?

530
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,510
There's a school in vermont

531
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,250
for kids with autism.

532
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,590
Doesn't charge tuition.

533
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,240
Vermont?

534
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,550
Yeah. I even made some

535
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,160
calls for them.

536
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,560
Made sure their kid could get in.

537
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,240
And did he?

538
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,170
Yes. They were going

539
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,390
to move there.

540
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,130
The whole family?

541
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,770
I'm all about the kids.

542
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,520
Yeah,you're a real champ.

543
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,420
Joseph.

544
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,920
I found a place for ruby

545
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,250
at a halfway house.

546
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,860
She can live there

547
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,780
with brent if she wants.

548
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,350
I've been calling you.

549
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,170
Went by your apartment

550
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,340
last night,'cause I thought we

551
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,610
were going to talk,but...

552
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,590
you never showed up.

553
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,650
I was at the hospital.

554
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,430
With him.

555
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,280
Saying good-bye.

556
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
And after...

557
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,720
I walked all night.

558
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,500
Now I'm here.

559
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,220
With you.

560
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,940
Sounds like it was

561
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,780
a tough decision.

562
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,550
It was.

563
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,300
It's just that,

564
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,020
ray knows me.

565
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,770
Everything about me.

566
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,890
And maybe  if you let me in,

567
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,830
I'll leave you,too?

568
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,870
Ray never left me.

569
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,640
No. He's just never around.

570
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,910
I mean maybe

571
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,640
that's what you really want.

572
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,660
No.

573
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,740
I want to be with you.

574
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,870
What,for like a week,

575
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,990
a month,then what?

576
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,020
Can't we try?

577
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,950
I left your keys on the table.

578
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,740
Don't leave,joseph.

579
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,460
Please.

580
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,180
Look,I'm not your

581
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,550
consolation prize.

582
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,770
I don't want to be alone.

583
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,590
Maybe you do.

584
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Why not go to the normal

585
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,860
sibling,ask about vermont?

586
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,410
'Cause the sister lies.

587
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,780
And your boy brent can'T.

588
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,800
That's right.

589
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,730
Take off your tie.

590
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,770
What?

591
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,760
Your tie,it's yellow.

592
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,800
Brent hates yellow.

593
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,560
Forget it.

594
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,740
No way.

595
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,450
Uh,it's detective

596
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,130
valens,brent.

597
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,320
9136.

598
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,460
That's right.

599
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,020
Your parents cared a

600
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,250
lot about you,brent.

601
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,530
You know that?

602
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,170
Mom and dad.

603
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
They cared so much they

604
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,880
were planning on moving

605
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
so that you could go

606
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,440
to a better school.

607
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,570
A school in vermont.

608
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,450
345652sw38.

609
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,310
What do those numbers have

610
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,400
to do with vermont,brent?

611
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,030
Vermont.

612
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,040
345652sw38.

613
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,920
Brent,where did you

614
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,380
see those numbers?

615
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,880
Okay.

616
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,140
Okay.

617
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,530
Okay,okay.

618
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,310
Forget vermont.

619
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,070
I know what that number is,

620
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,100
at least the last part.

621
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,240
What?

622
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,750
Sw38.

623
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,480
Smith and wesson .38.

624
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,650
So the first part must

625
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,480
be the serial number.

626
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,040
Kid,you just gave us the gun.

627
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,690
It's all about triggers,boss.

628
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,280
Triggers?

629
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,840
Yeah.

630
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,690
Say the right word,

631
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,780
you get the right answer.

632
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,070
So you're clueing into brent?

633
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,320
I don't want to take all the credit.

634
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,530
I mean,

635
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,040
scotty was there.

636
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I got it.

637
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,670
The serial number.

638
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Who's the gun registered to?

639
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,860
Steve harris.

640
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,080
Brent's dad?

641
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,820
Parents were killed

642
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,420
with their own gun.

643
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,850
Your parents were killed

644
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,160
with their own gun,ruby.

645
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

646
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,850
A gun you had access to.

647
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,620
You think I killed

648
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,370
my own parents?

649
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,860
You didn't want to move to vermont.

650
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,380
Vermont.

651
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,380
Yeah.

652
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,000
We know about that,ruby.

653
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,260
Moving away from doug.

654
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,550
Your amazing boyfriend.

655
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,060
"Forget vermont,"

656
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,750
your parents said

657
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,660
right before they were shot.

658
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,080
That's why they were killed.

659
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,170
None of us wanted to move.

660
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,200
But they said we had to,

661
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,780
for brent.

662
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,970
It was always about brent,wasn't it?

663
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,350
Your cross to bear.

664
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,120
I understood.

665
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,710
You know,I have a sister,ruby.

666
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,690
A real screw up.

667
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,420
And no matter how perfect I was,

668
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,630
my mom was all about her.

669
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,160
It was like I didn't even exist.

670
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,530
That's not how it was with us.

671
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
Oh,yeah?

672
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,870
You didn't bail brent

673
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,190
out of trouble all the time?

674
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,470
You didn't hate them

675
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,180
for ignoring you.

676
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,150
For a freak?

677
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,290
Don't call him that.

678
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,300
He didn't mean to do it.

679
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,990
Do what?

680
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,650
What did brent do,ruby?

681
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,940
That night...

682
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,610
the night

683
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,790
your parents were killed?

684
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,170
Brent came home...

685
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,910
and all the roads

686
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,230
we have to walk wind

687
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,820
and all the lights

688
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,910
that lead the way are blind there are many things

689
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,460
that I would

690
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,000
like to say to you,

691
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,030
but I don't know how

692
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,940
I said maybe

693
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,790
you're gonna be the one

694
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,000
that saves me

695
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,300
and after all

696
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,060
you're my wonderwall.

697
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,940
I buried his clothes

698
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,180
and the gun in the backyard.

699
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,500
Okay,ruby.

700
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,400
I won't be able to take care

701
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,490
of brent now,will I?

702
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,950
No.

703
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,210
It's me,brent,

704
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,120
detective valens.

705
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,560
9136.

706
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,980
That's right.

707
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,460
We talked to your sister ruby.

708
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,910
She told us what happened.

709
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,050
You were in the car

710
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,660
with your parents

711
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,370
when they were murdered.

712
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,740
065739.1.

713
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,440
That's right,brent.

714
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,110
That was the odometer number.

715
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,280
Then you saw those shoes.

716
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,220
Are you high.

717
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,170
And you didn't want to move

718
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,380
'cause you don't like change.

719
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,280
That's why your dad said,

720
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,110
"okay,okay,forget vermont."

721
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,140
345652sw38.

722
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,180
The serial number

723
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,740
of the gun.

724
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,890
The gun that you fired.

725
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,900
The gun you fired,brent!

726
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,470
The gun your sister said

727
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,440
you were holding.

728
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,850
215-555-0196.

729
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,340
215...?

730
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:39,960
That's a philly

731
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,680
area code,brent.

732
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,380
That's a phone number.

733
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,030
What does that number have to do with you holding the gun?

734
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,270
215-555...

735
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,540
brent,whose phone

736
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,410
number is that?

737
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,410
Sammy's house.

738
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,040
the killer got a call from

739
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,070
someone in your house,brent?

740
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,730
Sammy's house.

741
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,320
Your house.

742
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
My house.

743
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,070
Brent,

744
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,640
detective valens...

745
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,840
9136.

746
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,330
...Is proud of you.

747
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,500
Okay.

748
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,390
Okay.

749
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,350
Hey,detectives. How you doing?

750
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,210
Oh,brent's been talking

751
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,320
again,doug.

752
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,610
That's good,right?

753
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,540
Ruby made a phone call

754
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,240
from her house

755
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,070
the night of the murder.

756
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,600
At 6:20.

757
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,530
To your cell.

758
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,480
Don't lie,

759
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,510
'cause we got the phone records.

760
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,150
Yeah,your point?

761
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,470
Brent saw his home number

762
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,410
flash on the killer's phone.

763
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,710
Your phone.

764
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,480
Whoa,wait,back up.

765
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,400
Uh,brent saw?

766
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,320
That's right.

767
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,350
Brent.

768
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,360
And brent doesn't lie.

769
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,110
And you might have

770
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,840
clocked out of work

771
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,490
at 9:00,doug,

772
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,680
but nobody remembers you

773
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,410
being around

774
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,840
between 6:00 and 7:00.

775
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,730
And we know you helped

776
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,330
the harrises move

777
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,130
their stuff

778
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,350
out of their store,

779
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,130
the gun they kept there

780
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,400
included.

781
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,300
You said you loved

782
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,740
the harrises,doug.

783
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,840
I did.

784
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,020
They were like the

785
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,650
family I never had.

786
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,820
But they were going to move away.

787
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,570
You were going to lose ruby

788
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,240
and the family

789
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,310
that was better than your own.

790
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,310
See,you don't get it.

791
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,670
Get what?

792
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,240
That brent's

793
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,280
the lucky one.

794
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,120
Not being able

795
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,920
to feel anything.

796
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,480
'Cause you felt too much?

797
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,640
Look,I loved ruby more than

798
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,500
anyone's ever loved anybody.

799
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,810
And you couldn't let a love like

800
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,300
that just disappear on you.

801
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,790
The thought of her not being

802
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,880
with me,moving away forever...

803
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,400
not a possibility.

804
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,440
So you had to stop them.

805
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,420
I didn't want to,I swear.

806
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,940
But it was like my heart...

807
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,590
it was like...

808
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,270
lovesick.

809
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,290
What...

810
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,100
Oh,what are you doing

811
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,200
out here in the rain?

812
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:28,810
You're soaked.

813
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,370
Hop in.

814
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,600
Come on,it's take-out tuesday.

815
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,480
I know.

816
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,030
I can't let you do it.

817
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,120
- Take her away from me.

818
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,120
- Do what?

819
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,750
Ruby?

820
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,680
She's my air.

821
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,730
I cannot breathe without her.

822
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,510
I will die,I swear.

823
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,720
What are you doing?

824
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,380
- I mean it.

825
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,380
- You can't take her.

826
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,570
Okay,okay.

827
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,150
Forget vermont.

828
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,800
You say that now,but I know

829
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,280
you will do anything for brent.

830
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,260
No,no.

831
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,640
I'm sorry.

832
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm so sorry.

833
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,950
in my place,in my place

834
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,940
were lines

835
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,070
that I couldn't change

836
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:42,070
I was lost,oh,yeah

837
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,020
I was lost,I was lost

838
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,170
crossed lines

839
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,470
I shouldn't have crossed

840
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,080
I was lost,oh,yeah

841
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,580

842
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,550
how long must you wait

843
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,700
for him

844
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,240
yeah

845
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,280
how long must you pay

846
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,210
for him

847
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,920
yeah

848
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,640
how long must you wait

849
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,340
for him

850
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,710
for him

851
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,210
I was scared,I was scared

852
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,310
tired and underprepared

853
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:48,550
but I wait for you

854
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,470
