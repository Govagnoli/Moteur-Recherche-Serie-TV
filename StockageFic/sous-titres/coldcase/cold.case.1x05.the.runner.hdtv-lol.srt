July 20, 1973

4
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,717
Timmy's sick, the baby's sick,
and the wife's gonna give me hell

5
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:17,343
'cause I forgot her mint chip ice cream.

6
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:18,862
The other night Diane says,

7
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:22,768
"Joe, baby, I'm hankering
for some pickles with fish sauce."

8
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,535
Pregnant women.

9
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:29,363
2710 car, go to east Ludlow and
Jones for a domestic disturbance.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,832
See, now if we answer
that mommie-poppie call

11
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,510
and my mommie's beating
me down tonight.

12
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,853
2710 car.
Okay, got it.

13
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,396
Get outta here.
You split, man.

14
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:41,984
No, I ain't letting
you go out on your own.

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,135
I told you to get your ass home
by midnight, didn't I?

16
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,886
Hey, wait until the kid's born.

17
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:49,567
That's when you'll really
kiss your life good-bye.

18
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:52,054
- Yeah.
- I hear you, man.

19
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,448
Thanks, Joe.

20
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,293
They told me you got the old murders.

21
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:52,699
What?

22
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,971
He said, um,

23
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,936
you the one that's got to listen to this.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,876
What is it?

25
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:04,510
I found it in a garbage dump over by
the raymond jennings projects.

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,230
You got a name?

27
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,836
Neesey.

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,681
Neesey, huh?

29
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:12,020
That your real name?

30
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:16,634
Deniece, okay?
Deniece Funderbunk.

31
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,932
I already told him.

32
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:24,557
So, look, I get anything for this?

33
00:02:24,557 --> 00:02:26,777
Just a sincere thanks for
your civic-mindedness.

34
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:28,732
My civic what?

35
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,689
Thanks, Ms. Funderbunk.

36
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,782
I gotta jet.

37
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,104
A garbage dump?

38
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:42,824
You don't mind a little dirt, do you, Rush?

39
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,103
I hang around you, don't I?

40
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,395
Runner!

41
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,656
Runner!

42
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,335
Runner!

43
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:02,944
Standard cassette player and recorder
way old school. Early '70s.

44
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,124
I transferred the audio
from analog to digital.

45
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,900
The stuff after the gunshots,
the man's muttering,

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,671
I'm still working on that.

47
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:12,540
But check this out.

48
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,324
Shan...

49
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:15,284
what's that?

50
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:18,106
I'm going to eq it by rolling off
some of the top and bottom,

51
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,856
filter out the background noise.

52
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:26,127
Tweak it and clean it, correct the pitch.
Bam!

53
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:32,674
Sounds like some sort of public
announcement system. / Yeah.

54
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,285
And near a railroad station.

55
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,573
Sh... shanning station.

56
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:41,449
The old train tracks in north Philly.

57
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:45,787
They closed that station some time
in the...early '80s.

58
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:47,824
A lover's lane.

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,712
You know this from experience?

60
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,734
Not a soul around.

61
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,654
Just you and the stars.

62
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:55,631
Runner!

63
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,306
Runner!

00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,973
Runner!

65
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,403
Lonely place to die.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/10/26

77
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:42,544
Small caliber weapon fired three times
in the vicinity of shanning station.

78
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:45,009
Before it closed in '81.
That narrows it down.

79
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,776
Where the hell is it?

80
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:49,419
- Did you say shanning station?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:53,102
You're not gonna find that
box job down here.

82
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,205
This one was one of our own.

83
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,850
Never left homicide,

84
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,859
30 years.

85
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,995
Three shots to the heart.

86
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,145
One year on the force.

87
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,868
Washington? / Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,049
He just graduated from the academy.

89
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,377
Worked in the 27th district.
Citywide Manhunt For Cop Killer

90
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,506
Raised in a North Carolina orphanage,

91
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:27,448
a stint in the military before
entering the police academy.

92
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,995
Washington was responding
to a domestic call.

93
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,410
He never made it there.

94
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,101
A few hours later, they found his body
near the shanning tracks.

95
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,139
Blood spatter matching

96
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,269
Washington's blood type was found
in a stolen vehicle

97
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:41,725
left on a turnpike two days later.

98
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,339
It was mostly a dead end.

99
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,277
We lifted a fingerprint off
the car windshield. No hits.

100
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,431
Maybe we run the print again.

101
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,104
I'd like to work with you on this one, Lily.

102
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:56,083
I knew Joe Washington.

103
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,226
You knew his partner?

104
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,700
Of him.
Butch Rinaldi.

105
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,810
Why wasn't he with Washington that night?

106
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,505
I let him go out alone.

107
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,359
Shouldn't have done that.

108
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:14,217
Must have pulled over a motorist that
ran a traffic light or something.

109
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:18,034
Joe got three bullets for his trouble.

110
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:21,334
I was standing right here

111
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:26,429
when I first seen Diane that night
Joe's wife.

112
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,040
Butchy!

113
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,701
No!

114
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,304
No!

115
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,041
No!

116
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,873
Diane lost the baby a few weeks later.

117
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:08,501
You last saw Washington
at 12:00 midnight.

118
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,921
That's when our shift ended.

119
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,566
On the tape, there's a train horn
seconds after the gunshots.

120
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,698
We checked train schedules
at the museum.

121
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:19,547
Only one arrival that night at 1:00 A.M.

122
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:23,908
So we can place time of death
about an hour after you saw Washington.

123
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,726
But shanning's only five minutes
from the precinct.

124
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:29,540
Maybe he wasn't headed
to the domestic.

125
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,791
He said he was, clear as day.

126
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,249
According to the logs, dispatch sent
another call ten minutes after the domestic.

127
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:39,304
Drug activity
at the raymond jennings project

128
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,216
where the tape recorder was found.

129
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:44,293
If Washington responded to that call,
the timeline adds up.

130
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:46,934
Raymond jennings wasn't
even in our district.

131
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,820
Why would Joe go there and
not tell no one?

132
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,861
That's what we got to find out.

133
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:02,974
I did live in the raymond jennings project,
young lady.

134
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:05,741
And I called the police that night.

135
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,284
My tax pays your salary.

136
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,865
30 years is a long time to remember
a call you made, Ms. Gloria.

137
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,414
I remember real good, sir.
You want to know why?

138
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:19,729
Because those damn police
actually came for once.

139
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,227
What does that mean?

140
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:24,036
Black folks from the project calling
on Friday night,

141
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,915
police don't come.

142
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,707
But that night that
black cop showed up.

143
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:32,392
And he gets to fighting
with the drug dealer.

144
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,185
- What drug dealer?
- Never saw him before,

145
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:38,455
but after I called the police,
I went out to see what happened,

146
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,610
not expecting a damn thing.

147
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,748
Get off my court.

148
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:49,064
You don't own this.

149
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:51,284
Well, I own this. I own you.

150
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:53,735
I own everything you is, Joe boy.

151
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:56,677
You ain't better than me.

152
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:59,131
You just pretend you is.

153
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,823
The dealer called him Joe?

154
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:12,845
Joe this, Joe that.

155
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:17,238
That black cop must have come
around the projects regular

156
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,913
'cause he knew enough not
to park at the curb.

157
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:22,691
Those drug dealers'll see him
a-coming a mile away.

158
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,549
What'd the drug dealer look like?

159
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:26,327
Skinny.

160
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:27,617
Young.

161
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,026
Black.

162
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,525
Strutting around like
some sort of crazy rooster.

163
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,838
My eyes been bad since forever.

164
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:36,390
Can't tell you more.

165
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,786
But I did hear those druggies
calling him "the runner".

166
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,413
- What?
- The runner.

167
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:45,080
What kinda name is that?

168
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,258
Thank you, Ms. Menards.

169
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:54,306
Washington called the killer
that on the tape, the runner.

170
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:56,053
'Cause he knew him.

171
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,011
They both knew each other.

172
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,139
Real well.

173
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,950
I did patrol of the raymond
jennings projects in the '70s.

174
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,179
Never heard the name the runner.

175
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:12,186
Guy ain't in the system anywhere.
No arrests, nothing.

176
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:15,224
So how'd this runner and
Washington get so cozy?

177
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:17,954
And how'd Washington know those projects
enough to know where to park

178
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,079
when he didn't even work that district?

179
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,813
Maybe he had it in for drug dealers.

180
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,665
Washingtong's patrol log.

181
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,912
Radioed in calls on dealers
in his district constantly.

182
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:29,843
Got into two altercations.

183
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:31,537
There's a lot of hate here.

184
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:32,670
Love hate.

185
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,154
No arrests on his record.

186
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:36,159
Smoke and mirrors?

187
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:39,717
Acts tough for appearances' sake,
but he's really on the take?

188
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,598
Bank records don't show cash coming in.

189
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,927
But cash was going out,
every few weeks.

190
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:46,541
These didn't cover
his usual living expenses.

191
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,517
He wrote clearly marked
checks for those.

192
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:51,831
And these sums are
big enough to stand out.

193
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,356
What are we thinking, buying drugs?

194
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:58,385
No, addicts clean out bank
within a couple months.

195
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:00,022
This doesn't follow that pattern.

196
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,985
So what was he doing?

197
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,061
Maybe his widow knows.

198
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:05,980
The runner?

199
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,397
No.

200
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,339
I never heard of him.

201
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,151
How long were you married, Diane?

202
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:16,666
Ten months, two weeks.

203
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,243
Was Joe a big spender? Um...

204
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,536
first year of marriage and all.

205
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:25,488
No. We just got the house.

206
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,009
Why?

207
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,898
Um,

208
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:33,187
these checks he wrote
for cash every few weeks.

209
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:36,706
Do you know what they were for?

210
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,404
He got me flowers every Friday.

211
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:42,981
And movies.

212
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,868
We went to movies all the time.

213
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:50,447
But I never thought
it would amount to that much.

214
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,303
I thought things would be
different by now.

215
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,829
That I'd be different.

216
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:05,198
Time makes things worse, not better.

217
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,632
Maybe time also finds the truth.

218
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:14,850
Can you tell me what you
remember from that day, Diane?

219
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:21,409
We were thinking about
what to name our baby.

220
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,072
Our little girl.

221
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,478
- Marianne.
- No.

222
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,551
- Martha.
- Uh-uh.

223
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,921
- Matilda.
- No way.

224
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,268
Okay, Mr. Man,

225
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:42,042
let me see you come up with
something more groovy.

226
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,342
You want groovy, baby?

227
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,966
Uh-huh, I want far out,
psychedelic, groovy.

228
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,509
How about Diane?

229
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,071
I'm vibing Diane.

230
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:52,657
I love diane.

231
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,231
You do?

232
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:58,691
What?

233
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:00,850
Love me?

234
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,023
I do.

235
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,888
- You know what else?
- What?

236
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:09,276
I'm gonna love ya, love ya,
love ya just a little more.

237
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,139
Come here, baby.

238
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:19,020
Joe left for work 20 minutes later...

239
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:22,313
and I never saw him again.

240
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,894
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,454
Sometimes I think,

242
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:34,719
My god, she'd be a woman by now.

243
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,275
My little girl.

244
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:41,201
Anyway...

245
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,478
Um,

246
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,391
if you think of anything else.

247
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,880
Detective Rush?

248
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:59,347
Could you tell from the tape

249
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:05,331
whether Joe was in pain when he died?

250
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,802
No.

251
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,964
He wasn't.

252
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,977
I don't know if Diane was telling
the truth about the money.

253
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,768
Wonder why she was never asked about it.

254
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:21,054
Maybe Butch has an idea.

255
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:24,783
Tonight's first Thursday at the tavern right?
Bet he'll be there.

256
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,239
- You're not going to first Thursday.
- Why not?

257
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,930
The old timers don't take too kindly to
women crashing their night with the boys.

258
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,119
Too bad. It's a new world.

259
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,040
Those dinosaurs are
bad enough sober, Lilly.

260
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,745
You saying you won't go with me?

261
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,944
I'm saying go see Butch in the morning.

262
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,410
Forget Jones tavern.

263
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,815
Wife know you're on a date tonight?

264
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,090
Hey, Butch.

265
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,931
You know detective Rush.

266
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,265
How you doing, Butch?

267
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:18,986
This one's for Joe Washington
and all the guys who died on the line.

268
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:25,765
We got to talk.

269
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,239
Yeah.

270
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:30,968
Diane called and told me about the crap
you came asking about Joe's money.

271
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:32,527
There was money going
out of his account.

272
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,014
You know what it was for?

273
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,971
This ain't no place to bring a lady, bro.

274
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:38,683
- Any ideas about the money, Butch?
- No.

275
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:41,447
Turns out Washington knew
runner real well.

276
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:46,321
I hope no one's trying to associate
my fallen partner with some drug dealer.

277
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,075
- How'd he know runner, Butch?
- She thinks she can come in here...

278
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:49,894
- Just answer the question.
- Smearing a good cop's name...

279
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:51,327
Hey!

280
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,216
I'm the one asking the questions.

281
00:15:56,216 --> 00:16:00,579
So what's your question, detective?

282
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:05,358
Was Washington paying someone off?

283
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,322
You know who we got here, boys?

284
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:14,702
The only female in homicide
working cold cases.

285
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:17,336
- Know why?
- Maybe you ought to sit down, Butch.

286
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,179
'Cause it's in the basement.

287
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:23,212
Where the little lady can
dust down the files.

288
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,633
So how'd it go at the tavern?

289
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:47,201
Ass handed to me.

290
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,404
Does that surprise you?

291
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:53,416
I think Sarreti, the assigned on the case,
suspected the drug angle, too.

292
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:57,611
An interview Sarreti did
with Deante Rollins, heroin dealer.

293
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:01,376
His territory was raymond jennings
in the early '70's.

294
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:04,112
Like Sarreti was wondering
about the cash himself.

295
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:08,085
But we can't ask him 'cause he keeled
over from a heart attack last year.

296
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,391
And back then,

297
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:12,374
- Deante wasn't sharing.
- What about now?

298
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:15,042
Maybe he's learned to play with others.

299
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:19,914
Never heard of no runner.

300
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,263
You sure about that?

301
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:24,086
Like I say, never heard of him.

302
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,417
And your word is bond, Deante.

303
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,719
My name is Brother Jamal.

304
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,709
Sure it is.

305
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,177
Asalaam a fakim, my brother.

306
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,551
Like you know what that means.

307
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:37,239
What does it mean, Jamal?

308
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:39,437
Peace be with you.

309
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,360
Have you found it yet?

310
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,645
Peace?

311
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,244
It's a journey.

312
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:46,801
There is no it.

313
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,079
There is no end.

314
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,432
A tough road, redemption.

315
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:55,160
Yes, especially when you're dealing
smack to women and children.

316
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,458
I never sold to children. Ever.

317
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,803
Back in the day, we was businessmen.

318
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:03,916
Organized, chains of command,

319
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,462
none of this teenage gangsta bull today.

320
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,973
- You were disciplined.
- That's right.

321
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:11,106
Working those basketball courts,
24-seven, 365.

322
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:12,412
Never missed a day.

323
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,891
So you were there that night
Washington got killed.

324
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:21,553
And you must have seen the fight.

325
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,311
Yeah. I seen it.

326
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,634
You don't own this, man.

327
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,642
Well, I own this. I own you.

328
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,290
I own everything you is, Joe boy.

329
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,297
And the cop runs up into the projects.

330
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,198
What was he doing?

331
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,462
A few minutes later
he comes running back down.

332
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,613
Sam!

333
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:51,708
Sammy!

334
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,449
Sammy!

335
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,037
Sam!

336
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,558
Sammy!

337
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:00,647
Where'd Sammy go to?

338
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,314
What about runner?
You seen him?

339
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:04,050
Where did runner go, huh?!

340
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,327
Took off in some car, man!

341
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,141
Towards the tracks, man!

342
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,363
Who's Sammy?

343
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:27,444
The reason runner and his homie split
'cause of something that happened to her.

344
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:28,936
Who was his homie?

345
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,447
All I know is they was tight.

346
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:35,101
Had the same tattoo on their knuckles.

347
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:41,299
Here we go.
Joseph Washingtongs autopsy photo.

348
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:42,307
From the original negative,

349
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:47,348
I printed onto technical pan film
and transferred onto high contrast slides.

350
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:49,972
From what you asked, I figured
density slicing might do the trick.

351
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,002
What's that?

352
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:55,377
It's when you take each scale of gray
and you print it as pure black and white.

353
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:58,290
Is that the best you can do, Ray?

354
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,558
Matter of fact, I did better.

355
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,993
And better.

356
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,903
Better.

357
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:13,045
So that's how Washington
knew the runner.

358
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,360
Washington hung with a small-time

359
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,657
heroin dealer called the runner
in the early '70s.

360
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:24,174
We checked juvie records
in the court history database.

361
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:26,111
Used the tattoo as an identifying mark.

362
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,612
Meet the real Joe Washington.

363
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:31,950
17 years old, arrested for selling smack.

364
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,236
Gave the arresting officer a false name.

365
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:38,192
That's why police background
check missed it.

366
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,586
No North Carolina orphanage?

367
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:41,910
Fairy tale.

368
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,333
He grew up in raymond jennings.

369
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,262
Straightens out, starts flying right,
joins the military.

370
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,701
Then the police academy.

371
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,175
Gets married, and...

372
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,722
we know the rest.

373
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:54,223
So Washington buried who
he was from everyone.

374
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,474
Even his wife?

375
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,655
I never knew those things about him.

376
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:03,315
He never told you where
he really came from?

377
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:10,300
There were other things he was
hiding from you, weren't there?

378
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,154
Someone robbed you, Diane...

379
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:16,089
of your husband, of your child.

380
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:19,058
don't you think he should pay?

381
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:25,854
Everybody wanted to remember him
as this golden boy...

382
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:28,345
great cop...

383
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:30,839
great husband.

384
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,133
I didn't want to rain on their parade.

385
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,794
By doing what?

386
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,011
I knew he was...

387
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,363
he was involved with somebody else.

388
00:21:42,363 --> 00:21:45,191
Married less than a year
and already cheating.

389
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,371
What a joke.

390
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,803
One afternoon,
he went out to the shooting range,

391
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:57,649
and I needed something from the store,
so I called him.

392
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,784
He wasn't there.
He never showed up.

393
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,529
When he came home that night,

394
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,996
I said,
"hey baby, how was target practice?"

395
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,630
And he said, fine.

396
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:13,183
It was fine.

397
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,054
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,778
He'd go out two,
maybe three times a month.

399
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,825
One day I followed him...

400
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:33,006
Sammy.

401
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:35,485
It's me.

402
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,281
Her name was Sammy?

403
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:53,629
Yes. / And she lived at
the raymond jennings projects?

404
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,087
Did you ever confront Joe about her?

405
00:22:56,087 --> 00:23:00,517
I was 20 years old and pregnant.
What was the point?

406
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:03,118
And you never told the
assigned detective this?

407
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:04,503
Or even butch?

408
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:07,431
Like I said, what was the point?

409
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:11,151
I always wanted to
go back there one day...

410
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:14,327
meet her face to face,

411
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,769
but I never did.

412
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:35,006
Heads up. You never know when
a TV might fall out of a window.

413
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:41,511
Samuela?

414
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:44,413
This must be the girl who drove
Washington and runner apart.

415
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:46,386
Looks like our sammy.

416
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,942
Think she's still here?

417
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:54,572
After all these years?

418
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:58,930
In these projects,
where you're born is where you die.

419
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:09,009
We're looking for Samuela Robbins?

420
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,824
Yes, I am she.

421
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:13,844
You're miss Samuela?

422
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,762
Yes. I said that already.

423
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,286
Detectives Rush and Jeffries.

424
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:23,942
- Could we come in?
- I'd rather you not, thank you.

425
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,759
Did you know a Joe Washington,
Miss Samuela?

426
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,334
You here about Joe?

427
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,559
You should have said so! Come in.

428
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:36,960
Joe grew up on this very floor.

429
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,585
Why, he took care of Sammy
ever since they were kids.

430
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:43,263
Sammy?

431
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:46,255
My granddaughter, Samantha.

432
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,228
They grew up together?

433
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:52,491
Like brother and sister.

434
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,699
He'd bring her back from
school every day.

435
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:58,183
Real protective.

436
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:03,397
She was all the love
he had in the world.

437
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:06,310
Do you remember
when you last saw him?

438
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:10,149
Well, after he moved out,
he used to come by all the time,

439
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:13,649
bring her toys, take her to the fair.

440
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,172
Why, on that night he...

441
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:19,044
the night he what? / Oh...

442
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,553
no, I..I don't know.

443
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,180
The night he was killed.
Isn't that what you mean?

444
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,212
No. I don't know anything.

445
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:26,530
I don't.

446
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,375
Joe loved your granddaughter,
like his own blood, didn't he?

447
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,338
Yes, he did.

448
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:36,448
And he came here the night
he was killed, didn't he?

449
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,982
Yes, he did.

450
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:47,228
Joe?

451
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:49,136
He think he owns me.

452
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:50,249
Owns Sammy!

453
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,401
What's wrong?

454
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:53,466
I thought Sammy was in her room.

455
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,541
Oh, she's messing with runner,
takes him them drugs.

456
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,054
You know that, Mrs. Samuela?

457
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,796
I... she won't listen to me,
and I can't keep her in the house all day.

458
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,714
I'm sorry, Miss Samuela.

459
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:06,564
I know it ain't your fault.

460
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,272
It's just the way things go around here.

461
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,568
Now it's my turn to take care of Sammy.

462
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:14,083
You know we talked about this.

463
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,577
You know she gots to get out of here

464
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:18,791
if she's ever going to
have a chance for a life.

465
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,788
That night Joe was killed,

466
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:37,641
and Sammy...
it was difficult, you understand?

467
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,609
No mother, no father,
just me and Joe.

468
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:43,486
And then he was gone.

469
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:47,067
So why didn't you come forward
when Joe was murdered?

470
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:50,379
There was nothing
I could do to bring him back.

471
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,616
And Sammy..

472
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:53,874
where is she?

473
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:56,931
I haven't seen her in over 20 years.

474
00:26:56,931 --> 00:27:02,296
The drugs, they kind of took her over
when Joe died.

475
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,397
Did you know someone...

476
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:06,736
called the runner?

477
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:09,545
Joe's best friend.

478
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,536
Mason Tucker.

479
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:16,058
They went to the catholic
school together, ran track.

480
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,941
So that's why the nickname.

481
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:29,008
Long way from raymond jennings,
aren't you, Mason?

482
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,974
Can I help you?

483
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:36,982
Detectives Rush and Jeffries.
Homicide.

484
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:39,873
We just had a few questions.

485
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:42,248
About Joe Washington?

486
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:44,437
Your homie from high school?

487
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:47,081
Your little drug-running buddy?

488
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:50,723
I knew Joe.

489
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,036
What's your point?

490
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:55,659
Night he was murdered, we got witnesses
in the projects saying you two had a fight.

491
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,256
I don't remember no fight.

492
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:00,037
'Course not.

493
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,665
Remember what you were fighting about?

494
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:04,379
I'll say it again, I don't remember.

495
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:06,817
How about Sammy?

496
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:09,130
Do you remember her?

497
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,593
- Your point being?
- The girl had a lot of problems,

498
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,583
and from what I hear,
you had something to do with it.

499
00:28:17,053 --> 00:28:22,361
Whatever problems Sammy had
were Joe's doing, not mine.

500
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:24,520
That's not what I hear.

501
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,920
I hear it was all on you, Mason.

502
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,786
Then I suggest you check
the hospital records yourself.

503
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:33,904
He was the one who brought
her in, not me.

504
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:39,984
Now, if you don't have anything else,
I'd like to enjoy my afternoon.

505
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:42,616
Oh, uh, one last question.

506
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:46,582
How does one go from
selling smack to selling jags?

507
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:50,403
Children do dumb things.

508
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,622
I'm sure you did, too, detective Rush.

509
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:57,268
That isn't who I am now.

510
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,952
Sammy was like
a little sister to Washington.

511
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:03,475
He felt responsible for her,

512
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:08,405
so he flips when she starts muling drugs
for Mason Tucker.

513
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,496
The night of the murder, Washington

514
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:14,466
hears a radio call about drug activity
at the raymond jennings projects.

515
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,288
And from the description,
he knows it's mason?

516
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,545
He goes to the projects,
fights with mason,

517
00:29:19,545 --> 00:29:22,382
gets Sammy's grandma to okay
his plan to get her out of there,

518
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:25,293
- but when he comes back down...
- Sammy's gone.

519
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,416
Washington hears Mason took off
for the railroad tracks.

520
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,608
He follows.

521
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:31,772
And that's where he ends up dead.

522
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:35,118
And Mason drops off the face of the earth.

523
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:37,449
Only to reemerge as a law-abiding,

524
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:39,904
yacht-owning citizen years later.

525
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,394
Deante talked about an incident
that went down

526
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:46,408
between mason, Sammy and
Washington years before the murder.

527
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,848
Do we know what it was?

528
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:50,322
Only that it put her in the hospital.

529
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,790
Mm-mm.

530
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,734
Please don't let it be that.

531
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,913
We got to look at it.

532
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:59,517
The nearest emergency room
is Saint Joseph's.

533
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:02,286
Well, the best person to
ask is Sammy herself.

534
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:03,989
Check narcotic intelligence.

535
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,569
Just got the news.

536
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:08,784
We got a hit on the fingerprint inside
the stolen car.

537
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,784
The killer's car?

538
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:14,251
The print in the car matches
Samantha Robbins.

539
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:18,816
Sammy was in the car
when Washington got killed.

540
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:34,782
Thanks for the tip about the hospital.

541
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,960
So Sammy od'd on heroin in 1971.

542
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,230
Now how's a little girl
get her hands on that?

543
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,676
I wouldn't know.

544
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:45,294
No?

545
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:47,983
'Cause Washington told
the doctors you gave it to her.

546
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,738
That's a lie.

547
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:52,104
You're right.

548
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:57,093
You know what, Mason?
I'm like you. I lie a lot.

549
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:59,904
Let's both try something new...

550
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:01,921
the truth.

551
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:05,702
Sure.

552
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,890
I'll tell you the truth.

553
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,547
You want know what happened to Sammy?

554
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:12,929
It was during high school.

555
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,644
Me and Washington were
getting high all the time.

556
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,595
Hey...

557
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,098
hey, you're my bro, you know that man?

558
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:31,864
You all I got, Washington.

559
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:36,186
We gonna own this world, you and me.

560
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,053
Can I play?

561
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,811
Get outta here.

562
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:55,718
Please?

563
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:58,568
- I wanna play the game.
- I said get outta here!

564
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,039
Don't yell at the angel, bro.

565
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,662
Sammy, put that down.

566
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:06,703
Shut up, Washington.

567
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,709
Ow!

568
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:13,601
So that's why he went his way
and you went yours?

569
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,796
Seems to be the way the ball bounced.

570
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:19,420
Mason, I know sammy was in the car
that night Joe was killed.

571
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,771
Who told you that?

572
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:23,326
A middle-aged heroin whore?

573
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:26,290
Joe was running from
his guilt about Sammy.

574
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,260
What about you?

575
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,452
What are you running from?

576
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:42,140
You wanna talk to me,

577
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,010
talk to my lawyer...

578
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:47,076
Bitch.

579
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,936
Cop on kensington said
Sammy's in here.

580
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:56,324
Coming on the end of her 28 days.

581
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:58,741
- This her first time in detox?
- Uh-huh.

582
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:00,436
Bet it won't be her last.

583
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,886
Maybe it will be.

584
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,107
Why?

585
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,883
'Cause maybe
she's looking for forgiveness.

586
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:14,064
I thought Denise Funderbunk was
a pretty weird name.

587
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:17,121
One of the counselors here,
that's her name.

588
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:21,430
For real.

589
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,370
Thanks for bringing in the tape recorder.

590
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,230
Your tape recorder.

591
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,414
Why you here anyway?

592
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:32,144
Why ain't you arresting the guy
who did it?

593
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,401
We need your help, Sammy.

594
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:38,557
I'm clean outta help.
Ain't got nothing to give.

595
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,116
Sorry.

596
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,992
It's all about you, isn't it?

597
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:44,222
Always getting in trouble.

598
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,836
Always waiting for someone
to bail you out.

599
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:49,354
That's why Joe came
to the projects that night.

600
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:51,462
That's why he died,
helping you.

601
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,518
Helping me? 
Helping me?

602
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:56,262
He lied to me!

603
00:33:56,262 --> 00:34:00,624
He promised and then
he just went and died!

604
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:06,035
What did Joe promise
you the night he died?

605
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:08,784
He promised to take me home.

606
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,233
Hey, get off of my car.

607
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,593
You don't own this.

608
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:18,944
Well, I own this. I own you.

609
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:21,564
I own everything you is, Joe boy.

610
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,464
You ain't better than me.

611
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,303
You just pretend you is.

612
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,569
Sammy!

613
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,707
Sammy.

614
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:37,576
Look, I told you not to mess with Mason!

615
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,980
I told you not to touch that crap!

616
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,637
I didn't do nothing!
You can't tell me what to do!

617
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:42,295
- You ain't my daddy!
- You ain't got no daddy.

618
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:43,896
You ain't got nobody.
I'm all you got.

619
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:46,208
You shut up!
You shut up!

620
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:50,059
Look, look,
come here, come here.

621
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,368
Come here.

622
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:56,663
My wife's going to take care of you.

623
00:34:56,663 --> 00:34:58,935
Give you the love you don't know.

624
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:01,169
Let's go up and talk to your grandma.

625
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:03,513
She won't let me go.

626
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:05,468
I'll go, okay?

627
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:09,109
You stay here and wait for me, okay?

628
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,279
Mason don't own you, Sammy.

629
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,090
You own you.

630
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,852
Really?

631
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,451
You gonna wait for me or what?

632
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:23,443
Gimme so skin.

633
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:37,860
He went up and never came down.

634
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,027
That's all I know.

635
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:41,018
Hmm. Really?

636
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,792
Really.

637
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:47,577
So how'd your tape recorder
get in mason's car?

638
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,598
And your fingerprint?

639
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:51,446
You think this is over?

640
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:53,271
Just 'cause you dropped
a tape recorder on my desk?

641
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:56,488
Ever hear of the eighth step, Sammy?

642
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,931
Making amends.

643
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:00,590
It's not over.

644
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,269
Not till you tell me
what happened on those tracks that night.

645
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:11,434
Big old bad Mason don't own you.

646
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:13,770
You own you.

647
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:36,891
You think you can just walk on out
after all I done for you?

648
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:38,433
I gotta pee, runner.

649
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,928
Well, he thinks he can take
what's mine and walk away?

650
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:43,413
I own you.

651
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:46,728
He don't own you. I do.

652
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:53,308
Come here.
Come here.

653
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:02,734
Runner!

654
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:03,953
Runner!

655
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,062
Runner!

656
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:09,867
When I woke up,
we weren't at the tracks any more.

657
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:12,687
We was headed back to the projects.

658
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,205
Mason was driving and talking, and...

659
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:19,372
he just kept talking to himself.

660
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,793
What was he saying?

661
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:24,793
The lord's prayer.

662
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,679
He left me near the garbage dump
outside my building.

663
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:38,890
Like a piece of trash.

664
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,542
You never answered my question...

665
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,962
about why you're running.

666
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,272
And why it never ends...

667
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,156
the running.

668
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,653
I'm not talking to you.

669
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,934
I'm talking to you.

670
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,327
Fact is, I'm here to arrest you.

671
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:14,588
So sit down.

672
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,578
We found Sammy.

673
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,324
You were wrong.

674
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:23,012
You don't own her.

675
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,848
I know you.

676
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:33,757
You don't know a thing about me.

677
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:37,316
I know what it's like to run

678
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,378
from who you are...

679
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:41,137
I don't know what you're talking about.

680
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:44,324
...From what you did.

681
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:48,374
But you can't, can you?

682
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,985
So you spend your whole life running.

683
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:56,416
Runner!

684
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,866
Runner!

685
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,617
Runner!

686
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:07,621
Our father,

687
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:08,877
who art in heaven...

688
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,347
what're you doing here?

689
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:14,358
you're praying.

690
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,426
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth...

691
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,920
You were asking for forgiveness.

692
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,420
Remember?

693
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:29,925
He should have never
tried to change things.

694
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:31,081
He should have never come back.

695
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:34,362
He... he should... he... he...

696
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:44,003
he was all the love I had in this world.

697
00:39:48,194 --> 00:39:51,904
Joe was looking for forgiveness.

698
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:55,285
I think you are, too.

699
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:58,891
It's time, isn't it?
To forgive yourself...

700
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,150
runner?

701
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:04,462
Runner!

702
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:06,247
Runner!

703
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:08,233
Runner!

704
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:50,757
# Sometimes in our lives, #

705
00:40:50,757 --> 00:40:54,189
# we all have pain #

706
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:58,860
# We all have sorrow #

707
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,839
# But, if we are wise #

708
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:11,029
# We know that there's always tomorrow #

709
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:16,987
# Lean on me, when you're not strong #

710
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:20,254
# And I'll be your friend #

711
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:25,145
# I'll help you carry on #

712
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:30,070
# For it won't be long, #

713
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,936
# till I'm gonna need #

714
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:37,972
# Somebody to lean on #

715
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:43,095
# Please swallow your pride, #

716
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:46,301
# if I have things #

717
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:51,140
# You need to borrow #

718
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:57,644
# For no one can fill, those of your needs #

719
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:58,859
Hi.

720
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,587
I wanted to come here,
Diane, to tell you about Sammy.

721
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,605
She wasn't your husband's mistress.

722
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:09,301
She was a little girl that Joe grew up with.

723
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:14,717
that he loved and he had a debt to her.

724
00:42:14,717 --> 00:42:18,119
So we brought her home to you.

725
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,959
Diane.

726
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:27,763
Sammy.
