 ¢Ü BJ Thomas' "Hooked on a feeling" ¢Ü

00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:20,850
Aren't these gloves the most?
I feel like princess Grace.

6
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:22,996
They're lovely, Landon.

7
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:30,246
Sorry.

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,845
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,326
- Emma, put those back on.
- They hurt my feet.

10
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:42,054
A young lady must learn
how to walk gracefully in heels.

11
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:44,261
Okay, okay.

12
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,362
Do you have your 
pocketbook and gloves?

13
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,293
- I'm not going to wear the gloves.
- Emma...

14
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,642
I don't want to cover up your ring.

15
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:54,145
- Isn't this exciting?
- Sure.

16
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,481
Just think.

17
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:58,133
You'll walk through that arch
and everyone will clap

18
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,447
when they announce your name.

19
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:00,573
But it's not for doing anything.

20
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,359
It's just for being a girl
and wearing a dress.

21
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,811
Emma, we've talked about this.

22
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:10,488
What being part of this society
will mean for you, for your future.

23
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,751
You may not appreciate it now,

24
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,984
but you've made me very proud.

25
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:18,126
I want to make you proud
by doing things. / You will.

26
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:19,962
You'll do things
I've never dreamed of.

27
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:21,680
Like go to the moon.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,402
- Emma, you are such a modern woman.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,356
Now how about if I apply just
the teeniest bit of mascara?

30
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,815
Mother...

31
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:44,446
Introducing miss Claire Brixton Henley.

32
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:02,380
Introducing miss Landon Antoinette Ridgely.

33
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:19,464
Introducing miss Emma Elizabeth Vine.

34
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:38,498
Introducing miss Emma Elizabeth Vine.

35
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,358
So who's coming to the Sixers
game on Wednesday?

36
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,845
Sorry. I'm not into hockey.

37
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,620
Basketball.

38
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:48,302
No, thanks.

39
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,831
What about you?

40
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,114
They're cheap seats,
but it's a good time.

41
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,387
Thanks, but I got something Wednesday.

42
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,627
Like what?

43
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,331
It's personal.

44
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,381
Detective Rush, Lillian Vine.

45
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,426
Pleasure to meet you.

46
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:11,399
Mrs. Vine is here about 
Travis Whitman, the art dealer.

47
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,391
His wife died last month.

48
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,971
Fell down the stairs at their home.

49
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:18,314
Well, that's his story, at least.
But now he's been charged with her murder.

50
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,268
Really?

51
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,954
Lillian thinks he could be
responsible for another death.

52
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:25,907
Whose?

53
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,831
My daughter's in 1968.

54
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,992
They were both 18.

55
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,144
What happened?

56
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:37,017
Travis escorted Emma
to her debutante ball.

57
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:39,310
She died that night.

58
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,632
From a fall down the stairs.

59
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,521
That doesn't happen twice in a lifetime.

60
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,417
It's the same death.

61
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:49,217
Emma's case was put on a shelf
pretty quick after it came in.

62
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:50,518
Was it ruled an accident?

63
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:53,390
No, it was handled as an S job,
suspicious death.

64
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,722
It meant no one looked at it
too closely in '68.

65
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,328
Well, it's 2006 now,

66
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,516
and we like to look.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2006/01/29

80
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,848
What do you got, a dead bride?

81
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,936
Debutante.
Emma Elizabeth Vine.

82
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:49,164
Found at the base of a flight of stairs
at the Edgecomb hotel, December, '68.

83
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,607
Spinal fracture, cracked skull.

84
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,460
- That's a bad fall.
- Or a good shove.

85
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,121
Cops couldn't get traction on the case.
No one would talk.

86
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,658
A white glove conspiracy?

87
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,468
Society people didn't want a scandal 
on their hands. Closed ranks.

88
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:04,085
- We got a suspect now?
- Travis Whitman.

89
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,621
He was Emma's escort that night.

90
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:06,922
And just last month,

91
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:10,076
wound up with another dead woman
at the bottom of his stairs.

92
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,307
His wife.

93
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,359
He trying to sell that as a coincidence?

94
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,948
Not too many takers, though.
He was arrested for murder.

95
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:19,357
Out on bail at a cool million.
There's one other thing.

96
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:22,580
Lillian said Emma was wearing
a ring that night.

97
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,853
A gold swan with a diamond eye.
But it was missing from the body.

98
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,437
A lot of people could have taken it.

99
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:31,655
Hotel staff that found the body,
paramedics...

100
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,691
They put out feelers
to pawnshops at the time,

101
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:36,582
seeing if someone tried to move it.
Came up empty.

102
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:38,515
Maybe they waited
until the heat died down?

103
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:39,740
I'll check sale records.

104
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,982
At the time of the murder,
Emma was living in Fishtown.

105
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,055
That's not deb recruiting territory.

106
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:49,250
I don't know, some kind
of Philly Cinderella?

107
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,219
Handsome, wasn't he?

108
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,015
Even in that marshmallow.

109
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,376
Your husband?

110
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:06,808
Timothy.

111
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:10,811
This is the album from Emma's
debutante season.

112
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,670
Pretty important to Emma, debuting?

113
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:15,654
To tell you the truth,

114
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:18,095
I was the one who really wanted it.

115
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,392
Yeah?

116
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:22,009
I grew up fascinated by debs.

117
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,934
They seemed so perfect.

118
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,836
Like the whole world was theirs.

119
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:29,139
You know, my sketchy
understanding of this world,

120
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,632
it's wealthy girls, right?

121
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:33,670
From the main line, Chestnut hill.

122
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,364
- But your family was from Fishtown.
- Yes.

123
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:42,555
- So how do you go from there to...
- Having my own daughter debuted?

124
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:44,224
Uh, yeah.

125
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,065
We had a different cache. Timothy.

126
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,607
In '68, astronauts
were bigger than the Beatles.

127
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:56,421
And my husband was on the list
to go the moon.

128
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,006
All of a sudden, we were society.

129
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,574
- Is there a date yet for the landing?
- Not yet.

130
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:07,760
But think. Your husband
is going to walk on the moon.

131
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,474
I think it will be next August.

132
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,314
They're sticking by Kennedy's timetable.

133
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:13,047
My, you're well-informed.

134
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,004
Emma know more than I do.
She loves flying.

135
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,923
You could be stewardess.

136
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,315
Or a pilot.

137
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,857
You must be so glad
to have this club, Irene.

138
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,187
Someplace your children can go and...

139
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,526
And not be running wild on 
the streets with hippies? Yes.

140
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,244
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

141
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:36,231
Our debutante season starts soon.

142
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:40,004
How would you like Emma 
to make her debut?

143
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:41,301
But Irene, we're just...

144
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,031
The wife and daughter of an astronaut.

145
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,879
It would be an honor for us.

146
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,142
What would I have to do?

147
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,134
You go to parties all season.

148
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:51,943
And you bow to your father
in a gorgeous white dress

149
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,465
when you're presented at the ball.

150
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,639
It's very prestigious.

151
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,417
And you'll meet everyone.

152
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,278
And you can take Travis as your escort.

153
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,925
Isn't he your boyfriend?

154
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,726
But I have to take chip.

155
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,636
It's a business thing between our dads.

156
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:07,079
This way, Travis can come, too.

157
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,666
Oh, this is so lucky.

158
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,428
I would think the girls had all
been chosen by now.

159
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:20,797
I have some pull in that area.

160
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:24,428
After all, I am 
the mistress of the robes.

161
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,422
Mistress of the what?

162
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:34,096
The titles are from centuries ago.
It means she was in charge.

163
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,170
Well, it doesn't sound like
this ball was Emma's type of thing.

164
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,509
She only agreed after I pointed out 
the opportunities it could mean,

165
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,064
the people she'd meet.

166
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,801
She wanted to go to college.

167
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,736
So you were glad when she said yes?

168
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,307
Took Travis as her escort?

169
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:55,446
It was the mistake of my life.

170
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,313
Emma have trouble with Travis?

171
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:03,111
If she did, I was blind to it.
I thought those people could do no wrong.

172
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,628
I wanted to help her.

173
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,390
Instead, I handed her over to a murderer.

174
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,433
So that's the one, huh?

175
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:39,841
- The one?
- Painting you like.

176
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:44,208
It's my job, figuring out what people like,
what they're attracted to.

177
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,328
I learn a lot in this room.

178
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,602
Hope the same goes for us.

179
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,989
Detective Rush and Jeffries, homicide.

180
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,823
Is this about Sadie?

181
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,975
Oh, I've already got a javert
watching my every move.

182
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:59,979
That's for your wife's murder.
This is about Emma Vine.

183
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,419
- Emma? She died...
- 38 years ago.

184
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,561
It came up again since she 
died exactly the way your wife did.

185
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,853
Respectfully, no.

186
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,455
She didn't fall down a flight of stairs?

187
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,246
That much is true.

188
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:14,806
But it's my belief that Sadie
had a seizure and fell.

189
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:18,939
She was epileptic.
It's the only thing that makes any sense.

190
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,530
What about Emma?
She have a medical condition too?

191
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,317
I hardly knew Emma.

192
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,863
I escorted her to the ball
as a favor to my girlfriend.

193
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,883
- Landon.
- That's right.

194
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,573
I had no motive.

195
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,084
And no clue why she died?

196
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:37,398
Well, these girls took the debutante
season very seriously. / Right.

197
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:41,932
There was a bit of talk about the fact 
that Emma got someone else's spot.

198
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,607
Who was this someone else?

199
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,106
Sloane Kinny.

200
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,880
Big boozer. All-around floozy.

201
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,881
Did Sloane have it out for Emma?

202
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:53,689
Like Emma had yanked the golden
ticket right out of her hand.

203
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,927
 ¢Ü Melanie's "Beautiful people"  ¢Ü

204
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,487
I hope you like it.

205
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,339
It's Tricia Nixon's recipe.

206
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,735
So, Sloane, Emma's dad
is an astronaut.

207
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:08,699
That's the mostest.

208
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:10,575
Pretty neat.

209
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,378
Thanks.

210
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,508
He's gonna be the first man on the moon.

211
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:17,498
And Emma wants to be the first
girl to go to Harvard.

212
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:19,051
They don't let girls into Harvard.

213
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:23,087
Sure they do. Right after they 
get off the bus from Wellesley.

214
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,008
It's just that Harvard has
the best physics program.

215
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,121
You mean, like, P.E.?

216
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,613
You know, if you're interested,
there's an echo thing in the ballroom.

217
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:39,020
- Really?
- I'll show you when we're there.

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,036
You're going to the ball?

219
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:42,500
Yes.

220
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,092
- The roses came?
- This morning.

221
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,056
I didn't get mine.

222
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,726
I'm not debuting?

223
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,906
Sorry, Sloane.

224
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:59,049
Did I get bumped for her?

225
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,577
We don't even know her!

226
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,569
Sloane was new money.

227
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,926
Which made her a bad person?

228
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:10,698
No, what I mean is 
she was expendable so...

229
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,815
Irene cut her out.

230
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,467
For Emma.

231
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:19,139
So Sloane had an axe to grind with Emma,
but Emma died at the ball.

232
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,167
Yeah, but Sloane was there.

233
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,071
And she was angry.

234
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,875
Why would she be there?
She wasn't a debutante.

235
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,494
True, but I know I saw her.

236
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:29,608
Any proof of that?

237
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,923
Ask Chip if you can find him.

238
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:34,988
Your best friend.
But why would we believe him?

239
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,481
You probably wouldn't.
Just like you don't believe me.

240
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:41,441
You're right, Travis. I don't.

241
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,624
Well, join the club.

242
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,089
That's why I have to hire
all these fancy lawyers.

243
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,310
To help the guy that nobody believes.

244
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,179
Travis points to Sloane,

245
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,326
a girl that got knocked out of being a deb 
because Emma took her place.

246
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,146
Got Sloane's mug shot
from a DUI in '69.

247
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:03,815
Comparing it to the benevolent 
society's photos from the ball.

248
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,936
This Travis talks a good game, huh?

249
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,916
Well, smooth, but I still say 
lightning doesn't strike twice.

250
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,702
Miller have any luck
tracking the swan ring?

251
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:14,360
She put the word out to every pawn shop
and auction house in Philly.

252
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,559
Remembering a sale from 38 years ago.
That's one long shot.

253
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,743
Here, take a look.

254
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,564
Ain't that Sloane?

255
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:26,323
Staring daggers at Emma.

256
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:44,977
Feel like I should've polished my shoes
for this neighborhood.

257
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:47,563
No kidding.
Nice cribs out here.

258
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:49,588
You're coming to the Sixers game, right?
Jeffries got tickets?

259
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,027
Who's going?
You, me and him?

260
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:54,943
Well, I invited Miller but
she's got her other thing.

261
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,426
Something to do with Veronica?

262
00:14:57,426 --> 00:15:01,228
This morning I heard her ordering 
flowers for Wednesday night.

263
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,177
Sounds special.

264
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:07,084
- Why didn't she just tell us?
- Because it's none of our business.

265
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,070
We're coworkers.

266
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,796
We should share 
our lives with each other.

267
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,214
Yeah. Good luck with that.

268
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,062
This is it.

269
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:29,758
I wanted to be a debutante 
more than anything in the world.

270
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:32,407
So it must've hurt something awful 
when Emma took your place.

271
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,803
Oh, it did.
I thought I'd actually die.

272
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,942
I could hardly get out of bed.

273
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:39,788
Well, you got up to go to that ball.

274
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:43,088
Why, Sloane?

275
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,458
For Chip.

276
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,039
But Chip was Landon's escort.

277
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,020
But they were just friends.
Chip wanted me around for after.

278
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,109
If you get my drift.

279
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,168
I get it.

280
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,428
I was always good for that.

281
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:59,308
So you hung around the ball 
till he did his escort duties.

282
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:02,970
I watched a little, but I was mostly 
upstairs in our hotel room.

283
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,352
So Emma just got a free pass,

284
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:09,908
even though she's in the big 
white dress and you're not?

285
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:12,940
I'd lost by that point.
I'd already done the worst I could.

286
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,164
And what was that?

287
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,795
Found something out.

288
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:18,265
And ran with it.

289
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:24,931
It may be your night, girls,
but please, try to let the boys lead.

290
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:32,458
Oh, darn it.
I stepped on you again.

291
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,878
I didn't notice.

292
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:37,864
- But, for you, it's back on one.
- Okay.

293
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,935
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

294
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,747
Why are you debuting?

295
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:49,142
My mother says it's an opportunity.

296
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,604
What do you say?
It's all right.

297
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,411
Actually, today's been pretty fun. 
Why?

298
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,731
I've been watching you
at all the parties.

299
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:59,245
You don't seem as excited
as the other girls.

300
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:01,675
It's not really my thing.

301
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,237
Like physics.

302
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:07,504
Well, this is physics.
Everything is physics.

303
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,528
My foot describes 
a vector with force...

304
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,046
- going in a direction...
- Tracing a closed system.

305
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,096
I hadn't really thought of it that way.

306
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:25,204
Maybe you two should find
some empty space.

307
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:27,087
In another building.

308
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,021
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:33,898
- I'm hopeless, I'm afraid.
- Don't, don't look at them.

310
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:37,963
Dance with me.
Dance with me.

311
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,873
You think Travis was falling for Emma?

312
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:58,598
And vice-versa.

313
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:00,636
Landon wouldn't like that.

314
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:03,633
When I told her,
she was extremely upset.

315
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,189
You told her.

316
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:07,894
Well, I guess I thought I
could get my place back.

317
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,515
It didn't work.

318
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:12,209
So how ticked off was Landon?

319
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,376
Ever seen a child throw a tantrum,

320
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,728
take something that's theirs
when they're not used to hearing "no"?

321
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:18,796
Yeah.

322
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,371
Travis was Landon's,

323
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:23,373
until Emma showed up.

324
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:28,684
And Landon had gone 18 years
without ever hearing "no."

325
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,634
So what do they call you?

326
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,063
Coach?

327
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,466
My formal title is
"mistress of the robes,"

328
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:48,603
but the one at the end,
she calls me "mom."

329
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,019
She looks like you.

330
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,390
Well, hopefully, no one
steals her boyfriend,

331
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,665
like Emma stole yours.

332
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,111
Excuse me?

333
00:18:57,111 --> 00:19:00,771
Emma Vine? Travis Whitman?
1968.

334
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:04,711
Sloane said they were getting close,
and that you didn't like it.

335
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:06,499
That was a long time ago.

336
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:08,796
So was the murder we're working.

337
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,150
Sloane told me what she'd seen
at dance practice between those two.

338
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,502
And you got angry.

339
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:21,395
A lady doesn't get angry.

340
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:26,232
Although, sometimes what
she does instead is worse.

341
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:33,853
Okay, we'll see you 
all tomorrow at the hotel,

342
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:35,752
no later than 6 o'clock.

343
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,926
Couldn't your father make it, dear? 
This is the last rehearsal.

344
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:45,584
He had to fly down to cape Canaveral.
He's coming back tonight.

345
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,171
You know how much we're all looking 
forward to seeing you bow to him.

346
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,040
Emma, do you need a ride home?

347
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,412
- I was gonna catch the bus.
- In that?

348
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:57,592
I have street clothes and a book.

349
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,566
- What are you reading?
- Feynman's lectures.

350
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,334
On physics?
Impressive.

351
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,844
How about I get the car and 
I'll meet you two girls out front.

352
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,428
Travis has that book.
Is it his?

353
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:14,206
We were talking about it, so...

354
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,519
Your bow is really graceful, Landon.

355
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,256
I've been practicing it my whole life.

356
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:23,235
- Nervous about tomorrow?
- A little.

357
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:25,695
But I hear there's this acoustic
anomaly in the ballroom.

358
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,531
That Travis said he 
was going to show you.

359
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:33,751
There's something about 
Travis you don't know.

360
00:20:34,804 --> 00:20:36,824
He's Jewish.

361
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,393
- He is?
- He hides it well.

362
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,512
His whole family does.

363
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,949
But that's the dirty little 
Whitman secret.

364
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,114
But I thought Jews weren't allowed.

365
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,929
I guess it was like...

366
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:00,099
spitting on your food
before someone else could take it.

367
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,319
That was your way
of trying to keep Travis.

368
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,736
I loved him.

369
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,855
Even though I could see
that he liked Emma.

370
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:10,424
So what would've happened
if Travis's secret got around?

371
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,907
Would've been the end of him at the club.

372
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:16,094
- Him, his whole family.
- Socially?

373
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:20,730
People had a lot of, um,
business connections through there, too.

374
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,459
And they would've lost them
because they were Jewish.

375
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,653
I'm telling you how it was.

376
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:29,494
Not how I thought it should be.

377
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,800
Excuse me.

378
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:40,845
So Travis has got a secret
and Emma knows it.

379
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:44,144
Sounds like the escort
had motive, after all.

380
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,541
Really pushing that sale, huh, Travis?

381
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,472
Guess you got hungry lawyers to feed, huh?

382
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,776
Why are you back here?

383
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:05,339
You said you barely knew Emma,
when really you were falling for her.

384
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:07,959
- It's no reason to kill her.
- No.

385
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,528
There is a another reason.

386
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,711
Well, you seem to know more than I do.

387
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:14,027
Your family secret.

388
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:16,301
The one you told Landon.

389
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,471
Our secret.

390
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:23,023
Well, your name, Weissman.

391
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:26,532
In 1955 your family changed
it to Whitman

392
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:31,152
because back then, there was only 
so high a Jewish family could climb.

393
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,407
Our name was changed, it's true.

394
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,710
And Emma found out,
threatened to expose you. / No.

395
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,366
Now I don't need any pictures
to read you, Travis.

396
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:42,203
You're practical,
you need cash.

397
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:44,393
You sell some paintings.
You need to guard a secret...

398
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:47,321
It wasn't like that.
There were no threats.

399
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:51,470
It's more like we both just came clean.

400
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:05,021
- I rang the bell, but...
- I just came out to...

401
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:08,817
I'm trying to see Saturn's rings.

402
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,376
You left this at the club.

403
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:17,127
I took it off to try on those gloves.

404
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:21,353
This ring, it's...
it's special to me.

405
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,557
I found it before you left.

406
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:27,519
Tried to flag you down,
but I think you were avoiding me.

407
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:33,691
Landon told me something about you.

408
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,349
Your family...

409
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,722
That we're Jewish?

410
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,707
- Is that a problem?
- No.

411
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,255
But I wonder why you hang around with people
who don't like who you really are.

412
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,116
Why do you?

413
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:49,790
Right.

414
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:55,239
Because I'm keeping a secret, too.

415
00:23:57,626 --> 00:24:01,045
My dad got pulled
from the moon shot yesterday.

416
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,329
My mom won't let me tell anyone.

417
00:24:03,329 --> 00:24:05,419
She wants us to keep up appearances.

418
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,472
Like my family.

419
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:09,794
Appearances are the only thing that
matters to these people.

420
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:11,937
You already knew that.

421
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:15,347
I guess I've been
trying not to notice.

422
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,462
For your mother?

423
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:24,252
More because I don't want
to stop being around you.

424
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:36,946
Did Landon know this was going on?

425
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:39,544
No, we were gonna deal with it
after the ball.

426
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,946
Then Emma died.

427
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:44,219
So why not tell me this before?

428
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,407
You didn't want to hear it.

429
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,336
You just wanted me to 
hold out my hands for the cuffs.

430
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:51,176
Like everybody else in this city.

431
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,842
Come on, Travis,

432
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:55,394
you expect people to believe
two women in your life end up dead

433
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,468
at the bottom of the stairs
and that's just chance?

434
00:24:57,468 --> 00:25:01,047
It sounds unbelievable,
but it's what happened.

435
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,527
Right.

436
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:04,649
I had a piece of news today.

437
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:09,412
Second autopsy shows Sadie did have 
a seizure moments before she fell,

438
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,374
like I thought.

439
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,243
Is that according to a doctor
you're paying to testify?

440
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:17,080
No, it's according
to your medical examiner.

441
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:21,444
So maybe this Travis isn't such a monster.

442
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:23,842
Maybe terrible coincidences can happen.

443
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:24,682
I'll be in touch.

444
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:28,017
My lawyer says the charges 
may be dropped.

445
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,874
But it must be a mistake.

446
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,346
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:41,342
The M.E.'s report was pretty clear
about his wife's seizure.

448
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,246
But I know he killed Emma.

449
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:44,642
I know it.

450
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:49,851
I spent 38 years not knowing,
and then I opened that paper.

451
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,798
I can't walk away now.

452
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:56,577
You have children?

453
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:57,801
A daughter.

454
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,356
You know, right?

455
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:03,531
You know in your heart when something 
happens to them, don't you?

456
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,006
Yeah.

457
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:11,095
Please, don't drop her case.

458
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:16,730
Lillian, if we do continue,
you have to be honest with us.

459
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,134
Haven't I been?

460
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,168
You didn't tell us about your husband.

461
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:23,350
- That he couldn't go to the ball.
- No.

462
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,782
The day before the ball,
he was in the hospital. / Yes.

463
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:29,721
So what was your plan?

464
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,246
I know you wanted Emma to debut
more than anything.

465
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:34,269
What could we do?

466
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:36,487
On the day of the ball,

467
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:39,582
we went to Irene to tell her.

468
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:43,467
I frankly thought we'd be kicked out.

469
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,495
- But you weren't.
- No.

470
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:48,670
Because instead,
we found Matthew,

471
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,165
and he was our angel.

472
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,168
Hello, ladies.

473
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:55,044
Are you excited about tonight?

474
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:58,556
I'm afraid that's why we're here.
We won't be coming.

475
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,140
What?

476
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,715
Timothy's not well.

477
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,924
He's in the hospital.

478
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,388
- Lillian...
- He's all right,

479
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,844
but he's not going to the moon.

480
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:12,831
Honestly, I don't know
what's gonna happen to him.

481
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,101
Mom, he's strong.

482
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,566
I'm sure Emma's right.

483
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,503
Anyhow, I hate to embarrass Irene,
but without her father,

484
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:23,209
Emma won't be able to debut.

485
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:25,576
Emma could make her bow to me.

486
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:27,611
- Oh, no, we couldn't.
- Why not?

487
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:30,948
I'd be proud to present
the first woman astronaut.

488
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,306
But dad, aren't we walking together?

489
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:34,871
I could walk with you both.

490
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,255
No. If her father can't come,
she shouldn't either.

491
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,753
Landon, don't be like that.

492
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:41,256
Dad, this is for you and me.

493
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,436
She's not your daughter, I am.

494
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:46,640
- Landon, I would never want...
- I wish you'd never shown up.

495
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,656
Because you're ruining everything!

496
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:56,949
Sounds like Landon bared her claws.

497
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,903
She was just upset.

498
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,089
I wonder how upset.

499
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:07,739
Lillian, did Matthew have 
a special reason for helping you?

500
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,018
We'd known each other growing up.

501
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:19,145
My mother and I used
to clean his family's house.

502
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:23,308
That's why it meant so much to you
that Emma was a debutante.

503
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:29,221
That you'd grown up your whole life
with your face pressed against the glass.

504
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:32,394
I didn't envy the material things.

505
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,899
I envied...

506
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,130
how safe they were. 
How protected.

507
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,822
You wanted that for your daughter.

508
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,994
Maybe I thought it was possible,

509
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:44,552
because I grew up with Matthew.

510
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:47,543
He made you feel like you belonged.

511
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,576
Around everyone else,

512
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,436
we were what we were.

513
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:56,240
By ourselves, we were friends.

514
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,585
I can't wait until I'm reading the sports 
page again instead of society news.

515
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:08,043
Hear that.

516
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:11,403
Robes, gloves, bows, gowns.

517
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:13,391
The Sixers game can't come quick enough.

518
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,677
Does anyone know where Quaker hall is?

519
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:17,210
Near the sports complex.

520
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,691
Off of south?

521
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,259
Thanks.

522
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:21,918
Good night, guys.

523
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:23,544
- Night. 
- Night.

524
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,252
What?

525
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:31,412
Bet you that's where she's going
with her date tomorrow.

526
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:34,531
And that has nothing to do with us.

527
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:36,094
Don't even think it, man.

528
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:39,379
Well, look at this.

529
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,414
What do you got?

530
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:44,804
Landon's daughter 
in this year's crop of debs.

531
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,270
Yeah?

532
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,193
Look at her hand.

533
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:53,609
She's wearing Emma's ring.

534
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,602
It belongs to Emma Vine.

535
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,098
She wore it the day she died.

536
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,987
It came from my father's family.

537
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:06,800
We know the problem you had with 
your dad reaching out to Emma.

538
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,317
That's immaterial.

539
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:12,330
We also know that your boyfriend's
eye was wandering toward her.

540
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,372
Put that together, I can see you deciding 
she needs a trip down the stairs.

541
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,379
You didn't think it would kill her.

542
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:21,044
I have been open and helpful with you.

543
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:23,275
Not really, Landon.

544
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,598
Any secrets I kept didn't have 
anything to do with Emma's death.

545
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,160
Secrets, huh?

546
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:36,850
Unless you want your daughter to debut 
tonight while you're sitting in a jail cell?

547
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,830
better start dishing.

548
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:46,185
What my father said to Emma upset me.

549
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:48,147
Is that surprising?

550
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,120
He was my father.

551
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,235
I didn't want to share.

552
00:30:52,235 --> 00:30:54,698
So what'd you do about it?

553
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:57,281
Went crying to my friends.

554
00:30:57,281 --> 00:31:00,353
Said they had a way to cheer me up.

555
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:04,247
Sure you don't want the acid?

556
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:05,809
Sloane's digging it.

557
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,584
I have to bow in 20 minutes.

558
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:10,262
How many debs does it take
to change a light bulb?

559
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:12,601
I think this ball is all in my head.

560
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,509
Four. Three to complain,
one to tell the maid to do it.

561
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:20,530
No, seriously, I can feel
the ballroom here.

562
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:22,209
Emma.

563
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,144
Sorry, Fishtown, private party.

564
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:27,032
Landon, I heard  you came up here.

565
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:28,878
Yes, to get away from you.

566
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,750
I'll say no to your dad if you want.

567
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,802
No to walking with him
or to being his new daughter?

568
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:36,425
You're his daughter.
He loves you.

569
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:39,410
How would you know?
He's proud of you.

570
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,718
He's never been proud of me for anything.

571
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,709
We have nothing in common.

572
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:48,641
There's just this.
And I can't cry...I'm wearing mascara.

573
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,692
- Landon...
- Don't. Just don't.

574
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:55,843
How many Jews does it take
to change a light bulb?

575
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:59,800
Jews are too cheap
to change a light bulb.

576
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,345
They'd rather sit in the dark.

577
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:20,349
A few minutes later
we all went downstairs.

578
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:22,237
Travis was with you?

579
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:26,554
He, uh, slipped off to find Emma.

580
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:29,063
Right before the bows started?

581
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,716
That's when she got killed.

582
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:34,801
You should have told us, Landon.

583
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:36,679
He's a friend.

584
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,473
We know him.

585
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:46,932
Guess who put two lots of jewelry
up for auction on the quiet.

586
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,907
Swan ring among the pieces.

587
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:59,755
Dug through a lot of baubles
to find this, Travis.

588
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,049
So you had Emma's ring.

589
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:04,497
Got an explanation to go with it?

590
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:06,099
It's a ring.

591
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,227
There's probably a thousand.

592
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:09,915
No.

593
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:11,976
Just two.

594
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:14,709
Landon's grandfather had them made.

595
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,142
One for his daughter,

596
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:18,462
and one for the daughter
of his housekeeper.

597
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:19,777
Lillian.

598
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:22,047
They're the girls' Christmas presents.

599
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,595
The year they turned 18.

600
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,070
I know.

601
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,753
Why'd you take Emma's ring, Travis?

602
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:31,672
Little souvenir from your first murder?

603
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,392
- No.
- No?

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,648
I loved her.

605
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:41,009
Funny, because the first time we asked,
you said you hardly knew her.

606
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,617
Now you hock her ring 
to free up some cash.

607
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:46,020
Doesn't sound much like love to me.

608
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,213
If that ring was in there,
it was a mistake.

609
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:52,666
It was the only piece of Emma I had.

610
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,738
Because it was the only piece
of her you could take.

611
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:57,947
You think you see into people?

612
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:00,074
She saw into you.

613
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:04,342
The pleaser, the guy 
who's everything to everyone.

614
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,310
The guy who's really nothing at all.

615
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:11,329
How'd it make you feel, Travis,
knowing you were a fraud?

616
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,894
Knowing Emma knew, too?

617
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,367
Emma was like a comet.

618
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,684
She just lit up everything.

619
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:27,204
I was trying to change.

620
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:29,037
But you couldn't.

621
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:31,931
Not fast enough.

622
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,626
She was up there in the sky.

623
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:40,351
I was just left there
standing on the ground.

624
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:01,672
- That's some moon.
- Yes.

625
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:05,778
There is the sea of tranquility.

626
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:07,416
It's beautiful.

627
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,088
When I was little,

628
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,242
I used to think I'd have
a house on the moon.

629
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:17,296
My mom said I'd spend all of my time 
flying, just to go there and back.

630
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,313
I said it was fine with me.

631
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:24,044
- Emma, back there, with Chip...
- It's okay.

632
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:27,636
I just laughed... / Because you're g
oing along for your family.

633
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:31,240
- I understand.
- No, Emma. It was wrong.

634
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,087
I know it.

635
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:36,401
I know it because of you.

636
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:41,787
That's a waltz.

637
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:45,030
I know that because of you.

638
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,387
So dance with me.

639
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:49,671
- The bows will start soon.
- Not yet.

640
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:04,274
You don't want me, Travis.

641
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:07,051
- You'll find someone else.
- No.

642
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,867
Someone who fits in here.
You'll teach her to dance.

643
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,695
I want you.

644
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:15,757
- It can't be me.
- Why not?

645
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,559
I can't trade who I am
to get what I want.

646
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,991
But I'm doing all this for my family.

647
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:22,792
No, you're doing this for you.

648
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:25,934
Emma, you know how I really feel.

649
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,044
You didn't say anything upstairs
because you're never going to say anything.

650
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:32,534
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I...

651
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:35,683
I just don't want to be like that.

652
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:38,981
Like me, you mean?

653
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:42,593
Say it!
Say it if you mean it!

654
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:44,546
Like you.

655
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:47,531
I don't want to be like you.

656
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:09,719
Emma...

657
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:16,184
No...
