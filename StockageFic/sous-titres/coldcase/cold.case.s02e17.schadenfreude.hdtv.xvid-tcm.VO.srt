00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:08,129
January 2, 1982

4
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:21,575
Steven totally suprised me.

5
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,155
I've seen that street.
Those houses are glamour to the max, okay?

6
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:26,780
Steven told me I could decorate
however I wanted.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,483
I mean, he's at the hospital 
all the time anyway.

8
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,086
No way.
Anyway you wanted?

9
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:33,019
So far, I've got leopard skin chairs,

10
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:36,526
a Persian carpet and
faberge eggs for the mantel.

11
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:40,654
If I was you, I'd get like a big 
neon sign, like with my name on it

12
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:46,089
- and put it in the living room.
- I'm thinking more classical.

13
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,161
Oh, sure.

14
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,077
No way.

15
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:54,728
Your doctor's here, Mrs. Chase.

16
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:00,374
Steven?

17
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:02,042
Lindsay.

18
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,180
Is there something wrong?
Baby, you're sweating.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,310
Alan...

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,812
died.

21
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,861
What do you mean?
You are gonna operate on him today.

22
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,555
On the table.

23
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:19,429
During the surgery.
While..while I was operating.

24
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,163
No...

25
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:25,717
I think.. it's gonna get ugly, Lindsay.

26
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:36,375
Don't worry about the bill.

27
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,057
Chase. L. / May `82
Closed

28
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:49,678
Victim's name is Melanie Castle.

29
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,903
All right.

30
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:55,786
The place looks ransacked.

31
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:58,294
Junkie housekeeping.

32
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:01,398
- What have we got?
- Melanie Castle, 44.

33
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,483
Looks like a heroine overdose.

34
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,983
No foul play.

35
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:08,579
Well, I'm guessing we're not here because 
the apartment just came on the market.

36
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,313
You two remember
the Lindsay Chase murder?

37
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,842
Doctor kills his wife
for the insurance money?

38
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:17,709
23 years, Steven Chase has been in prison 
telling the same story about that night.

39
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,857
So what's the connection here?

40
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:23,273
Well, the doctor swore he heard
a gunshot, came downstairs,

41
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:26,136
and saw a shaggy man and 
a blond woman running out the door.

42
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:29,345
Only, no one ever found evidence
they existed.

43
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,984
Right.

44
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,302
Melanie here was wearing this.

45
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,505
There's an inscription.

46
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:41,826
Doctor Chase, 
all my love, Lindsay.

47
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,322
- Steven Chase was right.
- Yep.

48
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:46,966
Which ended up ....

49
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,272
on a blond woman.

50
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,541

This whole box is 
wacko phone calls.

63
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:31,199
Useful citizens offering info
on a blond gal and a shaggy guy.

64
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,416
Gotta love the specifics there.

65
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,535
Jury didn't buy the doctor's story,
convicted him in two hours.

66
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:40,495
So, Steven Chase is a big league
surgeon till he loses a patient.

67
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:43,104
No, not just any patient.
Friend, Alan Moore.

68
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:45,946
And Moore's widow sues
for malpractice.

69
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,097
Doc's medical license 
gets suspended.

70
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,812
And now, he can't pay the bills,

71
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:52,834
but he has a million on 
the life insurance on the wife.

72
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,585
Ain't that sweet. She ends up 
shot in her own living room.

73
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:57,200
Gun was never found?

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,900
No. This a receipt for a .38
Chase bought a month earlier.

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,191
Guy's a doctor living in Chestnuthill.
How's he hard pressed for cash?

76
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:09,646
Well, it says here he was pulling
in ten grand a month, but spending 14.

77
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:12,072
That was the '80's, Lil.

78
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:15,715
Why save for a rainy day when
the sun's always shining.

79
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,634
So, we thinking this dead junkie
might've been half of this intruder team?

80
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:23,087
- She's got the doctor's ring.
- New day for the blond-shaggy story.

81
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:26,966
Lousy alibi, but Chase has been 
sticking to it for a long time.

82
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,417
You were quite the news item in
'82, Dr. Chase.

83
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,999
City follows your trial like it was
a World Series.

84
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,158
Yes, it's called, Schadenfreude.

85
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,220
We're dumb cops, so you'll
have to talk down to us.

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,177
Taking pleasure in
other people's misfortune.

87
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:55,023
Works best if the other's got
a long way to fall.

88
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,071
Rich doctor, beautiful wife...

89
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:58,680
Suddenly it's a wall?

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,881
Now he lives in a box
with the scum of society.

91
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,686
Makes you feel good about
your life, right?

92
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:08,173
There was also a rich
stack of evidence against you.

93
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:09,422
Like the gun you bought.

94
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:10,796
Just before Lindsay was shot.

95
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,292
That was for me.
Not her.

96
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,518
I had dark days.

97
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:18,234
And your flimsy intruder story?

98
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:21,815
If I were a liar, I would've
thought of something better.

99
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,378
Recognize this ring?

100
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:31,547
Lindsay gave it to me
when I graduated med shcool.

101
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:33,736
How did you get it?

102
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,901
Tell us about the patient you lost.

103
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,663
Alan?

104
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,031
He and Diane were our
best friends.

105
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:46,263
I made this mistake and it
changed course of all our lives.

106
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:49,029
Especially when Diane sued you.

107
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,477
I couldn't face her.

108
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,527
I..

109
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,533
shrank.

110
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,274
But Lindsay didn't.

111
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,640
We shouldn't be here.

112
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,493
Yes, we should.
Alan was our friend.

113
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:17,166
What can I say to her?
I don't have any words.

114
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,211
You will.
I know it.

115
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,045
You always do.

116
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,976
Diane, we are so sorry.

117
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,863
How can you come here?

118
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:43,442
We loved Alan.

119
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:46,636
You killed him.

120
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,780
He didn't, Diane.
It was a horrible accident.

121
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,612
I've contacted a lawyer.

122
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,596
Diane. No.

123
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:57,607
I want to see you 
lose something too.

124
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,672
I'm sorry for loss.

125
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,578
And you'll be sorry 
for your losses.

126
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,491
Sounds like a threat.

127
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,241
She was in shock.

128
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,613
Grieving.

129
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:24,385
That's when people do things
they couldn't normally stomach.

130
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:27,863
My wife was killed by a blond
and a shaggy man.

131
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,051
Diane had brown hair.

132
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,453
Still, no one had 
motive like she did.

133
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,835
It's not possible.

134
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:39,902
We weren't those kind of people.

135
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,111
No one ever is.

136
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:50,378
Diane Moore?

137
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,461
- Do I know you?
- I'm Detective Valens, Homicide.

138
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,189
Nice ride.

139
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,745
Well, it gets me there.

140
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,859
It's about Lindsay Chase.

141
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:07,178
- What about Lindsay?
- We're looking at her murder again.

142
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,145
Poor Steven's been paying for that
for twenty years.

143
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,500
Poor Steven?

144
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,747
He was a good friend at one time.

145
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:16,412
Are you singing a different tune
than you did in '82?

146
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,847
The way I heard it,

147
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:20,696
you gave it to Steven and Lindsay 
pretty good at your husband's funeral.

148
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,214
Sent them away.

149
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:28,357
I was out of my head
when I lost Alan.

150
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,415
I couldn't see pass the pain.

151
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,799
- Yeah?
- I wanted their world to crumble.

152
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,180
- Like mine had.
- And that's why the lawsuit.

153
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,627
And it broke them.

154
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:44,020
He couldn't practice, pay 
the mortgage. They were a cash poor.

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,980
Plus, Chase got real depressed.

156
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,171
It was a horror show.

157
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,981
And I couldn't get enough of it.

158
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:05,860
Lindsay, hi.

159
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,975
- D'you need a color?
- No.

160
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,510
Well, yeah.
But that's not why I'm here.

161
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,518
I'm looking for employment.

162
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,224
I don't have professional experience,
but I'm good with hair and nails.

163
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:20,474
Kitty, I've got aerobics in 20 minutes.

164
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:21,893
2 secs, Diane.

165
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:25,426
No, now.
I'm the one paying you.

166
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:32,425
Look, all I've got is hair
sweeping stuff.

167
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:35,870
It's a minimum wage and it's
your friends's hair.

168
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,986
They're not my friends anymore.
So I don't mind.

169
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,861
I just need to make enough
for groceries till Steven gets better.

170
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,171
Sure.

171
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,481
It'll be great, Linds.
Welcome.

172
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:57,628
I was so distraught...

173
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,867
I actually enjoyed 
watching her suffer.

174
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:06,267
It wasn't until later I thought
maybe it was me.

175
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:10,024
- You what?
- Who caused her death.

176
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,696
Maybe the lawsuit drove 
Steven over the edge,

177
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:16,520
made him kill her.

178
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,188
Anything on our dead blond junkie?

179
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,339
Looked into her glorious past.

180
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:26,569
Few jobs, stint in rehab, usual story.

181
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,211
No connect to the Chases?

182
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,652
Scotty have better luck?

183
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,837
Well, Lindsay Chase may have taken 
a low rent job a few months before she died.

184
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,340
Will's running that down.

185
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,302
Struck out.

186
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:40,166
IRS has no record of her working
at the Patrick Brea Salon or anywhere else.

187
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,673
What's it Salon?

188
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:44,368
Brea.
B.R.E.A.

189
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:50,824
That was Melanie Castle's 
employer, January to August, '82.

190
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:53,008
That's the same time Lindsay
was killed.

191
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,785
So our blond and Lindsay Chase
were co-workers.

192
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:14,235
Kitty Shaw?

193
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,385
Katarine.

194
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,158
I figured I'd upgrade the name
and the rest of my life would follow.

195
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,151
Tada.

196
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,063
Detectives Rush and Jeffries.
Homicide.

197
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,939
We're wondering if you remember
Lindsay Chase.

198
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,847
Of course.
She was my friend.

199
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,289
Why don't we...

200
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,954
What about Melanie Castle?

201
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:43,155
We worked together like,
million years ago.

202
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:45,644
Yikes, why?

203
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:49,526
Melanie died two days ago.

204
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:52,823
- Heroine overdose.
- Oh god, no.

205
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:54,602
What does that have to do
with Lindsay?

206
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,421
We're taking another look
at her murder.

207
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:57,979
I thought her husband killed her.

208
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:01,406
We heard she might have worked 
for you back at Patrick Brea Salon.

209
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,685
That's what we hear, 
but there's no record of it.

210
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,356
We paid her under the table.

211
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:07,599
Paid most of the sweepers
under table.

212
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,369
- Like Melanie?
- Yeah.

213
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:12,125
Now, those two, that,

214
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,872
that was a culture clash.

215
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:16,738
And Melanie didn't appreciate
the extra help with the broom?

216
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:22,650
I don't think Melanie thought of Lindsay 
as a helpful presence in her life.

217
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,288
No.

218
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,373
Feel better?

219
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:42,180
I'm sorry.
You probably had plans.

220
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,409
- I didn't mean to cry at work.
- Hey.

221
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,244
I'd cry too if my super-hunk hubby
was depressed in bed all day.

222
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,954
Plus, I thought 8 hours would
add up to more than this.

223
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,450
Steven's gonna pull through.

224
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,219
He's got a million reasons
to get out of bed.

225
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,870
You, is one.

226
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,484
- We're talking, okay?
- Tell Timmy.

227
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:06,760
I wanted to sit at the bar.

228
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,368
Is this a girl thing?

229
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,249
No, it's fine.

230
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,040
Hi.

231
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:16,404
Timmy, this is Lindsay.

232
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,493
Yeah, I saw you before.

233
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,910
You're not driving 
the beemer anymore.

234
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,230
Got repo'd.

235
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,111
You got money problems.

236
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:31,621
That hair sweeping job isn't gonna help 
you out, but I know about other stuff.

237
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,631
Real stuff that could help you out.

238
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,881
She's not like that.
Take a chill.

239
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:38,886
Okay, I can see that 
she's classy, okay?

240
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:41,382
You don't have to point it out.

241
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,267
I wanna go.

242
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,662
Now.

243
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,556
Why?

244
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,988
Just got one gulp down.
What's...?

245
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,483
Psycho!

246
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:02,422
Mel.

247
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:07,329
So Melanie was a little sensitive about 
her boyfriend making eyes at Lindsay?

248
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,374
Sounds like she wasn't too crazy
about her before that.

249
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:14,136
She kind of felt Lindsay was
lording over us, but...

250
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,974
It wasn't like that.

251
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,237
Know where Timmy ended up?

252
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:24,326
Jail, half way house, something
sensational like that.

253
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,999
Have you..

254
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,622
Have you ever thought about
doing a rinse?

255
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,264
Sometimes.

256
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,776
You could go copper.

257
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,858
You got the skin for it.

258
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:36,872
I'll think about it.

259
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,827
- Hey.
- Scotty.

260
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,347
Timothy Horan.

261
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,620
How's he looking?

262
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,842
Shaggy.

263
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:51,007
Starting in '83, methamphetamine,
methamphetamine, methamphetamine.

264
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,375
Three time loser 
with a blond girlfriend.

265
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,599
Yeah, who hated Lindsay Chase.

266
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,268
- We'll go pick him up.
- Think so.

267
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,504
Scotty.
I got something for you.

268
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,649
- Who's this?
- It's doctor, a grief counselor.

269
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,934
- I don't need that, boss.
- Well, it can't hurt, can it?

270
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,079
- Boss.
- You never talk about it, Scotty.

271
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,542
I do better not talking.

272
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,160
All right, throw it away.

273
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,075
Timothy Horan.

274
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,469
I ain't done nothing wrong, officers.
I live straight now.

275
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,968
Sober, except for beer.

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,149
So, this how you making it by?

277
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,524
- With your Windex?
- I tried working regulars.

278
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,896
Took too much out of me.

279
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,495
Well, see what you can
muster up for this.

280
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:55,039
We hear about Lindsay Chase.

281
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,489
You and your girlfriend Melanie
knew her.

282
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,083
Yeah, you two fit the description
of the couple Steven Chase saw

283
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,760
bolting out of his house that night.

284
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,253
Whoa, Lindsay was my friend.

285
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,634
Is that what you call girls
you got a mission to bang?

286
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,398
There were sparks, that was mutual.

287
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,193
Not how we heard it, Timmy.

288
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:12,078
We heard Melanie hated Lindsay for 
acting like she was better than you two.

289
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,298
Yeah. She got real bent out of shape
at you for drooling over Lindsay.

290
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:19,375
So maybe you made it up to Melanie
by taking the lady down.

291
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:23,697
Me and Lindsay made a true bond.
She came to me for help.

292
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:25,398
Yeah?
How'd that go?

293
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,309
She asked me if it was
really true I could make money.

294
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,765
- What'd you say?
- Well, I said yeah, for you, sure.

295
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,960
I just need a place to cook.

296
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:54,278
Kitty, my house smells like pee.
Steven's coming home tomorrow.

297
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,946
We'll roast coffee grounds.
That'll cover it.

298
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:00,298
Hey, those are our wedding gift.

299
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:02,331
They work good.

300
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,266
Look at me.
I'm a doctor's wife.

301
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,980
That's Steven's ring.
He's gained weight.

302
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,725
It doesn't fit him.

303
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:12,999
- Put it back, Melanie.
- Why? You got her shirt on.

304
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:16,469
Cuz Lindsay gave it to me.
I didn't lift it. Put it back.

305
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:22,116
After this, no more. It's not right.
All this in your nice house, okay?

306
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,920
Hey.

307
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,104
He's here.

308
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,499
So I owe you half.

309
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:58,454
- That's only three thousand dollars.
- Lindsay.

310
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,285
It's 25 hundred now.

311
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,136
Okay, Mike.

312
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,524
No.

313
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,556
What did you say?

314
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,988
Lindsay, don't.

315
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,341
Take it off.

316
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,734
6 thousand, a deal's a deal.

317
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,098
Except when it's not.

318
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:20,133
I could kill you right now,
get the whole batch for nothing.

319
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,548
If I wanted to.

320
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:32,146
Take the deal or leave my house.

321
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,714
And you never see anything like it.

322
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,111
You don't talk to Mike like that.
He was in the big things.

323
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,599
- What kind of things?
- Big money things.

324
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,966
Did you tell Lindsay 
about the big money?

325
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,572
Well, yeah. She was real curious 
about the stuff he did.

326
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:54,698
Money laundering, 
insurance scams.

327
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:56,918
You know if Lindsay and Mike
ever met again?

328
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,479
She'd be dead if they did.

329
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,961
Which she is, Tim.

330
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,880
Looks like Lindsay was getting in over 
her head trying to make some quick cash.

331
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,013
Fell in with the bad crowd,
speed freaks.

332
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:20,498
It could be why she didn't
tell her husband about the salon job.

333
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,784
Didn't want her meeting the low life
she was hanging with.

334
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:25,755
We think her slide might have
ended up with Mike Doherty.

335
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,664
Well, despite what Timmy said
about him, the guy ain't got a record.

336
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,109
He worked under the radar.

337
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,793
Made a pile collecting insurance from
staged robberies.

338
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:34,539
Put some meth deals on the side.

339
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,448
What's Mike up to these days?

340
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:39,772
He owns Doherty Systems,
a home security store.

341
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,120
Moved up in the world.

342
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,091
Put his crapulous skills to use.

343
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:46,054
I gotta get Scotty.
Drop in on Mike.

344
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:48,208
See if he and Lindsay met again.

345
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,097
Wonder why Kitty never mentioned
the meth cookout.

346
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:55,342
You'd think cooking drugs with
Wiliams Sonoma would ring some bells.

347
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,471
I can't feel my face.

348
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,552
Southern comfort,
it melts it right off.

349
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:11,948
Speaking of comfort,
how's your barmaid?

350
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,193
You're gonna henpeck me now too?

351
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,059
I waved the red flag once.

352
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,654
You don't heed, it ain't my worry.

353
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:21,759
Well, she keeps me guessing.

354
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,309
So, this ain't just a move for you?

355
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,922
Chris, a move?

356
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,547
Nah.

357
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,784
I don't know.
I don't think so.

358
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,482
- What?
- Well, you should figure that out.

359
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:42,021
- Right.
- Soon.

360
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,475
Yeah.

361
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:49,938
Dead bolts, chain locks.

362
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,786
This what's call
on systems, Mike?

363
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:54,405
Keep out the bad guys, don't they?

364
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,883
You'd know, I guess.

365
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,483
Don't get your meaning. / Your customers 
know they're being protected by criminal?

366
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,174
Never been arrested in my life.

367
00:22:02,174 --> 00:22:04,691
So what can you tell us about
Lindsay Chase?

368
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,461
Her husband killed her.

369
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,526
Blamed druggy intruders.

370
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,030
I read all about it.

371
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,896
Oh, you had closer seat
than that, Mike.

372
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:13,706
You were at Lindsay's house.
Remember?

373
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,566
To buy meth.

374
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,418
- You threatened her.
- I may have negotiated with her.

375
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:20,218
I could kill you right now.

376
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,475
- That a negotiation?
- She couldn't have been too scared.

377
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,120
Cuz she invited me back.
Alone this time.

378
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,530
Well, let's talk about that.

379
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,924
The woman had guts.
That's what I remember.

380
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,018
This real?

381
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:41,785
Yes, we were in Shanghai last year.

382
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,915
What's that?

383
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:50,323
No, not that. Steven's great-grandfather 
was turn of the century's water colorist.

384
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:51,956
It was a wedding gift.

385
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,609
He famous?

386
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,268
Grandpa.

387
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:58,158
Experts know him.
But you can't have it.

388
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:00,444
It has sentimental value.

389
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,451
If you don't want to this,
sell your house.

390
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,170
Don't waste my time.

391
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:07,158
I told you.
We can't.

392
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,413
He'd fall apart.

393
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,662
Then here it is.

394
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:17,109
The night of the job, I'll call
you from the minimart on Highland.

395
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,320
I'll ring twice and hang up.

396
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,758
You got it?

397
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:21,859
Yeah.

398
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,585
That call's your 5 minute warning.

399
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:27,398
Get upstairs.
Turn off the lights.

400
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,777
Okay.

401
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:32,245
Next morning, call the cops.

402
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,483
And then you wait 6 months
to collect the insurance.

403
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:36,925
I can't wait.
I need the moeny.

404
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:40,031
- You can't look needy.
- I am needy.

405
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:44,604
6 months, or we don't do this.

406
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,574
Fine.

407
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,552
We split insurance money,

408
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:55,488
I sell your stuff for cash
which I keep.

409
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:57,848
- What are you doing?
- You're high maintenance.

410
00:23:57,848 --> 00:24:00,819
I need a bonus, I'll take this.

411
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,159
Just a deal, not this.

412
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:08,112
No this, no deal.

413
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,868
She buttoned up,
no sale.

414
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,313
And you just let that happen.

415
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:22,416
I had 30 other deals going,
I didn't need her.

416
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:26,755
Gal gets you all worked up
and you just walk away?

417
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,827
Nobody gets me all worked up.

418
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:33,015
And her dying a week later,
that's coincidence.

419
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,702
I wasn't thnking 
about her a week later.

420
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:38,393
She wasted enough of my time.

421
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:43,295
I still can't get used to 50 bucks
for a haircut.

422
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,186
And now I make a living, I...

423
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,864
Hate to spend money.

424
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:48,255
Not me.

425
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:52,383
Minute I wasn't scraping by,
I spent like it was my job.

426
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:54,625
Look at yourself, Lilly.

427
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:59,763
So, Kitty. How come you didn't tell us
about Lindsay and the meth?

428
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,948
She was my friend.
I was protecting her.

429
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,061
How's that work?

430
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:08,398
She was ashamed of how
desperate she was.

431
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,415
She wouldn't want people knowing

432
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:14,242
that she had a bunch cretins turning
her nice house into a meth lab.

433
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:16,576
I'm not judging Lindsay.

434
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:20,605
She was a good person
in a tough spot.

435
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,951
You know, I might as well just
tell you the worst then.

436
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,650
She stooped even lower than that.

437
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,568
This have something to do with Mike?

438
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:32,633
- Timmy.
- Melanie's guy?

439
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,368
Kid was tripping over himself
to get with Lindsay.

440
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,754
She knew it.

441
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:40,828
And she needed someone to help 
her with what she was planning.

442
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:52,841
You know what I think?

443
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:56,036
I think people underestimate you.

444
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:59,285
- Yeah?
- You're sweet.

445
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,948
You're fun.

446
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:02,578
Having fun, huh?

447
00:26:02,578 --> 00:26:04,540
And you're smart.

448
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,977
You're so sexy.

449
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:12,396
I need smart.

450
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,956
What's going on?

451
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,725
Me and her are talking.
Beat it.

452
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:22,863
- Where's Melanie?
- Cousin's funeral.

453
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:24,967
Butt out.

454
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,047
How about some 
more peanuts, Timmy?

455
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:29,466
Yeah.
Coming up.

456
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:35,293
What are you doing, Linds?

457
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,668
Just hanging with Tinmmy.

458
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:40,587
You mean you're 
shaking your ass for him.

459
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:42,550
What's going on?

460
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:51,043
You know how that guy, Mike pulled
the plug on the robbery.

461
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,665
Cuz you wouldn't give it up for him.

462
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:54,173
And that was the right thing.

463
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:57,796
But I thought if I got 
someone else to do it.

464
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,720
Someone I can control.

465
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,244
Linds, look at me.

466
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:05,657
That's not the kind of people we are.

467
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,790
We don't work it for twerps
like Timmy. We're above that.

468
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,483
You just gotta hang in there.

469
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:16,450
You know what song Steven loves?

470
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,900
Don't Stop Thinking about Tomorrow.

471
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,680
That is so true, Linds.

472
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,916
That's what I wanna 
hear you saying.

473
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,089
Things are gonna get good again.

474
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:32,036
Fresh nuts, sexy.

475
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,287
Take a hike, Timmy.

476
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,802
You are so out of line.

477
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,508
Lindsay.

478
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,550
I know I'm jumping the gun,
but maybe you should tell your friend.

479
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,283
There are sparks.
I'm not making it up.

480
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:46,588
Right?

481
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:08,789
So Timmy got rejected by Lindsay
hours before she died?

482
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:12,053
Yeah, he was dreaming.
She was so far out of his league.

483
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:16,050
It doesn't mean he couldn't have
lashed out at her for sending him away.

484
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,258
I guess not.

485
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,507
How did he take Lindsay's death?

486
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:24,254
Truth is, I don't know.

487
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,700
He and Melanie split.

488
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,082
He never showed his face
at the bar again.

489
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,429
I never

490
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,507
downed so much of this

491
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,615
I forgot where I was.

492
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,978
You don't wanna play 
"I never" with me.

493
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:04,545
I never stole a liquor from
my employer after hours.

494
00:29:09,738 --> 00:29:14,670
I never caused 
complications for myself.

495
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,928
Just cuz of some guy.

496
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:20,365
Worth it.

497
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:30,044
I never checked my cell phone
ten times in an hour.

498
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:33,173
Cuz I was hoping someone
had called.

499
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:37,449
What kind of someone?

500
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:39,994
Complicated.

501
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:49,570
Never ...

502
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,697
pictured someone so vivid
from the night before,

503
00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:00,821
I missed my stop.

504
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:05,826
Went 5 miles out of my way
before I realized.

505
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,965
You ain't sick of me?

506
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:17,432
Feels like you just got here.

507
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:41,657
Lindsay Chase treated you
real bad, Timmy.

508
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:45,058
- Led you on.
- Me, I can't stand a tease.

509
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:47,889
You go down the rope,
you should deliver.

510
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:50,011
You tell her that?

511
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:52,538
You go to Lindsay's house that night
and tell her your terms?

512
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:55,825
No. / High class lady like that,
I bet you she laughed in your face.

513
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,669
- She wasn't teasing me.
- She lied about the sparks.

514
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:01,249
Yeah, but in front of her friend.

515
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:06,932
Something happened when her
friend wasn't around?

516
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:10,827
Before Kitty had to butt in,
Lindsay and me were confidants.

517
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,326
Is that so?

518
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:15,946
She told me about how it really
was in that big fancy house.

519
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:21,701
It's all roses on the outside,
but inside she was crying.

520
00:31:22,485 --> 00:31:24,810
About what, Timmy?

521
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:32,840
Her husband, inspite of having
a grade A wife, had a dish on the side.

522
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,657
Steven Chase had a girlfriend?

523
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,525
Hurt Lindsay especially bad.

524
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,849
Cuz it was her friend.

525
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:43,493
Some Diane girl.

526
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:46,124
Diane?

527
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:48,682
You sure about that?

528
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,984
So it was the doc and Diane, huh?

529
00:31:52,984 --> 00:31:56,511
Puts a new spin on her husband
dying on his table.

530
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:10,464
I think I figured it out, doc.

531
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:14,087
The way you live, solipsism.

532
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:17,146
Oh, I'm not Ivy Leavue, 
but I pick up a thing or two.

533
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:20,095
It's a belief that you're the only
thing that really exists.

534
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:21,932
- I know what it means.
- It's your world.

535
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:23,557
We're just living in it.
Sound right?

536
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:27,942
- No, it doesn't.
- You had an affair with Diane Moore.

537
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:32,140
Yes.

538
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,030
Left that part out.

539
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,681
I wonder why.

540
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:39,429
Her husband dies on your operating
table just months before your wife gets shot,

541
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:41,600
clearing the way for
you and Diane.

542
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,369
- No.
- No?

543
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,026
Yes, it happened.
No, I didn't plan it.

544
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:49,030
Two dead people and all,
but who cares it's your world.

545
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,922
You get what you want.

546
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:53,584
- Diane.
- Alan dying ruined my life.

547
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,558
- That's cuz she turned on you.
- Wrong.

548
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,940
And the jury didn't buy your lame 
story and sent you away forever.

549
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,008
Suddenly the world didn't
revolve around you.

550
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:03,658
The affair was nothing.

551
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:06,827
Hurt Lindsay enough to 
bring it up to a virtual stranger.

552
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:09,845
- What stranger?
- Young buck named Timmy.

553
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:13,192
Loser to the core.
But he loved Lindsay.

554
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,491
I loved Lindsay.

555
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:19,347
Nothing says that sweeter
than banging her friend.

556
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:25,955
The times were indulgent, selfish...

557
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:29,624
I caught up in it.

558
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:33,563
Well, while you were being
selfish and indulgent,

559
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:37,743
your wife was down on the ground with
the rest of us, trying to scrape out a living.

560
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:39,987
- What do you mean?
- She was dealing drugs,

561
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:42,406
planning to rip off your house
to get the insurance money.

562
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:44,060
What?

563
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,547
Lindsay?

564
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:48,942
She was desperate.

565
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,666
To save you.

566
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:56,804
Then we both hit our lowest point.

567
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,096
Funny thing is that's when
we found each other again.

568
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:17,017
Steven, what are you 
doing on the dark?

569
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:23,426
I ruined our lives.

570
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:27,004
What are you doing?

571
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,201
Who are you dressed like that for?

572
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,672
- No one.
- You seeing someone?

573
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:36,503
- No, Steven, give me the gun.
- I wouldn't blame ya.

574
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:40,103
Please, give it to me.

575
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,735
Without me,

576
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:47,777
you can get
your life back.

577
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,302
This is my life.

578
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:59,135
Us.

579
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:09,854
I miss you.

580
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:13,783
If you leave,

581
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:18,144
I don't know 
what will happen to me.

582
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,783
I've been so lost.

583
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:25,984
I just want to get away
from here, okay?

584
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:30,542
Okay.

585
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:36,277
Honey, yes.

586
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:40,077
We'll sell the house
and we'll leave.

587
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:42,782
Okay?

588
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:46,570
I just wanna be with you.

589
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:57,481
Will you go upstairs with me?

590
00:36:06,353 --> 00:36:10,423
You go.
I'll be right there.

591
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:19,397
I love you, babe.

592
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:21,823
I love you.

593
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:28,685
I went upstairs and

594
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:31,463
heard the shot.

595
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:37,199
End of Lindsay and me.

596
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:42,040
You said the phone rang twice.

597
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:44,256
What does that mean?

598
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:47,720
Two rings and hang up.
That was your signal, Mike.

599
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,060
Except the deal was off,
remember?

600
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,955
Then how come we have a phone call 
coming from a convenient store in Highland.

601
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:57,000
Minutes before Lindsay's murder.

602
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,095
- You tell me.
- Your plan was in motion.

603
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,432
You telling us you weren't part of it.

604
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,424
I hope you got more 
than a phone call.

605
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,220
You afraid we're 
wasting your time, Mike?

606
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,789
Like Lindsay wasted yours.

607
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,767
You didn't answer me.

608
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,992
Is this all you have?

609
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:16,618
No, it ain't.

610
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,264
We were just wasting our time
looking into your finances

611
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:22,153
and came up with 
something interesting.

612
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,916
Seems Doherty Systems has been
receiving payments from Katarine Salon.

613
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,139
Since the early '80s.

614
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,881
Now why would 
Kitty be paying Mike?

615
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,941
- That's pretty mysterious.
- Yeah.

616
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:36,022
You two secretly family, Mike?

617
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,126
I ain't talking.

618
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,814
Okay.

619
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,627
- We'll talk to Kitty.
- That should be easy.

620
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,953
You know how these
hairdressers are. Talk, talk, talk.

621
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:49,011
I was there.

622
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,493
Were you?

623
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:53,499
But I didn't kill her.

624
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,924
- I can prove it.
- How?

625
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,458
I have the gun.

626
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,580
With her prints on it.

627
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,687
That's why she pays me.

628
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,759
So Kitty was the blond?

629
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:23,439
- Keep a look out.
- What?

630
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,948
You're supposed 
to be out of here.

631
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:36,854
The plan is off.
What are you doing here?

632
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:39,565
- Kitty?
- Linds. Go upstairs.

633
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:42,086
Me and Mike can do this whole thing 
right and you can get your money.

634
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,814
- I don't wanna do this anymore, Kitty.
- You don't have to do anything.

635
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:48,909
- I took care of it.
- This is a mess. You said it was set.

636
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:51,830
Lindsay.

637
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:54,851
I gave him what he wanted.
So don't worry.

638
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:57,351
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just like I said.

639
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:58,849
Why did you do that?

640
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:04,461
Well, duh, for you..
For tomorrow.

641
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:06,650
You better tomorrows.

642
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,659
Like it?
It's my Stevie Nicks thing.

643
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:10,901
Are you crazy?

644
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,918
You're the one who talked
about the song.

645
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:17,880
Steven's upstairs.
Just please go.

646
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,997
Yeah, no problem.
This is way too sloppy.

647
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:22,808
Why are you pissed at me?

648
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:24,853
I'm doing this as your friend.

649
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,888
This is crazy.
I was crazy, okay?

650
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:29,410
- I'm not like this.
- And I am?

651
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,602
I am like this, I guess.

652
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,595
Right?

653
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:42,422
We're selling the house and leaving here.
Leaving this all behind.

654
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,119
So just go.

655
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,995
Got it.

656
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,823
- No. / - Hey.
- Kitty, please.

657
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:56,750
I thought I was like
your closest friend.

658
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,732
Put that down.

659
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,764
Kitty, please.

660
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,958
Was I?

661
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,345
Kitty, my god.

662
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:08,607
I just wanna know.

663
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,724
Was I your friend?

664
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,680
Did you ever even care?

665
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,442
Yes. Fine.
Whatever. Please.

666
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:18,640
Just get out.
Get out of my life.

667
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:23,421
