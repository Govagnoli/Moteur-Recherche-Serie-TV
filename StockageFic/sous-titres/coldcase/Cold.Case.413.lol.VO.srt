The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,420
January14,1996

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,700
Is't from Rwanda, uncle Tad?

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,340
800,000 dead in a hundred days.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,650
Rwanda's where the gorillas are, aren't they?

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,610
I love gorillas.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,060
Did you see any?

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,230
Uh, it wasn't that kind of trip.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,490
Did you see anybody get killed, uncle tad?

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,030
Just a lot of dead bodies.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,100
You should've stuck to the gorillas, if you ask me.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,360
I need a drink.

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,800
I'll get you one, dad.

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,630
Hey, we're on our own tonight, gin.

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,690
Ice bucket's empty.

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,980
I gave the help the night off 'cause of the snowstorm.

17
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, that is magnanimous of you, dad.

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,010
So it'll be nice.

19
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,950
Just family for once.

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,740
who could that be?

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,840
lauren?What are you doing here?

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,300
It is my favorite grandson's birthday.

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,550
Is it not?

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,370
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,820
Mom, I didn't think you'd make it.

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,100
Look at your hair.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,350
I had it colored.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,180
I can see that.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,190
There's the man of the hour now.

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,830
Hi, grandma.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,710
You look just like your father.

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,270
How is the unmentionable one, anyway?

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,380
I wouldn't know, mom.

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,490
He's in ohio with his new wife.

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,710
Well, he was good-looking.I'll give him that.

36
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,690
And I see you're back from safari.

37
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,710
Sherpas carry you, or did you make it through the snow on your own?

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,320
Your morbid fascination with death is getting worrisome, tad.

39
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you, mother.I'm glad you like them.

40
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,590
They're horrid.

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,300
As opposed to this lovely creature.

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,570
I'm diane gilbert, mrs.Williams.

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,020
Oh, please.Lauren.

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,570
Do tell, tad.

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,310
She's with me, not tad.

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,620
Of course she is.

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,830
Yikes.

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,890
Power's out.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,460
Diane: I love blackouts.

50
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,760
Tad: Does this mean we can all leave?

51
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,980
No.It means we're going to get cozy,

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,690
have a nice family gathering...plus one.

53
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,140
Mom?You okay?

54
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,410
Will someone please do something?

55
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:28,011
Decedent:Williams,Lauren
Cause of Death:Drowning

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,100
That's the internet mogul?

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,940
Mr.Heller?

58
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,520
Hey, detectives!Thanks for coming.

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,060
Hungry?Want a garden burger?

60
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,650
No.Thanks.

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,770
You have information on lauren williams?

62
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah.Lady supposedly drowned accidentally?

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,910
That's right.

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,690
Look under the board.

65
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,010
I'm the first owner since
the place was put on the market back in '96.

66
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,760
So nobody's touched anything.No

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,030
do you see it?

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,990
Scratch marks.

69
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,280
You okay there, scotty?

70
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,630
It looks like a fingernail.

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,060
Red nail polish.

72
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,430
Take a look.

73
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,120
It's lauren williams's, isn't it?

74
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,450
Could be.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,470
Means she was murdered, doesn't it?

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,260
It means she put up a fight.

77
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,430
Question is, who was she fighting?

78

Hurry up.Bus ain't gonna wait.

82
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,890
Morning, kiddo.'

83
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,440
Sup.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,850
Hey, you.

85
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,330
Found this in my sheets this morning...someone's sock.

86
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,390
Mysterious.

87
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,950
Yeah.No ideas how it might've got there?

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,260
Possibly this new neighbor, moved in below.

89
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,730
Frisky fella?

90
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,370
Frisky ain't the half of it.

91
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,370
Well, maybe had the lady let the poor guy stay the night,

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,380
he'd be less careless.

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,970
Lady's got a son.

94
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,110
Son don't need to know what his mama's up to.

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
I hear that.

96
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,910
So, uh, you have a nice day now, detective.

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,170
You too, ma'am.

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,710
Get on now.

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
See you tonight?

100
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,870
If you're lucky.

101
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,270
Rush: So if that fingernail is lauren's,

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,940
my guess is someone was on the diving board holding her head under.

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,440
While she scratched and clawed at
the only thing she could reach.

104
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,560
The night of january 11,

105
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,460
1996 half the city lost power from
8:15 P.M.To 1:37 A.M.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,300
Me puts the time of death at approximately 1:00 A.M.

107
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,610
Which means she was probably killed in the dark.

108
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,340
Ex-husband claimed he found her the next morning

109
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,940
around 6:00 floating in the pool.

110
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,320
Blood alcohol was .24

111
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,060
That sauced, no wonder they thought it was an accident.

112
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,660
There were only five people in the house that night, other than lauren.

113
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,600
Stanford, the ex-husband; virginia, the daughter; tad, the son.

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Diane gilbert, stanford's fiancée at the time.

115
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,480
And matthew, lauren's 13-year-old grandson.

116
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,170
Five rich little indians.

117
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,560
Follow the money, see who benefited from lauren's death.

118
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,200
My money's on the ex.

119
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,830
Well, scotty and will are with him now.

120
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,850
Well, that's good.

121
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,290
'Cause I'm guessing he's involved.

122
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,740
Why's that?

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,590
Stanford williams was 60 at the time and his fiancée was 28.

124
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,530
That makes him a killer?

125
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,650
That makes him a scumbag.

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,890
You're sure lauren was murdered?

127
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,050
Jeffries: You find that hard to believe?

128
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,380
Yes and no.

129
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,210
Because...?

130
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,450
Because of who was at the house that night, of course.

131
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,090
And no?

132
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,490
Because my ex-wife was a raving bitch.

133
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,510
Bad divorce?

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,700
Hideous.

135
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,590
Well, that much hostility,
why'd she show up at your house that night?

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,000
My daughter ginny invited her out of courtesy, thinking she wouldn't come.

137
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,880
Must've been awkward with your fiancée there.

138
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,360
Awkward would be putting it mildly.

139
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:34,220
So maybe you took advantage of the blackout,
got rid of your ex once and for all.

140
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,980
After she cleaned me out,
I thought of little else but killing lauren.

141
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,260
But drowning was never an option...too humane.

142
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,410
Really?

143
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,270
My fantasy was to bury her alive,
scarabs feasting on her intestines.

144
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,200
Where were you between midnight
and the time you

145
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,130
found your wife in the pool, mr.Williams?

146
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,190
I was in bed.

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,250
With your fiancée?

148
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,850
No.Alone, I'm afraid.

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,830
Lauren made sure of that.

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,110
How?

151
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,600
She dropped a bomb on us, as she was her wont to do.

152
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,150
here are more candles.

153
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,890
Stan, there are fresh batteries in the drawer for the flashlight.

154
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,310
Well, you certainly seem to know
your way around, don't you?

155
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,540
Lauren, don't start.

156
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,690
I'm just saying your new one seems very handy.

157
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,140
Incoming.

158
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,960
Mom, it's matt's birthday.

159
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,090
I know how difficult this musbe for you, diane,

160
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,300
being in a house with no electricity.

161
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,030
I'm not sure I follow.

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,530
Lauren: A reminder of your childhood, dear.

163
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,710
You are from tinley, arkansas, aren't you?

164
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,130
You researched my fiancée?

165
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,870
Maybe back in your day there was no electricity,

166
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,270
mrs.Williams, but in mine...

167
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,160
your three children are living with your mother back in tinley, aren't they?

168
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,130
Stan: Lauren, that's enough.

169
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,600
Stanford, don't tell me you didn't know about diane's brood?

170
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,260
Now don't let the fact that stanford
was an abject failure

171
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,860
as a father with our children worry you, diane.

172
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm sure he'll be a wonderful pop to your young'uns.

173
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,960
Stan told me you were a bitch, but...

174
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,980
but what, dear?

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,290
He didn't tell me you were so cruel.

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,090
Three kids?

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,980
You're going to pay for this.

178
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,180
lauren took no prisoners.

179
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,660
So, bombshell have the desired effect?

180
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,270
Lauren did me a favor, saved me from
getting saddled with three more mouths to feed.

181
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,760
So you see, I had no reason to kill her that night.

182
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,620
Well, how'd diane take you breaking it off with her?

183
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,460
Badly.

184
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,340
You're saying somebody actually murdered mrs.Williams?

185
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,790
Somebody who was in the house the night of the blackout.

186
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,530
Somebody who had reason to want her dead.

187
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,610
Well, I was there and I had reason, but I didn't kill her.

188
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,930
No?She was more pathetic than anything else.

189
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,260
That right?

190
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,120
After 20 years of marriage, stanraded lauren in for a newer model.

191
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,560
You?

192
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,880
Now that I have a few more miles on me, I can understand how she felt.

193
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,380
But you didn't understand that back in '96.

194
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,130
When you were the one with the low mileage.

195
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,450
No.

196
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,780
Well, lauren cost you your chance of marrying into the williams clan.

197
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,620
In retrospect, that blackout was a blessing.

198
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,970
A blessing?

199
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,770
Being trapped in that house, in the dark, with those people.

200
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,930
Eye-opening?

201
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,570
Terrifying.

202
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,690
Thought you would've booked.

203
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,340
Gone from bad to worse out there.Whiteout.

204
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,460
Oh, the good old days.

205
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,570
Your family looked so perfect.

206
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,550
"Looked" being the operative word.

207
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,620
That's your mother?

208
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,980
Took it when I was 13.

209
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,860
She was incredible.

210
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,890
She was a beauty queen from garth, pennsylvania.

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,290
Garth?

212
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,410
That's as bad as tinley.

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,810
Williams steel had a plant there.

214
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,600
That's how she met my dad, on an inspection tour.

215
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,700
So what went wrong?

216
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,520
My dad lost interest after we were born.
Started fooling around.

217
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,830
Although he could've been cheating before,
for all I know.

218
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,370
No.It was later.

219
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,490
Around the time you were born, tad.

220
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,940
I knew it had to be my fault somehow.

221
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,660
can you imagine cheating on a woman that looked like that?

222
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,300
I can.

223
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,210
You're wasting your talent and your life.

224
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,700
What's it to you?

225
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm your mother.

226
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,980
When convenient.

227
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,090
We'll talk about this later.

228
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,490
No, by all means, continue.

229
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,950
I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, mom.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,930
Oh, you mean a success,
as opposed to an abject failure.

231
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm not sure reuters or the associated press would agree with you.

232
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,990
Peddling pictures of the world's misery?

233
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,650
Please.It's shameful.

234
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay, just stay the hell out of my life.

235
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,410
I will do no such thing.

236
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,880
If only that were really you.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,070
Don't mind me.

238
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,390
When are you going to grow up and become a man?

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,560
The day you die.

240
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,290
So you just left them there,
at each other's throats?

241
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,460
Diane: Went upstairs, and waited for stan to break up with me.

242
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,100
Which he did.

243
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,690
Moms always know just where to strike.

244
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,960
Woman went for the jugular.

245
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,920
She pushed tad over the edge.

246
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,560
And he pushed back.

247
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,580
Investigating the murder of my mother is a serious waste of taxpayer dollars.

248
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, yeah?

249
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,810
Because whoever did it deserves a medal.

250
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,780
Maybe that's you.

251
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,470
We know you argued with you, night she was killed.

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,860
You know well,I argue with her every time I saw her.

253
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,730
Always get that heated?

254
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,410
Well,she want me to be someone I wasn't.

255
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,520
And I wanne be someone she wasn't.

256
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,370
So maybe you got sick of disapprove

257
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,760
Yeah.She trying to change you.

258
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,250
She had no power of me.

259
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,360
Mothers always have power.
whether you like it or not.

260
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,280
Listen,Tad.we did some checking.

261
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,150
You inheritted 3 million dollars
when your mom dead.

262
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,150
Much to my dad's dismay

263
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,350
What's that?

264
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,760
All the money he got from the settlement he squandered it.

265
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,360
And now,you are rich,and he isn't.

266
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,750
I gave every cent of that money away.

267
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,840
You gave away 3 million dollars.

268
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,140
I got numbers if you wanna donate.

269
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,330
Oh damn ,you could've kept some

270
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,820
Some money cost more than worth.

271
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,450
Your sister Virginia felt that way?

272
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,800
Is she only other person to inherit from your mom.

273
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,620
My sister¡®s circumstances were different.she has a son.

274
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,640
So she needed your mom's money.

275
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,760
So mom thought.

276
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:26,100
Poor Matt his birthday feast, sandwiches.

277
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,490
Made a roast mom.

278
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,790
Power is out if you have noticed the oven is electric.

279
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,430
I know.It's not your fault.

280
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,010
You trying to make me fell like this.

281
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,180
Don't be so defensive Ginny

282
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,050
I know you give you all when it comes to matt.

283
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,350
Time to darkling recover, Gin

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,040
And that public school you are sending him into is just so public.

285
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,010
Matt's education is none of your business.

286
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,550
It is my business.As long as you cash my checks.

287
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,560
You really gonna go there,are you?

288
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,290
When the unmentionable one left you high and dry, who bail you out?

289
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,400
Told you not to take her money.

290
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,650
Shut up,Tad.

291
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,760
Not everyone enjoy squalor the way you do.

292
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,630
So what did you think,mom.If I don't take Matt out of Public school,

293
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,600
You going to cut me off.

294
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,850
Don't be so melodramatic.

295
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:24,070
You know what? Screw this. Screw you.

296
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,240
What do you think your...?

297
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm gonna get my son get the hell away from you.

298
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,560
Do not walk away from me,Virginia

299
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,620
She is right,Gin run.

300
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,830
Your money is not worth the price that it comes with.

301
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,530
Hey,man.

302
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,630
You say that now.but come into the month,what are you going to do?

303
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,940
you walk out that door

304
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:52,350
you'll never get another penny from me.Ever.

305
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,540
I was never prouder of my sister than at that moment.

306
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,700
But she didn't leave the house that night.

307
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,900
'Cause according to the police report, she was there in the morning.

308
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,780
Yeah, whiteout trapped us all there.So what?

309
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,080
She and your mom have words later?

310
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,520
Where's this going?

311
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,250
Like you said, your sister needed the money.

312
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,750
And your mom conveniently died
before she could change her will.

313
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,570
My sister wouldn't hurt a fly.

314
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,040
Detectives, this is my son, matt, on winter break from med school.

315
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,860
We're here to talk about your grandmother.

316
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,070
Heard from my uncle you think she was murdered.

317
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,700
I find that impossible to believe.

318
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,560
I don'T.

319
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,720
She was a shrew.

320
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
So we heard.You heard wrong.

321
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,970
She was just complicated.

322
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,740
How's that?

323
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,990
Not the double-edged sword,
beauty was her curse bit, mom.

324
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,050
It's true.

325
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,450
When her looks faded,
she had nothing to fall back on.

326
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,610
My mother likes to think the best of people,

327
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,690
but my grandmother was a total bitch, plain and simple.

328
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,270
Excuse me.

329
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,440
You'll have to forgive him.

330
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,790
He only really knew my mom after my father dumped her.

331
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,370
She was different before?

332
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,540
Proud, fearless.

333
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,420
Only one thing scared her, and she hid it from everyone but me.

334
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,010
What?The dark.

335
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,790
Which is why it's so sad she died in a blackout.

336
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,350
All alone in that pool.

337
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,510
She wasn't alone if someone drowned her.

338
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,000
My family was dysfunctional, not homicidal.

339
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,210
Where were you that night, ginny, between 12:00 and 2:00?

340
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,460
I was asleep, in my old bedroom.

341
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,820
We know your mom threatened to cut you off, ginny.

342
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,460
Well, then you must also know that I told her to go to hell.

343
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,330
That I didn't want her money.

344
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,160
Single mom.No visible means of support.

345
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,440
Maybe you circled back.

346
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,640
Made sure you got what was coming to you.

347
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,950
You don't understand.

348
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,250
Money wasn't what divided us.

349
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,310
Jeffries: But something did.

350
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,280
Something worse.

351
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself, gin.

352
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,270
Don't be.

353
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,770
She's right about the end of the month.

354
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,110
I got a little money if you need it.

355
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,770
Another night of laughs in hell house.

356
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,130
Hey, that's my line.

357
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,260
I remember.

358
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,370
You always made me feel like such
a tool for saying it.

359
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,720
You were 13.What did you know?

360
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,690
Matt's 13.Bet he knows more than you think he does.

361
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,620
I thought you made your grand exit.

362
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,680
Snow's too deep.

363
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,600
So where's matt?

364
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,000
I sent him up to bed so he wouldn't be exposed to you.

365
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,350
Isn't there a belfry somewhere
you can hang upside down from?

366
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Now I'm the vampire?

367
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,860
If the cape fits.

368
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,350
Three against one, is that it?

369
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,930
Aren't you forgetting, I'm not the one who destroyed this family.He is.

370
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,520
At least dad doesn't lord his money over his children.

371
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,240
That's because he doesn't have any, dear.

372
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
'Cause you took it all.

373
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,950
Lauren: Half.

374
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,830
You squandered the rest all on your own.

375
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,750
I am so glad we could spend this quality time together.

376
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,230
We're like this because of your father's predilections for prepubescents.

377
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,430
Shut up, lauren, before you make me do something I'll regret.

378
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,490
Regret?

379
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,550
That would imply you had a conscience.

380
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm serious.

381
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,670
No one wants you here.

382
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, I'm not gonna let you turn my children against me.

383
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,980
Not with what i know about you.

384
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,040
- Don't you...
- pervert.

385
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,200
You are a sick twisted pedophile.

386
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,610
That's it!Come on.

387
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,110
Enough!Both of you just shut up!Shut up!

388
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,990
That was the last straw, my mom sinking that low.

389
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,520
What did you do?

390
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,920
I curled up in a ball and I drank myself to sleep.

391
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,490
Any truth to what your mom was saying, ginny?

392
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,500
About my dad?No way.

393
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,180
You sure about that?

394
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,770
My dad never touched me.

395
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,950
What about your brother, tad?

396
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,160
My dad may be a lot of things, but...

397
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,990
maybe that's what tad was trying to tell you when he was 13.

398
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,670
No.Absolutely not.

399
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,310
you lose a game or something?

400
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,410
No.

401
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,430
Then what?Girl trouble?

402
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,110
How'd you know?

403
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm a detective.What'd she do?

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,450
Think she's lying to me.

405
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,170
About what?

406
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,740
Says she's got to go to her grandma's house instead of coming to my game.

407
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,320
How'd she say it?

408
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,150
She twirl her hair or look away when she told you?

409
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,040
Nah, in the eye.

410
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,110
Then she's telling the truth.

411
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,930
For real?

412
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,200
Secrets of the trade.Tells.

413
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,430
When I got a suspect in the box--
the interrogation room--

414
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,730
you got to look for the tells.

415
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:13,330
So if leandra looked away, then she'd be lying?

416
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,130
Nine times out of ten.

417
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,170
You know, you ain't got to be all nice to me

418
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,960
just 'cause you and my mom are...whatever.

419
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
You know about that, huh?

420
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,510
Well, maybe you should become a detective.

421
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,770
Murder cop like you?

422
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,630
Why not?

423
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,510
Yeah.That'd be cool.

424
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,720
Yeah, it would be.

425
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,530
Nice!

426
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,130
Lauren may have been a bitch, stan...

427
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,010
but that's nothing compared to what we heard about you.

428
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,400
Do tell.

429
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Lauren called you a pervert.

430
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,130
A sick, twisted pedophile.

431
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,950
She would say anything to hurt me.

432
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Which is why you had to shut her up.

433
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,970
Once and for all.

434
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,410
That damn woman is still ruining my life.

435
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,640
So you do remember lauren calling you out?

436
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,930
She could never forgive me for cheating on her.

437
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,220
With children?

438
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,290
Maybe even your own.

439
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,260
With younger women.

440
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:42,380
Even if what you're saying is true, stan,
gives you one hell of a motive.

441
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,250
She's smiling from the grave, you know that?

442
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,410
Laughing at me.

443
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,940
She wasn't laughing when you drowned her.

444
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,000
I didn't drown her.

445
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,020
This is exactly what she would have wanted.

446
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,220
What is?

447
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,940
Eating our own.

448
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,290
Turning on each other.

449
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,300
Be specific.

450
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,570
Late that night, lauren trained her sights on

451
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,640
the only one of us she hadn't sunk her fangs into.

452
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,360
You didn't think I'd let you go to bed without opening your present, did you?

453
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,180
This is awesome, grandma.Thank you.

454
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,110
you know, I gave tad a camera on his 13th birthday.

455
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,510
Well, maybe I'll become a photographer like him.

456
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,190
You do, and I'll take that camera away from you right now.

457
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,950
I forgot.You don't like his pictures.

458
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,690
Matt, listen, now that you're a man, there's something I need to talk to you about.

459
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,180
Okay.

460
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,860
Your mother does the best she can.

461
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,390
- I know that.
- Yeah.

462
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,500
But there's a big, wide world out there.

463
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,680
London, paris, madrid.

464
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,360
Europe.That's cool.

465
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,080
And I want to take you.

466
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,530
In fact, I thought maybe you
might come live with me for a while.

467
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,300
Live with you?

468
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,110
What about my mom?

469
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,340
She wants what's best for you, too.

470
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,110
But she's a woman, matt.

471
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,550
She needs a man in her life.

472
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,020
What's that mean?

473
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,810
It's not easy to meet someone with a teenage son around.

474
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:34,550
We'd have loads of fun, I promise you.

475
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,620
What do you say we go for a swim?

476
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,040
Now?My mom said to stay up here.

477
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,060
What your mom doesn't know won't hurt her.

478
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,870
Come on.Get your suit on.

479
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,070
But that was the last time you saw lauren alive.

480
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,750
Heading to the pool with matt?

481
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,630
I'm not saying my grandson
had anything to do with anything.

482
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,650
He was just a boy.

483
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,120
You went swimming with your grandmother the night she was killed.

484
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,040
Never mentioned that.

485
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,050
I don't want to talk about this.

486
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,900
You were the last one to see her alive, matt.

487
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,050
I didn't kill her.

488
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,160
Your grandmother was trying to turn you against your mom.

489
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,030
Like I said, she was a shrew.

490
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,950
But you love your mom.

491
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,870
So you had to stop your grandma from digging her claws in.

492
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,340
That's not all she tried to do.

493
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,310
Tell me, matt.

494
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,180
She tried to destroy me.

495
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,710
I didn't realize you were such a good swimmer.

496
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,870
This was such a great idea, grandma.

497
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,220
Oh, call me lauren.

498
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,660
"Grandma" sounds so formal.

499
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,450
Okay.

500
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,450
Go ahead.Say it.Call me lauren.

501
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,330
Okay, lauren.

502
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,390
Now was that so hard?

503
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,680
You're blushing.

504
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,760
It's just kind of weird.

505
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,690
Under those good looks, you're bashful, aren't you?

506
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,610
No.

507
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,470
Do you have a girlfriend?

508
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,100
Not like a regular one.

509
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,590
Good.

510
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,850
Take it from me, it's best to get some experience with someone you can trust first.

511
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,660
Really?Absolutely.

512
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:16,880
Someone to teach you the ropes...tell you where to touch, where to feel.

513
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,230
Don't you want to know what makes a woman tick?

514
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,210
I guess.I don't know.

515
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,160
Matt...

516
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,810
look at me.Look at me.

517
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,620
Tad: Get out of the water,att.

518
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,920
You heard me.Get going.

519
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,040
Your grandmother was seducing you.

520
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,210
I don't know what she was trying to do to me.

521
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,840
Your uncle rescued you...

522
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,910
leaving tad there alone with his mother.

523
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,710
Your father,he was a pedophile

524
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,180
Don'T...don't do this.

525
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,090
We're not saying she didn't deserve it.

526
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,440
Because, no doubt, you had your reasons for hating her.

527
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,170
For stopping her from doing to matt
what she did to you.

528
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,660
I didn't kill her.

529
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,480
Jury will understand, tad.

530
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,110
Go light, under the circumstances.

531
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,950
And I don't know who did kill her, either.I swear.

532
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,840
We know you were there, in the dark.

533
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,800
The last one to see her alive.

534
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,830
what you don't understand is...

535
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:25,160
I didn't just hate my mother.I loved her, too.

536
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,910
Which is what makes it so twisted, so screwed up.

537
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,210
Lot of gray.

538
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,470
That's why I like black and white.

539
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,780
So what happened, tad, after matt left?

540
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,420
I confronted her...at long last.

541
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,230
Would you be a dear and bring me a towel?

542
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,320
I always thought I was bad.

543
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,620
You know, defective.

544
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,670
But it wasn't my fault.You made me.

545
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,210
Just like you tried to make matt.

546
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,550
Oh, please.Let's not rewrite history here tonight, shall we?

547
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,480
I'm not saying I...that I didn'T.

548
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,160
That it wasn'T...part of it.

549
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,910
I don't need to hear this.

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,500
But what we did,
I never would've imagined possible.

551
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,910
You are jealous...aren't you?

552
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,220
Of your own nephew.

553
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,140
Because you know what I'll give him.

554
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,490
Give him?

555
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,780
Don't you mean give yourself?

556
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,790
The audience you need.

557
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,470
I never heard any complaints from you.

558
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,580
You used me!

559
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,120
We used each other.

560
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,940
You were my mother.

561
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,240
I still am.

562
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,640
How could you do it?

563
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,080
How could you do that to me?

564
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,620
How could he stop wanting me?

565
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,760
I was still beautiful.Wasn't I?

566
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,350
In that picture that you took.

567
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,030
Yes, mom, you were beautiful.

568
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,910
And what about now?

569
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Is it all gone?

570
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,310
You're still beautiful, mom.

571
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,720
Thank you, tad.

572
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,160
But you are selfish.

573
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,290
And you are ugly on the inside.Really ugly.

574
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,550
You can say what you want.

575
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,880
No one will ever compare with me.

576
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,880
Not for you.Not ever.

577
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,160
Good-bye, mother.

578
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,180
It's funny.

579
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,670
I walked away from her,
swearing I'd never see her again.

580
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,460
I didn't think it'd be true, though.

581
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,190
The lights came on?

582
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,010
Yeah.Blackout was over.

583
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,130
But your father found your mom the next morning with the lights off.

584
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,720
Meaning whoever killed lauren entered when the lights were on.

585
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,210
Then turned them off.

586
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,300
Wanted it dark for a reason.

587
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,290
You were the only one who knew your mom's secret, ginny.

588
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,350
About being afraid of the dark.

589
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,650
So?

590
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,040
The blackout was over.

591
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,100
The lights were back on.

592
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,870
I don't follow.

593
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,710
That's why you turned them off.

594
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,870
To scare your mom.

595
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,790
To hurt her, because of what matt told you.

596
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,610
'Cause he did tell you, didn't he?

597
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,920
He never told me anything.

598
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,220
I knew just by looking at him.

599
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,440
'Cause you saw your brother look the same way when he was 13?

600
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,380
I let him down.

601
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,730
Betrayed tad when he needed me most.

602
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,610
But you weren't going to make the same mistake twice.

603
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,830
My mother was the most unhappy woman I've ever known.

604
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,790
The only thing that gave her pleasure was

605
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,170
making other people as miserable as she was.

606
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,200
But you weren't going to let her do that to matt.

607
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,990
I guess it doesn't matter now, does it?

608
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,670
Because I did protect my son from her.

609
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,060
Yes, you did.

610
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,840
And he's okay.

611
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
He's better than okay.

612
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,360
Gonna be a doctor.Save people.

613
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,690
The way I should've saved tad.

614
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,600
Ginny, don't be rude.

615
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,120
Turn the lights back on.

616
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,780
You know I don't like the dark.

617
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah, mom, I know.

618
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,680
Are you still angry about the money?

619
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,460
No.Because you know, I'm all bark and no bite.

620
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,040
If only that were true.

621
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,930
Did your brother come talk to you?

622
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,560
What is it with you and men, mom?

623
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,580
Why are they the only ones that matter?

624
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,730
Don't be absurd.

625
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,450
I worshipped you when I was a little girl.

626
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,800
Wanted to be just like you.

627
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,570
Now I really am going to bed.

628
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,060
You can never see my son again, you understand me?

629
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,420
Poor, plain ginny, always afraid I'm going to steal her men away.

630
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,580
He is not a man.

631
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,450
He is a 13-year-old boy.

632
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,030
Like moths to a flame.

633
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,470
That's the power of beauty.

634
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,480
That's the power you'll never understand.

635
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,970
I feel sorry for you.

636
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,500
Poor, plain ginny feels sorry for me?

637
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,370
You've never loved anyone in your whole life except yourself.

638
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,150
What would you know about love?

639
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,590
More than you'll ever will, mom.

640
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,990
Mom, give me your hand.

641
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,730
Mom!

642
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,800
I don't need your help!

643
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,620
You need somebody's help, mom.

644
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,210
Your power's fading.

645
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,420
You might ask your precious son about that.

646
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:25,180
Oh, god.I told you I hate you.

647
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,490
I hate you.
