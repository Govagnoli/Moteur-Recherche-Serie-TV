00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:27,273
Check, check...
check one, check two, check three...

5
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:43,367
Seems like before I left,
you and Suzanne were this big.

6
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,812
riding your sting rays around.

7
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,375
Now she's getting married.

8
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,761
Me too, soon.

9
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,235
I thought you were jazzed about it.

10
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:51,396
I am.

11
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:53,997
You need a drink? You hungry?

12
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:56,504
- I can get it.
- You sure, Brian?

13
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,021
Ah, ladies and gentlemen.

14
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:02,517
Okay, uh...

15
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:07,557
Let’s uh...

16
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:09,579
let’s just get this over with
so we can eat, huh?

17
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,303
Mr. & Mrs. Terry Lucas!

18
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,114
Oh, thanks a bunch for coming
everyone and uh- Ma, Dad?

19
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:27,251
Thanks for the new mustang!

20
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,566
Everybody, you got five minutes

21
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,651
before we charge you for
your drinks, so get going!

22
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:33,906
Oh, um…

23
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:39,346
me and Terry also wanna say a special
welcome home to Fishtown’s own war hero.

24
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:44,209
My maid of honor’s brother and
a brother to me, Brian McCormick!

25
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,637
I would’ve brought it for tonight
but I didn’t wanna embarrass her...

26
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:59,411
when Suzanne and I were
little girls we wrote all...oh.

27
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,059
Don’t tell me that guy’s your boyfriend?

28
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,161
Fiance, actually.

29
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,929
That guy?

30
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,418
With you?

31
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,127
Now that’s not right.

32
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:14,168
I’m not sure you should
be smoking marihuana.

33
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,006
This is a wedding.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Just trying to get in the spirit.

35
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,970
This is a new look.

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,197
Yeah, yeah. Slept like crap.

37
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,841
Who we calling on here?

38
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,415
Benny Warren Cousins.

39
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,411
We got an arrest warrant for him
from 1969.

40
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,362
What’s the story?

41
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:33,782
Well, a local Fishtown girl was
found strangled in his apartment.

42
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,191
Eleanor McCormick.

43
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,951
What’d they get from
their first time around?

44
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,258
There wasn’t a first time.

45
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:41,161
Warren hightailed it to Canada
the night of the murder.

46
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:42,522
Mounties couldn’t help?

47
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,505
They couldn’t find him.

48
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,804
Think he changed his name up there,
went underground.

49
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:48,667
No one’s heard word one from him
in 36 years.

50
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,157
What brought him back to Philly?

51
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,050
Father’s funeral.

52
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,968
He’s holed up with an old buddy
in this place.

53
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,186
Busy-body neighbor recognized him.
Called it in.

54
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,526
Let’s go.

55
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,709
Philadelphia PD for Warren Cousins.

56
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,769
I’m Warren.

57
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:28,054
Warren Cousins, you’re under arrest for
the 1969 murder of Eleanor McCormick.

58
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,452
Ellie’s dead?

69
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:08,767
Witnesses saw Warren hassling
Ellie at her best friend’s wedding.

70
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,175
He was the singer.

71
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,613
Trying to get a piece?

72
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,587
Only Ellie’s engaged, shuts him down.

73
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,306
A few weeks later she got the life
choked out of her in his place.

74
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,743
Autopsy shows bruises
on her knees and neck.

75
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,603
- Strangled.
- By someone with dirty hands.

76
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:25,342
Unidentified residue across her throat.

77
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,891
Prints come with that?

78
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,183
It’s only partial.
No help.

79
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,756
Let’s have Franny take a look
at the autopsy.

80
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,844
Maybe modern medicine tells us more.

81
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:35,105
Yeah, maybe lab can ID the dirt.

82
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,293
Found a relative of your girl.

83
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,297
Brother Brian still lives
at the old address.

84
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:43,665
You and Will sit down with him.

85
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,403
You don’t believe in shaving anymore?

86
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:50,246
It was a... late night.

87
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,412
Why are you looking so haggard?

88
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:55,991
I should go home and start over again.

89
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,384
There’s no reason.

90
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,941
I haven’t spoken to Ellie in 36 years.

91
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,835
That's sort of the point here, Warren.

92
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,283
I mean I didn’t know she was dead.

93
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:14,311
God!

94
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,738
I wouldn’t kill her.

95
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:18,602
We had a relationship, I loved her!

96
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:22,524
So, true love made you change
your name and disappear for 36 years?

97
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,869
I went to Canada because
I was a draft resister.

98
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:27,716
And all those years you never write
to her. Pick up the phone?

99
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,468
I couldn’t, I was a fugitive!

100
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:30,793
What about down here?

101
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:33,193
No one told you that the cops
were looking for you?

102
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,877
I broke off all contacts with my old life.

103
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,248
The buddy I went to Canada
with came back in the ‘90s.

104
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,223
He called me when
he saw my dad’s obit.

105
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:43,476
And you never asked after Ellie?

106
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,927
Ellie was the one who got away.

107
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:50,492
I still thought about her but I let her go
when she didn’t come north with me.

108
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,140
How we doing?

109
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,045
Oh, Warren says Ellie
was going to Canada, too.

110
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,922
Just like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
Running from the law?

111
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:03,303
That was the plan.
But she never showed up.

112
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,433
Couple of hints in that story, Warren.

113
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,114
Yeah, like her being dead
in your apartment.

114
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,679
She left her suitcase there earlier
that day.

115
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,773
Maybe, she went to get it and
someone killed her.

116
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,715
Uh, there’s no suitcase
in the crime report.

117
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,908
So, how’s the story really go?

118
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,534
A screw-up like you sets
his sight on a pretty girl,

119
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,682
can’t close the deal
so she gets punished?

120
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,713
You got it all wrong.

121
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:30,920
Ellie’s the one who came after me.

122
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,365
When me and Suzanne were seven,

123
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:38,724
we planned our whole life out
and wrote it in a diary.

124
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:42,282
I would have brought it tonight
but I don’t want to embarrass her.

125
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:44,242
See, she wrote pages and pages

126
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:49,031
about how she was moving out to Hollywood
and becoming Mrs. Elvis Presley.

127
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:52,240
Hey, that’s no fair, she did too!

128
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,272
But, I’m so glad she found
her real true love here in Fishtown.

129
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,107
Because the life that I wrote in that diary

130
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,011
was that she was my neighbor,

131
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:05,769
my maid of honor,
the Godmother of my children,

132
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,790
and my best friend for life.

133
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,786
So, here’s to that.

134
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:01,499
I don’t know why I came out here.

135
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,307
I don’t even know you.

136
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,999
Maybe that’s why.

137
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,778
Stupid, right?
Speech?

138
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,640
Nah.

139
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,913
I saw your brother in there.

140
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,441
See his girlfriend ditch him?

141
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,347
Wish I knew what to do for him.

142
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:24,353
How ‘bout just talking to him?

143
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,921
Bet that would mean something.

144
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,448
You going to Vietnam?

145
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:35,968
No, It’s not a cause I’d give my life for.

146
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,005
So you're one of those.

147
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,165
What are you?

148
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:50,105
Not sure, lately.

149
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:56,333
When you said it wasn’t right
about me and my fiance?

150
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,476
What did you mean?

151
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:01,199
Do you know…

152
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,778
It’s impossible not to look at you.

153
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,989
No…

154
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:19,121
No, it is. It’s not just you being pretty.

155
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:22,926
It’s how you are.

156
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:29,981
I … really enjoyed your singing.
Really.

157
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,893
I know you have a guy,

158
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:37,016
but I'm a valentine's day baby.

159
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:41,386
I just say it if I feel it.

160
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,496
We were together 6 weeks after that.

161
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,679
Then I left.

162
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,383
A one conversation at the weeding,

163
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:03,024
and Ellie chucks her marriage plans
to take up with you.

164
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:04,119
Yeah.

165
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,397
I still don’t hear how she ends up
dead in your place.

166
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,467
I don’t know how that happened!

167
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,897
All I know is I loved that girl.

168
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:14,168
And that always ends well.

169
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:21,413
This works out nice.
We got room in the trunk?

170
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,261
Brian McCormick?

171
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,500
You the detectives that called?

172
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,410
It’s about Warren Cousins,
he’s back in town.

173
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:33,570
What does the creep have to say
for himself?

174
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,015
Says it wasn’t him
who killed your sister.

175
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:38,143
You got ideas otherwise, Brian?

176
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:41,188
She’s dead in his apartment
that gives me ideas.

177
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:44,250
Warren says he and
your sister had a relationship.

178
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,281
- He does, huh?
- Anything to that?

179
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:51,090
Well, something had hold of
Ellie those last weeks.

180
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,256
Maybe Warren.

181
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,689
Seemed like something beatnik.

182
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,445
You okay?

183
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,934
Yeah, yeah. I couldn’t sleep last night.

184
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,582
That’s all.

185
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,627
- Oh, hold on. Dad!
- He knew it.

186
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,506
- Pat, Brian needs you!
- It’s okay, Mom.

187
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,575
Hold on, hold on, I’m here.

188
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,442
I got to admit I’m nervous.

189
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,332
What was it like there, Brian?

190
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,940
Muggy.

191
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,386
Mosquitoes there
are like freaking crows.

192
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,775
How about the war part?

193
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:34,896
Ellie!

194
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:38,494
‘Cause they’re saying
we’re losing and not prepared.

195
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,602
Is it true? / Ellie, your brother wants
to brag, he’ll do it to me over beer.

196
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,759
- I just want to hear about it.
- Eleanor...

197
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,715
it's starting.

198
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:51,201
The birthdates of today's
draft lottery are as followed:

199
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:55,157
You never know who to trust over there.

200
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,365
- When they did this,
- June, 27th

201
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,648
it was just a little girl.

202
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:03,319
She comes up to me like she
needs help.

203
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,358
Opens her hand.

204
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,326
May, 20th

205
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,314
- October, 9th
- Oh, man! That’s Terry.

206
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:14,883
February, 14th

207
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,787
November, 6th

208
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,083
March, 12th

209
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,753
Give me your fingers crossed
for me, babe?

210
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,054
Hey, what’s the matter with you?

211
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,729
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey-

212
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:29,397
- My birthday wasn’t called yet.
- I know, I know.

213
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,826
You’re real strange lately, Ellie.
You know that?

214
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,844
What was she crying about?

215
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:48,265
Don’t know.

216
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,870
The guy she's in love with since
she was twelve just got saved.

217
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,879
Made no sense.

218
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:56,276
Okay, Brian.

219
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,489
It’s been most of my life now, but…

220
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,856
never settles with you.

221
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:05,437
Not being somebody’s
older brother anymore.

222
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,164
What got Ellie so upset that night?

223
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,934
Maybe a shock to her what
her brother said about Vietnam.

224
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,024
- Lab did a rush job for you.
- Get anything good?

225
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,950
Swab the residue around
your girl’s neck?

226
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,958
Found minute traces of chrome in it.

227
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,780
Came from the doer’s hands?

228
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,519
Maybe flaked off a car?
Appliance?

229
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,177
Besides the knee and neck bruises?

230
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:34,651
There was an abrasion above
her eye from an earlier injury.

231
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:36,417
Earlier by hours?

232
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,887
More like days.

233
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:40,903
So chrome on the doer’s hands plus,

234
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:42,799
someone roughed her up recently.

235
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,807
What if, it was the draft lottery
Ellie was reacting to?

236
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,548
Fifth birthday called.

237
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:50,787
February 14, Valentine’s Day.

238
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,994
Lover boy, Warren.

239
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,920
She was crying cause he got drafted.

240
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,016
Maybe she did love him.

241
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,105
Just getting in?

242
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,178
I slept at the bar.

243
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,917
Sure you did.

244
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:22,887
What?

245
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:26,221
Because, I’m a detective?

246
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,125
I met someone.

247
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,613
He from the bar?

248
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:34,736
Yeah, but it’s not like
how you think though.

249
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:35,753
Aha.

250
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,119
It’s someone good for a change.

251
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:42,829
We talk and laugh… and connect.

252
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:45,758
Really.

253
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:53,309
He taking you out for
your birthday tomorrow? Cause…

254
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,411
If not, I am.

255
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,660
That would be great.

256
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:03,774
I wouldn’t have guessed it, but um…

257
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:07,965
It’s been good having you here.

258
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,540
Part of your story holds up, Warren.

259
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,017
Maybe Ellie did fall for you.

260
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,258
Okay.

261
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,494
Some parts are still shady.

262
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:42,080
All the stuff was at home and
accounted for, no missing suitcase.

263
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,831
I told you what I know.

264
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:47,308
It was a light blue, white handles.

265
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:51,098
You know anything about her fiance?

266
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,953
Bud Lydecker.

267
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,517
Just saw him at the wedding.

268
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,447
Well, you two got together.

269
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,438
Means, Ellie must have broken up
with him, right? / Yeah.

270
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:02,548
Know anything about how he handled it?

271
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,902
Getting traded in for...

272
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,762
for a long-haired draft dodger.

273
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,896
Probably wasn’t thrilled.

274
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,566
Any specific backlash?

275
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:19,064
I didn’t think so at the time, but…

276
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:21,384
Ellie did come to see me one night…

277
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:23,835
about a week after the wedding?

278
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,330
Hey! / Hi.

279
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:16,221
I did not think you would come.

280
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,610
Hello.

281
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,754
Oh, this is-

282
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:21,280
Oh, yeah! The, the bride!
Congratulations.

283
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,588
Oh, yeah. My husband would flip
his lid to see this place.

284
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,907
I just saw this woman with like,

285
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,796
paint on her, and nothing else.

286
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,585
Can I get you something?
Beer? Dope?

287
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,236
- You guys?
- Oh, no! No.

288
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:43,407
Look, you know what? Maybe I would.
The Beatles do it. So you know.

289
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,068
I’ll have a beer.

290
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,957
- Uh, this powder room?
- Yeah, it’s right over there.

291
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,592
I talked to my brother.

292
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,904
You did?

293
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,616
It was bad for him over there.

294
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:09,522
My parents still don’t want to hear it,

295
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,856
but I think he wants to talk.

296
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,827
Like you said.

297
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,792
I keep thinking about the thing
that you said.

298
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,651
I keep thinking about you.

299
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,674
Yo, yo. That’s twisted, man!

300
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,898
That was him, El.
You know it was.

301
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,099
Who?

302
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,700
No one.

303
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:46,301
You think Bud threw that brick?

304
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,997
Must be who they meant.

305
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:49,518
Yeah.

306
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,334
Okay.

307
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,284
Maybe he’s the one who should
be cooling it in here.

308
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,042
Let me go see at my dad’s arrangements.

309
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,433
You’re still our number one guy, Warren.

310
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,696
Detective.

311
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:06,061
Did you find anything else out…
about Ellie?

312
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:14,375
She cried when you got drafted.

313
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:36,810
Take a look around. Go on.

314
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,388
I’m losing them.

315
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:42,241
Nice timing.

316
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,881
You want another 36 years?

317
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,099
Ah, crap. Go ahead.

318
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,633
You said it was about Ellie?

319
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:51,317
Wondering how you took it when she
threw you over for this Warren guy.

320
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,766
I’m the one threw her over.

321
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,485
I dried up on us after my buddy
Terry’s wedding.

322
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,467
Cut her loose.

323
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,596
So that brick through her new guy’s
window that was you saying

324
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,869
- "We could still be friends?”
- Ah, the brick.

325
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,769
Yeah, I’ll cop to that.

326
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,862
But I didn’t know the hippie lived there.

327
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:10,365
That was meant for ‘Bridezilla.’

328
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:11,392
Suzanne?

329
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:14,017
On account of her behavior
at the wedding.

330
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:18,629
Oh, my God!

331
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:20,097
Oh, my God, oh my God, Ellie!

332
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:21,599
Suzanne, what are you doing?

333
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,785
What are you, an interpreter?
Terry!

334
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,894
Terry!

335
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:30,122
Bud, just, just turn around, okay?
I got to pull myself up here.

336
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:34,244
I undid all those buttons?

337
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,858
Please, just leave, okay?

338
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:43,386
I'll kill you!

339
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,869
- Don't look at me like that.
- Geez, Suzanne!

340
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:51,447
I know, El. I know.

341
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:52,845
Now look at me.

342
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,045
After what you told me,
don't be a hypocrite.

343
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,825
Whoa, what the heck is that about?

344
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,145
Nothing.

345
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:02,855
You, damn itt!
What are you two talking about?

346
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,257
Just forget it, Bud.

347
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,778
Fishtown bitches!

348
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:17,785
So you break up with Ellie,
because her best friend’s a cheater?

349
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,557
Birds of a feather.

350
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:21,631
Ellie’d be following suit soon enough.

351
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,653
Besides, I’m with the same girl
since I’m twelve.

352
00:22:24,653 --> 00:22:26,033
I was done.

353
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:28,994
What Suzanne mean,
Ellie was a hypocrite?

354
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,789
Something related to
their chick conspiracy.

355
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,545
I didn’t press for details.

356
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:35,973
You’ll have to ask ‘zilla’ herself.

357
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:37,637
You got an alibi for when Ellie died?

358
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:39,904
Working late at the sugar factory?

359
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:42,215
My pop waited up to tell me.

360
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:48,430
She’s the first person I knew close…
that died.

361
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,732
Hmm, Ellie.

362
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:03,317
You finally got that singer, huh?

363
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,165
Warren Cousins? Yeah.

364
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:06,784
He’s in custody for Ellie’s murder.

365
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,993
It’s a long time coming.

366
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:13,285
Suzanne, Warren says that he
and Ellie were in love. True?

367
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,393
She was dreamy about him.

368
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,404
No other man could compare.

369
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:21,908
- Not Bud?
- Bud or the rest of the species.

370
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,089
We heard about that brick incident.

371
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,351
Bud said that was on him.

372
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,003
I knew it.

373
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:29,431
But he mentioned a different reason.

374
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:32,410
- Something about your wedding night?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,022
Mistakes were made.

376
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,579
What did you mean that night?

377
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,832
Calling Ellie a hypocrite?

378
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:41,515
Oh, she told me about meeting Warren,

379
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:45,472
and it was suddenly making
her question things.

380
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,193
Oh, like settling with Buddy boy?

381
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,640
And ending up with her mother’s life.

382
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,967
Same thing crossed my mind
walking down the aisle.

383
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:57,208
So at the reception all I’m thinking is,
‘What did I just do?’

384
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,086
Enter the drummer.

385
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:03,733
So was Ellie gonna do something
to change her plans?

386
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,566
Yeah.

387
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,526
Which, my parents never got us
that mustang.

388
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:14,827
He’s been in the driveway
every single day of this month.

389
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:17,234
Doesn't have a word to say to me.

390
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:22,036
Suz, I don’t think it’s like this
with everyone.

391
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:27,802
Well, his birthday got called,
so he’s a little upset.

392
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:30,566
You wanna be like this?

393
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:35,558
Suz, there are men who are different.

394
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,706
You could have a new life with.

395
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:41,845
And they’d let you be who you are.
That's what they want.

396
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,500
And they would never-

397
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,302
they would die first, Suz.
They would never hurt you.

398
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,684
Really?

399
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,449
You wanna leave here?

400
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,549
Go someplace far out and start over,
where Terry can’t find us?

401
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:01,759
Cause Warren’s going to Canada
and we could, too.

402
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:04,028
Ellie!

403
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:06,373
Uh, you got a lot to say today, huh?

404
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,534
Just uh- catching up, Terry.

405
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,773
Oh.

406
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,296
Terry!

407
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:14,991
Don't you yammer about me
when I'm out working!

408
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,758
Do you understand?

409
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:19,051
And don’t bring stupid talk into
my house.

410
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,014
She don’t need anymore wild ideas
than she’s already got.

411
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,324
That’s what you say!

412
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,655
Okay, okay!

413
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,706
That’s the conversation.

414
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,729
Oh, by the way.

415
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:37,101
I know where you go at night, Ellie.

416
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:41,447
Whore.

417
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:51,777
He meant Warren’s place.

418
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:52,739
Yeah.

419
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,869
Where Ellie was killed.

420
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,953
Where was Terry the night she died?

421
00:25:57,953 --> 00:26:01,707
- Out till morning, getting blitzed.
- Hmm…

422
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,851
He wouldn’t have hurt her.

423
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:05,879
We grew up together, all of us!

424
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:09,288
But he was in a bad way then, right?

425
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,507
You said Terry was working
on a mustang?

426
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,596
Yeah, ’65.

427
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:20,787
His true love. Trust me.

428
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:26,875
It’s a chrome bumper.

429
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,978
What kind of person makes a kid
run those at 8:00 in the morning?

430
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:40,596
You coming down on me for that?

431
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,698
No, we’re homicide,
It's a little more serious.

432
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:45,931
Sit-ups until the whistle.

433
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:50,329
You remember Ellie McCormick?

434
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,007
Yeah, sure. Great girl.

435
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:55,725
We hear she tried to get your wife to
pull a ‘Thelma & Louise’ on you.

436
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:58,900
Run off together…leave you all alone.

437
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,983
You’d be short a punch bag
thanks to Ellie.

438
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:02,581
Girls were always talking.

439
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,896
It was just talk.

440
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,836
But you took them seriously.

441
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,214
What you call her again?

442
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:09,431
It was something unflattering, I think.

443
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:12,107
Plus there was chrome on her body.

444
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,793
Like on your mustang.

445
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,662
From your hands to her neck.

446
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:18,534
And you knew where
she went at night, right?

447
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,651
Oh, heck! Okay.

448
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:23,306
Straight story.

449
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:25,441
I went over there, once.

450
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:27,104
To give Ellie what for?

451
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,035
No!

452
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:29,655
I heard the girl scheming.

453
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:32,144
I thought maybe I could change my plans.

454
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:36,218
Cause all I had to look forward to
was going to die in a jungle.

455
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,902
Ellie!

456
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,108
What are you doing here?

457
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,662
I know what you’re thinking of me
right now.

458
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:48,551
But I’m just not in my right way.

459
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,618
I’m flipped out.

460
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,522
You know I’m going to Vietnam, right?

461
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,876
I know your birthday got called.

462
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,759
And I saw your brother at the wedding.

463
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:03,023
Katie looking around during the dance songs,
embarrassed to be with him?

464
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:05,583
That can’t be me.

465
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,061
You’re nothing like him, Terry.

466
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,230
I gotta go.

467
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,407
Ellie, wait!

468
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,800
I know Suzanne doesn’t love me.

469
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,144
So maybe…

470
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:19,493
maybe I should just beat it to Canada
where you and that guy are going.

471
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:20,595
Can I talk to him?

472
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,120
No! You can’t come in.

473
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,694
I’m scared.

474
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,658
Like your boyfriend?

475
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,192
He’s not scared.

476
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,842
He has beliefs.

477
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,889
Find your own way to Canada.

478
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:40,553
So, you wanted to duck the draft, too.

479
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,596
Didn’t have the nerve though.

480
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,932
Got lucky.

481
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,733
Ended up watching the border in Korea.

482
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,515
How’d you know where to find Ellie?

483
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:49,939
From Bud.

484
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:52,174
Bud was still keeping tabs
after they were over?

485
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:54,947
He was only camped out
there night after night.

486
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:57,186
Thought he gave Ellie the brush-off?

487
00:28:57,186 --> 00:29:00,347
Hey, it’s not for me to say.

488
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:04,407
But if that’s how it went,
why's he stalking her?

489
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,853
- I already talked to the other two.
- Yeah, I know.

490
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:10,434
- So what am I doing here?
- I guess we didn't get the truth just yet

491
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:11,986
about how you and Ellie ended.

492
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:14,214
Well, you can go pound sand
if you don’t believe me!

493
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:19,397
Maybe, you just misrepresented
how that final talk went?

494
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:22,946
You ever had a fiance?

495
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,468
And yes, she screwed
my head up good.

496
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,105
Well, that’s what Ellie did to me.

497
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,598
So maybe over time,

498
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,776
I wanna remember a little different,
you know?

499
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,443
- Pride thing?
- Now you put in the time.

500
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,593
You’re the long-term guy.

501
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,169
Some new act waltzes in,
she goes nutty.

502
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:44,027
Sure.

503
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:45,990
You can’t talk to him about it.

504
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,229
What, a rational conversation with a woman?

505
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:49,853
I never had one.

506
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,887
Well, you tried and two seconds later

507
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:54,548
they got you frothing at the mouth, right?

508
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:58,339
Pretty soon,
you got to mess on your hands.

509
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,268
And how’d it went, Bud?

510
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,480
You can’t have her,
no one can?

511
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:08,213
Hey. I took it harder than
I said but come on!

512
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,351
I didn’t kill her!

513
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,720
You staked her place out.

514
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,155
I watched for her one night.

515
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,956
Few nights! / I heard a week.

516
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,671
So a week!

517
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:21,819
Believe me, I wasn’t the messed-up one.

518
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,278
I went to the door finally,

519
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,836
walked into World War III.

520
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:42,072
Ellie? Ellie!

521
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,001
Damn it! let me in there.

522
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:46,561
Where is he?
Show me where he is!

523
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,551
Bud, keep it down!

524
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:51,097
He’s bad news Ellie, I’m telling you!
Look at you!

525
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,166
You answer me one question, okay?

526
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,845
Are you serious?

527
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:02,965
about giving up 19 years in Fishtown,

528
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:05,248
then, run off with this hippie guy,

529
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:06,766
who you’ve known for six weeks?

530
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,797
- You don’t understand Bud.
- Who do this to you?

531
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,304
Don’t you, don’t you remember?

532
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:20,898
that time we went down to Atlantic city,

533
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,933
just the four of us,
for beers and surf and turf?

534
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:24,936
Remember?

535
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:29,136
And, and I went into the water and you,

536
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:33,245
you came in and pull me out?
Remember that?

537
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:34,452
I do Bud. / Yeah?

538
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:37,043
Yeah. / So?

539
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:40,890
So I’m in love with Warren.

540
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,606
Sorry.

541
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:49,185
Yeah…well, that's screwy.

542
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:55,779
Adios.

543
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:11,541
Maybe me and Ellie weren’t perfect
but I never laid a hand.

544
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,862
But Warren did?

545
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:15,522
He acts like this peace-lovin’ guy.

546
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:18,050
Not behind closed doors.

547
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,473
So, ever hear from that New York guy?

548
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:27,716
He doesn’t know where I am.

549
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,754
Which is a good thing.

550
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:31,266
And badly?

551
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:34,256
He got overly invested. / Hmm…

552
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:39,964
Like um…Joe Dennison?
And Danny Ross.

553
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:42,414
- Steve Regis?
- I was never with Steve-

554
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:43,397
Liar! / I wasn’t!

555
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:46,270
Hey, I wouldn’t admit to it, either.

556
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:49,972
There’s someone good now.

557
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:52,260
Yeah, yeah. What about that?

558
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:57,078
Well, actually he’s a cop.

559
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,346
Do I know him?

560
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:02,351
Yeah.

561
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:10,505
Not Valens.

562
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:18,270
I can’t believe you’re doing this again.

563
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,626
Again?

564
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,525
- I should've guessed.
- Valens isn’t like Patrick at all.

565
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:24,040
Don’t talk about him.

566
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,749
I would never do that. Lil.
'cause of how it hurt you.

567
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:32,656
Don’t you know by now you ruin
everything you touch?

568
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,317
I don’t ruin things.

569
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:43,289
Happy birthday.

570
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,190
Lil…

571
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:52,595
I’m leaving for work at seven, you can
come by after that and pick up your stuff.

572
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:08,814
- Something wrong?
- Nope.

573
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,422
Let’s do this.

574
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,573
I’m back in the cell in two hours,
can’t this wait?

575
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:18,456
No, it can’t, Warren. / I’m starting
to believe you did love Ellie.

576
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,144
I’ve only been saying that from the start.

577
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:21,804
Well, it’s always the guys
who love too hard

578
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,084
that end up smacking their girls around.

579
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:25,732
I never touched her.

580
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:27,543
There was a witness outside
your apartment.

581
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,909
Heard screaming, violence.

582
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,134
It wasn’t me. / Oh!

583
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:34,256
Ellie got her face bloody all by herself?

584
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:36,974
I promised to her that I’d never tell.

585
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:41,897
But I guess I’ve been keeping promises
to a ghost for a long time now.

586
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,489
So?

587
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:46,443
It was Brian.

588
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:48,171
Yelling in my apartment.

589
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,149
- He the one hurt her?
- He was detoxing.

590
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:51,717
Not in his right mind.

591
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,062
Heroine.

592
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:54,717
A lot of guys came back with the habit.

593
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,842
I knew the signs as soon as
I saw Brian at the wedding.

594
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:01,227
It was…ugly, you know?

595
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,442
He got so pissed off one night
he threw a plate at Ellie.

596
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:05,957
Cut her face.

597
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:08,199
Why d’you get involved in it?

598
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,257
Ellie wouldn’t leave with me with Brian sick.

599
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:15,869
Plan was, after he got clean, Ellie
and I would go north.

600
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,674
Take it easy.

601
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:25,860
You take care of Brian at home, okay?

602
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,489
So…eleven tonight?

603
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:33,884
Warren…

604
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,452
You okay?

605
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:38,342
I don’t know if I can do this.

606
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,785
El…we’re all packed.

607
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,040
Your stuffs up there ready to go.

608
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,874
I don’t think I can leave my brother.

609
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,492
He’s in the clear now.

610
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,023
What if he relapses?

611
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:51,685
No one else here knows.
We’d be all alone.

612
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,883
What about our plan?

613
00:35:56,994 --> 00:35:59,399
Look at him, Warren…

614
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,267
Do you still love me?

615
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,714
I love you so much.

616
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,018
Then come with me.

617
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:16,122
You know you’re the first person to ever
tell me I could be bigger than this place.

618
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,614
It’s true.

619
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:20,477
Thank you for that.

620
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,233
Baby, don’t talk like you’re not coming.

621
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,933
I just need time.

622
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,138
They’re picking us up
at eleven at the bus station.

623
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:32,625
Ellie, I know what I’m asking you.

624
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,451
But it’s cause I love you.

625
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:38,393
And if you come with me…

626
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:40,810
I’ll love you my whole life.

627
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,371
I know.

628
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:49,271
And if you don’t come,
I won’t make it hard for you.

629
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:51,766
I’ll let you go.

630
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:58,139
I’ll see you tonight.

631
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,659
I made them wait until midnight.

632
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:21,810
Then I waited for a long time after that.

633
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,186
Thinking she was gonna knock
on my door one day.

634
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,395
She made a choice.

635
00:37:29,395 --> 00:37:32,773
Well, Brian didn’t say anything about this.

636
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:34,833
Not a great look-back.

637
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,522
Probably the worst time of his life.

638
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,456
I was just about to go to sleep.

639
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,671
Graveyard shift?

640
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,293
It’s a good schedule for me.

641
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:56,808
I could never lay down at night.

642
00:37:58,184 --> 00:37:59,465
Did you wake up?

643
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:01,329
- The night Ellie left.
- Left where?

644
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,203
The night she packed her suitcase.

645
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:06,332
Left to go to Canada. Did you wake up
and find her room empty?

646
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,969
She wouldn’t go anywhere with that guy.

647
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:12,387
Brian, we know you came back
from the war with a drug problem.

648
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,009
A lot of guys struggle with that.

649
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,901
Well, that stuff holds on tight, right?
Can’t just give it up easy.

650
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,560
So maybe you slipped up.

651
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,544
The night Ellie decides to leave.

652
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:24,221
You went to Warren’s to talk her out of it,
only you’re in such a haze…

653
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,629
you do something you regret.

654
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:28,479
Something you’re just sitting on
for all these years.

655
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:30,760
No, I wouldn’t do that.
I got clean.

656
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,748
There was chrome on her neck, Brian.

657
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:34,833
From your chair. / No!

658
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,170
You got that junk in your veins and

659
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,018
now your baby sister goes behind
your back and sneaks off.

660
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,178
You got nobody,
you’re down so low, you break.

661
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:45,154
I was clean!

662
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,249
When I did it.

663
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:58,871
Ah, God.

664
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:03,463
For the first time in so long…

665
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:08,744
I was clear.
I could see right to tomorrow.

666
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:11,930
And all the way down the line.

667
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,218
Brian.

668
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:28,422
How did you get up and go?

669
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,330
Ellie, you really gonna leave me?

670
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,731
Sorry I didn’t say goodbye.

671
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,821
Hurts too much.

672
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,300
So don’t.

673
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,810
I love him, Brian.

674
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,635
I want to start a life with him up there.

675
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:43,938
While I’m down here, alone in the house?

676
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:48,276
Not alone.
Mom and Dad are there, Kate…

677
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:50,941
No…

678
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:52,453
What?

679
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,123
She’s gone.

680
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,260
El, there’s not gonna be anyone for me.

681
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,665
Sure there is. / No, I-,

682
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:09,466
I don’t work how men do.

683
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:15,441
Brian.
That’s not what a man is.

684
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:18,878
It’s about who you are on the inside.

685
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:22,547
How you treat people,
how you love them.

686
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:28,039
Oh, but that’s where it’s all rotten….

687
00:40:28,311 --> 00:40:29,705
No.

688
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:33,023
El, the little girl who did this?

689
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:36,989
She recognized me.
that's why?

690
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:41,324
Because we went into her hut and
we dragged out her parents and her grand parents

691
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:45,335
and we threw them in a bunker
and tossed in a grenade.

692
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,521
She finds me later.

693
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:51,200
So starving...

694
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,736
She’s probably 40 pounds, wet.

695
00:40:54,551 --> 00:41:00,787
And all I was thinking was
‘I should have killed her, too’.

696
00:41:02,457 --> 00:41:07,397
El, you are the only one
I can tell these things to.

697
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:12,452
You’re not rotten.

698
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:15,076
You don’t know!

699
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,644
Okay?

700
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:22,902
Because you get to leave
and forget and I am stuck here!

701
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:25,411
For the rest of my life!

702
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:27,548
What about me?

703
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,319
Brian, it’s all right.

704
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,041
No, I’m stuck!

705
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:40,921
Just, just let me, let me...

706
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:42,677
I’m stuck!

707
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:46,020
