1
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,030
Hawk,will you play"summertime blues"for us tonight?

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,270
I think I can fit that in.

3
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,690
you know,I listen to you in bed before I go to sleep.

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,460
Your voice feels so close.Like you're in bed with me.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,260
What's your name,darlin'?

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,590
Gloria.

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,440
I hope you have sweet dreams tonight,gloria.

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,100
mic's starting to pick that up, bones.

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,340
Yeah,I called maintenance 50 times.

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,810
Sorry,about that, hawk. I'm on it.

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,460
All right. You got something for me?

12
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,240
Check out the latest roy hamilton single.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,880
Sounds like it's in 3-D.

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,470
Yeah,heard about that. New thing called stereo.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,300
You gonna play it,hawk?

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,600
Only if I like it.

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,580
Aw,it's smokin',hawk. 

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,700
Someday,I'm gonna buy a gibson guitar just like the one on that song.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,310
Hold on,elvis. Let's get to work.

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,890
Hey,hey,philly.It's your cool rockin' daddy the hawk,

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,510
comin' at you live on wixa.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,900
Can you hear the sound,philly? I heard it last night at the locust club.

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,250
It was doing funny things to the people.

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,470
It made their bodies sweat, made their hips shake.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
I want you to turn it up, philly!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,610
I want you to turn up that rock and roll music!

27
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,970
You're dialed into the hawk and this is gene vincent with "say mama!"

28
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,540
Let's slow it down for a sec for a little ballad called "scarlet rose."

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,690
a filmmaker doing a documentary on '50s rock dj john hawkins.

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh,the hawk?

31
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,760
My mom used to go to his sock hops.

32
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,400
Said he was pretty wild.

33
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,660
Late '50s were a crazy time to be a kid.

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,480
You a rocker,boss?

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,690
I had a radio.

36
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,030
Detective rush, this is tom bergin.

37
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,310
Tom's been looking at a tape recording that began seconds after hawkins died.

38
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,500
Didn't hawkins...

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,720
yeah,comb his hair with a .38 live on the air?

40
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,370
So they thought. Apparently,as hawkins slumped over,

41
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,720
his hand hit a control that started an in-studio tape recorder.

42
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,930
He taped his shows?

43
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,990
Yeah,for reruns.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,710
And no one's heard this before?

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,400
Years ago,but no one's heard what I've heard.

46
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,050
No one had this equipment.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
This thing ready yet?

48
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,420
One sec.First I had the tape transferred on m-audio,

49
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,960
and then I flipped it to logic pro 

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,800
because it totally leverages the new mac pci-dsp card.

51
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,250
Hey,guy.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,990
No one understands a word you're saying.

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,740
Right,right. Here we go.

54
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,820
this is right after the gunshot.I'm gonna lower the sound of the record.

55
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,850
All you'll hear is the ambience in the dj booth.

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,330
footsteps?

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,920
Hawkins wasn't in there alone.

58
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,770
could be a door, someone leaving.

59
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,850
Then it's quiet for 30 minutes until the janitor rain.

60
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,960
So either hawkins woke from the dead and walked out of there...

61
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,180
or his murderer did.

65
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,300
hawkins got top billing over the musicians?

66
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,880
Radio djs were as big as the rock stars.

67
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,010
Alan freed in new york, wolfman jack in L.A.

68
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,490
And the hawk here in philly.

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,740
Can't even name a dj on the air now.

70
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,980
Back then they were the tastemakers,scotty.

71
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,630
They picked the songs, made or broke careers.

72
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,260
Hawk could've been the target of some wannabe rock star.

73
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,910
Or some record company suit. That was the time of payola.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,680
Dj's taking bribes from record companies to play songs.

75
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,550
Far as we know,hawk never took any payouts.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,580
Real fan of the music.Wasn't afraid to play black artists to white teens.

77
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,680
You a fan?

78
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,210
Nah. I like country music.

79
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,650
Country?

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,380
Yeah,I dj'd in college.

81
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,940
This is will jeffries coming at you live.

82
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,310
Here's hank williams with "my son calls another man daddy."

83
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,720
just when you think you know someone.

84
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,870
the '58 theory was suicide. Looked self-inflicted.

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,050
They didn't have our forensics back then.

86
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,990
Divorced at 24. Ex-wife inherited his money.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,700
Good motive,except that he was broke.

88
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,320
Maybe she found out after the fact.

89
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,630
Even if she's not the doer,first wives know all the dirt.

90
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,460
Excuse me.

91
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,770
Hey,ally, everything okay?

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
I don't know. It's your brother.

93
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
He stopped going to work.

94
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,680
What?

95
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,610
Mike's been in bed for three days straight.

96
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,950
So he's sick?

97
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,990
Not according to the doctor.

98
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,940
He hasn't been the same since that day you came over.

99
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,470
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,660
What'd you say to him,scotty?

101
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,130
Nothing.We were just talking.

102
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm scared,okay?

103
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,170
he sleeps all day.At night,he wanders around the house like a ghost.

104
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,160
Okay,listen... I'll stop by today.

105
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,200
Okay.

106
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,930
Mike will be fine.

107
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,500
We married young. He was a free spirit.

108
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,890
I wanted kids,a simple,quiet life,and he wanted...

109
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,560
to rock and roll?

110
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,360
my father was a musician.

111
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,550
I knew firsthand how tough a show business life could be.

112
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,190
Did you stay in touch with your ex-husband much?

113
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,830
Oh,goodness,no.

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,530
I remarried,started a family.I didn't want the likes of john around.

115
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,960
Where were you the night he was shot,dottie?

116
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,060
Oh,really,now. I was at home with my family.

117
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,080
When did you last see john?

118
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,090
a month before he died.

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,160
13 years since I'd last seen him.

120
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,510
I was selling our house.

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,660
He agree to that?

122
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,130
It was bought with my money,but back then

123
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,710
a woman could only get a loan if a man cosigned.

124
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,750
Different times.

125
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,710
How was john when you saw him?

126
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,420
Same as always.In the middle of a mess.

127
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,170
asthat's right,kids,zip toothpaste!

128
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,880
Keep your smile hip.

129
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,150
brush with zip.

130
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,750
How you been,dot?

131
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,880
Good.

132
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,750
- When you called,I thought... 
- just sign the bottom,john.

133
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,060
How's the family?

134
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,390
Everyone's fine.

135
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,350
You know,I heard a record by your dad the other day.

136
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,470
he sound like a drunken fool?

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,210
No,sounded like a great bass player.

138
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,020
You promised to play the song i wrote,hawk! What the hell happened?

139
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,810
You been drinking?

140
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,440
I had a bunch of friends and this girl sally from the roller rink.

141
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,000
They were all at the drive-in tuned into the show,waiting to hear my song.

142
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,030
"Belly button rock"?

143
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,610
Yeah,that's it. What happened?

144
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,980
I listened to it.

145
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,750
And?

146
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
It's not so hot,bones.

147
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,360
You saying I got no talent?

148
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,480
No. I'm saying I only play what I like.

149
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,010
Baloney sandwich,hawk.

150
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,480
You play whatever the record company pays you to play.

151
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,880
You know that is not true.

152
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,610
How 'bout i get my dad to buy you one of them new skylarks,huh?

153
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You play my song then?

154
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm not for sale. I never was. I never will be.

155
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,310
I'm sorry you had to see this,donna.

156
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,340
But I told sally I'd be on the radio.

157
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,370
I'd do anything for you,bones,anything to help you,

158
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,530
but you know how I am about the music,right?

159
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,390
All right,then. Go on,now.

160
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,050
Sally will still dig you.Rock 'n' roll star or not.

161
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,280
Better lock up that gun of yours,hawk.

162
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:53,920
Excuse me?

163
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,420
You never know who could get to it.

164
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,940
Is that a threat,buddy?

165
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,610
You can't keep stomping on people's dreams all the time and get away with it.

166
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,890
Whose gun was that?

167
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,930
John'S. Always kept it at work.

168
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,510
So many crazies out there.

169
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,650
Sounds like bones was one of them.

170
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,910
Heard you had a meltdown with your boss,the hawk.

171
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,450
I had dreams.

172
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,810
Thought hawk didn't appreciate the next elvis.

173
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,040
Well,maybe you found his gun,

174
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,510
made him appreciate you.

175
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,710
came back the next day,hat in hand,and hawk forgave me.

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,780
You were at the station the night he was killed. 

177
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,840
I was,uh,djing a party that night,so I left.

178
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,920
Plenty of witnesses.

179
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,500
Well,the truth is,his career advice saved me from years of futility.

180
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,130
Your songs were that bad?

181
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,610
terrible.

182
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,260
But I could still recognize talent in others.

183
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,650
Built a career on that.

184
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,280
Congratulations.

185
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,050
Yeah. I learned what music really was from the hawk.

186
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,840
one in a million,that guy.

187
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,990
Think of anyone who'd want to hurt him?

188
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,100
Well... lot of people didn't care for him,sure,

189
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,940
but one guy had more than a garden-variety beef with him.

190
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,880
Grab your partner grab your gal and rock...

191
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,520
you feel that beat?

192
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,830
Now when this song kicks in,

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,980
I want you kids to shake it.

194
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,830
can you shake it?

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,550
I don't think you heard me.I said,can you shake it?!

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Well,all right! Let's go!

197
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,570
hey,hawkins?

198
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,940
Your mama colored?

199
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,010
Come again?

200
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,870
I figure she must be,you like playing this jumpity-squawk so much.

201
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,750
It's rock and roll.

202
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
Why don't you take the stick out of your tail and enjoy the beat?

203
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,910
Carli chester?

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
You recall that name?

205
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,110
No. Should I?

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,170
She's one of the girls you got out there dancing like a whore.

207
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,630
Take a look,mister.Those kids are alive,cause they can feel the music.

208
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Carli is 16 years old.

209
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,090
She's my little girl,and she's in trouble.

210
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,750
Trouble?

211
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,240
Month ago she went to one of your sock hops.

212
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,740
Says she met you at a party afterwards.

213
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,380
I meet a lot of fans.

214
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,540
You did more than meet my daughter.

215
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,090
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

216
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,460
You're calling my little girl a liar,sir?

217
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,000
No,but I'm not the father.

218
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,990
You either take responsibility,

219
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,900
or I'm gonna fit you for a pine-jacket.

220
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,670
Understand me,buster?

221
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,060
turn it up,bones. 

222
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,480
You got it,hawk!

223
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,810
teeny-boppers always did love the hawk.

224
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,070
Sounds like he did some lovin' back.

225
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,650
Kind that gets you arrested.

226
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,360
Or shot in the head with a .38.

227
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,850
You recall a rock dj known as the hawk,lloyd?

228
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,830
Never did care for that kind of music.

229
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,770
He got your daughter pregnant back in '58.

230
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,860
I was wrong about that.

231
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,750
How so?

232
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,180
My daughter lied.

233
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,400
It was her moron boyfriend who's now my moron son-in-law.

234
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,470
Thought hawkins killed himself.

235
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,800
He was murdered.

236
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,580
Not surprised to hear it.

237
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,920
That right?

238
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,730
I saw him in a neighborhood diner time to time.

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,040
Two ships passing in the night.

240
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
You want to elaborate?

241
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,940
A few months before he died,

242
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,280
I took my family to breakfast before sunday services.

243
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,060
He was there.

244
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,770
Coming off of a late night?

245
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,390
And getting into trouble with a young girl again.

246
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,080
You know what they say about a racetrack?

247
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,650
It's a place where windows clean people.

248
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
That right?

249
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,660
You look familiar. Have we met?

250
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,010
On the radio.

251
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,170
I'm your #1 fan. You can call me jenny.

252
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,440
Jenny. It's a nice name.

253
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,710
People said you come here a lot.I hope I'm not bothering you.

254
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,070
Not at all,kid.

255
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,010
Will you play "my kind of dream" for me tonight?

256
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,270
Sure.

257
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,110
what's your kind of dream,jenny?

258
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,520
Gettin' out of this town.

259
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,250
Goin' where?

260
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,210
Anywhere.

261
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,160
It's a nice place-  anywhere.I've been there myself many times.

262
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,480
It's got to be better than secretarial school.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,310
That so bad?

264
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,390
It's a train ride to squaresville.

265
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,920
see,I wt to be a singer.

266
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,620
Get in line. That's a hard dream.

267
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,420
But it's mine.People in line aren't my problem.

268
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,010
You sure are feisty,jenny.

269
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,220
Born that way.

270
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
what the hell you doing with gramps?

271
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,950
None of your business,skiz.

272
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,780
We're going now.

273
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,660
Get off of me!

274
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,940
Why don't you take a walk? Cool off.

275
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,800
Why don't you keep your nose out of it,old man,before I break it for you?

276
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,150
Kid,you rode in here on a bicycle.

277
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm quaking in my boots.

278
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm staying,skiz,so scat.

279
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,870
Woot de do.

280
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,820
This skiz clown-- know his real name?

281
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,340
Scott sienkovic.

282
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,180
I remember because he made the front page of the papers a few months later.

283
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,890
Boy scout of the year?

284
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,490
Armed robbery.

285
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,510
Shot a bank teller.

286
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,410
Had it out for hawkins big time,skiz.

287
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,400
And we know you're not shy with a firearm.

288
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,280
Grown man going after a girl half his age.

289
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,130
Guy deserved to get shot.

290
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,690
You want to tell us where you were the night he died?

291
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,970
Bowling at the thunderbird lanes.Me and 100 other kids heard that needle skip.

292
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,900
we'll check that out,skiz.

293
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,410
Woot de do.

294
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,630
This jenny-- she your girlfriend long?

295
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,280
Couple of months,before she got all obsessed with hawkins.

296
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,250
How obsessed?

297
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,060
She kept calling the radio,

298
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,200
writing him letters,

299
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,770
talking about him nonstop.

300
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,430
You know,real psycho stuff.

301
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
You think they had an affair?

302
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,180
Must have.

303
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,790
Why else would she give two pennies about that loser?

304
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,730
Sounds like it was a one-way street.

305
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,510
She got crazier and crazier over it.

306
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,870
One night we were in front of a real rock star,

307
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,900
and as usual,all she cared about was the hawk.

308
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,120
All right! Now here's the one you've been waiting for--

309
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,150
little richard!

310
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,370
skiz,you got to help me get to the hawk.

311
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,500
Stop acting nutso,jenny.

312
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,160
I got to see him. You don't understand!

313
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,330
He's an old coot. Why do you care?

314
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,330
Don't talk about him like that!

315
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,770
You're on your own,dollface.

316
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,130
do this,we'll go park later.

317
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,530
Promise?

318
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,440
You helping me get to him or not?

319
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,820
Woot de do.

320
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,620
We got to talk to the hawk.

321
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,870
Yeah,and I got a date with jayne mansfield.

322
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,670
You think you're funny?

323
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,480
Hawk!

324
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,750
hey! Why'd you stop taking my calls?

325
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,730
I've been busy,jenny.

326
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,340
You shouldn't even be back here,all right? 

327
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,830
I just...I just want to talk.

328
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,760
About what?

329
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,690
Us.

330
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,750
Us?

331
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,400
Jenny,there is no us.

332
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,680
I made it for you.

333
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,910
play it. You'll understand everything.

334
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,050
I'll never forget you.

335
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,670
"Scarlet rose."

336
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,090
Same song hawk was playing on the radio when he was killed.

337
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,600
Know where we can find this jenny?

338
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,820
Ran into her after I got out of jail.

339
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,840
All married.Mrs. Jenny monahan.

340
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,350
Pretended like she didn't know me.

341
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,280
That's a surprise.

342
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,680
Can I get out of here?

343
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,950
Yeah.

344
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,310
Sounds like we got a groupie gone wild.

345
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,840
At 17,you think your first love's your last.

346
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,610
Yeah. Every fan knew where the hawk broadcast.

347
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,410
I wonder if jenny found her way there.

348
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,220
And found the hawk's gun.

349
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,890
what's going on,mike?

350
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,530
What do you mean?

351
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,930
This.

352
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,090
It's got to be be some kind of virus.

353
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,670
Think I can afford to miss work?

354
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,250
The doc says you're okay physically.

355
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,720
Oh,he's just pissed I'm late with his bills.

356
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,790
da called me again.

357
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah,this coach fitzpatrick thing. 

358
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,520
The case is... falling apart.

359
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,330
The only guy who agreed to testify is getting scared.

360
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,250
He might go south on the stand.

361
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,390
Judge could toss it.

362
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,270
- You sure you don't remember anything?  
- No way.

363
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,900
I ask because...

364
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,210
there was this one night you came home from practice.

365
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,170
Oh,god,scotty,that was a long time ago.

366
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,550
Yeah,but I remember,'cause... you were pretty messed up.

367
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
You slept in your clothes. 

368
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,680
you okay,mike?

369
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm fine.

370
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,120
Go to sleep.

371
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,620
Something happen at practice?

372
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,050
No.

373
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,050
Hey,why are you being so quiet?

374
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,130
Just don't go there no more,okay?

375
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,100
Don't go near the coach.

376
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,550
Why?

377
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,960
You want to play guess?

378
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,860
Come on.

379
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,550
Guess this song.

380
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,110
you got it?

381
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,610
Scotty,I'm too tired,okay?

382
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
Okay.

383
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,510
We'll play tomorrow night.

384
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,190
All right. Night,mikey.

385
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,790
Night.

386
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,190
I don't remember that night.

387
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,010
Well,what about that song?

388
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
No.

389
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,090
You're sure?

390
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm tired,scotty.

391
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,340
That was the only time I ever saw you get so... bummed out.

392
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,270
I mean,you were crying...

393
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,350
if I was bawling,it was probably because that weasel jay shortz cheap-shotted me.

394
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,940
Yeah. Probably.

395
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,860
We'll talk later,all right? I'm just beat.

396
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,680
Okay.

397
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,140
you don't get better soon,I'm going to pound you.

398
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh,yeah,that'll be the day.

399
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,460
How about a little music?

400
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,700
May I?

401
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,730
interesting lyrics you wrote for the hawk.

402
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,190
How'd you get that record?

403
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,520
Bones kept all of hawk's stuff,

404
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,980
including the song he was playing when you killed him.

405
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,630
Me? Oh,you're joking,right?

406
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,340
Back then it was called a teenage crush.

407
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,930
Now we call it stalking.

408
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,330
I was a lonely,confused kid, not a murderer.

409
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,240
Can't just take your word for it,jenny.

410
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,740
I was at home that night with my sisters.

411
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,560
Believe me,hawk had bigger problems than a lovesick teenybopper.

412
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,230
What kind of problems we talking?

413
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,370
One night... I snuck into the station to see him.

414
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,920
I got an idea of what he was up against.

415
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,710
Meaning what?

416
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,650
The record companies.

417
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,900
They were always trying to make him take payola.

418
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,870
Hawk doesn't sound like the kind of dj that would take money to play a song.

419
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,260
Well,that didn't stop them from trying.

420
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,150
Thanks,ben.

421
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,740
Didn't know you were buying dinner tonight.

422
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,820
I sent you a record last week,expected it on the air by now.

423
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm not for sale.

424
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,270
Everyone's for sale.

425
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,110
Funny,I heard you play one of my groups today.

426
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,180
Hey,I got nothing against your label.

427
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,340
Was it that new warner mack tune? That's pretty hot.

428
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,430
No,the darts,"square town."

429
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,330
Oh,bones picked that one.

430
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,180
I give him a pick each day.

431
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,630
And he chose mine.

432
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,000
are you saying that bones took money to play a song?

433
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,310
Bones understands the game.

434
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,770
Djs like you are dinosaurs.

435
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,050
That right?

436
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,740
We've got the money,the artists,the control.

437
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,960
Radio is just my personal handshake to the buying public.

438
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,590
And if the buying public doesn't want it?

439
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,220
One choice of entree you eat, what's on the plate. 

440
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,280
You know what?People like you take everything that is real and good

441
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,930
and you turn it into tinsel.

442
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,500
But the worst part...

443
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,520
tinsel-man...  is that you don't even know it.

444
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,600
Oh,so you're the big shot celebrity with all the answers,that it?

445
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,300
No,I'm just like the kids.

446
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm a fan. I'm a damned fan of the music.

447
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,630
Now,if you will excuse me,I have to sell some toothpaste.

448
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,960
You give my best to bones.

449
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,840
That's right! Zip toothpaste!

450
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,050
If you want to keep your smile hip,

451
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,140
you'd better brush with some zip!

452
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,340
Gave up the singing career then and there.

453
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,310
Saw how cutthroat it was.

454
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,410
That the last time you saw the hawk?

455
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,070
He looked crushed.

456
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,160
So the hawk knew bones was on the take.

457
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,930
And maybe hawk was going to do something about it.

458
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,280
Your career is over if authorities knew you were taking payola,right,bones?

459
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,320
Fcc was cracking down,lot of people's lives ruined over that.

460
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,480
You can't prove I took money.

461
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,090
We don't care about payola in '58.

462
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,490
We care about who killed john hawkins.

463
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,640
Hawk confront you on what you did?

464
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,470
The same night he found out.

465
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,810
Keep talking.

466
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,350
I never meant to betray him.

467
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,780
But you did,bones.

468
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,810
It didn't matter.

469
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,050
Something had already changed in him.

470
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,550
If I get my own show,

471
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,380
you girls are my first guests.

472
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Bones,we got to talk.

473
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,970
Hawk! Have a seat.

474
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,270
This is,uh,this is gigi,and this is lulu.

475
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,190
Gilugilu.

476
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,440
You mind,girls?

477
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,330
We need some privacy.

478
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,290
hurry back.

479
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,730
What are you doing here,bones?

480
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,680
Mr. Ockley invited me.This is some shindig,huh?

481
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,630
I got two chicks after me. Can you believe that?

482
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,380
They're hookers,bones.

483
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,360
Wh-what?

484
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,190
No,lulu's A dance student, and gigi's A...

485
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,160
stripper.

486
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,800
I've seen her act,umbrellas.

487
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,270
you're fooling.

488
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,920
I know you took money to play that darts song.

489
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,660
It was just one song.

490
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,480
That one song means that they've got me over a barrel.

491
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,560
I don't understand...

492
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,290
I could go to jail...

493
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,270
because of what you did.

494
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,840
Mr. Ockley says it's how the game's played.

495
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,980
You know what the game is,bones?

496
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,690
It's the music and the fans who love it.

497
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,770
And then there's all this.

498
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,630
The dealmakers,the sellouts,the price of your soul.

499
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,470
I'm sorry,hawk.

500
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,910
I'm so sorry.

501
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,570
What are you gonna do?

502
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,620
I don't know,maybe leave philly for a while.

503
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,530
What about your show?

504
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,060
Aw,to hell with it.

505
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,070
To hell with all of this.

506
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,170
I got something more important in my life now.

507
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,520
Jenny.

508
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,820
but she's just a fan.

509
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,270
No.

510
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,930
She's more than that.

511
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,420
Me and her gonna take a little trip out west.

512
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,590
Hawk...

513
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,380
I just wanted to be a winner. 

514
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,640
Like you.

515
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,460
You always were,kid.

516
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,840
Steep price. We all paid.

517
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,650
Some more than others.

518
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,980
So jenny and hawk were going away together?

519
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,630
That was the plan.

520
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,120
But,the next night, hawk was dead.

521
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,690
Funny how jenny failed to mention her travel plans with hawk.

522
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,280
Failed to mention a lot more than that.

523
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,400
Follow me.That documentary dude? He's got nothing on me.

524
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,590
Check it out.

525
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,790
Lyrics to "scarlet rose."

526
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,210
See,the way jenny reacted to that song got me thinking.

527
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,780
We already heard the lyrics,nick.

528
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,710
Well,I've been on the phone with ascap all day.

529
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,360
What's that?

530
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,310
The american society of composers.

531
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,340
And it turns out there were some lyrics that jenny didn't record.

532
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,340
Really?

533
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,380
Like that elton john song "daniel"? You know what that's about?

534
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,930
A guy missing his brother daniel.

535
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,450
Yeah,but you never know the reason why 'cause of the verses he left out about vietnam.

536
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,360
"Daniel's" about vietnam?

537
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,650
How do you know that?

538
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,840
The ascap chick told me.See,changes the entire meaning.

539
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,700
So look at the lyrics that jenny didn't record.

540
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,850
So dream your sweet little dreams,and I will kiss your tiny cheek

541
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,500
and though I must leave now know,that you'll always be with me

542
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,550
I offer up this prayer,that everywhere she goes,

543
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,150
please protect my baby,my sweet,sweet scarlet rose.

544
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,740
Song is registered under the name john hawkins.

545
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,520
Circa 1942.

546
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,820
So the hawk wrote it,not jenny?

547
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,530
Sounds like a lullaby.

548
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,600
Well,maybe jenny wasn't his girlfriend.

549
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,620
My money says she's his daughter.

550
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,330
john hawkins was your father, not your heartthrob.

551
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,640
He divorced dottie when you were four.

552
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,720
Why keep that secret,jenny?

553
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,320
I never considered him my father.He left. I never saw him again.

554
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,840
So whyrack him down?

555
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,980
Maybe cause you wanted to tell hawk what it felt like to be abandoned?

556
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,440
And maybe he rejected you again.

557
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,790
So you start sneaking into the station.

558
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,230
You're wrong.It wasn't like that...

559
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,760
come on,jenny.Your father let you down once,then twice.

560
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,590
So you made him pay...

561
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,740
no!

562
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,290
Finding him was the best thing that ever happened to me.

563
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,890
When did you tell him who you were?

564
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,380
The night little richard played When I gave him my record.

565
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,470
I couldn't leave. I had to find him.

566
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,470
I used to play this song for...a little girl I knew.

567
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,670
I used to sit her up right next to me like a princess.

568
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,360
Was her middle name rosemary?

569
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,660
Jennifer rosemary hawkins.

570
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,950
I used to tell her that scarlet roses were the prettiest in the world.

571
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,270
Just like his little girl.

572
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,140
Your scarlet rose.

573
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,620
I was so afraid to tell you.

574
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,450
So you did it in a song.

575
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,740
You listened to it?

576
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,180
It's beautiful.

577
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,900
Six months ago I found some old photos mom hid away.

578
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,480
When we were a family.

579
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,450
You remembered me at all?

580
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,260
I never forgot you

581
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,350
I want you to understand why I had to leave.

582
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,220
It doesn't matter now.

583
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,180
No.I was living for myself.I was constantly on the move.

584
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,760
One year in new york,next year in L.A. 

585
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,100
Lots of cigarettes and booze  and...

586
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,430
lots of static.

587
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,270
Dottie was right. It was...it was no place for a kid.

588
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,150
I wouldn't have cared.

589
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,900
How 'bout we take that trip to anywhere?

590
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,050
Let me make up for lost time.

591
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,690
What about your show?

592
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,560
I told 'em I was going to take a little time off to spend with my family.

593
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,230
We talked about leaving in a couple of weeks.

594
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,700
He said I could sing backup with a band in california.

595
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,210
But all I cared about was having my dad back.

596
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,870
Well,how'd your mom take the news?

597
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,340
I never told her.

598
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,070
You sure?

599
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,220
Might get her upset.

600
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,410
That might even go talk to the hawk.

601
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,150
Try to stop him.

602
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,450
Everything my mom did was because she loved me.

603
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,770
I understand you and hawk had a daughter?

604
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,230
Jenny was legally adopted by my second husband.

605
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,690
Still. It's,uh...strange how you left that out.

606
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,690
John was never much of a father. So,uh,it didn't matter.

607
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,420
What about your own father?

608
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,790
What does he have to do with this?

609
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,970
Your mom died young,and your father raised you.

610
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,730
The musician?

611
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,360
If you can call playing at holiday inns along route 1 being a musician.

612
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,520
Died on the road at age 43.

613
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,150
Suicide.

614
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,050
I can see how jenny wanting to be a singer was upsetting.

615
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,260
She wouldn't listen to me.

616
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,540
She thought her passion was enough to give it a try.

617
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,700
Passion is for fools.

618
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,180
Passion is a fifth grade girl finding her dad hanging dead in a motel bathroom.

619
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,500
You'd do anything to keep jenny from ending up like that.

620
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,320
I was trying to protect her.

621
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,300
But she was determined.

622
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,120
And she wanted her real dad to help make her dreams come true.

623
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,680
And what does he do?

624
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,000
He encourages her. Invites her to california to sing.

625
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,330
My god.

626
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,840
You went to the studio that night,didn't you,dottie?

627
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,350
To stop him.

628
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,700
I went there to talk.

629
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,080
I swear,just to talk.

630
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,190
Jenny told me everything.

631
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,900
You stay away from her.

632
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,700
She's my daughter,too,dottie.

633
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,550
No.

634
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,760
A daughter is someone you raise.

635
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,690
Someone you take to girl scouts,

636
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,750
someone you make dinner for every night,

637
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,580
whose tears you wipe when she cries.

638
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,620
I want to be there for her now.

639
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,610
You just want to fill her head with nonsense.

640
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,990
No,I want her to dream.Or to at least try,dottie,don't take away her dreams.

641
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,790
You abandoned us.

642
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,080
You're a selfish son of a bitch,and you always will be.

643
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,910
I'm not that man anymore.

644
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,920
You will ruin her life

645
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,260
Poison her with silly notions of singing.

646
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,820
She is good,dottie. She is really good.

647
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,530
I've heard enough...

648
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,280
no,I want you to hear this,all right.

649
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,480
She's got talent, She's got real talent.

650
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,530
Let's slow it down for a sec for a little ballad called

651
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,170
"scarlet rose."

652
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,220
dottie.

653
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,310
I can't lose her,john.

654
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
Take it easy,dottie.

655
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,070
Take it easy.

656
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,540
Don't fill her with dreams.

657
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,480
Dreams just break your heart.

658
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,530
Gimme that thing,dottie.

659
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,730
Come on now,sweetheart,come on.

660
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,650
That's right.Okay.

661
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,300
Scarlet rose... scarlet rose...
