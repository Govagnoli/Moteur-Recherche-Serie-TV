3
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:40,561
Rose, stay put, all right?
And keep your head down.

4
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,649
You never know what these
darkies will try and pull.

5
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,916
Wait, Curtis.

6
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,754
- You hear that music?
- Take it easy, all right?

7
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,452
Crank that window up.

8
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:57,664
Collins, where you been?
I'm damn near dry in here.

9
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,748
I can't help it.
I got wide demand.

10
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,453
Hey, chickadee.

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,037
Watch it, buddy.

12
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,746
Rose Collins, get in the dang car!

13
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,347
What're you aping at anyway?

14
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:20,395
I ain't. I'm not.

15
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,239
Looking.

16
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:14,296
Commercial diver checking for sewage 
leaks found this truck with a body in it.

17
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:16,844
Dredged it up from 
the Delaware this morning.

18
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,431
- Was it down there long?
- I'd say so.

19
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,345
No kidding. / Guy in my neighborhood 
had one of these vintage jobbies.

20
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,031
Spray you with a garden hose
if you got close to it.

21
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,875
- How old we think it is?
- It's gotta be early '30s.

22
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,007
The headlights mounted on the bar, 
not the fender? Means it's pre '35.

23
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:35,696
We'll get an exact year when we
match up the plates and vin number.

24
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,735
Truck was halfway stuck in the mud.

25
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,705
Kept them bones from
getting turned into sand.

26
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,559
We got a reason to think
it wasn't just bad driving?

27
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,565
About a dozen. / CSU has something that 
might explain the reason for the bullet holes.

28
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:51,264
Remains of a glass jug and copper 
tubing found underneath the seat.

29
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,173
- Tubing for what?
- Add sugar and rubbin alcohol, Lil,

30
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,050
you're making moonshine.

31
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,208
Bootlegging. Hot.

32
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,368
- 70 years dead.
- Nice and cold for you.

33
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,558
Could be our new record.

00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:37,902
I called in a favor with auto squad.

47
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,310
Turned up a match for our plates.

48
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,996
1931 Dodge pickup.
Registered to a Curtis Collins.

49
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,505
Could this Collins be our bones?

50
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,083
Nah, he's accounted for.

51
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,113
In fact, guy's still kicking it
at a retirement place in Haverford.

52
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:50,921
Lil and Vera are on
their way out there.

53
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,602
We know if he ever reported
his truck stolen?

54
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:56,523
Nope. Because Curtis Collins had good reason 
to keep the cops far away from his truck.

55
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:57,691
It's like we thought.

56
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:03,140
Picked up twice for illegal distribution of 
alcohol and violation of the 18th amendment.

57
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,484
Curtis Collins, 
bona fide bootlegger.

58
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,506
And the truck was 
the company car.

59
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,556
Glad we brought you
a challenge for once, Frannie?

60
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,167
Outside of paleontology camp,

61
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,225
this is the oldest body
I've ever worked on.

62
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,025
You able to get anything
from what's left?

63
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,656
Fractured skull was 
the cause of death.

64
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,118
From a gunshot?

65
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,359
- Probably the accident.
- What else?

66
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,350
We got the skull and pelvis,
so I can tell you the victim was female.

67
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,031
Late adolescent to young adult.

68
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,634
A girl? / Had to be 
some lady bootleggers, right?

69
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,698
Curtis Collins?

70
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,401
This can't be good.

71
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,414
Did you lose 
a truck around 1930?

72
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:49,314
Sure. You making reparations?

73
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,207
It was dredged up
from the Delaware this morning.

74
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:56,871
No kidding. / Had bullet holes 
all over it and a body inside.

75
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:01,578
A body?

76
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,147
You don't say.

77
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,828
Any idea who that was?

78
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:08,662
Good chance that's 
my sister in there. Rose.

79
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,412
What makes you think that?

80
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,345
She ran off with my truck,
August of '32.

81
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,914
And you're just now thinking
she might be dead?

82
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:21,593
When I couldn't find her back when,
I thought she didn't want to be found.

83
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,809
You two on bad terms?

84
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,905
No.

85
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:29,687
Our father killed himself
after the bank took his store,

86
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:32,342
mother was long dead.

87
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:34,662
Leaving you in charge.

88
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,820
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt her?

89
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,693
No.

90
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:44,876
Other than refusing to heed me, 
Rose was sweet as honey.

91
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:47,167
Light up a room.

92
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,384
Took a peek at your file, Curtis.

93
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:52,383
Selling moonshine
was a dangerous business.

94
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:53,977
That earn you some enemies?

95
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:56,161
Guess so.

96
00:06:56,508 --> 00:07:01,073
Cause as a young businessman,
I sure wasn't sweet.

97
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,727
Collins!

98
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:07,346
Reach over for your brother and
turn that engine off, girly.

99
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,032
Easy there, Doc Win.

100
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:12,298
Had a nip of that gasoline
you trying to pass off as whiskey.

101
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,988
Tastes like you ran
it through with fertilizer.

102
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,755
The only fertilizer here's 
the lice you're dropping, Doc.

103
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,571
I'm about done
dealing with you, Collins.

104
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,183
This block is my territory
and I am fierce in protecting it.

105
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,299
You won't find another outfit
willing to supply you.

106
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,797
Unless you're dead and gone.

107
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:27,991
Then we'd all celebrate.

108
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,841
Please don't hurt him!
Take, take another jug!

109
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,855
Dang it, Rose!
What'd I say to you?

110
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,317
Stay out of it, doll-face.

111
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,800
I know you're not talking
to my sister familiar.

112
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,140
- What if I am?
- You do not talk to her.

113
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,830
Calm down and 
leave the girl out of it.

114
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,161
Fertilizer-tasting or not,
the hooch is half the draw of this place.

115
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,779
Other half being the entertainers,

116
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,218
and they all need the hooch
to get in touch with the muse.

117
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:53,595
Go serve it up, why don't you?

118
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:59,119
Let's not talk business
in front of the females.

119
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:01,938
I'll catch up with you
another time.

120
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,824
Friend.

121
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:10,533
So this Doc Win thought you were
selling him an inferior product.

122
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:14,559
There were fellas making liquor
out of hair tonic.

123
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,722
Least I put corn syrup in the mix.

124
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:19,820
And Doc Win didn't see you
being decent that way.

125
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,097
Not at all.

126
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,477
So if Rose was in your truck,

127
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:27,329
maybe some of your business contacts
thought they were offing you instead.

128
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,625
Yeah.

129
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:36,981
Well, Doc Win knew the truck.
Always said it rattled a particular way.

130
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,882
Irked him.

131
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,072
We know this is a stretch, Celia,
asking you about your great-grandfather.

132
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,820
Doc Win's a legend in our family.

133
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,198
I've been hearing about him
my whole life.

134
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:50,441
He had a beef with a guy
named Curtis Collins, a bootlegger.

135
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:54,603
Curtis's truck was pulled up
out the Delaware today with a body inside.

136
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,279
We think it may be his sister.

137
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,961
And you think Doc
had something to do with that.

138
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:02,258
- Possible.
- Her name was Rose Collins.

139
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:05,066
Ring any bells?

140
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,905
The name, no.
But the face...

141
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:11,572
from Doc's album...

142
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,845
This is the same girl, right?

143
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,665
It is. Sure. / I've looked 
at this picture so many times.

144
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:23,219
You know anything about this girl?

145
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:26,277
My grandma used to tell me
stories that Doc told her.

146
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:31,120
My favorite was about this night when 
Billie Holiday came to play Doc Win's.

147
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,269
What do you think
of this one, Billie?

148
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,504
She ain't bad.

149
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,318
She's got my name.
That's in her favor.

150
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,372
Oh, no.

151
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,328
- Your brother know you're here?
- No.

152
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:06,256
Please don't toss me out
because of him.

153
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:09,028
I got money to buy
drinks just like she does.

154
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:11,306
A cordial, please.

155
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:20,250
Hello.

156
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,200
Bible study's out the door,
three blocks down.

157
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:27,484
I'm here for the music.

158
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:31,886
Watch out. She don't sing 
about lollipops and flowers.

159
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:34,573
This ain't no place for you.
Why don't you go on home?

160
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,007
I need to listen a while.

161
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:44,602
Pardon me.

162
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,776
Could I try one 
of your cigarettes?

163
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,483
Fresh out.

164
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,270
Dang it!

165
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,438
My hat was off.

166
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:57,367
How come your mother lets you
dress like a boy?

167
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,711
I do what I please, first off.

168
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,455
And I ain't dressed like a boy.

169
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,551
I'm dressed like a fox.

170
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,395
Doc Win, you gotta go give this
Sunday-best-wearing white girl

171
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:16,203
her very first cigarette
while I'm trying to listen?

172
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:19,617
- Why don't you hit the skids?
- I have a drink I paid for.

173
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,923
Now shoo, fly, 
and don't come back.

174
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,389
Story was Rose was the first 
white girl to come to Doc Win's.

175
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:49,658
Lured in by the music.

176
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:53,065
Doc said it was a testament
to the blues being universal.

177
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:56,453
And who was this Billie
giving Rose a hard time?

178
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:58,167
One of the regular customers.

179
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,860
Read in the club's poetry
readings, too.

180
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,427
Can we hold onto this album
a little while?

181
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:04,536
Sure.

182
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:08,000
And I've got boxes of Doc Win memorabilia
that I've been meaning to go through.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,648
If I find anything else,
I'll give you a call.

184
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,927
So Rose Collins might've been the type 
to stick her nose where it didn't belong.

185
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:21,897
She definitely wasn't
welcome at Doc Win's.

186
00:12:21,897 --> 00:12:25,625
Looked at the old ledgers.
Doc Win's wasn't a good girl's kind of place.

187
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,694
Cops arrested people 
there every weekend.

188
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,355
Shady clientele?

189
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:33,972
Drunks, women of ill-repute,
artist types.

190
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:37,134
So maybe Rose goes back
to Doc Win's and this Billie,

191
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:41,078
or someone else there,
takes issue with her.

192
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:43,690
Hey. I did some more looking
at your girl's skull.

193
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,961
And? / There's no nasal sill, 
the little bone at the base of the nose.

194
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,391
Nose bone mean something?

195
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,589
It's one of the ways to determine
race from skeletal remains.

196
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,187
Your victim was African American.

197
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:05,157
Well, Rose Collins is still alive.

198
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:06,432
No kidding.

199
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,234
Living somewhere up in Manhattan.
Got a last known address.

200
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,570
You find a name for our bones?

201
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,469
So far, six young black women,
disappeared or assumed dead around '32.

202
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,156
Saved that stack for you.

203
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:18,760
- It's a birthday present.
- When's your birthday?

204
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:21,132
- Tomorrow.
- How you celebrating?

205
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,037
I'm 60. I'm almost dead.

206
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:26,164
I'm going home tonight,
writing out my will.

207
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,285
Okay.

208
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,589
Most interesting name I found,

209
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,147
Wilhemina Ducette.
Nickname Billie.

210
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,933
- The girl from Doc Win's.
- Check out her mug shot.

211
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,206
Looks like she thinks
this whole arrest thing's funny.

212
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,495
Girl had a close relationship
with Philly PD.

213
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:44,653
Age 12, juvenile division picks
her up for curfew violation.

214
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,462
Age 14, engaging in illegal
possession of liquor.

215
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:52,874
16, arrested for causing a public
disturbance by wearig men's pants.

216
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,132
She sure liked her boy's clothes.

217
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:59,511
She was getting in scrapes
pretty regular till summer of '32.

218
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:03,314
Then no more. Great aunt files 
a report when Billie drops off the map.

219
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,873
Into the Delaware?

220
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,635
Best answer so far.

221
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,672
Maybe Rose can give us more.

222
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,888
We thought you'd be
harder to find, Rose.

223
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:26,384
Seeing as your brother thought
you might've died in '32.

224
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:29,207
I ran away that year.

225
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,342
Curtis and I haven't talked since.

226
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:34,072
70 year sibling squabble.

227
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,688
You got me beat.

228
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,288
He and I never got on.

229
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,323
He wanted me under 
his thumb like a kid.

230
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:41,048
I wanted to live.

231
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,366
We got some questions
go way back, Rose.

232
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,282
You remember a woman
named Billie Ducette?

233
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,955
Sure. She was a character.

234
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,788
Any idea how she could've wound
up in your brother's truck.

235
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,921
August of '32?

236
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,194
I lent it to her.

237
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,184
You and Billie were friendly?

238
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:04,172
Because we heard she hassled you,
the night Billie Holiday played Doc Win's.

239
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,402
She did.

240
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:08,479
But after that, we became friends.

241
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:11,123
So she borrowed your truck,
and disappeared?

242
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:13,721
I thought maybe
she took off for New York

243
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:17,139
and knowing what Curtis would do
if he found out she had his truck,

244
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:19,096
I followed her to get it back.

245
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:22,629
- And that's how you wound up here?
- I never found her, though.

246
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:26,162
I was gonna go home
to Philly, but I, uh...

247
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,654
I met a Wall street man.

248
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:32,067
And he became my husband.

249
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,510
You remember Billie
having any enemies?

250
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,569
She was saucy.
Had her share of rifts with people.

251
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,348
Anyone who'd go so far
as to shoot at her?

252
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:44,318
You've heard the expression
"a woman scorned"?

253
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:08,377
Sent that girl away a night ago,
and don't she know it's been ashes

254
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:12,014
Sent her away and
don't she know it ache

255
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,131
Heart of mine, throat of smoke,

256
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:18,381
I sent a girl away and
it's been hell opened up,

257
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:22,360
working on my skin
till it be bone.

258
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,751
You're wearing a skirt.

259
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,483
I clean house. They make me.

260
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:39,935
Well...

261
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,832
Well, what?
That about me?

262
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,619
It's one of my originals.

263
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:50,654
How I express my truest thoughts
through poetry.

264
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,561
I got one of my poems
published in a magazine.

265
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,495
You heard of opportunity?

266
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,993
Published by W.E.B. Dubois?

267
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,175
Who's that?

268
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,423
Wasn't them chose me anyhow.

269
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,921
They will when I move to New York.

270
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:11,105
Was this other outfit,
equally prestigious, you know.

271
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:13,023
Paid me two dollars.

272
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,223
- Gee...
- You come back to the club,

273
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:19,216
I'll buy you a real drink
using my poem earnings.

274
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,925
Thought you didn't want me there.

275
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,338
All right, listen.

276
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,852
I go with this girl,

277
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,160
little Georgie and she's batty.

278
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,955
You go with a girl?

279
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:34,820
They're a headache,
but that's my taste.

280
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,714
I have a beau.

281
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,480
Ted. A boy.

282
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,880
- Your boy get jealous?
- Sure. He's a hothead.

283
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,568
Little Georgie's got a pistol in her purse
and I've seen her use it.

284
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,320
- You saying she'd use it on me?
- If she came in, saw us jawing.

285
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,556
But I broke it off with her.

286
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:55,958
Told her I got the right
to new friends if I want them.

287
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,748
Will you teach me how to smoke?

288
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,857
Will you teach me how to dance?

289
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,999
Yeah, all right.

290
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,735
Oh, no.

291
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,469
Step in there.

292
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,670
- That her?
- She followed me. You ought to go.

293
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,383
Billie Ducette!

294
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:17,053
- You stop in your tracks!
- And put some speed on it.

295
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:23,987
So Billie had a thing for you.

296
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:25,798
At first.

297
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,328
Which was scandalous to me.

298
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,299
But you still became friends.

299
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,989
I was taken by the way she lived.

300
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,925
- So free.
- Wearing pants.

301
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:40,149
Smoking and cursing
and not caring who protested.

302
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:44,349
And this little Georgie
was her jilted ex?

303
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:48,364
Billie said just ignore her but,

304
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:53,338
I couldn't stop thinking about
the pearl-handled pistol she carried.

305
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,889
You in my view, boys.

306
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,604
Got to interrupt your vacation
for a minute, little Georgie.

307
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,640
What'd you call me?

308
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,896
We meet in another life?

309
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,865
Let's talk about that life.

310
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,697
You remember a girl
named Billie Ducette?

311
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,708
Oh, no. That hurts.

312
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,681
Back when, that girl
bruised my heart and good.

313
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,736
- And what'd you do in revenge?
- Revenge?

314
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,614
Not my way.

315
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:34,283
You stabbed a lady in '43
and spent five years in prison.

316
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:38,052
Woman got in the way of me
and my dance moves.

317
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:42,052
Would it surprise you to hear
Billie was killed back in '32?

318
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,826
Death don't surprise me.

319
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:48,150
There were gunshots in the back 
of the truck she was found dead in.

320
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,500
And we know you had a fondness
for using your pistol.

321
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,892
Billie had enough trouble
coming her way.

322
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,294
Didn't need mine.

323
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,727
What kind of trouble
we talking about?

324
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,062
Worst kind.

325
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:02,975
Kind that comes with being sweet on
an innocent, little white girl.

326
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,668
Hit me again, Doc.

327
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:08,066
I can still feel my damn heart beating.

328
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:30,963
I never slow-danced before.

329
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,540
Ted doesn't like dancing.

330
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,684
You like it?

331
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:46,038
In New York, you can go to 10 clubs
like this in a single night.

332
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:49,020
That'd be nice.
Dancing all night.

333
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,300
I bet we'd have fun there.

334
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,752
- Ted!
- Rose,

335
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,394
you know what
kind of a place this is?

336
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,844
You got to be out of your mind.

337
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,389
- You've been drinking.
- My brother's a bootlegger, Ted.

338
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:03,080
Been bound to happen.

339
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,173
You being lippy just then?

340
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:06,656
That's the hooch
and it don't suit you.

341
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,222
You were supposed
to say, "can I cut in?"

342
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,748
So this is the one.

343
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:17,085
My pal saw you two
outside st. Abigail's.

344
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,718
She's a queer, Rose.

345
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,489
And she brought you down here
to get you sauced and take advantage.

346
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,604
No, no.

347
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:26,289
You the one that don't dance?

348
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:32,285
Man can't move his feet's
a man can't move when it counts.

349
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:42,108
Drinks is on me everybody!

350
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,089
You hear about any fallout
from this Ted situation?

351
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,230
But not too much after's
when Billie took a powder.

352
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,874
You mean, was killed.

353
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,120
Guess that's right.

354
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,403
Tell you what.

355
00:21:56,403 --> 00:22:04,134
Men do not like having another woman
as romantic competition.

356
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:13,646
Okay. / Seen a few of these scenarios 
first hand and they are right ugly.

357
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:20,652
So this Ted guy, 
Rose's boyfriend?

358
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:22,029
Dead and gone.

359
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,776
Still might be the doer.
Aced Billie for eyeing his girl.

360
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,031
Happy bihdhday, Will.

361
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,057
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:30,517
Give yourself a present, man.
Go see her tonight.

363
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,125
- Who?
- Lena. Singer at this club.

364
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,719
I'm staying in tonight.

365
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,516
I'll go with you, wingman.

366
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:38,808
Forget it.

367
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:41,993
Got cigars and guitars at home.
That's all I need.

368
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,222
Celia Watson dropped this off.

369
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:47,216
Mementos from Doc Win's?

370
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,952
Literary magazines.

371
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,869
"To Rose."

372
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,297
"An original poem by Billie Ducette."

373
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:56,485
Maybe something in one of these
gives us a clue to how she died.

374
00:22:56,485 --> 00:23:01,357
So we got to make sense of,
"oh, ripest fruit, pink and hidden,"

375
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:05,427
"I've traveled wet,
sweaty miles to find you."

376
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:10,489
Sounds like Billie visited
Rose's school again.

377
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,251
"To Rose, whose breathing
is blooming,"

378
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:18,496
"school bell shocks my heart
into moving"

379
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:22,891
"Springtime sends green roots
through my veins,"

380
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:27,701
"my eyes are dusted off,
my blood is searching,"

381
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:31,990
"at the bell, I'm born again,
through the earth aching,"

382
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,482
"moon-faced girl,

383
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,700
you are the only one I see."

384
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,972
Sounds like Billie was smitten.

385
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:46,891
What about Rose?

386
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:49,238
She said they were just friends.

387
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:51,718
This makes it sound
like more than that.

388
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:55,381
"Those three words I have
never heard together"

389
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,566
"Those three words
I have never heard together,"

390
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,456
"before you made them
in your mouth,"

391
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:06,431
"chewed them soft
like sugar cane,"

392
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:08,728
"polished them with your tongue,"

393
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:13,912
"gave them to me sweet,"
"and I swore I'd never get them lost."

394
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,433
"Is it how I can't find sleep,
or get fed, this thing you said?"

395
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:26,373
"Is it how my heart grows
at the sight of you?"

396
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:30,217
"Then, baby, yes,

397
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:33,016
I love you, too."

398
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:39,660
Rose told Billie she loved her.

399
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,910
We sure these aren't
just Billie's fantasies?

400
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,025
She said it was her truest self
she wrote in her poems.

401
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,485
Okay, well, this one ain't pretty.

402
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,008
Date on it, August 1932.

403
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:52,352
Close to when Billie disappeared.

404
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:54,194
What's it called, Nicky?

405
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,784
"My body broken."

406
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:04,994
"Tired, nickel-colored night"

407
00:25:04,994 --> 00:25:08,600
"You can take my blood
and keep it,"

408
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,454
"I ain't need it no more,"

409
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:16,827
"use my broken teeth
to pave your street,"

410
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:22,527
"my splintered bones 
stomped for sand,"

411
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:27,166
"if this lead-footed man should
once again leave me dead,"

412
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,780
"my body broken,"

413
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,998
"my soul would find a way,"

414
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:39,731
"oh, night, to dance 
with his girl again."

415
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,818
Someone beat up Billie,
left her for dead.

416
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:49,058
Someone whose girl she stole.

417
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:51,599
Possible Billie stole a lot
of girls in her day.

418
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,629
She calls him "lead-footed,"
like he can't move his feet.

419
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,972
Maybe dead Ted.

420
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,005
The bad dancer. / Rose didn't 
tell us Billie got beat up over her.

421
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,806
She didn't mention 
love poems, either.

422
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:03,760
Didn't want to own up?

423
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,385
I can't picture my grandma
owning up to something like this.

424
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,589
Back to the Big Apple.

425
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,279
Best friends.
That's what we were.

426
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,649
That's all?

427
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,298
Rose, someone hurt Billie pretty bad
a few nights before she died.

428
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,821
That your boyfriend, Ted?

429
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,121
Yes.

430
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:37,988
All because you and Billie
were friends, huh?

431
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:42,913
Rose, she wrote you love poems.

432
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:46,982
You have them?

433
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,579
Yeah.

434
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:54,942
I'm a great-grandmother.

435
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:58,404
- My family doesn't know.
- We're talking to you,

436
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:00,838
not your family.

437
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,705
I was 17.

438
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:08,633
I didn't know what it was.
I just knew I wanted to be around her.

439
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:14,491
You had feelings for her?

440
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:20,487
There's a book in my desk,
the drawer on the left.

441
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:24,589
With the violet cover.

442
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:28,033
Writings from my teenage years.

443
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,477
You're a poet, too.

444
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,518
Oh, just that summmer.

445
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,224
I tried to write my own poems.
I was trying to be just like Billie.

446
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:42,447
I was terrible, of course.

447
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:45,314
"I came up from the dark
without you,"

448
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:48,928
"and every day since
has been in shadow."

449
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:56,138
I thought Billie
brought me out of the dark.

450
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,747
Showed me the light.

451
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:03,122
What happened 
when Ted beat her up?

452
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:08,086
It made me realize how much I felt.

453
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,545
You think he broke anything, Billie?

454
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,036
Look at me.

455
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,226
He told me I come near
you again, he'll kill me.

456
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:43,564
No.

457
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:45,614
But I gotta come near you, Rose.

458
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,545
He won't kill you.
It's crazy.

459
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:51,726
Don't you see how it goes?
It ain't easy for us.

460
00:28:58,427 --> 00:29:00,600
Hold still.

461
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,006
Hold still, will you?

462
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:13,316
It's okay, it's okay.

463
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:25,879
I got a plan 
so we can be together.

464
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,054
We'll go to New York.

465
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:29,458
We ain't got no money.

466
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,455
Sure, we do.

467
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,813
Look around.

468
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:37,546
We got lots.

469
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:12,437
After that, I knew Curtis would kill me,
so we, we had to go.

470
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:14,223
To New York.

471
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,051
That was the plan.

472
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:19,409
Billie was gonna take the truck
and liquor, pick me up at school.

473
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,089
But she never made it?

474
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,544
I took a bus to New York
in the morning.

475
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:28,668
I tried to find her.

476
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:33,874
Rose, why were you so afraid
of your brother?

477
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,696
After our parents died,
Curtis became fixated on me.

478
00:30:37,696 --> 00:30:41,423
He, he wanted us to
be together forever.

479
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,432
He never would have let me go.

480
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,354
And you think he caught Billie
stealing the truck?

481
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,755
What would he do to her?

482
00:30:54,197 --> 00:30:56,747
If that happened...

483
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:00,768
I'm sure she would
have been killed.

484
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,755
My sister's dead.

485
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:18,245
No, she's in New York. Alive.

486
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,613
You got it wrong.

487
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:21,448
How would you know, Curtis?

488
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,378
You lost touch in '32.

489
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:27,789
I just know, is all.

490
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,892
Answer me a hypothetical.

491
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,449
Back in the days when
you weren't so sweet,

492
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,669
what would you do if you caught
someone lifting your moonshine?

493
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:39,883
- Shoot them.
- Did you shoot Billie Ducette?

494
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,414
I don't know who that is.

495
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:46,208
Sure you do.

496
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:49,076
She broke into your shed,

497
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:53,854
stole your hooch, your truck.
You chased her, shot at her,

498
00:31:53,854 --> 00:31:55,542
ran her off a bridge.

499
00:31:55,542 --> 00:32:01,163
That's poppycock.

500
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:09,570
What about someone
stealing your sister?

501
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,868
What would you do to them?

502
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,192
Watch that mouth.

503
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:20,426
Billie Ducette becoming
a little more vivid to you now?

504
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,711
I didn't shoot that thing.

505
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,671
- What's that?
- The one poisoned my Rose.

506
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,270
Ain't kill her, but...

507
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:37,058
Rose had to step in.

508
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,517
What the hell are you doing?

509
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:53,087
Looking for leaks.

510
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,190
- Stop it!
- I caught myself a thief, Rose!

511
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,041
Curtis, leave her alone!

512
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,291
You gone bughouse?
She's stealing from us.

513
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,771
I love her!

514
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,310
You what?

515
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:12,140
Love her.
Please let her go.

516
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:15,542
You better watch
what you're saying, Rosie.

517
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,063
You don't know what she is.

518
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,533
Yes, I do.

519
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,680
I know it through and through.

520
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,424
Don't you say that to me!

521
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:23,712
No.

522
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,601
Oh, lord. No.
I tried to raise you right!

523
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,917
I tried, but you slipping off.

524
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,488
I'm your heart, Rose.

525
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:32,258
I know that you know that.

526
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:36,700
But you let this thing
get in your mind like a maggot.

527
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:39,969
- It's all right, baby.
- Don't talk to her!

528
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,253
You gotta choice is what.

529
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:51,614
You cannot be loyal to this thing
and be part of this Collins family.

530
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:54,388
- Rose.
- Which one?

531
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,699
Blood or this?

532
00:33:58,518 --> 00:34:01,706
Me or this?

533
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,961
I'm gonna put her 
out of her misery.

534
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,698
Now, go get my gun
out of the truck. Now!

535
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:13,105
Go get it!

536
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:27,983
You're not my family,
you sorry son of a bitch.

537
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,538
Billie, get in the truck.

538
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,626
Rose...

539
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,516
Curtis...

540
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:46,476
I guess good-bye.

541
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:10,816
I took my plymouth and

542
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,921
drove after them.

543
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,067
- Shot at them?
- Emptied my gun.

544
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:18,566
But they kept on.

545
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,055
So how did the truck
end up in the river?

546
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:24,959
Bridge was out
because of the rains.

547
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:28,272
I saw the sign, slowed down.

548
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:30,529
And the girls?

549
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:36,107
Hit the bridge going full-bore.

550
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:41,058
That's, that's what's
scrambling my brains, see.

551
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:44,719
You saying Rose is alive.

552
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,851
Because she was in that truck.

553
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,705
They both were.

554
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:50,826
And I...

555
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:56,094
I saw it go off of that bridge.

556
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:13,784
I don't know why, exactly.
The last couple of days,

557
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:16,800
I feel short of breath at home.

558
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,488
I know that feeling.

559
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,568
Fresh air helps.

560
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:28,751
We talked to your brother
about your theory he killed Billie.

561
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,413
He gave us something else.

562
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:33,712
He told us you were
in the truck, Rose.

563
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:37,566
- When it went off the bridge.
- That's not possible.

564
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:39,444
I would've died.

565
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:43,061
Yet here you are.

566
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,534
I was not in that truck.

567
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:50,502
I was waiting for Billie.

568
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,718
I was alone.

569
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,410
Right.

570
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,945
So there was no plan.

571
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,414
- You never loved her.
- You never healed her.

572
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:05,102
You never came up 
from the dark without her?

573
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,448
Rose...

574
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:16,049
"came up from the dark without you"

575
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:20,951
"and every day since
has been in shadow."

576
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,189
Dark is the water.

577
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:28,076
This is about the accident, isn't it?

578
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:31,875
You gave us this poem, Rose.

579
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,559
You want to tell us.

580
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,653
Water, love, guilt.

581
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,995
Death.

582
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:42,709
I'm no writer.

583
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,841
But she was.

584
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,426
And that's why you wrote this.

585
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:51,565
For Billie.

586
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:58,333
I wondered if it was wrong,
the feelings I had for her.

587
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:01,473
No.

588
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:05,355
It was just the wrong time.

589
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:09,923
All these years...

590
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,802
I've carried her with me.

591
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,772
What happened that night?

592
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:18,103
In the truck?

593
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:26,107
I betrayed my girl.

594
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,874
How?

595
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,385
I lived.

596
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,232
- Baby, hold tight.
- He's gonna kill us!

597
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,414
He's gonna follow us
all the way to New York

598
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,929
and track us down like dogs.

599
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,316
Let me out, then.

600
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:59,906
It's me he's after.
You blow on out of here.

601
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:02,979
- No, he'll kill you.
- I'm not scared, Rose.

602
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,843
No. We can make it.

603
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,411
It's closed off.

604
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:16,496
No, no, no, no.

605
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:18,807
We ain't getting away
from him now, Rose.

606
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:22,581
I know. But he's not
taking you away from me.

607
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,950
- You love me?
- Baby, what are you doing?

608
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,981
- I'm your girl, right?
- You're my girl and I love you.

609
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:48,076
How'd you like to love me forever?

610
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,238
Yes.

611
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:56,770
Okay.

612
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,477
All right, then that's
what we'll do.

613
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,164
Billie!

614
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,168
"I came up from the dark
without you"

615
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:08,711
"and every day's been in shadow."

616
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:13,534
"I have begged the tide to 
wash away my sin"

617
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,737
"and take me to you in the dark"

618
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:21,906
"but every day I surface again."

619
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:59,087
"but in the spring,
I am betrayed by the new earth"

620
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:03,835
"with you in my heart,
I am born again a green bud,"

621
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:08,194
"I am born again blooming."
