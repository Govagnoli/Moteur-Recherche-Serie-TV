00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:15,803
- Two bucks.
- Here you go.

4
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,635
Thanks.

5
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,385
Buck 29.

6
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,098
I only have a dollar.

7
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:31,684
- Is this for school?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:33,453
All right, then.

9
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:35,031
Education's important.

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,186
You don't wanna end up like 
those mutts on the corner.

11
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:44,444
Get outta here.

12
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:46,926
- And be careful.
- Thanks, mister.

13
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:51,590
Boss!

14
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:54,541
Takeout's getting cold.

15
00:01:58,376 --> 00:02:01,492
Vera's wolfing down the last of
the sweet and sour. / Okay.

16
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,395
The Sixers traded Allen Iverson.

17
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,286
Uh-huh.

18
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,139
Boss...

19
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,335
- food's here.
- Oh, thanks, Lil.

20
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,549
I'm not hungry.

21
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,355
You got something on a cold one?

22
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,514
No, I just come down to take a look at 
that case every once in a while.

23
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:21,886
Any reason?

24
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,260
Tender age.
The kid was eight.

25
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,314
Your job?

26
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,424
No...No!

27
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:40,921
No!

28
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,184
No!

29
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:45,002
My little boy!

30
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,333
Calm down, please ,sir.

31
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,668
- Any good leads?
- Oh, plenty. None panned out.

32
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,248
Three black teenagers were main suspects.

33
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:02,279
We nearly had a race riot 
in the neighborhood when the kid died.

34
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,021
You wanna take a look at it?

35
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:10,087
You got something new on it?

36
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,288
No. You get fresh eyes.

37
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,114
Maybe you'll see something I missed.

38
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,742
Any reason you're looking back now? 
Today?

39
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,588
What am I, one of your suspects?

40
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,914
Well, you're avoiding my questions like one?

41
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,350
All right.

42
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,623
I can take a hint.

43
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,474
Be mysterious.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2004/01/18

53
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,819
Tim Barnes was hit once in the face
below the right eye,

54
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,533
presumably knocked unconscious.

55
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,761
- He died of hypothermia.
- No prints, no witnesses.

56
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,194
The lead suspect
was a 16-year-old glue-sniffer

57
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,853
named Latrell Richmond.

58
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:25,234
Juvenile record of assault and burglary.

59
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,277
He and his pals hung out
at a corner by the store

60
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,170
where Tim Barnes bought that notebook.

61
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,749
You interview him?

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,329
That night.

63
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,478
So after the boy goes into the store?

64
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:36,588
I saw him leave.

65
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:38,903
Headed north on Grover.

66
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:42,367
What did you do after you saw the boy
walking north on Grover?

67
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,499
Nothing. Chilled.

68
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,854
You didn't follow him, 
maybe try and rob him?

69
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,092
You deaf, Still-man?

70
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,072
I gotta repeat everything?

71
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,449
Anyone see you chillin' 
on the corner, Latrell?

72
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,053
Other than your two friends?

73
00:04:58,053 --> 00:04:59,873
No, it was... it was cold out.

74
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:03,217
- Nobody was out.
- What about Mr. Murphy, the store clerk?

75
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,365
- He see you chillin'?
- How do I know?

76
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,151
I stayed away from that white boy.

77
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:10,222
Cracker hates the black man,
just like the Philly PD.

78
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,763
We released him into 
his mother's custody.

79
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,711
We were gonna box him in the morning,

80
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:19,300
- but he'd disappeard by then.
- How about his two friends?

81
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,113
They were polygraphed.
Both passed.

82
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,913
One is dead now, and the other's
serving time, won't talk to cops.

83
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:27,397
- Latrell's mom around?
- Yeah, she and his two sisters always

84
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,249
claimed they had no 
idea where he went.

85
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:30,940
Let's fan out.

86
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,554
I'll go to the parents.
You go to the store clerk.

87
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:35,441
The clerk was the 
last to see Tim alive?

88
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,321
Yep.

89
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,972
Maybe Jeffries and Vera
can pay Latrell's family a visit.

90
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,315
Good.

91
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:45,496
Tim loved delivering the mail 
with his dad in the summer.

92
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:50,556
Your other two?

93
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:52,527
Uh, that's Tina in California.

94
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,295
She's a vet now, lives in Modesto.

95
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,187
And that's Brian, he's my youngest.

96
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:58,000
He's a law student of Syracus.

97
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,712
Oh, Greg, honey.

98
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:04,590
Uh, this is Detective Rush.
She's here about Tim.

99
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,169
What about him? / I'd like to talk to you
about the night he was killed.

100
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,972
Lieutenant Stillman sent me.

101
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,036
- He's lieutenant now, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,805
He was a nice man.

103
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,561
I told her it was okay.
I can handle it.

104
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:26,983
All right.

105
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,826
You wanna know what happened 
that night, I'll tell you.

106
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:31,880
Once.

107
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,656
Hey, mom, can I go to the store
to buy a notebook for math?

108
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,650
- Ask your father.
- I got a dollar. I'll pay for it.

109
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,643
I said ask your father.

110
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,675
- Dad, that hurt.
- Hey, dad,

111
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,371
can I go to the store to buy a notebook
for math class?  / Stop it! Stop it!

112
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,137
Tina, your hair's gotta be washed.

113
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,123
Dad. / No, it doesn't.

114
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,224
- Dad.
- What?

115
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:56,011
Can I go to the store 
to buy a notebook?

116
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:58,777
- Ask your mother.
- But she said to ask you.

117
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,321
Are we done, Daddy?

118
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,647
Stop squirming.

119
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,367
Forget you.

120
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:06,870
Tina, stop squirming.

121
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,383
You have kids...
Detective?

122
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,080
Because you don't know
the meaning of exhausion

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,368
until you've had a colicky newborn
on top of two others.

124
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,942
We were outgunned, 
weren't we, honey?

125
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,546
Three against two.

126
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:25,502
How much time passed
before you noticed Tim was missing?

127
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:28,670
Um... two...

128
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,441
two and a half hours.

129
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:32,209
That's how nuts we were.

130
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:35,359
- Then what'd you do?
- We called Tim's friends.

131
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,107
Um, checked around the block,

132
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,075
and pretty soon we got scared,
so we called the cops.

133
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,590
By the time they found him...

134
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:46,428
Tim was frozen to death.

135
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,744
If we would have just 
noticed him missing earlier...

136
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:51,386
It's okay, sweetie.

137
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,761
Like I said, once is all 
I'm gonna tell that story.

138
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:04,665
Hey, hey! Hey!

139
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:05,911
Watch that.

140
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,173
Wilma Richmond?

141
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,659
Detectives Vera, Jeffries.

142
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,890
My daughters told me you called them.

143
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,948
You ain't gonna get nothing outta me
you didn't get outta my girls.

144
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,600
Think maybe we can 
come in, Ms. Wilma?

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,098
- Yeah, we are, uh, sitting ducks out here.
- And it's cold.

146
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,909
Don't bother the kids none.

147
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,912
Besides, you got blubber on you.

148
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:32,812
We'll only be a minute.

149
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,761
So your daughters say 
they haven't seen Latrell

150
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,823
since the night he disappeard in 1980.

151
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,201
- Ditto.
- No phone calls, letters?

152
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,077
What did I just say?

153
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,716
Besides, if I knew 
where Latrell was,

154
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,517
which I don't,
you think I'd tell you?

155
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,610
Don't hear me wrong?
I feel bad for that family,

156
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:01,919
but they're not the only ones
lost a boy that night.

157
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,645
I lost my son the same 
as they lost theirs.

158
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,965
So what happened that night,

159
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,062
after you brought Latrell home
from Homicide?

160
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,695
I don't like to think 
about that night.

161
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,216
- We can understand that.
- Oh, yeah?

162
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,438
You lost a boy, Detective?

163
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:22,893
No, ma'am. / Then why are you
talking about understanding?

164
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,231
Trell was my eldest,

165
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,907
the man of the house,

166
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,195
but he was still just a boy.

167
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,806
We'll get us a lawyer, Trell.

168
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,196
You ain't gotta run.

169
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:34,869
We can't afford no lawyer.

170
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,322
Where are you gonna go?

171
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,188
Don't know, but if I stay here,
the police'll beat my ass till I confess,

172
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,260
pin this murder on me.
You know they will.

173
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,249
- You got any money?
- No.

174
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,864
Here.

175
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,608
- I'm not cleaning you out, Mom.
- Take it.

176
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,113
16 years old.

177
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:20,529
Can you imagine how scared he was?

178
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,013
Your grandkids?

179
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,791
From my daughters.

180
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,910
Thank God I at least have them.

181
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,429
Now if you don't mind,

182
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:36,970
why don't you go harass some 
other innocent black people?

183
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:47,805
Sean Murphy.

184
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,223
Call me Murph-- everyone does.

185
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:53,095
You're a long way from clerking
at the five-and-dime, Murph.

186
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,192
That's what a little hard work can do.

187
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,083
So...

188
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,394
this is about Tim Barnes?

189
00:10:58,394 --> 00:11:00,553
I understand you were the last 
person to see him alive.

190
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,557
Aside from whoever killed him.

191
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,512
He bought some from your store?

192
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,555
A black-and-white composition book.

193
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,148
Was Tim a kid you knew from 
the neighborhood?

194
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,194
He came into the store occasionally,

195
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,440
never had enough money.

196
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,755
I'd let him slide.

197
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,155
Felt sorry for him.

198
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,181
Why is that?

199
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,950
There were these black 
kids in the area.

200
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,444
I think they were picking on him.

201
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:20,805
They do that a lot?

202
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,310
They were always hanging 
around the corner, harassing people.

203
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:26,379
Mutts had the lazy gene, 
if you know what I mean.

204
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,589
You see Tim with them mutts that night?

205
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:29,600
You bet I did.

206
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,345
They ever bother you?

207
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:52,719
No, they knew better.

208
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,259
You know this guy?

209
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:56,758
Yeah.

210
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,643
Yeah, he was the ringleader of those kids.

211
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,014
- Laquanda or something.
- Latrell.

212
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:04,717
You didn't actually see him or any of 
his pals hurt the boy though, did you?

213
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,519
If I would have seen something,
I would have intervened.

214
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,030
I would have kick those...

215
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,609
African-American young 
gentlemen's asses.

216
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,615
The Barnes speak highly of you.

217
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:21,758
How are they doing?

218
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,625
Getting by, I guess.

219
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:27,024
That kind of wound doesn't heal.

220
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:28,581
I used to call them a lot.

221
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,520
I stopped when I didn't have 
anything new to tell them.

222
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,359
- You buying baby furniture?
- No, it's my daughter.

223
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,449
- She's pregnant.
- How far along?

224
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,617
A couple of months. 
I just found out.

225
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:43,269
Anything from Latrell's family?

226
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,733
Mother and sisters are 
sticking to their stories.

227
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:46,900
You think he could be dead?

228
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,840
I doubt it. Latrell 
was a survivor of sorts.

229
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,078
So is that the new direction?

230
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,602
Hearing your daughter's pregnant?

231
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,874
It got me thinking 
about this case, yeah,

232
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,347
and feeling guilty.

233
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,771
About what? / I was working the
Barnes job when my daughter was born.

234
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:08,670
Yeah, I missed her birth completely.

235
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:13,860
My wife, uh, wasn't pleased.

236
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:18,050
I lost my marriage over a case
I couldn't even solve.

237
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:21,108
Well, no wonder you 
don't want back on it.

238
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,813
The sad part is, I do, though.

239
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:26,432
I want this thing solved.
I want it put to rest.

240
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,056
I get it.

241
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,389
No, you don't,

242
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,101
but you will one day.

243
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,032
Hopefully before I did.

244
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:43,561
Murphy's a piece of work;
into genetics racial superiority.

245
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,317
He thinks Latrell's the doer?

246
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,240
ID'ed him off his picture 
in a second flat.

247
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,496
We got something.

248
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,702
Latrell's two sisters, Lisa and Leslie.

249
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:52,779
They got three kids apiece.

250
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,718
But according to Wilma Richmond, 
she has seven grandkids.

251
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,264
Yeah, so who's lucky number seven?

252
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,142
Thinking maybe he's Latrell's?

253
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:01,924
We're gonna find out.

254
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,492
We're on the street, boss.

255
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,833
Us, too.

256
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,399
- Going to the crime scene.
- Good.

257
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,372
Ain't too often we got the Assigned
available to go with us. / Uh-huh

258
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,856
Come on, boss.

259
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,895
Be a big help.

260
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:20,411
I'll get my coat.

261
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,226
Used to be a working 
class neighborhood...

262
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,225
half black, half white.

263
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,956
A lot of racial tension.

264
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,833
This is where Tim died.

265
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,752
Except he was lying in snow, not slush.

266
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,380
That coffee shop there 
was a five-and-dime

267
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,070
where Tim Barnes bought his notebook.

268
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,511
Where Murphy worked.

269
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,628
In this corner right here,

270
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:12,230
this is where Latrell and 
his pals were sniffing glue.

271
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,933
Even the church is getting a facelift.

272
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:20,371
The Barnes were Catholics, right?

273
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,945
Yeah, Tim was in the boys' choir.

274
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,688
- You talk to the priest?
- Yeah. Father Declan.

275
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:27,067
He was in the church that night,
but he didn't see or hear anything.

276
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:30,118
There wasn't a pedophilia scandal 
back in 1980, was there?

277
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,820
No. Just pedophilia.

278
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,075
Oh, what, the guy's a priest,
so automatically he's a pedophile?

279
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,766
No, but don't we gotta look at it?

280
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,923
Well, he was close to the family,
both the parents and the kids.

281
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,789
Diocese won't disclose the priest's 
whereabouts without a court order.

282
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:52,839
You got a relationship 
with ADA Kite, right?

283
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:54,805
What do you mean, a relationship?

284
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:56,684
I mean, maybe you can give him a call.

285
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:59,387
He could help us, uh, 
cut through the red tape.

286
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:02,717
Yeah, I... could call him.

287
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,432
Did a search of Latrell's 
mother's phone records.

288
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,487
Other than her daughters,
one other name comes up consistently.

289
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:09,810
It's Candace Smith.

290
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,824
Who's that? / 36-year-old nurse
with a 14-year-old boy.

291
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,336
Wilma Richmond had a picture
of her kid in her apartment.

292
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:19,397
- Looks to be about 14.
- The seventh grandkid?

293
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,062
Latrell's, maybe.
With Candace.

294
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,200
Wilma told you to talk to me?

295
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:27,821
We're here about her son, Latrell.

296
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,141
Latrell?

297
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:31,019
Well, that's a name I 
haven't heard in a long time.

298
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,541
Um...

299
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,110
this is a picture of him.

300
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,746
That there was Latrell.

301
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,638
A couple of names back, that is.

302
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:41,202
When I married him, he was 
going by Julius Smith.

303
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,389
Your boy sure looks like him.

304
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,586
Don't remind me.

305
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,027
You wouldn't happen to know
where Julius is, would you?

306
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,713
Michael,
wanna give us some privacy?

307
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,419
Like I never heard you 
badmouthing Julius before.

308
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,818
Go.

309
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:05,357
Julius Smith is a low-rent, 
two-timing,

310
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,159
piss-poor excuse of a man.

311
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,058
Kicked his worthless butt 
out the door six years ago.

312
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,425
He doesn't call,

313
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:13,586
- pay child support?
- Child support?

314
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,052
The day he left,
he cleaned me and Michael out.

315
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,957
Took his own son's GameBoy.

316
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,761
- He an addict?
- Addict, dealer.

317
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,862
Last I heard, he was hustling 
out of the Badlands.

318
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,832
But what did he do now?

319
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:25,420
You know what? Don't tell me.

320
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,849
I don't want to know.

321
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,689
You find Julius Latrell--

322
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,444
whatever the hell his name is,

323
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,866
tell him his son's a straight-A student.

324
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,938
He's grown up to be a real man,

325
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,638
not like his lying ass.

326
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,593
Yes, ma'am, we most definitely will.

327
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,418
I went to law school with Sherman Markey, 
one of the diocese's attorneys.

328
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,159
He spared us the rigmarole.

329
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,997
Your Father Declan's in a retirement home
for priests put out to pasture.

330
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,050
"Sacred Heart Retirement Home."

331
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,012
Thanks, Kite.

332
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:01,096
This priest, he a man-boy-love type?

333
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,876
I hope not,
but either way, I'll find out.

334
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,599
See ya.

335
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,077
See ya?

336
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:11,501
What do you want, a thank-you note?

337
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,525
We ever gonna talk about 
that night on the street?

338
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,070
Talk about that night...

339
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,600
Hmm. Maybe when this case is over.

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,174
But then you'll be on another case.

341
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,274
That's true.

342
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,700
I tell you what.

343
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,722
You're the workaholic.

344
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,220
Call me at home.

345
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,331
I don't care what time.

346
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,301
Okay.

347
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,150
Maybe.

348
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,047
Tonight wouldn't be too soon.

349
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,669
- Father Declan?
- Yeah?

350
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,319
Valens, Rush, homicide.

351
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,054
Mind putting it on pause for a minute?

352
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:03,652
What can I do for you?

353
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,362
You remember a boy named Tim Barnes?

354
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,522
Of course.

355
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,477
Tragedy.

356
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:11,375
He was in the boys' choir at your church.

357
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,556
And on your baseball team... 
when you were coaching.

358
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:16,815
Are you accusing me of 
something, Detective?

359
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:18,806
You were transferred three 
months after his murder.

360
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:20,424
At my request.

361
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,143
- I'm not a pedophile.
- So, why'd you decide to leave?

362
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:31,627
My white parishioners blamed the blacks.

363
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,938
I cautioned them against 
leaping to conclusions.

364
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,295
My position was not popular.

365
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,506
You don't think the black kids
on the corner did it?

366
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:40,779
It's not for me to say.

367
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:45,302
In the case file it says you went to
the Barnes house the day of the murder.

368
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:48,318
Yes, Greg Barnes
asked me to check on Nicole.

369
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,881
She was having a hard time coping.

370
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:55,728
Needed...
cheering up.

371
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,962
Tina!

372
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,386
I don't know, Father,

373
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,597
I-I have these dreams.

374
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:10,386
What kind of dreams?

375
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,935
Bad ones.

376
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,270
You're tired.

377
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:20,960
Tired doesn't cover the half of it.

378
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,867
It's just... three's too many.

379
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,922
Tina, don't do that again!

380
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,113
See what I mean?

381
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,690
- Mom!
- Not a moment's peace.

382
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,364
- Tim hit me.
- Did you hit your sister?

383
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,221
Did you hit her?

384
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,698
Yeah, did you hit your sister?

385
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,375
- She-she made me!
- No, buts, Timothy.

386
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,793
I've had it up to here!

387
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:42,306
What do I have to do? 
What do I have to do, huh?

388
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,541
- What do I have to do?
- Nicole, Nicole.

389
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,742
What?

390
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,715
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,816
Why didn't you ever tell 
that to Detective Stillman?

392
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,870
Nicole had suffered enough.

393
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:02,212
Last thing she needed was cops
breathing down her neck.

394
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,934
You ever see Nicole hit Timmy?

395
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:09,142
She was high-strung, emotional.

396
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,216
But did you ever see her hit the boy?

397
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,312
Did you talk to Nicole after Tim died?

398
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:18,376
Confession is a sacrament.

399
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,654
Protected by both church and state law.

400
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,312
How about her husband Greg?

401
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:26,266
- Did he come talk to you?
- I couldn't say.

402
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,561
Couldn't or wouldn't?

403
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,174
Someone confessed to the murder,
didn't they?

404
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:30,524
That's why you left the parish.

405
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:33,289
You couldn't stand knowing one of
your parishioners got away with it.

406
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,607
I wouldn't say, regardless.

407
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,970
Even if that person 
killed an 8-year-old boy?

408
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,480
Even if.

409
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,070
Father Declan knows something.

410
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,547
You think Tim's killer confessed to him?

411
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:53,137
We already know he was counseling 
Nicole Barnes.

412
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:57,357
And it turns out she was hospitalized
twice for attempted suicides since 1980.

413
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,740
Her son was murdered, Lil.
It'd drive any parent over the edge.

414
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,649
According to Declan, she was over 
the edge before Tim was killed.

415
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,105
You must have looked at her.

416
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,639
She said she never left 
the house that night.

417
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,295
Her husband and neighbors backed her up.

418
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:10,221
I got two words for you, 
boss; Andrea Yates.

419
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:13,915
From what Declan says, Nicole fits
the postpartum psychosis bill to a "T".

420
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,867
I'll give you this--in 1980,
that wasn't exactly on our radar.

421
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,199
I'm gonna talk her husband.

422
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,970
Don't go to her until you have to.

423
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,504
District cops and BD 
teams in the Badlands

424
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:25,821
know of a Julius Smith, aka
Latrell Richmond, in the area.

425
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:28,076
Gave us an idea
of what block he's hustling out of.

426
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,670
You show his picture around?

427
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,995
Door slams everywhere.

428
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,740
Well, we gotta flush Latrell out.

429
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,918
Time for "No drugs today"?

430
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:36,533
Oh, I think so.

431
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,186
What's that?

432
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,006
You'll see.

433
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:00,689
Ms. Town and Country

434
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,572
doesn't know the pharmacy's closed.

435
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,567
I'll give her the heads up.

436
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,331
No drugs today, ma'am.

437
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,030
You're like a Swiss watch, Greg--

438
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,494
on your route just where 
your boss said you'd be.

439
00:23:22,494 --> 00:23:23,794
What do you want?

440
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,537
To talk about the night of the murder.

441
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,404
I've already told you, 
once is all you get.

442
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:30,765
- Except you left out a couple of details.
- Like?

443
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:34,274
Like you asking Father Declan to look 
in on Nicole the day of the murder.

444
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,239
Leave Nicole out of it.

445
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,182
Are you still in contact 
with Father Declan?

446
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:41,789
We stopped going to 
church after Tim died.

447
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,683
You bring Tim out on the route sometimes?

448
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,248
How do you know that?

449
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,848
Picture on the mantle,

450
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,650
him wearing your postal service hat,

451
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:55,040
carrying your bag.

452
00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:00,450
He loved to come along...

453
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,076
carry the bag.

454
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,223
Yeah?

455
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,096
He was a great kid.

456
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,041
Were Tim and his mom close?

457
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,209
She loved him, same as I did.

458
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:15,911
I don't doubt that,

459
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,468
but sometimes people...

460
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,723
mothers...

461
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:24,783
they get so overwhelmed, 
they do things they regret.

462
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,235
Well, Nicole coped the best she could.

463
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,891
Then why are you afraid to tell me
what happened that night?

464
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:33,085
I don't know what happened.

465
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,103
It was chaos, as usual...

466
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,090
Tim.

467
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:38,267
Timmy.

468
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:41,795
Honey.

469
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:42,764
Nicole.

470
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:44,547
Nicole!

471
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:49,075
Where the hell have you been?

472
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:57,145
- It's freezing out there.
- I don't feel it.

473
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:59,627
- I don't feel a thing.
- What are you talking about?

474
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,515
Nothing.

475
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,581
Where's Tim?
I can't find him.

476
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,168
What do you mean, you can't find him?

477
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:08,331
Tim!

478
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:09,600
Tim?

479
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,522
- Timmy!
- I'm gonna go look outside.

480
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:13,547
Greg...

481
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:14,932
What?

482
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:18,001
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

483
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,461
Three's too many.

484
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,723
Stay here.

485
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,044
Did you ask Nicole 
what she was doing outside?

486
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:37,557
No.

487
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,148
And she never said.

488
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:42,187
24 years, you don't discuss it?

489
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:43,888
My wife is a good woman.

490
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,930
She raised the two other kids just right.

491
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:50,447
Now, if she did something awful to 
Timmy that night, it wasn't her.

492
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:51,683
Do you understand?

493
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:54,067
It wasn't her.

494
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,671
I'm going to need to talk to your wife.

495
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:01,635
Not without me, you're not.

496
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,718
This ain't your corner,
and this ain't the beach, fools.

497
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,958
Why you acting like it is?

498
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,362
We're just taking in the sights, 
ma'am, enjoying the city.

499
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:32,126
We gotta make a living same as you.

500
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,376
That's what we're counting on.

501
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,573
How long you gonna perpetuate
this injustice?

502
00:26:36,573 --> 00:26:38,455
However long as it takes
to locate who we're looking for.

503
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:41,433
Maybe I can be of some assistance.

504
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,704
Maybe then you can vamoose 
the hell off of my block.

505
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:46,569
We're looking for Julius Smith.

506
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:47,569
Julius?

507
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,322
- He ain't worth your time.
- Know where we can find him?

508
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:54,432
Can't rat out a brother, 
even if he is a punk-ass.

509
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,782
Suit yourself.
You got any mustard?

510
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,506
Mustard? Hell.

511
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,552
No-good, mustard-eating mother...

512
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:04,938
Now we're rolling.

513
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:09,039
Yeah, she'll get Julius' name 
all over the village, and quick.

514
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,941
It's my fault, Nicole.
I never should've opened my mouth.

515
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:17,555
No, it's okay, honey.

516
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:19,862
You're the one who's never 
wanted to talk about this.

517
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,331
I've come to terms with what I'd done.

518
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:24,506
What was that, Nicole?

519
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:26,720
I went outside...

520
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:45,368
# God only knows #

521
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:49,359
# God makes his plan #

522
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:53,380
# The information's unavailable #

523
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,763
# To the mortal man #

524
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:59,785
# We work our jobs #

525
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:03,855
# Collect our pay #

526
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,235
# Believe we're gliding down the highway #

527
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:11,804
# When in fact we're slip slidin' away #

528
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:15,694
# Slip slidin' away #

529
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,524
# Slip slidin' away #

530
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,549
# You know the nearer your destination #

531
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,772
I prayed with all my heart and soul.

532
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:31,137
For what?

533
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,597
For God to take away my burdens...

534
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,014
and He did.

535
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:39,728
He took away Timmy.

536
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:44,172
Didn't He?

537
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,937
Is that why you stopped 
going to church, Nicole?

538
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:57,992
'Cause you made that paryer?

539
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,147
It's why I tried to kill myself, too.

540
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,370
Why would anyone wanna live in a world

541
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,584
where God would answer your 
paryers by killing your son?

542
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,649
There she is.

543
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:17,683
Hey.

544
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:20,869
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't call me.

545
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:21,514
Um...

546
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:23,750
You know how it is.

547
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,695
Looks like I'm too 
late to buy you dinner.

548
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,362
- I talked to that priest.
- Guess it'll have to be drinks.

549
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:30,528
- What, now?
- Yeah.

550
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,932
You mind? / I didn't take you
for a fast-food type, Kite.

551
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:36,696
You got me all wrong, Rush.

552
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:41,047
Let me drop these warrants 
off at Fugitives, and, uh, we'll go.

553
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:46,712
You know what we need?
We need some marshmallows.

554
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:48,385
Marshmallows? Hell, 
we need a bigger fire.

555
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,899
I'm freezing my nuts off.

556
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:50,996
Check it out.

557
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,699
Yo, Detectives.

558
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,347
Yo, man?

559
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:01,524
- You're looking for Julius, right?
- That's right.

560
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,877
- Got a cell?
- Number's up top.

561
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,534
I'll see what I can do.

562
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:09,661
You do that.

563
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:14,823
Won't be long now.

564
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:17,748
Should I, uh, go into 
the high school years?

565
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,582
You like talking about 
yourself, don't you?

566
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:24,048
Well, someone has gotta 
talk about something.

567
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:26,877
- I talk plenty.
- About work. Nothing good.

568
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,558
What do you want, secrets?

569
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:30,143
Yeah.

570
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:36,101
Oh... you letting me in?

571
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,829
Come on, come on, 
show me where you live.

572
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:52,083
- You like cats?
- Sure. Yeah.

573
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:03,593
Nice place.

574
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:05,878
Thanks.

575
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,970
Oh, dear God.

576
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,407
I thought you liked cats.

577
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:13,562
Cats, not... mutants.

578
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,691
This is Olivia,

579
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,639
- Uh-huh.
- and this is...

580
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:24,827
Tripod.

581
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:28,312
And you were doing so well.

582
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,463
W-What are you doing?

583
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,817
I wanna see it down.

584
00:31:57,273 --> 00:31:59,665
Oh, I-I don't know about that.

585
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,580
Another time, okay?

586
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,550
Why not now?

587
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,656
Because you're...

588
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,272
because you're scaring the cats.

589
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,748
I think you got that 
reversed, but, uh, okay.

590
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:24,436
It's a start... at least.

591
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:27,614
To what?

592
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:33,709
The adventure.

593
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:41,357
See ya.

594
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:51,185
Got the call an hour ago.
Julius is inside, probably asleep.

595
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:52,377
I'm ready.

596
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,225
Police!

597
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,963
Everybody down!

598
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,923
All right, police! Everybody down!

599
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,626
Everybody down! Now! Down!

600
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,800
We're upstairs!

601
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,658
Hey, where you going? 
Come over here!

602
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:15,076
Come on, hands up!

603
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,026
Julius Smith. Where is he?

604
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,740
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

605
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:19,354
- What do you got here?
- What you doing, man?

606
00:33:19,354 --> 00:33:21,482
What's that, huh?

607
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:23,681
Julius Smith.
Where is he?

608
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:26,514
Come on, lady. Those are my rocks. 
Come on, please.

609
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,577
Julius Smith, where is he?

610
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,587
In the bag, over there.

611
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:38,863
Julius Smith.

612
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:40,401
Latrell?

613
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,697
Latrell?

614
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,365
We gotta bust a cap here,
see if he moves...

615
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,835
Show me your hands.
Let me see your hands!

616
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:57,629
Time's done a real number on you,
hasn't it, Latrell?

617
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:58,820
Latrell?

618
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,180
I don't know any Latrell.

619
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,527
Ah, man...

620
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,065
you're still around!

621
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:14,359
Where'd all your hair 
disappear to, Stillman?

622
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,811
Same place as your teeth, Latrell.

623
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,266
Give us a minute, guys.

624
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:33,266
Why'd you do it, Latrell?

625
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:34,847
Why'd you kill Tim Barnes?

626
00:34:37,753 --> 00:34:39,430
I didn't kill nobody.

627
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,421
I didn't believe you then, 
and I don't believe you now.

628
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,078
You ruined my life, 
you know that, Stillman?

629
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:46,486
The parents of that kid,

630
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,954
the brother and sister of that kid,

631
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,392
their lives were ruined.

632
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:52,314
This case took a toll on a lot of people.

633
00:34:52,314 --> 00:34:54,157
- 'Cept you.
- No.

634
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,028
Me, too, Latrell.

635
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,173
That boy's death really 
messed with your head,

636
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:02,004
- didn't it, Still-man?
- That boy's name was...

637
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,240
Tim Barnes.
Tim Barnes.

638
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,964
You don't think I know that?

639
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:11,093
You don't think that boy's 
death bothered me none?

640
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:16,108
Maybe there's a detail or two type
factoid I failed to mention way back when.

641
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:25,794
Come here, man.

642
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,793
Hey, you hear...?

643
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,540
I said come here.
Come, come here.

644
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:32,478
Where you think you goin', 
little man, huh?

645
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,815
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere?

646
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:36,447
The store. / Yeah, you're damn
right you're goin' to the store.

647
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,048
- You know why?
- Leave me alone.

648
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,337
You gonna buy us some glue,
you hear me, Potsie?

649
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:41,677
I only have a dollar.

650
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,703
Well, that's your problem, okay?

651
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:47,416
'Cause you go in that cracker's 
store and not bring us our glue,

652
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,643
you're gonna wish your 
little ass was never born.

653
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:50,692
You understand?

654
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,011
Good.

655
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,036
Hey, Potsie...

656
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,351
don't be bringing us none of 
that Elmer's glue, neither.

657
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,561
Model glue, you hear me?

658
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,493
Why the hell didn't you tell me that?

659
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:15,871
C'mon, Still-man.

660
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,231
Like I'm gonna tell the police

661
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:21,661
I threatened to whoop a white boy's ass
the same night that white boy gets dead?

662
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:25,376
If you didn't do it, 
and you haven't said

663
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:28,461
anything yet that tells me 
you didn't, then who did?

664
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:35,841
If you got any ideas, Latrell,
now is the time.

665
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:43,054
That night, when I was leaving my ma's.

666
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:47,534
I seen that cracker, Murphy, 
knockin' on the church door.

667
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:49,769
One of them priests come out of the, uh...

668
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:53,098
What do you call them places 
where the priests live?

669
00:36:53,098 --> 00:36:56,480
- Rectory.
- Right. Rectum-ry.

670
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,878
Dude was wearing some funcky-ass
Phillies pajamas.

671
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,688
- Did Murphy go back inside with him?
- No. It got me thinking.

672
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,429
"Why's Murphy in need of 
spiritual-type counseling?"

673
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:11,040
Think about it, Still-man.

674
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,885
Now, that cracker, Murphy, 
he got the-the opportunity

675
00:37:13,885 --> 00:37:15,920
and the motive to kill that boy.

676
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:21,062
Well, I'll give you opportunity,
Latrell, but motive?

677
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,697
I got it all figured out.

678
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:25,732
You kill a white boy, right?

679
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:27,861
Blame it on the black man!
What happens?

680
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:29,768
Cops come in, crime go down.

681
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:33,450
Crime go down, the real 
estate prices go up.

682
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:36,106
Now, I ask you --

683
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,547
who stood to benefit?

684
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,300
The man buying up all the 
real estate, am I right?

685
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,582
And who that?

686
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:47,257
Sean Crackerjack Murphy, that's who.

687
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:50,938
That is one hell of a theory, Latrell.

688
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,527
It ain't a theory.

689
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:55,843
That's a hypothesis, Stillman.

690
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,256
Well, now that we got motive 
all squared away...

691
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,893
- Crazy theory.
- Hypothesis.

692
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,793
But Murphy going to the 
priest is pretty interesting.

693
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:13,526
Yeah, in the middle of the night,
just hours after Tim Barnes died.

694
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:15,851
Someone confessed to Father Declan, Boss.

695
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,716
But why would Murphy kill that kid?

696
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,013
Ask Father Declan.

697
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,786
Oh, Declan hasn't broken his vow 
of silence in 24 years.

698
00:38:22,786 --> 00:38:24,706
He ain't gonna break it now.

699
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:27,472
Maybe he doesn't need to break it.

700
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:31,628
Maybe we just need to make 
Murphy think he's broken it.

701
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,655
I appreciate your coming down, Father.

702
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:37,398
And I apologize for giving you
a hard time the other day.

703
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,125
- Don't mention it.
- Oh, here.

704
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,717
So... tell me your idea.

705
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,350
Ah, what I was thinking was this...
a baseball league for cops.

706
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,886
The problem is, 
I don't know where to begin.

707
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:51,973
And you, you've got experience 
starting up a league, right?

708
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:56,089
- Oh, that was a long time ago.
- Well, I could really use some pointers.

709
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:57,890
Okay, gimme that paper here.

710
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:00,972
That Latrell.

711
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:04,595
Ha! Must have been smokin' way too
much crack, coming up with that theory.

712
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:05,488
I know

713
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:09,414
pretty far-fetched, except you did get 
rich off real estate, didn't you?

714
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,735
Where is he?
I-I can't wait to I.D. his worthless ass.

715
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,842
Where's the lineup? 
Where's Latrell?

716
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,576
We gotta have a conversation first.

717
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:23,294
All right.

718
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:27,278
You were the detective 
on that kid's case.

719
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:31,301
And you were the kind store owner
who let Tim slide

720
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:33,102
when he only had a dollar
for that notebook.

721
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,025
That's right.

722
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:41,836
Have a seat.

723
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:52,504
I never guessed it would be you
sitting in here.

724
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:54,037
We're exhuming Tim's body, Murph.

725
00:39:54,037 --> 00:39:58,417
In 1980 we didn't have DNA testing,
but it's a whole new ball game in 2004.

726
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:03,721
You don't mind, do you?

727
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:09,161
I came here to identify
that boy's killer,

728
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,482
Latrell Richmond.

729
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:11,838
When's that gonna happen?

730
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,275
Did you see Detective Valens 
out there, Murph,

731
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:17,338
taking down Father Declan's statement?

732
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,533
He shed a lot of light on this job.

733
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:22,221
Told us how you knocked on
the church door that night.

734
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:24,083
How he opened it in his pajamas,

735
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,297
let you in to confess to Tim's murder.

736
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,893
Well, a priest can't talk about 
what he hears in confession.

737
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,456
That's true.

738
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,114
Except Declan's retired.

739
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:39,164
And bitter.
No allegiance to the church anymore,

740
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,325
not after all the scandals.

741
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:47,219
You... you hate little kids, 
is that it, Murph?

742
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,017
I don't hate little kids.

743
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:50,729
Just black kids.

744
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:52,526
Tim Barnes was white, remember?

745
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:53,548
But he was a thief.

746
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:57,295
He stole glue from you 
for those black kids.

747
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,583
That's an ungrateful mutt for you.

748
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,821
He betrayed you, huh?

749
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,380
Not just me.
Us.

750
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:14,648
Guys who work an honest day 
for an honest wage.

751
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:15,667
White guys.

752
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,084
Thanks, mister.

753
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:55,311
Hey! Hey!

754
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,543
You little mutt!

755
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:04,660
- You think you can steal from me?
- They made me.

756
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,621
Don't lie to me, mutt.

# Just one single tear

770
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:37,426

771
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:43,054
# I see so very clearly now #

772
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:51,063
# All my fears are drifting 
by me so slowly now #

773
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:54,530
# Fading away #

774
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,406
# I can say #

775
00:43:58,406 --> 00:44:03,541
# The night is long but you are there #

776
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:11,420
# Close at hand I'm better for 
the smile you give #

777
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,019
